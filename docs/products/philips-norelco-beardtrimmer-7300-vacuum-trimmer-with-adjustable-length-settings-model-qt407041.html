            <li>/&gt;The build quality is something to be desired, but portability is excellent!</li>
            <li>My husband is very happy with this product</li>
            <li>This is a great device for all the family!  </li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>Since I still have that attachment, I tried it on the 4070 and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It trims his beard perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Also, I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the trimming comb attachments.</li>
            <li>For over $50 I would expect it to give a perfect, uniform trim.  </li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>- so don&#x27;t do what the ad says and throw away your scissors - you&#x27;ll need them for a perfect trims.</li>

            <li>trimming my stubble to get that 3-5 day no shave look and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the Lithium-ion battery on this trimmer (Great Upgrade for a trimmer!)</li>

            <li>Best Beard Trimmer on the Market</li>
            <li>Excellent trimmer</li>

            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer!</li>
            <li>But in use, it works excellent for beard trimming and the trimmer /w guard</li>
            <li>works excellent for trimming up &amp;#34;body hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>another one-thought it to be one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used/owned</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>could be your best friend, but for what I was looking for it was overkill on features, and underwhelming on delivering the 5 o&#x27;clock look.</li>

            <li>The convenience is excellent and it&#x27;s ergonomic and maneuverable in use.</li>
            <li>It was great!</li>
            <li>It is the best I have had over a period of 40 years of trimming</li>

            <li>Really impressed with this</li>
            <li>This trimmer is awesome!  </li>
            <li>The plastic roller for changing the height was flimsy at best.  </li>
            <li>The best part for me is that I don&#x27;t have to find and change combs all the time to trim up my beard.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product (</li>

            <li>Excellent replacement for a Wahl trimmer</li>
            <li>, this beard and mustache trimmer was the perfect choice</li>
            <li>I have a Philips Norelco 3D shaver that is excellent</li>
            <li>and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Not the best one I have ever had,</li>
            <li>It was awesome.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer!</li>
            <li>This trimmer does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li>Phillips has corrected the issues and created a great product!</li>
            <li>I bought this razor about 4 weeks ago and am impressed with the quality of its&#x27; manufacture.  </li>
            <li>I have used a number of trimmers over the pst four decades - this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent buy - couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Best ever!!</li>
            <li>product&#x27;s quality is awesome.</li>
            <li>Does the job it was made to do, excellent</li>
            <li>perfect trimmer for what do</li>
            <li>Awesome shaver.</li>
            <li>I got the best, fastest, neatest trim I&#x27;ve ever given myself in 20 years of having a beard.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, perfect!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still happy with it and the battery is holding up well!</li>
            <li>This is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer over a year ago and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great for manscaping too!</li>
            <li>I just got this and used it...and it works awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not the best of you have a curly beard, as the guard misses hairs.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ability to use both corded and cordless is also an excellent feature; my battery arrived drained, but plugging it in allowed immediate use.</li>
            <li>I use the rigid guide, and set the trimmer at 6mm, for a perfect beard.  </li>
            <li>thing I like best about this Phillips trimmers is its design and ergonomics.</li>
            <li>If they can address the issues I pointed out, it&#x27;ll be perfect.</li>
            <li>A SUPERB PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>Item is excellent!  </li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;This is a great addition to your trimmer.</li>
            <li>However, after just setting it to the length I hoped would be correct, I just pushed in through the hair to the skin and let it fly and that seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a great trimmer</li>
            <li>QT4070 is a great trimmer with an improved adjustment dial for beard height.  </li>

            <li>Does a great job trimming.  </li>
            <li>the turbo vac&lt;br /&gt;system is great.</li>
            <li>Works great for me.</li>
            <li>but that would make this $50 shaver great value.</li>
            <li>also it has a precision trimmer which is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything I had hoped for great beard trimmer</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, great price.</li>
            <li>Etc?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Wahl lithium Ion groomsman as well and it is great, except when I try to use it for scruff</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>

            <li>Amazing beard trimmer!</li>
            <li>For those two purposes it works amazing!</li>
            <li>The battery life is also absolutely remarkable, as I have not recharged it once yet.  </li>
            <li>Unsurprising, because surely you have a personality to match that marvelous appearance!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m good for another 10 years!!!  </li>
            <li>Great product and good price.</li>
            <li>In short, Norelco continues to improve on the design of its vac/trim system and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve owned from them - and they are among the best if not the best out there at this mid-level price</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is good and does a great job of trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>I think they were successful in creating a lower quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without</li>
            <li>I have always had Norelco products, but love this one the best !</li>
            <li>This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever tried, it shows how many mm you are trying to cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for measured trimming, But could do better at trimming without a measured length.  </li>
            <li>a great product and good seller</li>
            <li>and the best part is the way the length setting is able to be locked</li>
            <li>Good quality razor leaves a great finish and look.</li>
            <li>They are very happy with it and intend to use it for many years.</li>
            <li>Just as listed and timely sent , nice!</li>
            <li>but I am still having a good amount fly everywhere.</li>
            <li>i had it for a year or more and works , functions excellent.</li>
            <li>I have been a hair stylist for many years and am very impressed with this clipper.</li>
            <li>THAT IS NICE!</li>
            <li>but with just a bit more power it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>The readout is a wonderful idea... and would be much better if it worked correctly.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, provides great stubble look all the time.</li>
            <li>After trying many trimmers this one has been the best one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many trimmers, razors, and shavers and this one seems to be the best one out there.</li>
            <li>all family members say it is the best razor they have ever owned! :)</li>
            <li>though it was kind of bulky!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with its design and how well it works.</li>
            <li>I called Philips Customer Care (with whom I&#x27;ve always had a pleasant experience)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to those in the market for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>Easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Very light, battery life is very good.</li>
            <li>works great good good good good good good good good good</li>
            <li>Please note it does not increase in .5mm increments, which is fine because the 1mm setting is the perfect length for a groomed stubble look.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very good at that, on turbo it cuts better, and is faster than the Remington.</li>
            <li>, I know that philips makes the best shavers on the market, but to be honest, I haven&#x27;t found the QT4050 or QT4070 to be better then</li>
            <li>Sounds good.</li>
            <li>and it does a perfect and smooth job with trimming with sizes...</li>
            <li>This good for nothing.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>The result is as good as any trim I ever paid for...</li>
            <li>Couple that with good Lithium batteries and this trimmer is just about as close to perfection as you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer does a good job on the moustage and beard and keeps the clippings from clogging the drain.</li>
            <li>Prompt Delivery, Reciprocity,Restraint seller and Product received In Good Condition.</li>
            <li>Battery life seems to be good.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, works great for trimming and turbo mode is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>Good for beard trimming.</li>
            <li>Bought this as hopefully a good stubble trimmer, but even without the guard (which is the lowest setting)</li>
            <li>I don travel a good bit and this lets me know</li>
            <li>Got a good beard trim from this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t suck up all the hair, but it does a fairly good job of it.</li>
            <li>So yes, it looks good.</li>
            <li>(what else would it be good for?).</li>
            <li>(what else would it be good for?).</li>
            <li>If you need a good beard trimmer, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li>really good trimmer, doesnt snag.</li>
            <li>Both have beards and both loved it.  </li>
            <li>Works great as a beard trimmer for the length but not so effective to create the lines you need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because this is a good trimmer otherwise.</li>
            <li>:  Trims good.  </li>
            <li>Vacuums good.  </li>
            <li>There was actually a good three-week period in which I didn&#x27;t use it at all.  </li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Item arrived in good shape and in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I have been delighted with the product.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good trimmer</li>
            <li>It has a good range of hair length settings.   </li>
            <li>This is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good product but tricky to learn to use.  </li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product but not meant for longevity.</li>
            <li>He says that he likes this trimmer; it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>The adjustments are good, and it does a good job in trimming the beard.  </li>
            <li>It is not quite as good as that one and that s why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
            <li>The battery is good.  </li>
            <li>, it really is a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li>in-all when i find a good replacement, this thing is going</li>
            <li>in-all when i find a good replacement, this thing is going</li>
            <li>If all you need is a beard trimmer, avoid combo kits as they don&#x27;t have good auxiliary tools.</li>
            <li>To summarize, this is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>So being the fair minded man that I am, I gave it</li>
            <li>This is a good, well-made, trimmer.</li>
            <li>To get a good trim, I need to see where I am trimming while I am trimming.  </li>
            <li>think this trimmer is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>Good product guys.</li>
            <li>It appears to be fairly well constructed, time will tell about its durability.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>I jumped to this shaver as a replacement, but it doesn&#x27;t cut anywhere as good as the Remington did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good purchase and I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for a good amount of time before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li>It works, hair is sucked in, and my face looks good.  </li>
            <li>the 8-9mm settings are a good compromise between a beard and stubble to maintain for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It would have been good to know beforehand that this was the case</li>
            <li>It looks good.  </li>
            <li>Good trimmer that keeps a good charge.  </li>
            <li>good product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the battery, display, and vaccum system.</li>
            <li>It does a good</li>
            <li>battery life seems to be quite good.</li>
            <li>A good trimmer</li>
            <li>but it was a good one.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer, great idea, but</li>
            <li>Great for beard, body or even shaving your own head&lt;</li>
            <li>life is good..</li>
            <li>He looks good.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is just as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>think I made the best available choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lithium Ion battery - 1 hour charge - good battery life&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shopped for a good versatile trimmer that could leave the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look with precision.</li>
            <li>--it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Its a good trimmer, but not for close ups.&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
            <li>Battery seems to hold a charge for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>It is a good equipment, but is not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It does a good job just like my Phillips Norelco shavers have always done.</li>
            <li>Battery life has been good also</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall good product if it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; up 100% of clippings but a good 90-95% (you&#x27;d need a shop-vac attached for the rest)</li>
            <li>It was a Christmas gift that was requested specifically because of its good qualities and reliability.  </li>
            <li>Does not do a good job of keeping the whiskers vacuumed.</li>
            <li>Good razor though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good on making edges and trimming place like under the nose.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good trimmer to maintain your scruff, go with this one.</li>
            <li>i have been using this item and so good, if you want to cut you hear this item is so good</li>
            <li>Its good.</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t the perfect fit for our needs.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good and it can run on AC as well if plugged in.</li>
            <li>Battery life good.</li>
            <li>He loves it and mine is still good except mine</li>
            <li>Good trimmer for that &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; / &amp;#34;Lost&amp;#34</li>
            <li>A good storage/travel&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the best beard trimmer currently available for a number of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but none of them did as good a job as this.  </li>
            <li>and i loved it .</li>
            <li>Excellent, does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>so I looked for a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good tool</li>
            <li>loved it, until it died.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Norelco used to be really good.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We&#x27;ll start with the good.  </li>
            <li>Now all that has to happen it it gets here in good shape</li>
            <li>It recharges fairly</li>
            <li>He loved it.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>but i found that it didn&#x27;t catch all the hairs and was fairly noisy.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, precise control</li>
            <li>I have a beard that I keep fairly trim.</li>
            <li>As good as advertised.</li>
            <li>Its good quality for beard length control, and shaping.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>seller sent the item in good time as well.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>Its good compare to all,but it some times cutt the skin without clip</li>
            <li>Good price too</li>
            <li>But it does a good job and the lighter weight is a plus.</li>
            <li>Philips ownership seems to be good for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ended up going with the Conaire iStubble and loved it.</li>
            <li>---it&#x27;s a good idea.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>The battery life has been really good, too.</li>
            <li>Was a good trimmer for a couple of years and then stopped working a month after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>Really good trimmer.</li>
            <li>But not so good for getting a close shave.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the fact that it catches a lot of the hair (not all, but hey nothing is perfect).</li>
            <li>A good buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for the trimming that I want.</li>
            <li>The vaccume  on it works good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>great for the man who does his own beard.</li>
            <li>My wife commented that my beard never looked so good.</li>
            <li>good product based on paid value..</li>
            <li>I use guard setting 3, which is fairly short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good trimmer.</li>
            <li>The travel lock is good.</li>
            <li>and he loved it.  </li>
            <li>For the money it was a good product.</li>
            <li>this is so good</li>
            <li>Its good, and the vaccum is a good function.</li>
            <li>Will recommend for any person who is looking for good grooming device.</li>
            <li>All the things that I loved about the T980 were still there in the QT unit.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>and it just didn&#x27;t do a good job of sucking up the hair...</li>
            <li>Good trimmer</li>
            <li>i get the item its a vary good shaver .</li>
            <li>and it has a good weight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for trips once you know which attachment of the two</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re good</li>
            <li>good news:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it, works so good &amp; it work wile charging.</li>
            <li>Received in good order.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good.</li>
            <li>But for what it is designed to do I think it is really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, the good bits.</li>
            <li>the not so good.</li>
            <li>The battery life is not as good as my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>FUNCTION GOOD</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned my norelco beard trimmer for almost 14 years and loved it.</li>
            <li>Loved this.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at catching a good amount of shaved whiskers in</li>
            <li>and I am struggling to find the best angle to obtain a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I was initially very pleased with this trimmer and it still does a good job with the trimming.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how it would work on a full beard but for stubble it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the sink nice and tidy and he says that it makes shaving a breeze!</li>
            <li>Not bad - but not the best.</li>
            <li>The QT4070/41 beard trimmer is very nice, I like the flexible head attachment and that the length adjustment is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>this is a ultimate buy best i ever done do not miss out best stubble cutter ever</li>
            <li>It trims my beard perfectly and charges up quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer, and once you call and get the superior contour comb guard(I have posted images in the product image gallery of the differences between the 2), you&#x27;ll have a truly great product.</li>
            <li>an exceptional amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly and I am very happy with the Qt4070</li>
            <li>The learning curve was quick and the results were excellent.  </li>
            <li>,  I too have found the effects of this razor very nice, and it&#x27;s easy to use!</li>
            <li>I can still say it works great, but the plastic was indeed very cheap.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very good and advanced...</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>, i was very pleased.</li>
            <li>when the time comes to cut it off, i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll be using this great shaver to do that job too.</li>
            <li>Glad we found it here on Amazon at a great price.,</li>
            <li>I have used this model beard &amp; stubble trimmer for years and been very satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li>: The design is very handsome.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it plugged in as well as on battery is a great bonus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy, satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with this one also.</li>
            <li>I love this razor for shaving my beard flip it on turbo and it cleaned up just about everything some hairs fly</li>
            <li>but it still works great better than having hair everywhere</li>
            <li>Delivery was prompt and efficient and the product lived up to all its claims, very pleased</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for about a month now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>My husband was very pleased with my gift to him of the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Great product with many features.</li>
            <li>Works great with outstanding battery life.</li>
            <li>and I would be more than happy to pay for it...</li>
            <li>Very satisfied</li>
            <li>by Philips Norelco and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the way it worked</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the design and the trimming of the QT4070.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product, from a wife&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer with many adjustments.</li>
            <li>My husband is very pleased with his trimmer.</li>
            <li>Rated this five stars as I am very pleased with the trimmer and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I would be more than happy to pay for it...</li>
            <li>The many settings for hair length work great as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and have been very impressed... worth every penny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that you will be happy with this product should you choose to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Great machine and gives you better control over the trim level.</li>
            <li>but I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>A ton of settings to trim those fly aways and just make his beard look more clean/put together.</li>
            <li>But, it breaks every 3 months even with very light use!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great none better take from a guy who has had a beard for 45 years</li>
            <li>I love the trimmer itself, it is really great.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Got this based on the reviews and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>it seems well made, nice controls and a good battery.</li>
            <li>but this one does a fare superior job of keeping my whiskers nicely trimmed.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer, nice adjustable settings.  </li>
            <li>If you want stubble or a nice beard trimmer this is a good buy</li>
            <li>One is the stabby kind like people mentioned, but it does a good job getting closer.</li>
            <li>The shave is perfectly even at any set length and this thing is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The ability to adjust length right on the trimmer, without all the attachments, is awesome.</li>
            <li>And it has so many lenth settings, its really a great device to own.</li>
            <li>I would say it is the best available, but it could be better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I think this device has the best combination of attributes available, now I just have to be a better user of the tool.</li>
            <li>fortunately for me, it fits perfectly in my Braunpouch :)</li>
            <li>fortunately for me, it fits perfectly in my Braun pouch :)</li>
            <li>the cut is exceptional, the battery life is good, the trimmer does its job exceptionally well, I just wish they had designed the door on the whisker compartment better.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this beard trimmer!</li>
            <li>Lot&#x27;s better!  </li>
            <li>i love Amazon reviews!  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li>but when you are charging it use a timer to make sure you don&#x27;t over charge it!</li>
            <li>and they said I would be okay to return the shaver in 3 days - the 46th day after buying the shaver!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you dump out the hair before transporting it as movement will cause the hair to fall out everywhere from the trimmer!</li>
            <li>Shaver was excellent exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>think more of a 48-hour shadow!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with how well the vaccum works.</li>
            <li>The first, and best trimmer I ever owned was a Panasonic which they ended up discontinuing -  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I can use it many times before charging it again!</li>
            <li>This product allows him the stubble he desires and allows me to still see his handsome face!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Amazon refunded my money and let me keep the trimmer, which is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I have never seen it look better!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love some recommendations to try as an alternative to this!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I got it!</li>
            <li>You just cant expect the best result from the first try.</li>
            <li>I have always used Wahl trimmers for my goatee, this the first Norelco trimmer I have ever owned, and the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned....</li>
            <li>love it !</li>
            <li>This is an excellent beard trimmer which works exactly as described but may have a design flaw.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li>I have never used better beard trimmer in my life!</li>
            <li>Love the turbo mode!</li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise, the new timmer worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I liked my $20 Whal much better. :P</li>
            <li>I used to love it when I grew out my goatee, but for a full on beard its not the greatest.  </li>
            <li>Great shape and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>He said it works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>i bought this product as a christmas gift to my husband and he loves it easy to use and its great to use on his beard.</li>
            <li>It is easy to adjust the lengths, and it does a great job of trimming.</li>
            <li>Works great and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li>This is my first trimming tool, the vaccume is great at greatly reducing the amount of hair that drops out.</li>
            <li>I just used my QT4070 for the first time, and I was kind of impressed.</li>
            <li>My husband has full beard and mustache and loved it!</li>
            <li>Great fine adjustments for any length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That seemed fine to me, because besides that, it sounds like a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice looking and easy to use trimmer.</li>
            <li>Amazing, if you have a beard you need one.</li>
            <li>For me, I find using themachine with the hair grain as oppose to against the hair grain works amazing.</li>
            <li>The rest of the performance is amazing</li>
            <li>Phillips now ships the QT with the correct crumb and it really is an amazing trimmer.</li>
            <li>The electronic readout to accurately set the millimeter hight for the shave ...  was great ...  until it broke.  </li>
            <li>This light trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li>The difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>The clippers make me look amazing.</li>
            <li>but it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>thing has the precision, can handle a stubble beard, cuts amazingly well</li>
            <li>The battery on this thing is freakin amazing, I never do reviews but had to submit a review just because of the battery.</li>
            <li>This kit works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>and after i did it worked amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing when you think about it.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing device.  </li>
            <li>Amazing beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>The battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>Think of it more like a good ride-on mower as opposed to a lawn edger.</li>
            <li>Nice to have it around if i need it....</li>
            <li>This trimmer is powerful, has great battery life and a good length selector.</li>
            <li>I received the QT4070 today with a nice mantle of scruff today.  </li>
            <li>it is nice.</li>
            <li>More competition would lead to greater innovation, but the Phillips-Norelco turbo vac trimmer does a great job for now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice trimmer..</li>
            <li>it cleans its own hairs up through vacume built in brill</li>
            <li>It gathers about 60% of it, which is still nice.</li>
            <li>This razor is the perfect indulgence for the man who wants a quick-charging mustache/beard/stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, feels good, cuts good.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if there were some way of integrating it into the trimmer; but there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I can see Turbo mode being a handy feature for the hairier mammals of our species, however.     </li>
            <li>The LCD display shows battery level, as well as trim length setting, and there are length index marks along the side of the trimmer as well, a nice feature if the LCD ever goes on the fritz.     </li>
            <li>and I have been able to keep my beard looking good.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband who grew a beard for a Christmas production and he discovered he liked the beard.  </li>
            <li>Nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>In addition, the hair catching system doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li>I own three of these one set for hair &amp; one for my beard.</li>
            <li>The turbo boost in this model is nice, and I use it on occasion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all-around Great!!!  </li>
            <li>The travel lock is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>Until a month ago, about 5 months after I bought it, it would spontaneously turn on by itself.  </li>
            <li>--I kept that guide nice and level like a couple of reviewers</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good beard trimmer but make sure you keep that charger with you.</li>
            <li>honestly have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>Fits my hand nicely.</li>
            <li>The adjustable settings are nice as well 1-18mm I believe.</li>
            <li>It seemed like the best no-fuss solution, without the vibration of the Wahl and yet more powerful than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok because it is still fairly close.</li>
            <li>It trims nicely and without pain or pulling.    </li>
            <li>nice led display too.</li>
            <li>Trims evenly and nicely.  </li>
            <li>I LIKED IT</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no charger stand or wall mounting unit, and it doesn&#x27;t stand on its own.</li>
            <li>The shave is excellent, and Norelco sends two styles of head which is really helpful.</li>
            <li>Ok, so this is a good quality trimmer...</li>
            <li>It does a good job of collecting most of the hair that you trim.</li>
            <li>I also own the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This kind of misleading marketing annoys me.  </li>
            <li>and it comes out looking nice.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have a carrying case or pouch to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>NICE IDEA</li>
            <li>Its nice and</li>
            <li>The suction of hair is nice</li>
            <li>I like to cut my own hair and beard.</li>
            <li>A mustache trimmer would have been nice, but I can&#x27;t dock for something I knew it didn&#x27;t have and bought anyway.</li>
            <li>My T980 is still good, but the cutter unit won&#x27;t click into place any more, as the flimsy design causes a break at the housing.</li>
            <li>But now, I think I will just research on my own.</li>
            <li>Has a turbo mode which I haven&#x27;t even needed to use yet, but nice knowing it has it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of soothing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being able to use it while plugged in is good.</li>
            <li>I hope I won&#x27;t need it, but it&#x27;s nice to have it.</li>
            <li>length adjustment is nice and seems to work quite well.</li>
            <li>This fits nicely into my compact / travel shaving kit, so I like it just how it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice even trim and</li>
            <li>I have owned a lot of norelco beard trimmers and this one is as good or better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found incredibly nice</li>
            <li>It will also leave you that nice stubbly 5-oclock shawdow look if thats the look you want.</li>
            <li>I own the norelco everything</li>
            <li>trimmer feels nice in the hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller send the item in a nice packed way.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>overall though, the greatest trimmer in the world lasted me over 7 years, if this one gives me 5....ill be happy.</li>
            <li>It has a great feel in your hand and the digital readout is awesome.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice settings.</li>
            <li>I am loving it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice touch and makes cleanup easier.</li>
            <li>The charger/power cord is nice and small/light, not bulky at all</li>
            <li>Charge indicator is nice as is the travel (power) lock although I haven&#x27;t needed it yet.</li>
            <li>Every man should own one of these</li>
            <li>It would also be nice if the product had a stand.  </li>
            <li>so it will not roll of a cradle would be nice.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t pickup everything, but you can&#x27;t honestly expect that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice having the trimmer altogether in one piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice, lightweight shaver for light-duty trims.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>My dad also liked it.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very well made and does an excellent job keeping my beard well groomed.</li>
            <li>Design is nice looking.</li>
            <li>This thing really makes everything best and even.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a detailer, you may want to purchase a cheaper one to complement the nice trims of this product.</li>
            <li>I have treated this thing so nicely.</li>
            <li>it worked, I liked the thing alright.  </li>
            <li>He likes to keep a nice beard.  </li>
            <li>liked it</li>
            <li>And no, I don&#x27;t work for or own stock in the company.</li>
            <li>This was a really nice upgrade from my 8-year-old trimmer.</li>
            <li>doesnt trim as close as i would have liked, and seems to leave longer straglers.</li>
            <li>Loving this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Talk about nice.</li>
            <li>Turbo button is nice to have as well.</li>
            <li>Efficient, effective, no nonsense trimmer.</li>
            <li>I really liked that trimmer though and it served me well for years, so this was the replacement of choice.    </li>
            <li>Nice Job to the Phillips/Norelco engineers</li>
            <li>so so - doesn&#x27;t really vaccum well.&lt;br /&gt;Probably perfect for just sideburns and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Otherwise quite nice</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the number handy</li>
            <li>Nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li>This is the best and really does pick up 90 percent of the beard hair.</li>
            <li>I just bought the stainless steel Wahl and an very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The turbo mode is a nice feature</li>
            <li>very happy with this trimmer works very well</li>
            <li>A nice trimmer</li>
            <li>and this is a really nice upgrade.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job on my beard and mustaches.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer for what I need to do</li>
            <li>so I find that perfect area instead of being too much or too little.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I found not as effective in reaching &amp; trimming these &#x27;nook &amp; cranny&#x27; type areas of my face.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Durable and flexible; nice that you can charge it or use it plugged in.</li>
            <li>Will not take any kind of charge and cannot even use while plugged in.</li>
            <li>The power boost button is nice.  </li>
            <li>The flex head is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>THis product is great as it has the dual trimmers as opposed to the combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head is a great part of the shaver as it makes trimming some areas much easier.  </li>
            <li>not as close a shave as i would have liked.</li>
            <li>It gives him a nice even trim.</li>
            <li>I was using a Phillips Norelco beard trimmer, and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think they could have done better improving what I think is a good product</li>
            <li>Not as good as the model it replaced but better than anything else on the market...</li>
            <li>This works just as the model before it, which I own as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would have been nice if it came with a carrying case.</li>
            <li>Somewhat inconsistent cuttingâ€”I find beard hairs not cut and just kind of bent.</li>
            <li>For those of you that keep a beard, it&#x27;ll be nice to have.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t see the issue.</li>
            <li>Could be better; A good tool to have</li>
            <li>the motor must have busted) and I liked how it vacuumed up stray hair</li>
            <li>But it has done a nice job on keeping my beard nice and trimmed.  </li>
            <li>system is nice</li>
            <li>The beard guard works effectively on non-mustache areas of the face.</li>
            <li>and I get a nice even shave</li>
            <li>It does a nice job trimming</li>
            <li>Really nice to have the trimmings door latch working again...</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t remove the battery so it is a fire hazard as it will become warm after being on for a period of time.</li>
            <li>Nice Norelco</li>
            <li>The vacuum works great, and creates the perfect 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, which every man should have.</li>
            <li>works great,  lost a star for  the vacuum which is anything but perfect.  </li>
            <li>I own the older T980 which was excellent.  </li>
            <li>The contour comb is perfect for my beard while the stubble comb is fantastic for keeping sideburns and up around my ears clean in between haircuts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek, light, great hand-feel, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco does a great job with minimum hassle in addition to keeping all the hair in the unit and not all over the sink - well worth the money!</li>
            <li>but still well worth the buy!!!</li>
            <li>I love this razor, it gives an excellent consistent shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li>My wife hates hairs on the sink and I am not always great about getting it clean.  </li>
            <li>Here are all the features he likes: comfortable to hold; cleans easily; collects hair so it doesn&#x27;t go all over the sink; good battery life; attractive design;</li>
            <li>Love the way it cleanly addresses my good looking beard!</li>
            <li>this is the best machine i ever used, fast, not noisy, light, the vaccum is useful (not the best but good)&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY happy with this product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Pulls hair on normal speed, works perfectly on turbo (no pulled hairs).</li>
            <li>First things first, great shaver, maybe the best WHEN you have all the parts.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li>This is a VERY nice product, i was looking for a compatible replacement that will help me clean up after i shave with the my edger.</li>
            <li>The dial for length works great and the vacuum to suck up most of what you&#x27;re shaving off works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought this, said to be very good and easy to clean</li>
            <li>I think if you can adapt your trimming stroke to the new guide you will be very happy with this trimmer...</li>
            <li>It is new trimmer from Philips which is perfect for stubble lovers.</li>
            <li>Which in my book is a excellent new innovation and a must have on a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did an exchange though Amazon and the new one has worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The beard trimmer is very good and the vacuum works great.</li>
            <li>I was worried that it may make even more sound than the razor, but its great and seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its smooth, good battery life, nice adjustments</li>
            <li>So this is a great product for guys who can, and do, proudly count themselves as part of the old fashioned bearded society.</li>
            <li>This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve own so far.  </li>
            <li>Great product with quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The turbo option does a good job of capturing the hair and more so, lifting hair a bit to do a better and faster job of trimming.</li>
            <li>trim evenly, easy to use, and the price is fair.</li>
            <li>good shave and a strong battery life.  </li>
            <li>However, it was easily returned, customer service is good.</li>
            <li>Good function and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, doe s great job trimming my beard, it charges quickly and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good trimmer, the vacuum feature is superb.</li>
            <li>This trimmer cuts evenly and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to change the length setting.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t have this charging issue (which is very easy to fix)</li>
            <li>Very easy to adjust beard lenght without damaging plastic changable head.</li>
            <li>The latch is a flimsy piece of plastic that breaks very easily.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and seems to be well-built</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The didital display is very easy to read.</li>
            <li>adjustments are VERY easy, and quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li>this is the best designed, best working beard trimmer--especially if you are interested in the stubble settings; this one has 18 length settings, and the very short ones work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one has been pretty good!  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions state that you should use a moustache comb (or any fine-toothed comb) in preparation before using the trimmer, very good advice which I certainly always follow.  </li>
            <li>I find it effective and very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Took me a while to realize that you could disassemble it to clean it out. :P</li>
            <li>Very nice and quick.</li>
            <li>Very good product @ reasonable price</li>
            <li>Very good, but require cleaning very often.</li>
            <li>The contour comb was included and so far, impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is by far the best beard trimmer I have ever seen...great for goatee too...</li>
            <li>and they were totally nice and able to take care of it for me.    </li>
            <li>There are many nice features - from it</li>
            <li>This moustage and beard trimmer is so far the best one I ever had.</li>
            <li>This is good for trimming lightly to keep that groomed look.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Since the comb doesn&#x27;t wrap completely around the blade, you have to hold the trimmer perfectly level to get an even cut.</li>
            <li>so it serves mostly as looking nice than functional for me.  </li>
            <li>There is a free 3 year extended warranty in the box so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the Best electric shaver I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the kind of precision cut that I was expecting in regards to having so many adjustable settings.</li>
            <li>So far I am  very happy with this.</li>
            <li>and I liked that one better.</li>
            <li>By far the best trimmer out there.  </li>
            <li>their predecessor the T980, that was by far the best philips shaver</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I have gotten so far.</li>
            <li>So far so great!</li>
            <li>The best beard trimmer by far.</li>
            <li>However, I honestly found the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; trimmers to be better.</li>
            <li>, so far this has been the BEST Norelco electric razor that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far from perfect.</li>
            <li>It seemed as though I had to do more work than I bargained for to get a nice even shave.</li>
            <li>sure I&#x27;ve not used it, but it&#x27;s nice to know</li>
            <li>It was a great purchase and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful a suction as what Wayne experienced, but unlike what Garth would rate it, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It has great battery life and a powerful motor</li>
            <li>I have used both the hinged and fixed comb-heads and find both work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t keep the trimmer at a perfect angle to your beard, it&#x27;s not hard at all to lop off a lot more than you intended.  </li>
            <li>Product works great and the vacuum part surprisingly works really good.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the beard trimmer and the vacuum feature is great!  </li>
            <li>It is indeed a good machine: effective, efficient and quick.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy the ability to adjust easily and that function still works great.  </li>
            <li>It trims my beard very well and its easy to dial in the perfect length.</li>
            <li>Excellent trims with no mess.</li>
            <li>It works great and was priced right.</li>
            <li>After using it for 6 weeks I can happily say it was the right choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and you don&#x27;t have to search for guards!  </li>
            <li>Some very fine hairs do fall through..</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have very fine, downy whiskers (who does?)</li>
            <li>This means that someone can easily compress the comb, resulting in a trim SHORTER than that set on the unit!  </li>
            <li>Gives him the perfect stubble look, and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess, so we&#x27;re both happy.</li>
            <li>Works great, easily adjustable, and it is very easy to clean up</li>
            <li>Great battery life, easy clean up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a win win situation, try it and if you like it keep it if not send it back.  </li>
            <li>I have had many trimmers and this is by far the best one I have used.</li>
            <li>The best part, is that I was able to use the precision trimming blade from my old Norelco trimmer that died.</li>
            <li>However, it falls short of being a wonderful replacement for my cheapo Remington target pickup of yesteryear (whose own battery has been failing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I would suggest anyone that likes a good clean trim to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard looking fresh, powerful motor and totally awesome</li>
            <li>my result is I love the product, but it dies out very easily</li>
            <li>This trimmer is awesome but has one major flaw...</li>
            <li>feature I bought it for -- the vacuum -- didn&#x27;t meet expectations, but I was so impressed with the trimmer itself that I still think it&#x27;s deserving of 4 stars.</li>
            <li>very good, better than older models</li>
            <li>While its functionality is excellent, it gets in the way of the blades if you want to use just the bare blades.</li>
            <li>At first glance, this shaver seems great.  </li>
            <li>And my first trim was great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I will probably upgrade to a 5 star review if the battery doesn&#x27;t die on me in the first year.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s first beard trimmer/shaver so we don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it works great with no issues.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 years ago for $15 with pretty great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>The trimmer worked great for first 3 months.</li>
            <li>This product was great for the first 8 months or so that I had it.</li>
            <li>A good trimmer should feel sleek and cool, IMHO.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;the design is very great (easy to handle and light).&lt;br /&gt;But between this and the new generation philips 5100</li>
            <li>It does a great job keeping the sink clean and provides a precise trim.</li>
            <li>I already own some older Norelco trimmers and they work great.</li>
            <li>the right one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable comb is very accurate at determining the length of the final cut and you can trim without great caution as it adjusts and tracks perfectly.</li>
            <li>It has several depth settings for the best trim and is very easy to change those as well.</li>
            <li>The spring actuated guide is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The tines on the face guard are very cheap</li>
            <li>the Norelco turbo is a very light, easy-to-use trimmer that does its job</li>
            <li>Very comfortable trim.</li>
            <li>Broke within six months of very light use.</li>
            <li>Very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I have a very light goatee which was probably</li>
            <li>has very smooth operation.</li>
            <li>The unit feels very cheap.</li>
            <li>Also like the adjustment for length, it is very precise.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet so holds charge and stream line shape is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable shaver</li>
            <li>But yes I&#x27;d say this was a very fantastic buy</li>
            <li>A pretty good presentation of it&#x60;s qualities brought me to buy it and the great expectations I had vanished just by the very first use.</li>
            <li>nice product, easy to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it holds a good charge and does an adequate job on the face.  </li>
            <li>Opens easily to dump shavings.&lt;br /&gt;Adjusts lengths easily, nice display shows length of cut.  </li>
            <li>Of course, having a shaver head makes it easy to get nice</li>
            <li>The reason i&#x27;m so positive on this uint, however, is that it DOES A GREAT JOB at sucking up the hair from my beard.  </li>
            <li>Great product and all of the positive reviews are well deserved.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, no stabbing, and works great around the body.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean!</li>
            <li>When you just want to trim you beard to 2mm or more, it works fine!</li>
            <li>Luckily, the trimmer does a very good jobontinuing to make the right comb.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to adjust the guard, the power is great, the vacuum is great, and I look like Ryan Gosling now.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer WAS very good, but it completely stopped working after 9 months.</li>
            <li>My experience has been very good so far.</li>
            <li>Works very well for those who wanna maintain a uniform stubble!&lt;br /&gt;Battery life&#x27;s great, easy to clean, and what not!!</li>
            <li>okay option for a 5 oclock shadow shaver.</li>
            <li>This saves me from losing the 15 heads that most razors come with.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>The one that was on the trimmer in the box is the one most people are complaining about.</li>
            <li>If Norelco is able to replace it with one that works as advertised, I will update this review  with a more favorable rating.</li>
            <li>I am about to spend more money on probably some clippers and use them on my beard.  </li>
            <li>i just don&#x27;t want anyone else spending $50 or more just to have your face with bumps and infection.</li>
            <li>okay, I don&#x27;t want to buy another though.</li>
            <li>On lowest setting it still does not remove all hair (yes I know it&#x27;s a trimmer and no shaver, but there are many cheaper trimmers out there which do a better job).</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I think they have top notch products.</li>
            <li>There are better and cheaper units out there, that will trim your stubble without slicing up your face.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t hold this trimmer at a perfect angle on you face, expect some very short patches in your beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a goatee man and was looking for something to keep it trim while also being able to pull off that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look by putting a close trim across the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>Trimmer makes me more handsomer.</li>
            <li>works very well  GREAT BUY</li>
            <li>Okay trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li>The build quality is very solid- to the point of impressive.  </li>
            <li>The shorter the hair, the better the job.  </li>
            <li>And I haven´t had to charge it yet, so that side is ok.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Works good, could be more powerful</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it tells you what length your going to cut at on the LED display.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and the battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li>Been using this item for many years and want to continue to</li>
            <li>All I can say is that the Wahl is now being gifted to someone.     </li>
            <li>Also, many reviewers before me seem to be selective readers.    </li>
            <li>It grows in many directions.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this yet, and once I have more information about it</li>
            <li>When mine breaks, I&#x27;ll buy another one. :-)</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that I use it to trim my beard ( I got with a 2 mm for sexy stubble)</li>
            <li>I think for the price, you wont find a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>This newer model is much better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it on a beard yet because I keep my facial hair shorter these days, but it gives a perfect length of stubble on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two already and will buy more when X-mas rolls around.</li>
            <li>The larger display is very welcome.</li>
            <li>I actually do love it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re MUCH better off buying a pair of clippers like a barber uses.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it works when plugged in</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product!</li>
            <li>it was much better made.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I did buy this.  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this shaver because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More cleaning work.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>(A feature I love.)  </li>
            <li>It is the most civil way to create that crafted stubble look without shaving in advance.</li>
            <li>With the guard on it was ok at trimming the rest of my beard.</li>
            <li>They mostly work</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line is this one works even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grab this dam trimmer because ITS FROM Philips and its top of the range</li>
            <li>but most people do not have that option.</li>
            <li>I would rate this as the best on the market most definitely.</li>
            <li>I sure it&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and hit it on something.  </li>
            <li>My research showed this to be a top model.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I love Philips Sonicare oral care products.</li>
            <li>Great product and vacuums very well.  </li>
            <li>When I update, I&#x27;ll be sure and list the phone number to call</li>
            <li>It looks more like a head shaving E-razor than a face shaver.</li>
            <li>I plugged in the trimmer and was immediately able to use it with the AC adapter.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love that there is a hair collector chamber in this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than nothing though&lt;</li>
            <li>I read most of the differing reviews before making my choice.</li>
            <li>- sometimes the cheaper option is the better option.</li>
            <li>I love the travel lock feature so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get turned on and drain the battery during flight.</li>
            <li>I tried my best to get adjusted but have just called norelco to exercise the 45 day money back offer.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, the combs for the 4050 and the 4070 are _interchangeable_, and with a phone call to Philips, I was able to get them to provide the 4050&#x27;s comb--model number</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>But wait there&#x27;s more.</li>
            <li>Great quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent buy.</li>
            <li>In this case you might be better off with a non-vaccuum model.</li>
            <li>I havent been able to find replacement blades for this, but</li>
            <li>I started using this to keep a low stubble and its not the greatest for that.  </li>
            <li>I challenge you to find a better one, and let me know if you do find one.</li>
            <li>It does everything it says it will and better...</li>
            <li>But the battery, even on TURBO mode, is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I know many of you may not use it for that</li>
            <li>This trimmer has done the job many times over.</li>
            <li>QT4050 is much better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>I tried using this alone and would spend 15 min or more before deciding &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34;, now I start with a Wahl corded trimmer to do 90% of the trimming then finish with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Okay...</li>
            <li>I used it once a week at most.  </li>
            <li>This thing is awesome if you want to keep a scruffy look, no matter what length you keep your facial hair at.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase though and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>I travel quite a bit and find that if I&#x27;m out any more then 3-4 days that I need to bring the charger with.</li>
            <li>as I can&#x27;t tell for sure as the model # wore off.  </li>
            <li>and he was pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>So, after more research I decided to give the QT4070 a try.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best beard trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>The deficiency is mostly, in my view, at the level of accuracy and ease of</li>
            <li>better...</li>
            <li>On Turbo not too many hairs get away though.</li>
            <li>yes if you find my comment is helpful :)</li>
            <li>This newer version works very well for adjusting beard height, and the contour comb piece is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on my 4th trimmer in almost as many years.</li>
            <li>It does work OK.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had better ones.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco QT4070/41 Beard Trimmer 7300 is on the top end of their line of trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Great deal with fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that if I charge it longer I will get more that one trim when using it cordless.  </li>
            <li>Have never been so satisfied with a trimmer before.</li>
            <li>You are also able to take off the guard to be able to get even closer.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>well although it does require the charging cable to unlock so make sure you don&#x27;t forget it when you travel</li>
            <li>Thus I needed something I can have with me out in the field and be able to shave at a moments notice.</li>
            <li>I began shaving my head in 1996 and since then I have been using many many shavers to do so.</li>
            <li>What I realized is that not only it is great for taking it with me while traveling, I can (and do!)</li>
            <li>In addition, I love the feature that is has for locking the power button while traveling.</li>
            <li>and it does an okay job.</li>
            <li>:  -Lithium ion batteries are so much better.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pick up all the clippings but it picks up most.</li>
            <li>: Used to trim head and body where trimming the hair on my head is the most important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lowest setting is now much better for the stubble look, be it on your face or head.</li>
            <li>, it does a better job of what it was designed for - STUBBLE.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased that the floating guide is NOW INCLUDED</li>
            <li>I have had this for over a month and it works better than the barber&#x27;s for beard trimming.</li>
            <li>and I am not in love with it.  </li>
            <li>They really honed the design this time, great upgrades.  </li>
            <li>Does the job and more that it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Mine came with both head attachments which I am glad about.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>This is one of the better trimmers I have bought, I just wished it was designed to trim the stache evenly.    </li>
            <li>I was considering getting a body trimmer and using that, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did not.      </li>
            <li>In sum: after more than a month using this trimmer every day, I have had no nicks, no breakouts, and no worries.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with its build and quality.</li>
            <li>I have to repeat motion many times, then touch up with scissors.</li>
            <li>So had this on my Christmas wishlist and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>With this comb you will not be able get the lower stubble settings.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;  trims most of your face hair almost even&lt;</li>
            <li>Since deciding to stay with a close-trimmed beard three months ago, I thought an electric trimmer might help me keep it at desired length better than scissors.  </li>
            <li>After reading through many Amazon reviews, the Philips Norelco QT4070 appeared to be the one to get.  </li>
            <li>After a month or so of use, I not so sure.  </li>
            <li>I COULDENT ASK FOR A BETTER SHAVER</li>
            <li>It worked at speed until the end, then asked for more</li>
            <li>you purchase this trimmer to keep your close beard and stubble looking pop-album ready--you&#x27;ll be pleased with its performance, features, and especially the awesome battery life.</li>
            <li>Glad they have more business</li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>However, the predecessor to the QT4070 is much better made.</li>
            <li>More length settings than you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li>I have many complaints about this trimmer:     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d trim, move the trimmer to the side, trim some more, etc.</li>
            <li>It collects most but not all of the trimmings</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read that more people have this.</li>
            <li>They work very well and do a great job of doing what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it does an OK job.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I will use it and it is OK for what it is.</li>
            <li>The price point is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Upon trying it, I really like this unit and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Some engineer tried to safe money for the company but making that part cheep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t capture everything, but it works better.</li>
            <li>Awesome job, goes above and beyond to get the job done.</li>
            <li>My husband LOVE</li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t need any elaborate setup with something on the floor or even a towel around your heck.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Then I tried the contour guard, and it is a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I got a much more even trim, and I think it helps do a better job of trapping the trimmings and getting them vacuumed up.  </li>
            <li>I have used a beard trimmer for better than 15 years and this trimmer is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>impression of this shaver is that the designers attempted to drastically lower the cost of materials, but compensated by making the product \\&quot;look\\&quot; better.</li>
            <li>catches probably 70%, which is better than 0%!&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that, it was affordable.</li>
            <li>The company surely knew that I would need one posting it to Australia.</li>
            <li>i bought this for myself, and am glad i did.</li>
            <li>Fast charging is also a great feature.</li>
            <li>Since the MB 70 doesnt seem to be availavle any more and the batteries gave out on mine</li>
            <li>this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life has been great, charges fast and</li>
            <li>It shaves ok.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is adjustable for cut length, which is my favorite feature of this product.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s to hoping the Peanut works out much better than this...</li>
            <li>It will collect most stubble in the built in container.</li>
            <li>Husband says works ok, but wish it would cut shorter.</li>
            <li>I was searching for years for the perfect stubble beard trimmer, and I&#x27;m glad I finally found this one.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Quite satisfied with the performance and suggest that everyone consider this type of trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Love this trimmer, its awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Bought another for my son in law</li>
            <li>/&gt;I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I have been using a version of this trimmer for many years.</li>
            <li>so buy it you will love it</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for changing from stubble length to eyebrow length.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming eyebrows is very inaccurate with scissors and takes time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s awesome not having a bunch of clip-on guards laying around for the different</li>
            <li>Potent motor, turbo function is a plus.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it&#x27;s light as a feather!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t suck up some of the hair coming off, but does grab most.</li>
            <li>/&gt;See my product update at the top of this review.smart.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, I can&#x27;t find anything better.  </li>
            <li>See my product update at the top of this review.</li>
            <li>If you have more body hair (chest, legs, etc)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it has the hair catcher though</li>
            <li>The 2 different guards work excellent.  </li>
            <li>He will love it.  </li>
            <li>Probably his favorite gift of the year.</li>
            <li>When I go to the barber he is able to give me a &amp;#34;shadow goatee&amp;#34; and I love the look.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>otherwise, i don&#x27;t really understand the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am thoroughly pleased with this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is great and charge is incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>Love everything about it.</li>
            <li>I have to use it 2-3 times over to produce an OK shave.</li>
            <li>and I have used many.</li>
            <li>would buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will grow to like this one even better as I get better with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beard/mustache trimming are excellent, and I like the contour following guide better than the one that comes on the unit itself.</li>
            <li>This product had better reviews, but shame on me for getting fooled twice.</li>
            <li>The trimmer seemed to be losing most of its charge without my using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It looks like others may have had better luck.</li>
            <li>sure keeps the stubble</li>
            <li>And I love it because it contains most of his shavings leaving me with a cleaner bathroom.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I love the vac feature as it does contain most of the hair.</li>
            <li>The length settings are locked in(opposed to a slide guard found on many) at the MM length and no worry about the length attachment accidentally sliding creating a bald landing strip on you check.  </li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, for those guys out there who cultivate that \\&quot;I don&#x27;t need to shave everyday\\&quot; look, this may be the thing for you.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this one is more robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad I got this for him.</li>
            <li>It also came with 2 types of &amp;#34;caps&amp;#34; for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li>It has so many features</li>
            <li>5-stars for sure.</li>
            <li>I feel better about myself now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for my acne</li>
            <li>It works great, just keep in mind when going from a longer beard to much shorter your need to go in steps.</li>
            <li>I love it,  </li>
            <li>More hair fell out of this contraption then was caught in it.  </li>
            <li>Mostly, I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a much more effcient trimm withouth the guide comb</li>
            <li>IN GREATER AMOUNTS THAN OTHERS</li>
            <li>tips and guidelines | 10 more words required...</li>
            <li>one more...</li>
            <li>The digital display for length and battery indicator are awesome.</li>
            <li>It has improved in being lighter weight, easier to hold and has a better grip.  </li>
            <li>I like this one even more since you can use it</li>
            <li>We are extremely satisfied with our purchase.</li>
            <li>Save your money and get a better trimmer buy the Norelco with the pivoting head/comb.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way better than before :)</li>
            <li>That said, I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not that much worth for this price but good to prefer becaz of  lot many options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>This one is much more efficient and easier to set.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer fit the bill nicely.  </li>
            <li>It replaced a Braun which had a much better build quality</li>
            <li>The trimmer that this one replaced was OK</li>
            <li>it does come in handy when he&#x27;s half-way to a beard and needs to &amp;#34;mow the lawn&amp;#34; before shaving it all off or before using another trimmer to get closer but not baby&#x27;s butt smooth.</li>
            <li>The different blades from the T980 (mustache trimmer head) fits perfectly on the QT4070.</li>
            <li>The clippers won&#x27;t give you a 000 length (against the skin), it&#x27;s more of a 1/16\\&quot;, maybe 1/8\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I love the improvements in this model.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Four stars because overall it strikes the best balance between effectiveness and scratchiness.  </li>
            <li>Did an ok job while it worked.</li>
            <li>It is, in my mind, the perfect trimmer, but after many years of use it is starting to wear out.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but figured this one warranted one (pun intended, as you&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Slimmer, stronger, better quality.</li>
            <li>and that was more accurate in both length and catching errant hairs.</li>
            <li>My last trim was at 7 mm and that was the best yet.</li>
            <li>But i think I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>always start from the lowest setting and be sure the display matches for each click (or you will wind up with a shorter cut than you planned for!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more would one ask??</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a case that somebody forgot to put it in the box, but more like they don&#x27;t offer the contour comb with this product anymore.  </li>
            <li>I wish the attachment had finer combs to grab the hair better.</li>
            <li>but most of it get sucked.</li>
            <li>The Remington is okay as well, but I find it under-powered.</li>
            <li>This Norelco is MUCH better trimming my beard,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It sucked 85% or even more.</li>
            <li>- you are not carrying the carpet hover in your hands :)</li>
            <li>smooth, nice, and even :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nigh unusable, and leaves me with much more stubble than a millimeter, which the cheaper Qt4022 can do with ease.</li>
            <li>Sure, it has a lithium battery, but for 50 bucks?</li>
            <li>; beard look. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 4070 is a much more polished product than the Scruff Sculptor and represents a much better value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome battery back up.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with my choice of this model.</li>
            <li>I have had this product before and it worked for many years and it broke.</li>
            <li>As many have already stated it doesn&#x27;t capture 100% of the hairs</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than a stick in the eye</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Then add a cheap pin hinge, and you&#x27;d be all set!</li>
            <li>This works OK</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to trim and fade my beard to give it</li>
            <li>I just writhe thinking about how many of these are going to end up in a landfill.</li>
            <li>sure not going to trade it in hope</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>but it does pickup most of the hair.</li>
            <li>It has more settings for the beard trimming and it does a better job capturing clippings.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for a while after receiving the package so wasn&#x27;t sure if I can return the item.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is the battery life...</li>
            <li>The trimmer could be better on the neck</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>-i don&#x27;t understand why it makes difficulties for others :)</li>
            <li>but once it died I discovered a better</li>
            <li>Still love it tho!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally recommended, it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Really love the Trimmer.</li>
            <li>With many of these reviews, check the date they were posted.</li>
            <li>Only flaw ive found is that it isnt the best edger for around ears or around goatee</li>
            <li>The next best thing.</li>
            <li>but I have to imagine there is something else better out there</li>
            <li>My bathroom is no longer a mass of hair and I love</li>
            <li>I love that it adjusts</li>
            <li>and I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>Norelco is always releasing better and newer models, which makes your efforts</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something newer and better, BUY THIS</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something newer and better, BUY THIS RAZOR.</li>
            <li>If it takes me more than 90 seconds to get someone to say &#x27;the additional head on the way, thank you sir&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have had many eletrical/elecronic razors before this</li>
            <li>Has many calibrated levels and gives a smoth and even beard....</li>
            <li>Powerful, holds charge good, plenty of attachments to use with it.</li>
            <li>but i wanted something that would be able to work cordless/corded and something that would be able to trim and line my beard/ goatee</li>
            <li>I went with this based on reviews and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>most trimmers give you 20-30 mins of work for 10 hours of charging.</li>
            <li>Mine came with the \\&quot;sharper\\&quot; comb as well as the more \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; comb.</li>
            <li>The 0.5mm setting is what I wanted - this does many fancy things, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for a beard/mo mower.</li>
            <li>In actuality, hairs still go everywhere and while it does suck in a handsome amount, a lot still ends up on the floor</li>
            <li>Use whichever one works better for you.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>--if you follow this guideline you won&#x27;t find a better trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The battery still holds up well, and mostly all of the hair gets pulled in by the vaccuum (some will get away though).  </li>
            <li>an ok job of sucking up hair into the holder.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>a good job not cutting your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are bald, or want to be, those settings can be used on the top as well as on your chin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wisk out the head once every three days, and make sure blades are lubricated.</li>
            <li>I still find it easier to trim the top of my mustache with scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just promises a bit more than it can deliver.</li>
            <li>- Many length adjustments</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have this norelco cause</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer, although i cant really see a difference with the turbo mode, but still that is a plus.</li>
            <li>, he seems to love it also for the shaving part.  :-)  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After a bit of convincing, he said that I could opt for a refund.</li>
            <li>I do wonder how many people have had to settle for the QT4050 as a replacement, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I picked this up to replace an aging Norelco trimmer that had been dropped too many times.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely satisfied and would recommend it .</li>
            <li>Buy a cheaper model that does more.</li>
            <li>Can get a close shave if you take the top off.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of settings and lengths you can set from stubble to grooming a longer beard.</li>
            <li>I do like to use the Turbo setting to make sure.</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge for many uses.  </li>
            <li>it should do a better job of that because I still have to get my razor out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to admit though that the Philips gets a more even trim than the iStubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>Works mostly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Norelco should reissue the T980 or make a better replacement.</li>
            <li>I will say it is better than not having it</li>
            <li>Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It does what it should, love that it collects the hair</li>
            <li>and they have too many attachments to deal with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It sucked 85% or even more.</li>
            <li>- you are not carrying the carpet hover in your hands :)</li>
            <li>smooth, nice, and even :)</li>
            <li>but I figured I&#x27;d give it one more chance.  </li>
            <li>Ok im</li>
            <li>Trims without having to go over areas too many times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>get into the top part of mustache, though, because I have a nose.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>you do NOT have a nose, then there won&#x27;t be any problem getting to the top part of the mustache.</li>
            <li>This newer model has more adjustment&lt;</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>My favorite trimmer ever.  </li>
            <li>A better design would be like the Wahl Trim-n-Vac, which used a removable cup to capture trimmings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with the Norelco QT4070.  </li>
            <li>I have had one for about 10 years and love it, too.</li>
            <li>You will need to shave a couple times a week or more to maintain the desired length.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>i get a better look with my symple T shaped trimmer made by Andis.</li>
            <li>From what I have read it has begun to be shipped with the better comb in box.</li>
            <li>and I love the travel lock feature for when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like keeping the length of my facial hair to about 4-5 mm and this trimmer does that job perfectly.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love the QT4070.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I love this trimmer, but it&#x27;s not without its flaws.</li>
            <li>I love the battery life and the fact that it is maintenance</li>
            <li>The unit costs more than some of the others, but what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li>It has more settings for beard length</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer</li>
            <li>It does everything I wanted it to and more.  </li>
            <li>I do not use the turbo mode, which could catch more hair, I am not sure&lt;</li>
            <li>okay, you&#x27;ll still find hair in the sink.</li>
            <li>I have a Remington that I got from Amazon that works way better.</li>
            <li>Much more even shave.</li>
            <li>Norelco is stylish and holds a charge adequately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does an okay job.</li>
            <li>I personally use this machine for groin areas and it works perfectly, now you might ask why I use this for that</li>
            <li>previouse model was much better.</li>
            <li>I returned that trimmer because of some things I didn&#x27;t like about it and then bought this one; I like this one a lot more.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Razor better than advertised.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you could find a better trimmer at any price.</li>
            <li>So many features to like.</li>
            <li>i top notch.</li>
            <li>Most trimmers I&#x27;ve tried get around 20% of the hairs on each pass.  </li>
            <li>they require me to put more wording don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li>But after reading about how much better the contour comb was, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gives me the most even shave I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer in hopes of cleaning up my bathroom more than my beard.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews discussing the type of clipper guard this came with, so I was pleased when I got mine</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t trim the top of your mustache!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>This one is a lot more fool-proof.  </li>
            <li>battery life is excellent and the noise is low.</li>
            <li>but I wish it was better.</li>
            <li>For many reasons I preferred the \\&quot;dead\\&quot; one it replaces.  </li>
            <li>Love the dialing in of the mm length.</li>
            <li>Like many I got this as a replacement to the T980 model which I had for years.</li>
            <li>I had this model and it felt like a better built unit in every aspect.  </li>
            <li>I trim my beard, maybe more.</li>
            <li>love the vacume suction function</li>
            <li>glad I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In all those years they can&#x27;t stay on top of their design, manufacturing and quality control systems?</li>
            <li>Bottom line I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d buy 6 more and use them for each day of the week</li>
            <li>The above was written in mid-March 2015 and the razor performed flawlessly for another 3 months.</li>
            <li>Love this clipper.</li>
            <li>i like better than before</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the clipper&#x27;s blades are worn</li>
            <li>so I was actually able to use the T980&#x27;s mustache trimmer on the QT4070 (the parts were interchangeable).</li>
            <li>Combs need some redesign so that they will do a better job of lifting hair and guiding it into the cutter.</li>
            <li>After studying many wildly-mixed reviews, I had some concerns with the newer razor.</li>
            <li>Most of my comparison will be to the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>most prominent difficulty with this trimmer is that it is quite imprecise for edging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>And I love it.</li>
            <li>Effective and precise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it now comes with the contour head</li>
            <li>The price is also up there, this probably the most I would spend on a trimmer</li>
            <li>in all, it works OK</li>
            <li>The locking function is wonderful, I can lock it and toss it in my luggage for international flights, and it never turns on unexpectedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>like being able to charge it in one hour out of the box, and being able to use it up to 50 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apart from this the trimmer is well made and the designed thought out with a stylish touch to it with the LCD which indicates the battery level and trimmer size setting once adjusted.</li>
            <li>I love the precision of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Does the job, I wish it had more power</li>
            <li>Does part of the job, but could work better...</li>
            <li>used for about one year and love it.</li>
            <li>The trimmer has more minute legnths for trimming.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER...</li>
            <li>So just make sure you register it because you may be talking to customer service a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is much better than just dropping cut hairs everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought this one and it works so much better,</li>
            <li>Job well done&lt;br /&gt;Trimming is great and fast.</li>
            <li>It captures about 50% of the trimmings, which I guess is better than none</li>
            <li>I did break the latch for the hair storage area door, but have been able to keep using by holding it shut while in use.  </li>
            <li>it is a OK feature</li>
            <li>so I stopped and made sure that it was locked into place and everything seemed OK</li>
            <li>The charging cable doesn&#x27;t hold itself too strongly when connected, so it can very easily get disconnected when charging.</li>
            <li>This product looks great, works great, and the vacuum feature is a fantastic feature.</li>
            <li>It works great and the vacuum is good.</li>
            <li>Has both trimmer guards and a better vacuum collection system/filter, great product!</li>
            <li>As others have said the vacuum system isn&#x27;t perfect but better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the Vacuum Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li>The vacuum and whisker collector works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Despite the fault of the vacuum not being perfect, I would still recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li>Vacuum is awesome.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is awesome.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is awesome.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is a wonderful feature</li>
            <li>The vacuum system works as advertised which is awesome.</li>
            <li>This one has a vacuum to suck up the hair and keep it out of the sink, however, it does not work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>vacuum feature isn&#x27;t perfect and still leaves quite a bit of hair in/around the sink when trimming (That being said,</li>
            <li>The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect, but gets about 95% of the hair.  </li>
            <li>The built in vacuum is not the best</li>
            <li>the vacuum isn&#x27;t the best!  </li>
            <li>The T980 vacuum worked perfectly...</li>
            <li>The vacuum works but isn&#x27;t perfect.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum picks up between 80-90 percent of my weekly trims, which is impressive</li>
            <li>The vacuum is awesome as well.  </li>
            <li>Works as stated but vacuum not the best</li>
            <li>I bought this Phillips Vacuum trimmer after reading reviews online and determining which would suit me best.</li>
            <li>This lets me get the setting exactly right to keep a nice, even trim that blends in nicely.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product, works great and doesnt pull your hair when shaving like others razors.</li>
            <li>Length options are perfect and the vacuum on this trimmer makes for a nice clean trim.</li>
            <li>The turbo setting allows for a nice clean cut that looks better than my cheaper trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The device locking mechanism is unique and effective.</li>
            <li>It even looks cool and the quality build is top notch!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I originally got this because I had a nice beard going...</li>
            <li>nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The QT4070 has a strong motor, a more durable cover for the clippings catcher, and the digital display for battery and height is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is a great product particularly if you&#x27;re looking for the stubble look.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much the best Beard Trimmer you can buy.</li>
            <li>excellent, exactly as described and works very well</li>
            <li>ok, first the good:  </li>
            <li>So happy to find the shaver that has replaced my older Norelco beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I had an older model which I used for 10 years, and I&#x27;m happy with the upgrade.</li>
            <li>I feel the best way to really have a clean looking beard is to have a barber clean it up for you.</li>
            <li>but when you&#x27;re in your own bathroom, an additional 15% of 1000 hairs is a lot of stubble to go searching around your granite countertop to clean up.</li>
            <li>They have plenty of power, particularly with the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; and they cut through hair great</li>
            <li>though, this is a great trimmer, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great features and highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;View</li>
            <li>Great product, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The receiver loved it very much.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good, and charge time is very fast.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with how nice and easy it is to use and how clean it keeps the sink with its vacuum ability.</li>
            <li>It operates smoothly and effectively collects cut hairs through a strong vacuuming feature.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, quick charge,works great</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use and charges very quickly.  </li>
            <li>These complaints are minor, though, and I still consider this to be one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All around, this is a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li>Would be pretty good for sideburns and goatees and the likes.  </li>
            <li>especially good for that stumble look</li>
            <li>Pretty good for keeping a close cropped afternoon shadow.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job otherwise, though.  </li>
            <li>This one is really pretty good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall good product and haven&#x27;t had any problems in the first month of owning it.</li>
            <li>(when you take off the guard) is pretty good for a stubble.</li>
            <li>but it does pretty good.</li>
            <li>I watched a good Youtube video review of this 4070 that recommended charging it overnight before you use it for the first time</li>
            <li>Works pretty good</li>
            <li>Works pretty good out of the box</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still cuts pretty good</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I&#x27;ve had in a long time</li>
            <li>first of all i got to say that its a good beard trimming pruduct.</li>
            <li>But it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>The charge has lasted more than a week and the vacuum function is great, and keeps my bathroom tidy.</li>
            <li>With beards and stubble becoming popular again, after 30 some years of being clean shaven, I decided to give a beard a try</li>
            <li>With this main head i get a really awesome length of stubble which is exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The new model incorporates great updates that add to its utility.  </li>
            <li>The new one works great.  </li>
            <li>by far the best beard trimmer i have ever owned would buy this its well worth the money</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Not being able to easily trim neat sideburns defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased at how easy it is to keep my beard trimmed with this unit.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>Good, clean design, clean trim line for detail, charges easily and maintains charge&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>Most of the hairs found their way into the chamber and so were easy to dispose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to trim that area so easily.  </li>
            <li>But I can say that the length dial works, and the blades cut quick and clean, and the unit holds a battery charge fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked this specific one for its features, It works great with one exception.</li>
            <li>Best everyday trimmer that I own.</li>
            <li>More precise and better feel than the Conair.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean, and portable.</li>
            <li>Good one, easy to use, Vacuum is working good and most of hair got collected.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s very easy to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect but gets up most of the hair, making clean up easier.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is a nice feature and greatly reduces cleanup.   </li>
            <li>The vacuum feature does, surprisingly, capture a good chunk of the hair.</li>
            <li>vacuum feature works great, and keeps things nice and neat.</li>
            <li>Well engineered, feels good in the hand, and most importantly, performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is a gimmick of course, but it is mention as a feature and makes the device sound like &#x27;very precise&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I think this product works fine for most parts of your face.  </li>
            <li>(2) DO NOT TRY TO CLEAN UNDER RUNNING WATER!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured okay, that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>clean!  </li>
            <li>The blades stayed sharp and the battery life was excellent; but one too many times in the humid environ of my bathroom spelled the end for this</li>
            <li>Never a nick, no razor bumps, nice comfortable and clean shave.    </li>
            <li>This product is as good as always and even works better than the older model I replaced.</li>
            <li>It is very clean and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very good quality product and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li>This looks like a very good product, and I&#x27;ll definitely keep it.</li>
            <li>The vacuum allows you to get a clean shave perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the vacuum works great.</li>
            <li>Vacuum works  great and is very easy to use</li>
            <li>Also, the built in vacuum doesn&#x27;t do a very good job either, and I still have to trim over the restroom sink.</li>
            <li>mess,&amp;#34; it should be more accurately put as &amp;</li>
            <li>and I think the trimmer guide/gauge is probably is more accurately functional for shorter settings.</li>
            <li>* more precise trim  *</li>
            <li>This model doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as closely and the unit seems lighter and more cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Well, this was it and it is incredibly lightweight but sturdy enough!</li>
            <li>I find it much more comfortable not to shave too close</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head for nearly 18 years and this is one of the best, most reliable, and what I most appreciate, the low maintenance and ease of clean-up.  </li>
            <li>This is a GREAT trimmer and I am glad I didn&#x27;t take heed to the negative reviews from people who must have been trying to eat the damn blade, lol.</li>
            <li>and so far the trimmer works great as well.  </li>
            <li>I will gladly give mine to anyone for free.</li>
            <li>So far its working great</li>
            <li>The contour-following comb is the more comfortable comb to use; the &amp;#34;fixed comb&amp;#34; sometimes grabbed my beard while trimming.</li>
            <li>just make sure that your face is smooth.</li>
            <li>The battery life is fantastic, I think I charge it maybe once every 2 or 3 months at most.</li>
            <li>In the end, like most things, you have to compromise and decide what is important to you.</li>
            <li>The first worked great and although over time had lost its ability to hold a charge for as long as it used to, it still worked great.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been quite happy with this purchase thus far.</li>
            <li>Great length if you&#x27;re young and in college.</li>
            <li>The trim was even and the trimmer itself was much more comfortable to hold than the T980.  </li>
            <li>After a lot of shopping, reading and trying many of the trimmers available</li>
            <li>If Yours does not come with the More \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; comb, you can contact Norelco and they will send you one free of charge.</li>
            <li>While OK, I found it to be cheaply made based on the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>I am able to find a setting that keeps my beard well trimmed and at a level that I am comfortable with.</li>
            <li>i love the led light</li>
            <li>I got it, plugged it in, charged it for an hour, and proceded to get the most comfortable beard trim in my 30 years of wearing one.</li>
            <li>This is the most important feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak about the longevity or reliability of the product, but so far, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and it has great battery life which used to annoy me with my old cadmium powered shaver.</li>
            <li>Great job keeping those peaky whiskers in control.  </li>
            <li>I shave my beard very close to the skin and this shaver does a really good job.</li>
            <li>I should also mention, I&#x27;ve had a handful of instances where the battery just kind of &amp;#34;quits&amp;#34; when using the trimmer fresh off the charger.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good trimmer when trying to get close to the edge of your goatee</li>
            <li>This thing is powerful and effective.</li>
            <li>I have been using this thing for weeks now, and it does a darn good job, and it does it fairly fast, too.  </li>
            <li>Good looking and works really well</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco products are well engineered and this one was very efficient and did a good job</li>
            <li>When not using the guards you cannot get a good straight edge because plastic covers the blades so you cannot see your lines.</li>
            <li>I use it everywhere, and this trimmer has been very versatile with a good battery life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeking alternatives, but I suppose no one wants to spend time making a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wish it was as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>Works really well with good consistency.  </li>
            <li>It works fast, feels good in my hand, and trims just as I want.  </li>
            <li>Had they included the correct comb and if the vacuum worked as good as their old model this would be the best trimmer on the market.  </li>
            <li>vacuum piece is cool and the design of the unit is awesome</li>
            <li>The vacuum capability works incredibly well, cleaning up is not a hassle.</li>
            <li>The vacuum  system was a brilliant idea to create.  </li>
            <li>It cuts great and the height adjustment is awesome, it actually seems to work better than any of the removable spacers on other clippers and has way more options for height.</li>
            <li>I consider this a non-issue though, since on its own this trimmer&#x27;s usefulness is extremely limited (nil in my case), meaning its battery life is at best only as good as that of the product it is functionally tethered to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(well - not entirely true, because it does let some hair fly), but all in all a great idea......until you end up with great big holes in your beard!    </li>
            <li>I owned previous breard trimmers from Norelco that were excellent and much more reliable.</li>
            <li>I love the readout showing the millimeter setting - makes it easy to read and reliably accurate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really easy to be used and so smooth, you will certainly love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have been a loyal Norelco user and was glad to be able to replace the inadequate trimmer with one which measures up to the quality I expect from the company.</li>
            <li>clean and very smooth when done.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t understand how this trimmer has so many positive reviews...</li>
            <li>So nice to be able to offer a positive recommendation for a Norelco product.  </li>
            <li>Such a good product, works better than i thought it would!</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer, I was pesimistic at first as to how effective and well it would work, but wow this thing is great!  </li>
            <li>Such a great trimmer, I had a cheap one before and very happy I decided to spend some extra cash and get this trimmer which does not pull my hair at all, does not cut my skin and reduces the mass drastically with its vacum</li>
            <li>The removable contour comb is very comfortable, and the trim with the contour comb is as good as I was getting from my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>It cuts hair easily and effectively unlike some that make the right noises, but no noticeable difference to your beard.</li>
            <li>Perfect, precise, powerful, safe and the head is easy to remove and put back (no fighting involved)</li>
            <li>I currently own a Braun that I&#x27;ll probably keep using over this just because it does have the trimmer guides, but I certainly would have been satisfied with this</li>
            <li>Great trimmer well worth the price, would certainly buy again...</li>
            <li>sure to order the version that contains the contoured guide as well as the original guide.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slim design fits perfectly in the medicine cabinet and it holds a charge extremely well.</li>
            <li>Other than that i am very Happy with it.</li>
            <li>Also the trimmers work sharply for a perfect trim.</li>
            <li>The trim you get is nothing that you can&#x27;t get form other trimmers, but having the clippings vacuumed is priceless.  </li>
            <li>but it sounds cool when you hit the button!</li>
            <li>However, if anything I&#x27;ve mentioned makes this product connect in some way with your intended use, it might be worthwhile to pick up if significantly discounted.discounted.</li>
            <li>will love this rascal...buy it and smile!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have pointed out the contour head works best</li>
            <li>advantage, the vacuum feature is awesome, especially on high speed.  </li>
            <li>but I find it easy to use and sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This model is more powerful and has better controls.</li>
            <li>But on the plus side, it charges very quickly.</li>
            <li>I do wish that the chamber for the cut hairs was removeable for easy dumping, but whatever.</li>
            <li>It also charged very quickly and never lost power in the 20 minutes I needed to trim up the beard.</li>
            <li>When done in the shower (water off), makes for ridiculously easy cleanup, bonus points if you can reach the can without getting out.</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust and very quick</li>
            <li>the attachments, it cuts from 1/32 inch to 23/32 inch, making it easy to keep your beard trim, or to maintain that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to adjust with length measurements listed in both mm and increments of an inch as well as an LED number setting.  </li>
            <li>If that is so, then this is a best example of how engineers can screw up a great product into an useless on.    </li>
            <li>Let alone that the prongs on the comb bend easily...</li>
            <li>I have found the trimmer to be easy to handle</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li>After just a couple of months of very mild use, the latch on the trimmings collection chamber broke.  </li>
            <li>Easy to adjust size.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>It allows me to easily keep my beard trimmed and well groomed.</li>
            <li>; comb makes it easy to move the trimmer over your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this thing quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Nice style easy to use.</li>
            <li>even trip, and easily adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to hold and control.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>The buzzer itself it great the only issue is the comb that attaches to the top.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, makes clean up a breeze, and resulted in a trim that brought many compliments from my friends.</li>
            <li>This one, however, has a hole in the guide which makes it incredibly easy to slip up on the angle you&#x27;re shaving at and cut your beard as if there&#x27;s no guide at all.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and achieve the desired length of your beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m purchasing this because the battery wore out very quickly on my Remington MB200.</li>
            <li>He finds it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and maneuver.  </li>
            <li>easy to adjust size</li>
            <li>This made it easy to trim hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li>The teeth bend too easily</li>
            <li>It also caught the trimmings in a screen which made shaving and trimming more convenient - nothing to clean up.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Braun could easily go 30+ uses before being needed to be plugged in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Length is easily selectable by twisting a knob.</li>
            <li>The Trimmer cuts evenly and the adjustments for length are easy to set.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not so easy to out of there with the provided brush</li>
            <li>ehhh, trying to get a close shave with this &amp;#34;vacuum shaver&amp;#34; is not all that easy.</li>
            <li>He reports that is easy to use &amp; meets his expectations.  </li>
            <li>After investigation, I found that you can easily remove the cutter unit.  </li>
            <li>The rotary click dial makes it easy to set and read.  </li>
            <li>and you can easily dump the hair into the sink.</li>
            <li>It is not so easy to adjust the correct Hair size.</li>
            <li>one is a rubberized comb that bends easily and</li>
            <li>the hinge breaking easily makes me leave it at 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>it dies easily for some reason.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the trimmer was easy using the included cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>Outside of having to judge better by looking at the length this is great.</li>
            <li>The trim length is easy to adjust with a dial and the length lights up.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great product that comes exactly as described, and does exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Easy to change settings and</li>
            <li>I have never used a trimmer this easy and as efficient.</li>
            <li>either case, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>The plastic parts don&#x27;t move in/out easily.</li>
            <li>so needed something easy for him</li>
            <li>The adjustment was easy to use and holds its place.</li>
            <li>It is easily adjustable and easy to confirm/check the setting.</li>

            <li>I also like how easy it is to change the settings for depth of trim.  </li>
            <li>The LED is easy to read.</li>
            <li>easy conversation was told the replacement blade would be in the mail</li>
            <li>The teeth could not be made out of firmer plastic, or shaped so they will not flex so easily?</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easily switching trimming lengths</li>
            <li>He can trim his beard easily and evenly in no time at all.</li>
            <li>Adjusts easily to desired length, works well, follows chin contour, cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The compartment that holds the trimmings breaks easily.</li>

            <li>Always thoroughly clean the device if you use it on more than one location on your body.</li>
            <li>If these issues were resolved, the trimmer would easily warrant a 5-star review.</li>
            <li>Make sure to clean out the space that &amp;#34;holds&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This was so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>trims easily and evenly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use it to trim my beard and hair all one length so it gets a workout every week, and has been going strong for a month or two now, I think.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a nice box so would look good for a present.</li>
            <li>the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another product from Phillips Norelco and would strongly recommend that no one else does, until they fix their customer service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to replace my older trimmer with this one.</li>
            <li>I thought the older model was good.  </li>
            <li>Overall a nice product and good value.</li>
            <li>Bought this thing 3 years ago and still running strong.</li>
            <li>do not have a strong beard so for me, I remove the comb and use the machine on the lowest setting which is 0.5mm for an even stubble and buying this machine was all about the vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I strongly advise you to not to buy this and save your money.</li>
            <li>The motor is strong, with no noticeable decline in power when on battery alone.</li>
            <li>thing has a lot of good reviews, I just wonder if anyone giving it 5 stars has ever used the older model.  </li>
            <li>It all plastic doesn&#x27;t look strong.</li>
            <li>Initially i loved it as it replaced my aged trimmer which was not doing a good job.</li>
            <li>Perfect, reliable and very handy for beard or stash norelco products have always been good product for me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li>The vacuum works great and gets most of the trimming.</li>
            <li>Vacuum feature is great but didn&#x27;t see any use of turbo mode except more noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vacuum function isn&#x27;t that great, but it comes with two shaver heads, once that pivots, and one that gives you more control.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer, love the accuracy of the guide and do feel that the vacuum is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>Great battery life and love the vacuum system.</li>
            <li>this model does a nice job in collecting hair with its vacuum system and also does good job trimming beard</li>
            <li>I do wish the vacuum was a bit stronger but honestly, I have nothing to compare it to and it DOES catch a good portion of the hair.</li>
            <li>and I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this purchase if you need a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>a Norelco get a Norelco&amp;#34; so I ordered this one and there isn&#x27;t anything special about it, yea it catch most of your beard hair in the suction trap</li>
            <li>it does not vacuum all of the beard remaining but only 75%-80%, still the trimmer is very good quality and great value for the price</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s a whole lot better than no vacuum.  </li>
            <li>i bought tht month ago, and im very satisfied with its abilities, its not 100% vacum the cut hair, but its very convient for everything else,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very safe for body grooming, so this really does it all.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for general hair/beard trimming.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the many features provided by this efficient and easy to use and clean beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first stubble and beard trimmer to obtain that stylist, stubble look that is popular now for us men.</li>
            <li>bought the pro, the trimmer works pretty nicely</li>
            <li>It is ideal for traveling since it runs for a long time between charges.</li>
            <li>far I am loving it!</li>
            <li>Beard never looked better and this thing will hold a charge for a month with full beard trimmings every 3 days.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good beard trimmer , the blades are sharp yet surprisingly don&#x27;t cut the skin .</li>
            <li>Very nice trimmer, love the vacuum system in it.</li>
            <li>First, as many reviewers have pointed out, the door holding the beard trimmings is very cheaply constructed.  </li>
            <li>Pros: it looks and feels great - and I enjoy the vacuum since it catches most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature didn&#x27;t work great, but sufficed and the rest of the features were so good that it didn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>Just set the length (I use 6-8mm) and run the trimmer down you beard  or mustache and it trims it to that length perfectly.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is hand&#x27;s down the best beard grooming tool.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect if it cut the hair down all of the way.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I could put it on 4mm, and still shave down to the skin if I don&#x27;t keep it at a perfect angle.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It was certainly an oversight on Norelco&#x27;s part, and they should certainly be happy and willing to ship out the replacement comb for customers who ask for it.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is why this was purchased --- and it performs beautifully.</li>
            <li>Having tried many (+10) electric beard trimmers in the past, including this model&#x27;s predecessor, I can easily say that this is the best trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, I&#x27;d bet that no other beard trimmer can do any better.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very good looking, comfortable to hold and holds a charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li>and when I was looking to buy a new trimmer I figured it was a good choice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use and accurate</li>
            <li>I tried the 3mm setting with plastic guide against my skin and it felt fine.  </li>
            <li>But, the trimmer shuts off if you try to use this fine trim head in Turbo mode.</li>
            <li>But, it works fine without being put into Turbo Mode.    </li>
            <li>Norelco should provide that fine trim head.</li>
            <li>Just what ti was looking for use it to shave over A month and still half power on the battery best i have had</li>
            <li>This trimmer works just fine for my needs.</li>
            <li>it does the job fine because it does say &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still working fine</li>
            <li>this trimmer may work out fine.  </li>
            <li>so if you slightly tilt the machine while shaving, and NOT hold the machine perfectly at an 45 degree angle, it will eat a piece of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says it doesn&#x27;t do fine lines.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is the first trimmer that I&#x27;ve actually been happy with!</li>
            <li>At best it get half of the shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Drilled holes for two self-tapping screws which works fine, but</li>
            <li>light and easy to use</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco QT 4070/41 Beard Trimmer 7300 does a fine job trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has a beard and it works fine</li>
            <li>Mustache/beard trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past have always been excellent multi-taskers, allowing me to trim much more than the name</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, handles easily, and retains it&#x27;s charge well.</li>
            <li>This is the first real, quality trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had (after a series of not so great trimmers).</li>
            <li>and it is working fine.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer works just fine.</li>
            <li>it works just fine...</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even interested in such feature, but using it I have to say that I am impressed...</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine.  </li>
            <li>so it would be easy to cut yourself though fortunately it hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet.</li>
            <li>It has worked fine so for me.</li>
            <li>My previous Norelco trimmer worked perfectly for 13 years.</li>
            <li>This is a fine beard trimmer</li>
            <li>I had it for a month and a half now, and are very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Fine battery life for cordless use.</li>
            <li>This replacement for a previous Norelco, does an excellent job of removing all the stubble from my scalp and trims my beard with  consistency.</li>
            <li>trimmer works fine</li>
            <li>WORKS FINE AND INEXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET</li>
            <li>My previous Norelco trimmer worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery works fine.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure depending on creativity and practice, I can create better and cooler cuts which my barber can never do because he&#x27;s not me.</li>
            <li>It would work perfectly for about 2 or 3 trims (5 minutes or less each time).  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even interested in such feature, but using it I have to say that I am impressed...</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>That said, it also cut way better and more consistently.</li>
            <li>I was using although it doesn&#x27;t trim as fine as the Wahl</li>
            <li>It works fine, but you can&#x27;t use it while you walk around your house, for ex, because a part of the hairs will fall on the floor.</li>
            <li>it works fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one star is for the trimming capability which was fine until the battery died.</li>
            <li>It does what it promises and mows your face just fine.  </li>
            <li>* Easy and precise adjustment&lt;</li>
            <li>Not only powerful but clean up is perfect!!  </li>
            <li>works great, has compartment that catches 95% of shaved hairs (beard, moustache) and easy to clean the compartment, many different shave levels, 2 speeds, comfortable shave</li>
            <li>However, as I said before, the T980&#x27;s trimmer works just fine on the QT and, of course, the QT fits in the T980&#x27;s case.</li>
            <li>Trimmer cuts fine</li>
            <li>Works fine, but I&#x27;ve had problems:</li>
            <li>My advice: QUICK!</li>
            <li>The trimmer feels powerful with decent speeds, looks elegant and the closeness settings are good.</li>
            <li>I love this beard trimmer - cordless, charges quickly, and even has an electronic lock for traveling</li>
            <li>He really likes it, one of the better trimmers that he&#x27;s tried!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, but my sink is not full of trimmings when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best trimmers he has ever had and it gets the job done in no time plus gets rid of the mess.</li>
            <li>He likes it just as good as his old one!</li>
            <li>It seemed like a lot of R&amp;D went into making this product innovative and easy to use, but what&#x27;s all of that worth if it&#x27;s just going to stop working so soon?  </li>
            <li>I have had quite a few beard trimmers and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li>The device is simple, easy to use and does an great job.</li>
            <li>They used to come with an added attachment to trim tight spaces and it was perfect for trimming my mustache and chin.  </li>
            <li>Great vacuum works as advertised but cannot use easily to cut around ears or trim sideburns</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mess free trimmer with best results.</li>
            <li>The fine adjustments fit whatever length you want.  </li>
            <li>I am still perplexed why Norelco &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; a perfectly fine product and made it into a piece of junk?</li>
            <li>Works fine for about 6 months, then the blades need replaced, but there are none available.  </li>
            <li>Wish they did not use so much cheap plastic on this unit, otherwise it would be just fine for me.</li>
            <li>If you are doing this, put your trimmers (and certainly any razor you might own) away and lock them</li>
            <li>my biggest grip with it is the fact that the integrated guard keeps me from being able to get right up under my nose easily.</li>
            <li>I had to make sure he charged it correctly the first time to prevent any battery damage, but other than that it was a flawless purchase</li>
            <li>Excellent beard trimmer which certainly met my expectations, and the vacuum works well also!  </li>
            <li>It trims smoothly and evenly and is easy to clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Replaced this with a Remington after the battery gave out; this is a huge improvement in:    </li>
            <li>I had an old Philips Norelco beard trimmer and it was perfect, being 8 years old, it was time to let it rest.</li>
            <li>The guard isnt accurate at all.</li>
            <li>CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP.</li>
            <li>It should come with a \\&quot;contour\\&quot; comb that doesn&#x27;t have a huge gap in it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t flow smoothly across my chin without stumbling but again overall its great.</li>
            <li>As I travel, this is a huge inconvenience for me.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it three stars is because of a huge problem I have with this product.</li>
            <li>It is a huge pain in the</li>
            <li>I had huge expectations for this product because of the reviews, but after 2 months of use</li>
            <li>This is a huge problem.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was accurate</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a huge upgrade from one without it.</li>
            <li>Its by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li>Philips description of everything this trimmer does was 100% accurate.</li>
            <li>For those purposes, this was a huge advance over the 10yr/old model I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>The great thing about Amazon is that they&#x27;re taking it back for free.</li>
            <li>It is quite, accurate  and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Second worked great and still does.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s much more powerful</li>
            <li>and now the part shows that it will be available October 6th.  </li>
            <li>They can place a back-order for $15, but if I want to free part</li>
            <li>The quality of trimming though is reasonable and effective.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s an easy clean up.</li>
            <li>For some bizarre reason the setting between 3/8 inch and 5/8 inch is \\&quot;15/32\\&quot;, not 4/8, and the longest depth is 23/32, not 6/8.</li>
            <li>I found the shaver to be quite easy to clean, using the included cleaning brush</li>
            <li>A smooth precise trim.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is perfect for everyday trimming.</li>
            <li>I primarily use this for trimming my head - bald head...</li>
            <li>I use that trim head on the QT4070 also, because it does fit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do any hairline or detailed trimming/edging, but I suspect I could not get the John Water&#x27;s stache&#x27; with this device.</li>
            <li>My one gripe with this, and it&#x27;s the same my friend has experienced, if you travel with it, even if you lock it</li>
            <li>It was a no hassle phone call and within a couple of minutes I received an email order form and will be receiving it in 7 to 10  business days all free of charge.  </li>
            <li>He says it trims well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Not too light to use though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>digital display is great.</li>
            <li>Feels light and plastic.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>With the T980 no longer available, it appeared that my options were either the QT4050 or the QT4070.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ll send it to you, free of charge.</li>
            <li>I have a very coarse, unruly beard that grows in all directions and this trimmer does a great job contouring my beard using the attached guide.</li>
            <li>Built-in adjustable guard instead of having to change to different guard heights is a great feature.</li>
            <li>im guessing they are available.  </li>
            <li>broke off (cheap).  </li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>, vac works as designed and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic to keep my beard looking</li>
            <li>Overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It should be noted that there is a table in the instructions that give you the length in inches for each available setting of 1 to 18,  </li>
            <li>I received this product free of charge via the vine</li>
            <li>Does a great trimming job and has various lengths.  </li>
            <li>-It gives a great trim (WITH the NON-included contour following comb).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, clean \\&quot;interface\\&quot; and leaves an even stubble.</li>
            <li>This does a great job and is sleek and smaller than the one he had.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is also quite comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Obviously, that was something I was happy to see</li>
            <li>man up can just call Philipls and have them send it to you for FREE.  </li>
            <li>Also in order to have an even and smooth cut, you must go over atleast twice</li>
            <li>Great trimmer overall.  </li>
            <li>Lower-cost models like the QT4050 have the better comb (per Amazon description), with a slower charger, but would be worth the savings.</li>
            <li>Only flaw in an otherwise great design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had this trimmer for a few months now and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>However, after fully charging a second time the battery life was great.  </li>
            <li>I found it easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to take apart and clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;very light in weight.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is easy to clean, charge and store.</li>
            <li>Easy clean up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>he said it works great for trimming his beard which he keeps very short.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a non-impressive re-design of a product that was previously fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a non-impressive re-design of a product that was previously fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and works like the description.</li>
            <li>Fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is really important.  </li>
            <li>This is a solid trimmer with great battery.  </li>
            <li>I have to rake this over my face over and over to get all the hair which it just won&#x27;t do, always have to finish with a cheap $20 Remington.  </li>
            <li>This is a great item for facial trimming.  </li>
            <li>This product is great and adjustments are as simple as pushing a button.</li>
            <li>The digital depth indicator is great as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight design, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely beyond happy with my decision of going forward with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Plastic feels cheap... turbo mode does</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the look that</li>
            <li>Its light and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Light weight but</li>
            <li>Also nice is the LED readout indicating how much battery life remains, though the battery does recharge rapidly in the event that it does die.  </li>
            <li>One of these cheap pieces of plastic broke off and now the door won&#x27;t close...</li>
            <li>I like the dial-up trimmer guard and the razor is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Overall a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the battery indicator light, which lets me know when the battery is draining away.</li>
            <li>It is actually more like one day&#x27;s worth of hair not 5 o&#x27;clock shadow</li>
            <li>The overall mechanism works great</li>
            <li>I can not say enough great things about this.</li>
            <li>Great for the stubble look or for maintaining a short beard.</li>
            <li>Mine broke after 4months of light use.</li>
            <li>Been using it for several months now and it works great.</li>
            <li>They offered to ship this comb free of charge.  </li>
            <li>They sent me a pouch free of charge.  </li>
            <li>It trims my goatee very evenly and cleans up nice.</li>
            <li>If the sound is an indication I could trim my hedge with it.</li>
            <li>my getting used to the light motion required to cut evenly</li>
            <li>My beard is light colored</li>
            <li>but the short warranty period isn&#x27;t too great.</li>
            <li>Just an overall great product.  </li>
            <li>The great part about Phillips, is that they offer a 45 day money back guarantee on their products.  </li>
            <li>Works great for overall shortening to achieve stubble and blending sideburns.</li>
            <li>trimming settings that I think are fabulous, you can choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...,</li>
            <li>Well just before Christmas this pass year the light in my head came on and that&#x27;s when I found it with u guys.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great shave.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, and it was more than I wanted to spend, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Ordered for the precision trimming levels and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>While not an important consideration for me</li>
            <li>So, the battery and cheap door hinge are my hangups.</li>
            <li>On that note I did test that the cutter head from this unit does in fact fit and work in my T980.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>it actually makes a great line to frame my face.  </li>
            <li>The cut on the QT4070 is so smooth.</li>
            <li>For what your getting with this product, the price is completely justified.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap..</li>
            <li>I really liked the product and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>The guy I spoke with said it wouldn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>Cuts well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy Clean Up</li>
            <li>He uses it regularly and says it does a great job.</li>
            <li>It works great with my mid length and shorter length beards.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind plugging it in constantly its great, but don&#x27;t leave home without the charger.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t clean the blade easily after use.</li>
            <li>I bought mine and it stopped charging after 3 months of light use.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic I believe.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this razor and has been working well for over a year now.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s replaced for free.</li>
            <li>Worked great initially.</li>
            <li>Also had a cheap plastic feel to it...</li>
            <li>lines that I got from this is precise.  </li>
            <li>rarely leaving any shavings on the counter top.</li>
            <li>Multiple settings and interchangeable heads along with a hair reservoir makes it a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>it gave me the feeling that it was a cheap product.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>trimming settings that I think are fabulous, you can choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and keeps the cut hair off your neck and shirt.</li>
            <li>and you definitely enjoy with this.</li>
            <li>available and they lock into position.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the improvements.</li>
            <li>And Norelco really should provide the 15 Cent moustache comb its own instructions</li>
            <li>and I press the trimmer to my face until I stop hearing the screeching sound of hair being cut.</li>
            <li>A tad on the cheap plastic-ee side</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very portable and fits quite nicely with the rest of my stuff when I am traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that the trim is comfortable</li>
            <li>, this is great to avoid slippage and surprisingly not standard with all trimmers.</li>
            <li>If you maintain a beard or stubble, you need to trim it everyday and the norelco is the perfect tool for the job.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and adjustable.</li>
            <li>I lightly rinsed it anyways, and it survived.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to clean with the included brush.</li>
            <li>I primarily use the QT4070 to maintain a 1 mm &amp;#34;designer stubble&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several beard trimmers, but none that have done as great of a job.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I am getting the results that I was looking for with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>it came with an attachment that &#x27;catches&#x27; the beard hairs while he is trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Better price on amazon than in the stores-- and the convenience of shopping online with free shipping</li>
            <li>makes me smile... :)</li>
            <li>said this should not happened and immediately agreed to send a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li>Shaving still preforms great for shaving, but there&#x27;s obviously a wiring/charging issue with this unit.</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t fit anywhere</li>
            <li>I got it last week and up to now works great.</li>
            <li>I think I could use a rubber band to secure the hatch, if the latch breaks.</li>
            <li>I finally tried this one and it&#x27;s been great for over 2 years.  </li>
            <li>Buyers beware that the door latch is a bit cheap</li>
            <li>The cheap construction has not made an impact, but it will.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I haven&#x27;t had this Trimmer but just for a short period of time, and it works very well and great for me!!!  </li>
            <li>I think it would be a good product for someone with longer beard hair but for me it is completely unusable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the QT4070 twice now, but I&#x27;m already ready to dub it the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a regular trimmer in this regard, but not quite as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>not that good, the Last philips I bought was better and cheaper too,&lt;br /&gt;next</li>
            <li>I can say without a doubt that the 4070 is far superior to anything I have used before.  </li>
            <li>Especially trimming without the guides on the neck or anywhere you want a clean spot, it does an exceptional job!</li>
            <li>The trimmer guide for the beard isn&#x27;t as good as my old trimmer, though.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic was great while it lasted (not quite as good as this one), but the battery not being able to hold a decent charge after less than a year is unacceptable.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it get&#x27;s them all but having 80-90% less hair to clean out of the bathroom sink is a great thing!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good upgrade from my old unit.  </li>
            <li>I rated it as a good trimmer, but it takes quite a few passes and patience to get a good trim.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, still charging it up</li>
            <li>and I expect it to be as good as my old 4021</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s actually good news because I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement cutter head in quite some time as all were back ordered.</li>
            <li>The QT4070 is far superior in almost every way.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It is preforming as good as my old Phillips Norelco bread trimmer.</li>
            <li>So far so good after a month.  </li>
            <li>I loved the old Norelco</li>
            <li>Far superior device, so I say go for that one and skip the Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/14/14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cut is as good as my wahl corded monster of a trimmer, which really surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good replacement for my old Norelco</li>
            <li>Vacuum function is lacking for sure and would be nice if it had an attached pop up mini trimmer to get more precisely around the mouth and ears.</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge really well, vacuum works wonderfully and the different size options are great as well.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works OK, the suction  is good.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum system is a nice bell and whistle, but it isn&#x27;t 100% effective.</li>
            <li>The vacuum does a good job of collecting most of the trimmings and</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair, but it does a really good job of getting most of it.</li>
            <li>Works great but vacuum get in the way when trying to line and trim mustache</li>
            <li>The vacuum collects about 90% of my beard trimmings (makes my wife happy because they no longer clog the sink).  </li>
            <li>vacuum feature is great; captures and stores 90% of the shavings  *</li>
            <li>I discounted the vacuum feature but the price for this model was attractive</li>
            <li>This product works as advertised and the vacuum feature is great.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum works great and gets about 90% of hairs.</li>
            <li>This is great because of the vacuum.</li>

            <li>yhe vacuum works great.</li>
            <li>Vacuum function is kinda bs but shaver works great</li>

            <li>The vacuum feature works great.  </li>
            <li>works great, the vacuum system is a must have.</li>
            <li>It seems like a novel and great idea; the vacuum suction picking up your stubble, a rotating gear to adjust height, a display that shows battery life (what?!).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, battery lasts a long time - great for travelling.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very pleased with this new model.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this new one.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Other than that very good device.  </li>
            <li>I was fine with out it and while it does keep the sink clean -</li>
            <li>I cannot use the product to mark up or line up or whatever the term is, my mustache and beard in a fine line to clean things up.</li>
            <li>I still use a razor to shape my beard and neckline which I am fined with because I never use electrics for full shaves but this is an easy way to keep it trimmed evenly</li>
            <li>It works ok for the 5 O&#x27;clock shadow, but other than that, its not that great.  </li>
            <li>Really, I highly-recommend it for the product and price!!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks again, Amazon &amp; Philips-Norelco!!!</li>
            <li>absolutely works as advertised!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks PHILLIPS and AMAZON !!!</li>
            <li>Very unfriendly in use!!!</li>
            <li>very nice product and low price</li>
            <li>Very powerful motor.</li>
            <li>I use this for a short stubble trim all the way up to side-burn cleanup, so the range is very nice.  </li>
            <li>It trims to 1 mm and is very powerful when fully charged.</li>
            <li>Very worth your purchase.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>I am new to trimmers and found this one easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>I waited to get this on special and finally got it at a great price with free shipping.</li>
            <li>pleased with the results, and it does a better job than my older trimmer.</li>
            <li>The older style norelco accuvac had a much better method for retaining trimmings via a removable basket and vacuumed up more of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect (it probably gets about 75% of the hair), but for the most part I had no other problems.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is incredible compared to other trimmers that I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>It is pretty quiet and the battery life is very good as well.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum catches a lot of the clippings, but you will want to clean the sink after trimming to keep your fellow sink users happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say in comparison to the older Norelco vacuum beard trimmers this is the best.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum on the unit works pretty good, and the led screen is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>It has nice features but the vacuum isn&#x27;t very strong so you&#x27;ll still make a mess&lt;</li>
            <li>This new model has a better design, is more comfortable, comes with two heads to guide the trimming process.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent Trimmer, Photos are same as the original, made of high quality material from china</li>
            <li>A clean accurate cut</li>
            <li>I got this because four years ago I bought the older version, and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and clean design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Working for me very well so far, holds a charge great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The unit charges easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, while this beard trimmer has some challenges, if you are a traveler who wants a shaver that doesn&#x27;t have multiple parts to carry, this one is adequate, and while it has some annoyances it is the best option I could find.</li>
            <li>My mind was made up after I read the 4 and 5 star reviews that pretty much confirmed that if you \\&quot;know how to glide over your face instead of dragging and digging it into your skin you will love this product\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li>Within a week, you&#x27;ll be able to fully enjoy what Philips should have built in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I have owned and liked older Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li>I get a quick and easy trim of my beard.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty good about this for 8-9 recharges and the unit worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Pro: charges fast and vacuums pretty good.</li>
            <li>Despite usually spending a lot of time on it at 18mm, I still need to go in sometimes and trim my face hedge with a Wahl, as it&#x27;s not always perfectly even (despite me shaving precisely how instructed).</li>
            <li>The variable trim lengths are super easy to adjust and to read.  </li>
            <li>I even shaved the whole head with it once just for curiosity and the result were pretty good.</li>
            <li>It gives a quick and easy trim and seems to have plenty of power and battery life.  </li>
            <li>Exelent beard trimmer not recomended for shaving anything longer will clog up and hurt you, very nice for keeping clean facial hair has my Recomendation.</li>
            <li>The plastic door is very flimsy and breaks VERY easily.  </li>
            <li>down side is that it is not as good at catching all the cuts hairs as perhaps I would like.  </li>
            <li>This works fairly well, but has a major design flaw: the guard to adjust length isn&#x27;t continuous, so the blade (at any guard length) can trim significantly shorter than you intended.  </li>
            <li>but if you own the t980 both the heads fit on it and work so will just ues that for mine new .</li>
            <li>The battery life is great and the vacuum is awesome, no more sink full of clippings.  </li>
            <li>Good led indicator for charge too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it would be better if the blade protruded out a little more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and trim the stubble nice and soft with no pain.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and quick to charge.  </li>
            <li>good quality, easy to use, charge holds for a week or so, overall acceptable qualtiy.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean out, I use a fingernail brush, and just takes a quick swipe.</li>
            <li>The vacuum built in is handy in keeping MOST of the fine stubble from getting on the counter.  </li>
            <li>As a satisfied owner of a Norelco T980, I was pretty interested in the idea of a replacement trimmer that was quieter, lighter, offered better battery life, and wouldn&#x27;t have any battery memory issues (the T980 used Ni-Cad batteries).</li>
            <li>Great battery life, long cord, cuts well.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this so far.</li>
            <li>While it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted, there didn&#x27;t seem to be a better option</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for three months with my original charge.</li>
            <li>The digital screen showing the setting and more importantly the battery level is also nice.  </li>
            <li>I received this yesterday and after using the Remington Titanium (POS) for the past 10 years let me just say this trimmer is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>Original revieew March 2014:   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep this, but I wanted to let others know that if you don&#x27;t need fast-charging, get the lower model, and more importantly, in terms of comfort, the contour-following comb is better than the fixed comb.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not, I&#x27;m sure, the best trimmer in the world I do have plenty of experience, and do know what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Setting is locked, so no depressing the comb with the application of pressure, so it&#x27;s the safest one yet!</li>
            <li>after using it for the first time I fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the Philips Norelco QT4070 so far.</li>
            <li>Twice now,  Not sure what&#x27;s the deal is with this, but it is inconsistent garbage for anything but perfect stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did my first trim at 12 mm and it was the one with the most missed hairs - and a lot of post-trim scissor work.</li>
            <li>I think Philips realized that everyone wanted the original trim guard, so they just started including both.</li>
            <li>The first lasted for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Yes, the 4070 now comes with the spring-loaded contour comb familiar to T980 owners; no calls to Philips customer service needed!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I am very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>First, the 0.5mm closest shave is not what I experience -- more like 1.5 to 2 mm on my stubble.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Some background why that is significant.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time and I&#x27;m pleased so,far.</li>
            <li>Have the original version of this item-can&#x27;t find the cord so I have to buy</li>
            <li>This feature SIGNIFICANTLY increases the ease of cleanup, which is this product&#x27;s saving</li>
            <li>It works ok, but doesn&#x27;t do exactly what I was expecting it</li>
            <li>Very glad I had saved the old case.</li>
            <li>it keeps the hair off my counter and he likes that it actually trims his beard successfully.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of trimming and the built in vacuum is easy to dump.</li>
            <li>Check first to make sure the rechargeable battery can be replaced.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure he likes it-- ESP.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend with a short beard and it is really nice!</li>
            <li>This trimmer delivers famously on the first one.  </li>
            <li>The QT4070 blade cuts very smoothly and evenly, much better than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I have had a beard/mustache for many years using lots of different trimmers but the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 7300, vacuum is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love love love the vacuum design.</li>
            <li>this is brilliant piece of kit if you cant be  botherd to shave just take it down to a five oclock shadow brill.</li>
            <li>In summary, this is fine and it appears the battery will last longer, but having used both, I would prefer my Remington with a good battery.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is fast, easy to use, easy to clean, handles trimmings well, and does a great job maintaining different beard lengths.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s not so good on fine facial features, setting length, and portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great to clean up my beard when I let it get too long.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, trims beautifully, and is endless adjustable and sucks up the trimmings perfectly.  </li>
            <li>hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally looking at norelco&#x27;s shaver line, but those are for clean shaves.</li>
            <li>he says the battery has a very long life, and the trimmer does a great job of trimming.  </li>
            <li>This means I cannot use the trimmer to clean up around my neck.    </li>
            <li>Norelco&#x27;s beard and stubble trimmer is clean.</li>
            <li>You will still have to clean out your sink afterward.   </li>
            <li>you have to clean up around the sink.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve got a clean trimmer and a clean sink.</li>
            <li>Gives a clean stubble length shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy that I decided to spend a few more bucks for the added features of this model.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve been using it so much that the battery wore out, and (no doubt thanks to your dashing good looks)</li>
            <li>but it keep the bathroom clean.</li>
            <li>This is the third beard trimmer I have owned and, by far, it is the best.</li>
            <li>And the door is better than the previous tray, which broke on me and required fixing with super glue, as another reviewer also experienced.</li>
            <li>You will have to spend your time to clean your sink nevertheless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a bit better than the old one and the QT4070&#x27;s noisier turbo mode, yet more so.  </li>
            <li>Then I lather up and clean up basically.</li>
            <li>job at reducing clean up.  </li>
            <li>I end up having to use scissors to try and clean up the areas this trimmer cannot handle.     </li>
            <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to have a clean shave though.</li>
            <li>But you still need to clean op your sink.</li>
            <li>but then there is the clean up.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t capture all of the hair, but it captures alot of it and makes clean up easier.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll still have to clean up the sink and counter afterward.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: 1/7/14, the door to clean out hair does not close.</li>
            <li>I had to clean the bathroom as hair was all over and returned the trimmer immediately.</li>
            <li>I would rather have a couple hairs to clean up then hundreds.</li>
            <li>but this device encourages me to keep a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to clean up at all.</li>
            <li>I like a clean line &#x27;tween my goatee and the rest, so it&#x27;s not my bag.</li>
            <li>look without having to be clean shaven all of the time.</li>
            <li>I am a guy who does not like a clean shave.</li>
            <li>This would get my 5 star if it were a bit easyier to clean out.  </li>
            <li>I took out the guide comb and tried to get a clean line for the mustache and the trimmer couldn&#x27;t cut any hair.</li>
            <li>but so far I am more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times and directions I go over my beard - there are far too many un-cut hairs.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t use water to clean</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t do that just use the brush provided with it to clean it.</li>
            <li>It did reduce the clippings in the sink and sped up clean-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its either this or manually clean up my sink which is 10 times worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean up now takes 2 min tops compared to 5-10 mins.</li>
            <li>The readout got stuck when I dissasembled the razor to clean the hair out</li>
            <li>Keeps the sink clean and</li>
            <li>From a design standpoint, I don&#x27;t understand why this gap exist because the hair will stick around if you don&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li>The vacuum/container keeps the area clean from trimmed</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t create clean edges, it won&#x27;t cut stray hairs...</li>
            <li>You will still need to clean the sink.</li>
            <li>I actually use the cheap Gillete trimmer/shaver for beard because that requires no charging and battery life is quite good.  </li>
            <li>I find I have to take it apart and clean 4 to 5 times every use.</li>
            <li>You WILL still have to clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>If you expect to not have to clean up any hair, this is not the product for you</li>
            <li>not convinient to clean.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t clean it with water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still having to clean my sink after every mornings touch-</li>
            <li>Does not cut as close as i thought, does leave an after shave shadow, you will have to shave with a razor after to achieve a clean look.</li>
            <li>since I like my beard trimmed close and clean</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to try it since my old one worked great for years</li>
            <li>Incredibly long-lasting Lithium battery has meant I&#x27;ve needed to charge it only after a whole month of use</li>
            <li>easy to use and neat, powerful, and precise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer/vac, but is missing some of the things that would make it an outstanding one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good or better than expected.</li>
            <li>Awesome features, overall good quality, love the vacuum and digital display.</li>
            <li>Very nice and the charge stays for a long time.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought the unit was for the adjustable length setting, which turned out to be very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked great during that single charge.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is nice and does well with getting most of the hair.</li>
            <li>The vacuum intake also prevents a good accurate markup.</li>
            <li>This does a nice job and vacuum gets 95% or more of the whiskers.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is nice and collects most of the hair.  </li>
            <li>The hight adjustment have a positive click to them and they lock in place, much better than my previouse Norelco Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I would give it five stars without hesitation if the claim that it &amp;#34;does not make a mess while trimming&amp;#34; were true.</li>
            <li>works great, vacuum catches a good bit of hair, and long battery life</li>
            <li>I still shave my face, but when I just want to trim around the edges with the razor, I&#x27;ll use this to whittle down to 1mm, and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li>easy to use, just have to find right position how to hold trimmer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to set the shaver for the right length and it stays locked while shaving.</li>
            <li>After many years of using a different brand, which did not trim evenly and could not hold a charge for even 24 hours, I am extremely happy with my new Norelco.</li>
            <li>Compared to any other trimmer on the market, I venture to say this is the most superior.  </li>
            <li>You can really control the length pretty good, better than most trimmers with different attachments.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean, and I love the digital read out.</li>
            <li>Oh and also it actually is not as bulky as it looks, fits very nicely in hand, and pretty light.</li>
            <li>, instead it&#x27;s right on this thing!</li>
            <li>They try to tell you that shaver doesn&#x27;t come with that part and that the part is for the QT4050, but it says right on their box that it&#x27;s included!  </li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>working perfectly   great battery life   very sharp and strong blades  </li>
            <li>Good value for not having to clean up clippings from the entire sink area.</li>
            <li>I liked my old trimmer, but it would not hold a charge and was no longer making clean cuts.  </li>
            <li>If you elect to clean it with water, I would advise being careful not to let water drop through the screen that leads into the vaccuum mechanism</li>
            <li>This version is head and shoulders above the older version - more precise trimming levels, sturdier filter screen to catch trimmings, just a more solid product and a very good price.</li>
            <li>Keeps his beard nice, short &amp; clean looking!  </li>
            <li>Based on the reviews saying the contour comb for a full beard as I have is not included (thanks to everyone for your accurate reviews!)</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer off amazon and it has been a pretty good product so far.</li>
            <li>Does great on general shaving, not so much on edging up however.</li>
            <li>Great service and product worked as expected.</li>
            <li>The settings seems to be accurate and useful.</li>
            <li>It was pretty good, bought it to replace a 2-year old QT4050.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY AS EXPECTED- COMPLETELY HAPPY WITH THE PURCAHSE.</li>
            <li>I keep my beard pretty short and for me this shaver works great.</li>
            <li>I would give the old one a 6 star rating, it was absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>My Wahl went about 6 months on its first charge and it was much more powerful.</li>
            <li>She does a better job and doesn&#x27;t charge much.  </li>
            <li>It says it will go to .5mm, that is true</li>
            <li>I have owned this for 20 days now without being able to get a straight answer out of Philips or their parts department.  </li>
            <li>The accuracy of the different settings is quite good.</li>
            <li>and it actually feels good to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; with it.  </li>
            <li>which by the way I loved until the day it found it&#x27;s way into my toilet...still ran it just was never the same!  </li>
            <li>update with full review after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>The battery still has a good bit of the origingal charge left.  </li>
            <li>, this model has several good features</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good about this trimmer.</li>
            <li>After much research, I decided to replace my battery operated trimmer with this more robust Philips.</li>
            <li>I really have had none better so this one gets 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li>I have used this product gently, and I really enjoyed it, but now it is a pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>length setting also has a good solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Sound fun?</li>
            <li>I had just as much hair on my hands and on top of the trimmer than in the hair catch.</li>
            <li>but thats true for all clippers.</li>
            <li>Most of them were corded and it was a real production shaving and then cleaning the area afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have a full beard (except for the neck), which I like to keep about 3 millimeters longer than \\&quot;stubble.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I really like how many choices I have for the beard length.  </li>
            <li>I was able to work around them (by using superglue) until the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.  </li>
            <li>Tapping the whole trimmer on the trashcan/sink is more</li>
            <li>Now on to what is not so cool.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy and would recommend it anyone that uses a trimmer regularly..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be more than a gimmick when I bought it, but my sink has been much cleaner since then.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts much longer, we&#x27;ll see over time, seems like the more you use it the battery seems to deteriorate.</li>
            <li>well and good, but hoping for a unit that will last longer than (under) 11 months!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The head has the widest range of lengths I&#x27;ve seen on any unit so far, and allows you to adjust 1mm at a time which is nice.</li>
            <li>The corded trimmer is much quicker and gives more even cut.  </li>
            <li>I would have paid more for one that had replaceable batteries and cutter units that were reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I really like this razor and expect to use it for many years.</li>
            <li>I love the whole concept</li>
            <li>for an on-the-go shaver, but doesn&#x27;t quite match up to a full kit of barbering tools.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about battery life on the go since I keep it plugged in most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Suction is not sufficient even after full cleaning.</li>
            <li>It collects virtually all hair if you don&#x27;t let the collection chamber get too full and brush off the filter.  </li>
            <li>I purposely selected the top of the line model because I don&#x27;t expect to make this purchase very often.  </li>
            <li>Time will tell if this is a true replacement for myT960</li>
            <li>I am loving this trimmer so far.</li>
            <li>The battery now retains a full charge as described in the literature and reviews.</li>
            <li>but I would be very happy if I could stop the engine that sucks the hairs</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: 5 days later, Phillips made good when the replacement trimmer arrived.  </li>
            <li>I have used it around tricky places such as my neck, and it serves you good...</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature was kinda cool, but I don&#x27;t see why it just wouldn&#x27;t always be on.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good trimmer that does what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>Although I have always maintained it neatly,  It is a full faced</li>
            <li>And it also sets it up for a full &amp;#34;smooth shave&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The battery seem to last though which is good.  </li>
            <li>really what more would you want from a trimmer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bad!&lt;br /&gt;(you always had to keep it on full power mode, i have no idea</li>
            <li>What started off as 1 week of use (10+ sessions) with a full charge ended up being two x 5 minute trimming sessions.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal I did when I bought the above product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a full beard for 30 years and have used Norelcos since the beginning.</li>
            <li>Many settings allow for a really customizable beard.  </li>
            <li>It is a dream come true for this type of appliance.</li>
            <li>I was also delighted, as pointed out in a prior review, that the mustache blade that came with the T980 works with the QT4070.</li>
            <li>I really like being able to dial in length to the mm</li>
            <li>While the button is held, the shaver ran, and it reported a full charge.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a trimmer who has a full beard.</li>
            <li>but if it means I&#x27;m cleaning up 1/2 as much hair as before that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you&#x27;re trimming a full beard, then this will work.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless the led length indicator is really cool</li>
            <li>Died after 8 months, will try to get it repaired through warranty but not hope full.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift to my son and he liked it while it worked, he liked it enough he wants another one.</li>
            <li>I have used it around tricky places such as my neck, and it serves you good...</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s a Lithium-Ion battery, so you should keep it charged full at all times to preserve the battery life.</li>
            <li>have a goatee and a full beard</li>
            <li>It is good for alot of facial hair and you can trim your hair as you like it.  </li>
            <li>He uses it all the time and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I had absolutely none of the problems that so many others have reported on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have a full beard 365 days a year, so I trim my beard</li>
            <li>View the full video review here: http://bit.ly/AmazonNorelcoReview</li>
            <li>good product only thing lacking is precision shaving.</li>
            <li>only issue I have with it is the close shave, it isnt as good as Remington</li>
            <li>I use it on a full beard, the contour comb set to 3 mm.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for over a month at a rate of 3 full face shaves per week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the battery is good for about two weeks with daily use.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance, I would have loved it except they didn&#x27;t even package the charger or the different style options.</li>
            <li>so there were no doubts in my mind that Philips Norelco was a good brand to go with especially the QT4070.</li>
            <li>Loved it initially.</li>
            <li>Have used several times and found this product has good battery life.</li>
            <li>- I use it on my neck and cheeks with a full beard.</li>
            <li>My man and I love this trimmer and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>Not a bad trimmer.</li>
            <li>So this is a good product with cool features such as the hair catcher where you can throw them out in the trash and there arent hairs all over the sink.</li>
            <li>This is not a BAD product at all.</li>
            <li>Not bad).</li>
            <li>Not bad,</li>
            <li>I think the vacuum is great idea, but it will need a better intake design and far more suction before it is really functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either they have changed the guards that are provided with the trimmer, or some people are impressively adept at injuring themselves and will probably die soon from walking down the street, or something similarly hazardous.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum function on this doesn&#x27;t work that great, my 12 year old Remington MB 70 that this item is replacing has a vac that works much better.  </li>
            <li>In particular the Norelco T980 was so wonderful that the sharp contrast between it and this product are part of the reason I&#x27;m posting this review.</li>
            <li>The adjustments are very straight forward and easy.  </li>
            <li>The height adjusts easily, and the readout is great, but you have to make sure it is set to what you want by checking the readout since the way the head adjusts isn&#x27;t as obvious as my last trimmer just by looking at it.</li>
            <li>It seems like there aren&#x27;t a lot of good dedicated beard trimmer options available right now, but I would avoid this one if possible.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the vacuum works surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>The vacuum isn&#x27;t as good as the T980</li>
            <li>The Phillips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard Trimmer is a good product.</li>
            <li>The vacuum seems indeed a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vacuum portion works good.</li>
            <li>The good here is the vacuum that collects trimmed hair.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is a good idea, but doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Our son loved the vacuum feature on this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this one and loved the fact that it has a self contained vacuum to keep hair from going every where.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works surprisingly well</li>
            <li>Vacuum feature is good, though don&#x27;t expect it to get everything.</li>
            <li>Cuts good, but returned it because the vacuum is nonexistent.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum function seemed good</li>
            <li>The vacuum collection is surprisingly helpful.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is not as good as I&#x27;d hope for</li>
            <li>Used the Philips Norelco T980 Beard Trimmer w/ Vacuum for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It had some deficiencies, and I am happy to say that they fixed everything for this new model.</li>
            <li>I must say that my new QT4070 has been just great so far.</li>
            <li>Vacuum isn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped, but it provides a great shave and I love the digital display.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to adjust and the number of settings that it offers.  </li>
            <li>I used to own the previous Phillips-Norelco trimmer model and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>precise range from 1 to 18 mm permits him to shape his beard easily and as he wants.</li>
            <li>Charging the battery is quick and keeping its battery charge longer than most is appreciated.</li>
            <li>The product came nicely packaged easy to open but had to be charged upon trying to turn it on.</li>
            <li>This is the only one I have found that easily and effectively gives me an even 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>The comb flexes nicely with facial contours and the length settings are easy to use and stay reliably in place.</li>
            <li>The adjustable guard is easy to use and the digital display is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Strong vacuum keeps the sink &amp; counter clean and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This trimmer isn&#x27;t perfect but it SIGNIFICANTLY reduces the mess from a beard trim to the point where its not hard to clean up what is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First: it&#x27;s easy to &amp;#34;override&amp;#34; the guide lengths.</li>
            <li>I have had a beard, and thus have had beard trimmers, for almost 30 years, so I have some pretty strong ideas about what a trimmer should and should not do.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: its pretty easy to make one of the combs work for face, head, body, whatever...</li>
            <li>However, it is worth the inconvenience since the quality of the cut is so much better than the Qt4070 and much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge and its functions were pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>It catches most of the hair where before I had to clean not only the sink but the counter top where the trimmed beard flew everywhere.</li>
            <li>The contour comb and dialable length settings make it easy to trim your beard to a consistent length.</li>
            <li>Like the easy way you can dial in the exact length of your beard (1mm to 18mm).  </li>
            <li>First, if you want the scruffy look, this is an easy way to get it and keep it.</li>
            <li>A month or two of 3-4 uses a week pretty easily</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for, sleek, easy to read number system.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is, I would guess, about 90% effective at capturing the hair, and the attachments are both easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Working from the neckline up with the top flat part against my skin with the comb lifting the hair and the cutters in the first line of attack, I got barber shop results in three passes, one with the setting on 18, and one on 16, and one quick fix-it trim with the comb removed (give it a good pull to remove it, slip it on with no force whatsoever when you have the right vertical angle).</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved this gift and so did I. I particular like that the vacuum catches most of the hairs</li>
            <li>the philips blades dont need cleaning or oiled they stay sharp all the time it also has a great length guide built in</li>
            <li>the razor works great and it keeps the stuble to itself unlike other one i had.</li>
            <li>works great, as expected!</li>
            <li>With that said I think it is a great trimmer for the price, don&#x27;t let other comments make you think otherwise.</li>
            <li>Other than that, quite happy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have experiences with other trimmers, but I can say I am perfectly happy with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>, the dial-operated hair-length control is nice; it&#x27;s easy to clean out the hair collection chamber; and it keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>works great ,cuts nice and battery last a long time</li>
            <li>A charge seems to last a pretty good amount of time and the ease of adjusting for trimming lengths is nice, but the other shortcomings outweigh these nice features.</li>
            <li>- This does an ok job of trimming for 5 o&#x27;clock, but isn&#x27;t that easy to get under the nose or nooks and crannies (as the unit is quite large), so you have to really work it.  </li>
            <li>Nice shaver from philips, the vacuum prperty works fine.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, metal &amp; rubber build instead of cheap plastic and is contoured to fit the hand.  </li>
            <li>A VERY PRECISE AN COMFORTABLE TRIM WITH NO MESS.</li>
            <li>The product is very good so far, used it just a 3-4 times, less friction, easy length set up, Vaccum heally helps, smooth on skin.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is very nice and makes the razor much easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>Nice smooth comfortable enjoyable new useful necessary</li>
            <li>I had the previous top end version of this trimmer and had it for many years before problems happened (mostly plastic part cracking/breaking).  </li>
            <li>The compartment fills up quickly and the overflow just sprays about your bathroom like mushroom spores.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for one month and found:  - The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature must be on 100% for this to adequately vacuum/trim my hair..... and even then...  -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really fast razor and easy clean up so shaving can be done while I wait for the shower to heat up.</li>
            <li>Better than the older model I replaced</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t lose any pieces, because it&#x27;s just one piece, and it&#x27;s super convenient for traveling.    </li>
            <li>My older Norelco T7500 was a reliable companion for many years.  </li>
            <li>This model is larger at the top and takes up more space while traveling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27; m sure they would love to charge extra for the power cord if they could get away with it.</li>
            <li>charge feature allows you to quickly charge the trimmer before leaving on a trip.  </li>
            <li>in that it lacks the travel lock, quick charge, and turbo functions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was still some mild shavings that found its way in my sink.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the blades don&#x27;t cut skin, or I&#x27;d be bleeding all over.</li>
            <li>So I tried it out yesterday and enjoy it (so far) even more than the T980.</li>
            <li>A tremendous time saver and always looking &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My old razor had one and it was very convenient, and also good for areas around your lips for mustache trimming.</li>
            <li>I like their older model better</li>
            <li>The comb on top doesn&#x27;t allow for an even trim, I find that no matter how many times I run the trimmer over my jaw line it still doesn&#x27;t trim at the same length.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I like my older one better, this unit will nick you if it can.</li>
            <li>Four stars because it includes the contour-following comb, which is more comfortable than the fixed comb which is attached when it arrives packaged.</li>
            <li>* Turbo mode to take care of business in quick order&lt;</li>
            <li>Super close \\&quot;stubble\\</li>
            <li>But if you like a tighter beard with more detail, this trimmer cannot function at the most basic level.</li>
            <li>Ok, first of all the trimmer works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I have older and cheaper Philips that shaves better than this.</li>
            <li>Keeping that in mind, I quickly run over my beard once a week with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>And for the most part it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>shaving unit seems okay on my first attempt, but it is just that it gets hot</li>
            <li>There is a nice battery indicator replacing what used to be just a blinking red light.</li>
            <li>I find it to be a worthy replacement for the T780.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;While my old Norelco head was easier to precise trim, this unit collects the beard stubble much better</li>
            <li>It is made from much sturdier material, handles easy and cuts cleanly.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly, and can also be used with the supplied cord.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t quite gotten use to the digital display yet, as the 7100 didn&#x27;t have it, but I am sure i will be glad to know the amount of charge I have when it gets close to dying on me.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement purchased by a (formerly) loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer works great, and sucks up most of the hair when you put it in turbo mode.  </li>
            <li>i purchased many trimmers, nothing like this..  purchased ones double and triple the price , you will not find any thing better than this!!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I think I got lucky.</li>
            <li>I took my trimmer out of the box (which btw comes with the contour following comb as well), plugged it in to charge while I read the user manual, and took it for a nice smooth drive....</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The guards removed quickly for shaping my scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 7300 &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; a lot more sturdy than the older model.</li>
            <li>Positives: it cuts evenly and quickly.     </li>
            <li>I like quick charge capabilities and LEDs showing remaking power.</li>
            <li>i definitely recommend to buy for your boyfriends/husbands ,  you&#x27;ll receive many kisses  :))</li>
            <li>Had one older one that I got in 2010, seemed more durable than this does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We even used it to do a quick trim of my husbands back/chest hair as we were headed to the beach.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>I prefer and use the more \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; comb which is what my older clipper had.</li>
            <li>Also, it does good edge work (and, apparently &amp;#34;manicured stubble looks&amp;#34;) with the attachments off.  </li>
            <li>The razor charges quickly and holds its charge.  </li>
            <li>I have had a beard most of my days on this planet and used many different beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li>After that, it charges quickly...</li>
            <li>I tried super glue, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I took my trimmer out of the box (which btw comes with the contour following comb as well), plugged it in to charge while I read the user manual, and took it for a nice smooth drive....</li>
            <li>and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li>keep my beard a bit longer than the hair on my head and the QT4070 allows me to quickly trim my my beard.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and seems to hold the charge well.</li>
            <li>If you travel outside the US often, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about charging this unless you are gone for more than 2 months or trim more than 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li>This does a decent job, but I was looking for more of a stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li>great to see how much battery is left too, just twist the wheel or remove the guard and it lights up the lcd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, Norelco&#x27;s warranty policy has provided me with two replacements.</li>
            <li>and it is simply adequate.  </li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;rogue hairs&amp;#34; that manage to evade the electric trimmer, but I like the ability to plow through all the whiskers quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, stubble is in fashion.</li>
            <li>Also the Quick Charge is better/great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product but the vacuum on the trimmer is not that good the Vacuum on the Old model was a lot better.</li>
            <li>Works great as a beard trimmer, but don&#x27;t expect much from the vacuum system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if I use it more often when my beard hair is shorter, the vacuum system works better.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works ok too and helps keep most of the hair from flying around as you trim.</li>
            <li>I really like the vacuum concept, though it doesn&#x27;t work all that great in application.  </li>
            <li>Works great and the vacuum makes clean-up much easier (no complaints from my wife about wayward</li>
            <li>The Remington MB200 design is better, but I really love the vacuum and lithium ion technology on this one.</li>
            <li>I wish that the vacuum function had more sucking power in order to get most is not all the hair that you cut.</li>
            <li>I think the vacuum works better than most people give it credit for.</li>
            <li>But the vacuum works great and it shaves very well.</li>
            <li>Really like the vacuum system and trims beard great.</li>
            <li>Even with the vacuum not being the best I still give this five stars because it simply makes beard trimming a snap</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Price is on the high end of most beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>It is also MUCH easier to clean!</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it holds a good charge and the vacuum works pretty good in it</li>
            <li>It works really Great for me, and all the features work very well...including the vacuum too!!!  </li>
            <li>The teeth barely if ever catch on your skin and get caught, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and, it&#x27;s pretty precise...</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the entire experience.  </li>
            <li>I use it for a beard on the 12 setting and it is very consistent even without the form-following comb.  </li>
            <li>I have had great success with other models but this one belongs in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of how functional it would actually be, and I&#x27;m happy to write that it&#x27;s done an incredible job!  </li>
            <li>I first noticed how flimsey and cheap it looked and felt.</li>
            <li>Both feel sort of cheap, but they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I could replace my dead Norelco T960 since it was the best beard trimmer I have used (and I have used several over the years).</li>
            <li>First of all, Philips Norelco was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty comfortable, lasts a while on a charge</li>
            <li>I bought this over six months ago and it is still running dependably on its very first charge.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and handles pretty well</li>
            <li>I would like to alert prospective users of this product that its electrical cord if one chooses not to use its battery feature that one ascertains that the plug that goes into the trimmer be well pressed into it so it does not get unplugged as it happened to me on my first two uses of this trimmer, fortunately it has not happened afterwards.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this trimmer as it is very similar to the T980.</li>
            <li>product looks goods, trims good (except for the upper lip), but I spent a good 10 minutes cleaning this after I was finished.</li>
            <li>This product looks goods, trims good (except for the upper lip), but I spent a good 10 minutes cleaning this after I was finished.</li>
            <li>Holds charge for a long time and does a good job at trimming.  </li>
            <li>over all it is a good product as long as it keeps working</li>
            <li>the charge stays good for a long time.</li>
            <li>(I use the 4 mm setting for my head, can&#x27;t say how good it is for long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth it to me to spend the 45 minutes in the bathroom shaving my scalp and face when I can use this awesome tool to trim down to a nice stubble in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The adjustment system works nicely and the vacuum catches most of the trimmings so it keeps things much cleaner .</li>
            <li>I wish the vacuum was a bit more powerful, but I&#x27;m sure that would&#x27;ve pushed the portability and noise levels to the limits of this structure.</li>
            <li>The system itself is much quieter than the older models which is nice.</li>
            <li>My facial hair is nice and trim and my sink is mostly clean.</li>
            <li>find that this thing is great if you want to cut down all the way to 1 day stubble</li>
            <li>It is great- just dial the length up or down for desired hair length.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, I had an older similar older Norelco I liked better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great product but not exactly show in the picture....!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and is very handy, you can carry it with a small bag.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>Pretty incredible little machine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a whole new world of enjoyable shaving he says!</li>
            <li>The vacuum is nice, but you´ll still have to clean your sink.</li>
            <li>If having a great vacuum is your main concern</li>
            <li>- The vacuum system does not work effectively, still have to clean up after almost every</li>
            <li>That said, I figured this new one would have to be a better design</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work any more, so I gave him the new one for his birthday</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not terrible but it also doesn&#x27;t live up to</li>
            <li>The new 3/4\\&quot; tall illuminated number makes much more sense in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they just keep getting better with each new model.</li>
            <li>This new one is so much better.</li>
            <li>Customer service was better this time - sending me a new unit</li>
            <li>good cut and the vacuum is what we both like very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great trimmer, and I highly recommend it, but I wouldn&#x27;t treat the vacuum as a deciding factor, it doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li>Just as I found on the internet reviews, consistent, powerful, accurate.  </li>
            <li>For years I was wonderfully happy with Norelco&#x27;s previous top-of-the-line model, the T980.</li>
            <li>But none the less, I&#x27;m still relatively happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the quick easy adjustability with the turn of a dial because I like to trim the areas directly around my mouth (mustache and soul patch area)</li>
            <li>It is lighter than my previous beard trimmer and has a great feel in your hand.</li>
            <li>Over the last 8 months, when I had a full beard, a goatee, or now that trendy 5&#x27;oclock+ stubble</li>
            <li>but it actually does a pretty good job of sucking in the beard particles and makes cleanup  </li>
            <li>The vaccum feature that catches hair is super useful.</li>
            <li>This is my third one in twelve years, and it does a pretty good job of keeping my beard and moustache trimmed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary - I only give the trimmer a three star because its performance is a long way from being what is advertised and or perfect.</li>
            <li>Also easy to get a straight line and trim moustache.  </li>
            <li>Its easy convenient and fast.</li>
            <li>I cut mine pretty short, I use the 3 or 4 millimeter setting, so with a good even cut</li>
            <li>but this is the higher model supposedly with much better battery life and much shorter charging time.</li>
            <li>I think this is a very efficient and easily used beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>The T980 cut more consistently but the OT4070 definitely does a more than adequate job.</li>
            <li>I like a very close beard which this product does easily.</li>
            <li>He said it&#x27;s easy to use and cuts really well.</li>
            <li>The cut hair storage compartment opens easily, making throwing out the hair a breeze (though the enclosed brush or a Q-tip make it much easier and thorough).</li>
            <li>The battery doesn&#x27;t last long but otherwise its awesome!</li>
            <li>had a very old Norelco Model and was a lot more effecient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A far better design would have been a trim head NOT with a flat, movable top, but with a single-piece, CURVED top, negating the need for moving parts to maintain contact...</li>
            <li>Every single time I shave this product does seems to leave a good deal of hairs without being cut forcing me to have to go over them with scissors.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good and the vacuum function works well.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works pretty good but do not expect it to pick up everything.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is also pretty good.</li>
            <li>The settings are just right, offering many length options and it is a plus to have a vacuum function so hair doesn&#x27;t go everywhere although, it vacuum doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job sucking in the cut hair.</li>
            <li>Sink clean up is still very much required.</li>
            <li>Also, he is not critical of this particular trimmer--he rates it as GOOD, and very likely as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li>Great results and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess in the sink</li>
            <li>I works great and reduces the mess created 10 fold.</li>
            <li>Same problem as many before me: batteries will not hold a charge!</li>
            <li>Says he can shave in 5 minutes verses an HOUR or more with his old Norelco shaver!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>but I find that I have to go over and over more times to get an even cut than with my old Norelco!</li>
            <li>The little Norelco beard trimmers keep getting better &amp; better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, the digital readout is nice, and the battery charge is certainly up for a lengthy trim job of hair, beard and body.  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job, better than the Sharper Image model I previously used until its battery died.</li>
            <li>Then the trimmings are more easily picked up by the moderate suction.</li>
            <li>that you need an extra step to get the advertised product but Philips has a very quick turn around to make sure you are satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Neither will this trimmer, with any of its accompanying attachments, effectively trim a scraggly beard unless you&#x27;ve been living in a cave without a razor for half a year or more.  </li>
            <li>After my first beard trim, I opened the vacuum compartment and found that it had collected most of the trimmed hair, although my basin almost looked like it was painted in beard hair :-).</li>
            <li>Good quality trimmer, no hairy mess to deal with, easy to clean,with good battery power digital meter lets you see how much power you have.</li>
            <li>It trims facial hair right away and does a pretty good job sucking all the hair in.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it as much as I keep close stubble and the stubble comb works just fine.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum itself does an ok job but gets clogged easily and doesn&#x27;t quite capture</li>
            <li>The vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up all the hair, but it picks up most of it!</li>
            <li>The vacuum for whiskers works better than I thought making for easy cleanup.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and feel it does a fine job.</li>
            <li>The adjuster to set the height is easy to use and the different heads come off easy to clean the unit.</li>
            <li>no bad surprises and the charger work both on US and other countries so all good</li>
            <li>first off the trimmer does a good job and the vacuum feature is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Norelco beard trimmers before and they typically are very nice.  </li>
            <li>I was floored by how powerful and clean this cut after using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>you know you will be chucking out in a couple years, or go with a higher quality unit with better construction and decent, available reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Other than that it does a good job, the hair trap thing fills up quickly.</li>
            <li>Tilting the trimmer up at all allows the blade to basically come in contact with your skin if you really pressed it, since there&#x27;s a huge gap in the guard.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this thing for a few months now and its really great.  </li>
            <li>for its primary function of trimming a beard,  it really  works quite well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need an LED light to tell me the setting</li>
            <li>It also looks very sleek and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fast, comfortable, I found none of the &amp;#34;sharp comb&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really fantastic shaver, and I really like it and recommend it to everybody.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trims real well and comes with the two heads now, smooth and stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From my experience of a few months its turned out to be a 5 star razor for getting a great stubble</li>
            <li>This is a great performing trimmer, with few drawbacks.</li>
            <li>I received the trimmer last night and was quite impressed with the neat packaging and the clear and concise instruction sheet that came with it.</li>
            <li>it was as smooth as if I used a straight razor.</li>
            <li>But the battery life is amazing only had to charge it once in a while..</li>
            <li>The cut quality is great, no problems with pulling or an uneven cut.</li>
            <li>now, it is quiet and powerful and trims my beard safely and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It does not shave much and you do not get that smooth face after you shave.</li>
            <li>They are very flimsy and made of cheap polystyrene plastic.</li>
            <li>This thing helps keep my amazing facial hair in line- no joke!  </li>
            <li>The solution is to always use a light touch, but really?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just get a cheap split leather pouch for it, but I really shouldn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because this is a nice trimmer overall</li>
            <li>Overall I have liked it.</li>
            <li>The tines on top of the comb are too soft.  </li>
            <li>I wish that it was like my old one, where the container popped all the way out, but all in an all, it&#x27;s a great trimmer and especially for the price!</li>
            <li>He says it trims everything better than his old one</li>
            <li>For longer lengths (taking sideburns from two inches to 23/32) I had to start off with a scissors and then use the shaver to even things out, which wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>or so it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but still useful.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not unhappy with it.</li>
            <li>Works great, love the vac feature, as does my wife who was tired of cleaning out the sink.  </li>
            <li>It is different, but if you slide the guide along your face instead of trying to stuff your chin into the blade slot, you will have a much more comfortable experience.    </li>
            <li>Though there were some negative comments most of them said the product is so good.    </li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer because I liked the fact that it had 18 different length settings.  </li>
            <li>This beard trimmer does have some nice features, like the length of cut setting and digital display.  </li>
            <li>The QT4070 is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>About once a week for the goatee, so I didn&#x27;t need a professional clipper and don&#x27;t use all that many accessories.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t promise you&#x27;ll get the proper comb in your box, but if you DO, it&#x27;s a really nice shaver.</li>
            <li>was so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This one is okay, but it&#x27;s loud and clunky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Turbo mode will make short work of any kind of grooming.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also rare to happen, but it does.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how effective it would be for those who might need the extra power.  </li>
            <li>The only nitpicky thing I would find needs improving is that it would be nice if it included a stand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve charged it only once ever, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>The digital readout is great for old eyes.</li>
            <li>nearly a year later it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li>, I plugged it in and charged it and the convenient charge level lights showed it was charged, and it was quite powerful without the chord upon use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I grew a beard just so I could use this....totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The setting display and overall LED display is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have over a day&#x27;s worth of stubble, forget about it.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>you can see, the positives are far greater than the negatives.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only reviewing this product for what I&#x27;ve experienced so far.</li>
            <li>Anyways, have not even used it yet, maybe it will be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>IF it has a powerful trimmer, because it does not have a turbo button.</li>
            <li>really nice thing is it only has two attachments - not the 10 or 12 things you have to keep track of.</li>
            <li>in all, this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is more important to me as I keep only chin hair and need to get my sideburns and around the chin hair just right&lt;</li>
            <li>you keep a beard - this is probably worth it.</li>
            <li>I believe it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>quality razor, was worth every</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>This one has the same design flaw, but only time will tell if they&#x27;ve used a more durable plastic.&lt;br /&gt;The QT4070/41 7300 feels good in the hand, on the face and moving through the beard.</li>
            <li>So far so good as far as build quality is concerned.</li>
            <li>This on replaces my old Norelco T980 - I have been looking for the T980 replacement for many months.</li>
            <li>fits nicely into a standard travel bag</li>
            <li>The philips Norelco, seems much better than my old Remington trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does come with both &amp;#34;guards&amp;#34; - and i liked the contour following one for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i had an old one used to provide better results</li>
            <li>It is a surely useful tool that goes over my expectation.</li>
            <li>cleaning out more frequently is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the most versatile and utilitarian beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>In the interest of deciding whether it&#x27;s worth it to spend the additional money, I will compare the two.    </li>
            <li>so far I can tell you already I&#x27;m going to love this thing.</li>
            <li>I reached out in desperation for Amazon&#x27;s website, where I found the Philips Norelco QT4070 and a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>This is no where near as good as my old one.</li>
            <li>So when I saw this product mentioned in GQ of all places, I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is significantly larger than my old trimmer but a great fit in my hands and works really well.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, the length settings are different in the two models!</li>
            <li>So far this one is even better.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have never had a more comfortable trimmer, with or without the heads.</li>
            <li>My old Remington does much better with it&#x27;s guard set on the shortest setting.  </li>
            <li>So it was rarely used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The suction function doesn&#x27;t catch everything though, but it&#x27;s still worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>The Remington does have one distinct advantage: close shaving neck hairs.</li>
            <li>Some of the most worthwhile money I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li>Still, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well, personally I would have liked to get something like 0.5mm when the cap is removed; but that&#x27;s not an issue at all.</li>
            <li>but I like my old trimmer better.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice improvement over my last Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li>Still a nice improvement over the removable collector on my last unit.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer is certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li>still worth the money...</li>
            <li>I must admit, as others already have, that the hair collection system was better on my old T980 but all in all</li>
            <li>While the trimmer is still usable, the door can come open on it&#x27;s own and sprinkle it&#x27;s contents in a clump in my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So the rechargable Lithium-Ion battery is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may be useful to know that the 0.5mm setting is with all attachments removed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few trimmers in my time, and this is by far the best</li>
            <li>The door to remove the whiskers is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>- Comes with useful attachment  </li>
            <li>But I do not think it worth $50 .Someone</li>
            <li>but my old one felt better and had a trimming attachment and a case which this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>However, whenever I tried to maneuver around angles of any kind (jaw, chin, even around the lip) the gap between the comb would be enough for my skin to make contact with the razor</li>
            <li>Much easier for maneuvering, better trimmer guard, cuts hair a lot shorter and truer to what I consider real stubble.</li>
            <li>I sent it in anyway, paid my own shipping costs, and haven&#x27;t heard back from them.</li>
            <li>I have been using beard trimmers for approximately 25 years and this is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>All in all, well worth your money</li>
            <li>exactly what I want,  holds a charge for a good long time.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>But I have many concerns regarding parts that are at the same time cheap &amp; over-engineered.  </li>
            <li>So far, this one seems to do a better job of capturing the hair trimmings.</li>
            <li>I rarely charge it and it keeps going on.  </li>
            <li>The popular Philips Norelco did not even last a year.</li>
            <li>so i think it&#x27;s worth having</li>
            <li>The T980 came with two blades, a wide blade that was used with the contour comb and was good for trimming your beard.</li>
            <li>it not covering the top of the unit completely.  </li>
            <li>liked the amount of hair it left on my face in the 1mm setting, and i like the feel of the hair</li>
            <li>Pretty cool</li>
            <li>The digital screen is nice and the battery display is a must have.</li>
            <li>While the pictures look nice, it&#x27;s made as cheaply as possible out of plastic.</li>
            <li>turbo button is nice and I always have it on so it has enough power to suck the trimmings up.&lt;br /&gt;I will always stick with Norelco beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>Even came with a blade guard attachment that you could use for your more sensitive bits.</li>
            <li>As a trimmer alone it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I will tell you this problem was more the fixed.</li>
            <li>It trims better than my old one and is faster as well.</li>
            <li>I also include a fresh bottle of Wahl clipper oil which is a must to maintain your trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and of course the 1 hour charge is super convenient and the digital display that shows the cut length is very easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though the vacuum does work fair enough, it leaves much more to be done on my part which leads me to think it just might be a gimmick after all.cleaning section has 17 steps?</li>
            <li>Though the vacuum does work fair enough, it leaves much more to be done on my part which leads me to think it just might be a gimmick after all.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with how well the vacuum works; if you trim at least once a week, it will collect almost all of your whiskers (unless you&#x27;re Robin Williams, or a member of ZZ Top).</li>
            <li>The vacuum &amp;#34;hopper&amp;#34; sucking up all the trimmings has made my bathroom far more tidy.  </li>
            <li>Settings for beard length allow for more precise trimming and vacuum function is a must.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the addition of the 2-speed vacuum accessory as it catches most of the trimmings.</li>
            <li>Having read several extreme negative reviews of this product I was hesitant to buy the shaver but did on the basis of the very good to excellent reviews.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it does a great job of trimming and has a large selection of lengths to choose from.</li>
            <li>whole operation lasted a maximum of ten minutes and was a lot of fun.d (give it a good pull to remove it, slip it on with no force whatsoever when you have the right vertical angle).</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature was especially intriguing to me.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is a nice touch</li>
            <li>the vacuum is really nice.</li>
            <li>Vacuum is a nice plus</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is nice and the fact I don&#x27;t have to deal with changing combs to get</li>
            <li>The vacuum is nice, but not a necessity.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done and the vacuum is nice.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is nice.  </li>
            <li>does the job, but not quite as effective of a vacuum as i would have hoped.</li>
            <li>Vacuum is nice but does not catch all hair.  </li>
            <li>It works well and because of the vacuum it keeps my sink nice and</li>
            <li>I like the vacuum, the LED height indicator is a nice feature as well.  </li>
            <li>the vacuum still not so effective</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is nice but not 100%.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the electronic display too (cool blue LED lighting) and I find the adjustment system (to adjust the length of the beard) easy to use.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>, I decided to give this handy dandy vacuum one</li>
            <li>I would have also liked it if the blades would protrude farther then the vacuum tube.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature grabs 80% of the clippings and is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>The vacuum function is a nice add-on, but doesn&#x27;t suck in all the hairs (I still have some fall into the sink).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice because we don&#x27;t get hair all over the bathroom sink since there is a vacuum inside it.</li>
            <li>Vacuum not as effective.</li>
            <li>He really liked the way it trimmed his beard, and how the vacuum feature worked.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is not 100% effective and hair still gets all over the place.</li>
            <li>The vacuum, though a nice concept, is positioned so that you can&#x27;t use the blade to outline your mustache, sideburns, etc...</li>
            <li>vacuum is nice.</li>
            <li>Tidys up the beard maintenance experience but have yet to experience a trimmer with vacuum that is as effective as those that just trim.</li>
            <li>The vacuum function was nice but it did not keep all whiskers from ending up in the sink.</li>
            <li>My man was very pleased with his new trimmer, we were both surprised that this system also has a built in feature that vacuums as they trim.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and fast my concern is without head</li>
            <li>I just had my own intentions when I bought it with a vacuum!</li>
            <li>The first one my husband has ever owned and it was easy for him to set it up for his beard and trim it to the length he wants.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s vacuum feature it should be easy to keep the bathroom clean!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s kind of a molded guard that prevents putting nice sharp edges around my beard for a clear shaving line.  </li>
            <li>Love the compartment that vacuums hair for no mess trimming</li>
            <li>Even with the vacuum capability, you&#x27;re always left with a sink full of hair, but it does a nice job of catching quite a fair amount in the little recepticle.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is great as well and leaves no mess</li>
            <li>This new is comfortable to handle, seems like it might be a bit sturdier, trims very well and adjusts easily.</li>
            <li>It does catch some hair, but It just seems to clog up and most of the hair ends up in on the counter top anyway like any other trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Picked this guy up recently and was excited to see how many ways I could put this to work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, as many, MANY other reviewers have stated, the trim head combs are flexible and not rigid.  </li>
            <li>The clean up is so much easier and it cuts much better than his old one, which he says used to grab and pull at the hair sometimes, so he had to go slower with it.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s okay, for a beard trimmer it has way to many length settings.</li>
            <li>Not the most powerful vacuum ever, but it does help pick up probably 70-80% of the trimmings allowing an easier clean up of fallen trimmings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shame, since otherwise it was rather excellent; though the vacuum feature was a bit gimmicky; I still ended up leaving stubble trimmings everywhere to clean up.</li>
            <li>and it does not bother me that the chamber isn&#x27;t the easiest to clean since I don&#x27;t have a need from it to be completely hair free between trims.</li>
            <li>Sure, you&#x27;ll definitely notice a reduction of hair falling on your sink, but you&#x27;re still going to have to do some clean up.</li>
            <li>Make sure to clean it regularly so it does not get clogged with air.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- holds good charge and overall does a decent job trimming</li>
            <li>So far works very well and trimming is very easy.</li>
            <li>Adjusting the trimmer is accomplished via a rubber coated adjustment wheel that is accessible on both sides of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stand on its own, and it takes up counter space when laying flat.</li>
            <li>Both of those were good with beard-length hair, but extremely inconsistent with stubble and my sideburns.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise (and relief) the contour comb was included in the original packaging.</li>
            <li>The recharge lasts a long time, and it just looks so stylish!</li>
            <li>, the cutter itself feels nice in the hand, although it must lie flat as there isn&#x27;t a vertical stand for it.</li>
            <li>The good news is the trimmer has yet to pull my beard - something other brands seems not to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Durability is good, other than the latch on the hair holding compartment</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t listen to the good reviews written here - I suspect that many of them are based upon the reviewers&#x27; initial thoughts, and not based upon their long term experience with the device.</li>
            <li>Good quality trimmer, other than one part:  </li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>Also make sure you clean it out after every use or the vacuum suction will be reduced.</li>
            <li>* Built in vacuum to clean up MOST of your stubble&lt;</li>
            <li>It just wouldn&#x27;t turn on right after shutting it off, I couldn&#x27;t get it to show any signs of life on the charger either</li>
            <li>The door for the compartment holding cut hair protrudes a bit on the right hand side.</li>
            <li>So sometimes to get every hair the right length you need to find the angle</li>
            <li>/are right for you.</li>
            <li>If you get it at the right angle, it shaves well.</li>
            <li>You just have to hold it at the right angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>but you have to angle it just right.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>The Trimmer Pro arrived right on schedule.</li>
            <li>I pulled my beard from day 1 right out of the box.</li>
            <li>The hair-trap door swings outward, pivoting from a hinge that&#x27;s located on the right side...</li>
            <li>You must align the fastening slots just right to get it to slip on.</li>
            <li>So I took the chance and that review was right.  </li>
            <li>Man up, get the right tools.  </li>
            <li>This is the right tool.</li>
            <li>and it does the job right.</li>
            <li>I provided the model and serial #, and she said they would ship me a replacement 405 right away....  </li>
            <li>, she checked their stock and said the [#422203617711] would go right out at no charge.</li>
            <li>so you need to stay right over the sink or trash can.</li>
            <li>You also end up scraping your face if you put it on the lower settings because it places the blade right against your skin.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if it could trim right under my nose.</li>
            <li>Now I can say I did the right thing.</li>
            <li>The feature I like is the hair collector, which collects the trimmed hair in a container right below the cutter so almost no cuttings end up in a wash basin or the floor.</li>
            <li>It seems like most beard trimmers rip out more hairs than they cut, and many times, you find yourself going over the same spot multiple times because they just won&#x27;t cut certain hairs.</li>
            <li>The variable trim settings are great--just take some experimenting to get the right length</li>
            <li>If you hit your lip with it your are not doing it right.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with the new trimmer/shaver and cannot recommend it well enough.</li>
            <li>* Light in weight,Trimming Fast, rapid Charge, easy to adjust the comb, 99 % vacuuming the trimmed hair, clear display,accurate, cord and cordless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it caught pretty much everything I didn&#x27;t pull off manually, and at the end the sink and surrounding area were hair free</li>
            <li>Low average at best.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it to turn back on and finished my shave, and the unit display showed the battery as full except for when it was showing me the \\&quot;E\\&quot; symbol.  </li>
            <li>First trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased and am completely satisfied so far.  </li>
            <li>First off it did not come with the advertised contour following comb (advertised on Amazon and on Norelco&#x27;s own website).  </li>
            <li>If the older models were available, I would trade the QT4070 in an instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>trim, fast and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light than the older model.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get much use because I have a job that requires clean shaven face.</li>
            <li>Charges fast, its clean since it has a trash compartment.</li>
            <li>And this one is a great improvement as I can finally trim my beard quickly and properly.</li>
            <li>If you are an avid eletric beard trimmer user then you would see that the guiding comb (both of them) comes in handy and can be used over several application.</li>
            <li>removable guide is a very nice feature, as it can be easily removed by pulling straight off of the trimmer from any height setting, and when placed back on the trimmer, is still at the last height you dialed in.  </li>
            <li>I hav used many trimmers and this one tops the list, its so easy to use, light weight, good battery life and less mess comes with this product.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to adjust, and a series of blue lights monitors the battery status.  </li>
            <li>I recently decided to grow a beard and this trimmer makes it very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It may take some getting used to until you get that perfect shave down, but once you do you&#x27;ll understand what you need to adjust for the future shaves.</li>
            <li>Cons -The vacuum to pick up hair isn&#x27;t the greatest and sometimes the area that sucks hair in will get clogged, but it&#x27;s an easy fix.  </li>
            <li>Blades are sharp, cuts cleanly without catching or pulling.</li>
            <li>He says the vacuum is pretty effective too.</li>
            <li>the vacuum part is sweet, works for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a fantastic stubble and beard trimmer from a well respected name in this category.</li>
            <li>it is a good shaver but the plastic filter holder should be removable for proper cleaning, over the time the hair and skin dust will ge to the filter... overall is a good shaver/trimmer for a daily use...</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this new trimmer so much....</li>
            <li>The vacuum is also more powerful and does a better job of pulling the hair into the catch chamber than the old trimmer.    </li>
            <li>for something better, worth to pay a little bit more.</li>
            <li>So Philips if you&#x27;re ready this find a way to put the brush in the handle of the trimmer like have a little spot that you could snap it in and out, and it would near perfect.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to use and cuts precisely with its multiple adjustments.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks of using this trimmer, I would recommend it to anyone looking for something easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>Most of the others were designed for &amp;#34;pseudo beards&amp;#34; i.e. stubble or intricate goatees and artistic facial hair.</li>
            <li>I love the vacuum that makes the bathroom sink clean up so much easier!</li>
            <li>Using the old blades improved the experience significantly and one of the blades was a special blade for close fine trimming which was not part of this new razor.  </li>
            <li>The blades do a fine job, and by the time they wear out I&#x27;ll just replace the shaver or get a new set</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal setting, it does a fantastic job trimming hair, and keeping any trimmings cleany vacuumed into it unit&#x27;s storage compartment.</li>
            <li>I never had the problem with the one this replaced, but the QT4070 goes one step further and has a nice solid click for your setting providing even more confidence that it isn&#x27;t going to inadvertently slip on me.</li>
            <li>Great idea - no more wiping the hair trimmings from around the sink</li>
            <li>The vaccuum feature works about the same on both trimmers, catching most (but not all) short hairs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of trimmers in the past 10 years and I&#x27;m happy to report that this trimmer is the iPad 2 of the trimmer industry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more quiet to run, battery lasts longer, and the digital cut height display is nice.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to get precise trim lines, and the turbo mode cranks up the trimmer speed and vacuum to the point where almost nothing drops</li>
            <li>The hair collection chamber gets full really fast.</li>
            <li>this was a big issue for me with my old trimmer, and I am more than pleased with this trim...</li>
            <li>This one has cool features like led lights and fast charge with LiIon battery</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great and holds charge very well (only charged it once so far</li>
            <li>this was a big issue for me with my old trimmer, and I am more than pleased with this trim...</li>
            <li>Normal skin tissue cannot fit into that gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>The Conair looked really nice and felt nice in hand (felt better than this Norelco), but it was awkward on the face.  </li>
            <li>This apparently now comes with both of the heads that many people said Panasonic should have included.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a cordless rechargeable trimmer, with quick charge, Lithium Ion battery for sure, with a vacuum and adjustable head that trimmed well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the average shaver, this trimmer strikes me as being good for all of two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver is nice and the lithium battery lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>The charge is long and the turbo is nice.</li>
            <li>The suction is adequate if the trimmings are not too large.</li>
            <li>, I did like the old fashion style AC plug and cord on the old one better, this new one has a huge plug that does not plug into the wall socket with the ornamental outlet cover in my bathroom and the cord is cheap.</li>
            <li>The vacuum does a wonderful job at reducing hair mess.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not overly impressive, the vacuum will not get all the hairs, but it does reduce the mess created significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hopefully it will last until someone makes a decent vacuum based replacement that doesn&#x27;t do more harm than good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vacuum feature, while somewhat gimmicky, does clean up a fair bit of the trimmed hair... but more on that in the cons below.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t expect to be able to get a full clean shave out of it, but it gets it down to a fairly minimal amount of stubble to be able to easily shave it with a companion device.</li>
            <li>but it does a decent job of trimming beards and when removed the guard it works great down to 0.5mm for that 5oclock shadow look.</li>
            <li>about every &#x27;nearby&#x27; model of Norelco will share the same charging system, but be sure to read the exact voltage/current specifications on the adapter to make sure you don&#x27;t rush the razor to an early death.  </li>
            <li>I would still buy this unit again, even over a new T980 if it was available.</li>
            <li>The new comb head on this trimmer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thought Phillips wouldn&#x27;t have a problem sending me a new part for free (seeing as it&#x27;s a piece of plastic).</li>
            <li>One review even said to call and complain to get the new cover for free.  </li>
            <li>I can live with it since the T980 is no longer available.</li>
            <li>After a week of light use (4 times for about 2 mins each time), I set the travel lock and made a trip to New York State.</li>
            <li>And the little vacuum feature is a great plus!</li>
            <li>Phillips customer service was easy to deal with and immediately sent me a whole new unit!</li>
            <li>It has an awesome vaccuum technology and can remove almost all of the hair without the cap, its an awesome trimmer; the only downside is that you have to try to shave with the trimmer upside down because the blades are not long enough so thats how you can get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>I also was a huge fan of the older T980, which finally gave out on me after many years of reliable shaving and trimming.  </li>
            <li>I had a previous model of this shaver, and loved it.</li>
            <li>I previously owned the Norelco T980 and loved it.</li>
            <li>In future, perhaps a trimmer operating with lower noise emissions would round it out to a perfect score.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What attracted me to this product was the fact that it seemed more solid and powerful than the Panasonic (the Turbo button does work) and like the Wahl had the one hour charge with the Lithium Ion battery.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is sleek looking and appears to be of good quality, but too early to tell if it will last the rigours of the guarantee period.</li>
            <li>It is great at sucking hairs up, the only reason I use it to get the majority of my unwanted facial hair off my face.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to maintain their beard on a day to day basis.</li>
            <li>Its great for back of the neck cleanup and facial hair trimming.</li>
            <li>These are all improvements over a trimmer that was good enough I would have bought another of the old one if needed.</li>
            <li>when I trim my beard I do typically trim a fair amount off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I have previously owned the 7100 version of this trimmer, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The trimming is very uniform and quick.  </li>
            <li>Far superior to my last Panasonic beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>the hair tray got full really fast, so I ended up cleaning it pretty often while trimming.</li>
            <li>None the less its a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light up numbers are kinda gimmicky, but are sorta nice.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t praise enough the vacuuming feature of that trimmer - just love it that I don&#x27;t have to clean much after it.</li>
            <li>I need around 4mm, and this 4070 make this a breeze to keep my blond shadow beard at the current perfect length (and if I get fickle and want it longer, a few clicks of a dial</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t take real good care of it, so after a few years the door to the clippings holder broke and the battery degraded to where it need to be charged prior to every use..  </li>
            <li>really annoyed that I threw away more good money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>good so far, it does not get close enough without the guard to do my head as I would like.</li>
            <li>I got a good trim the first time I used it, as I was able to apply techniques learned from 10 years experience with the Wahl Trim-n-Vac (the only other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used).  </li>
            <li>Every single man should own this product.</li>
            <li>The Phillips-Norelco turbo vacuum is noticeably more powerful, it cuts a lot closer, has a lithium battery and can be used with the cord.  </li>
            <li>Hairs still fall but not as many as you would expect so the vacuum is worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>use it on my head and an occasional beard.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature is great and works well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Philips Norelco, and have used their electric shavers for years, but what made this unit really stand out to me was the built in vacuum that captured a lot of the cut hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works great as a trimmer, but don&#x27;t rely on the vacuum system to capture all of your hair if you have thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum seems to be a bit more powerful too.  </li>
            <li>Vacuum - Well... to me this is more of an advertising gimmick than it is an engineering/design success.</li>
            <li>Amazing, the vacuum really works, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>This trimmer is great, the vacuum compartment contains the hair, the adjustable settings are a big plus compared with interchanging heads.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>In hindsight, maybe I didn&#x27;t work at it enough to get a full clean shave as most of my shaves are early in the morning when i&#x27;m rushing out</li>
            <li>Turbo button is great, it actually makes vacuum collection work!</li>
            <li>This new model is very powerful and I like the length calibrations.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but it still makes mess</li>
            <li>Another cool thing about this trimmer is how easily it pops apart and snaps back together for cleaning.</li>
            <li>It cuts clean and has pretty decent suction.</li>
            <li>I previously had a Philips Norelco beard trimmer that was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would give me a good tight trim, and this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no mess.  </li>
            <li>The only issue i had was the battery indicator not being very accurate.</li>
            <li>very fast</li>
            <li>Very Fast charging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery life is great - I charged it before a 3week vacation and had more than enough battery life to last the entire trip (using it about every-other day).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cup was replaced with a very secure door, so I don&#x27;t expect that to fall apart anytime soon, and there&#x27;s nowhere for hair to collect outside of the cup because there is no cup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer is very modern looking and can be operated cordless also.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy the trimmer from the actual Phillips website &amp; it only cost me $10-15 more, which I happily paid to get the actual working trimmer.</li>
            <li>Thank u very much for helping out.</li>
            <li>And the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Maybe that has an impact on my impression of this new one, but wow is this thing powerful and precise!</li>
            <li>: This is a fantastic product, much better than all the other options.</li>
            <li>As far as the trimming goes, it seems to work just fine</li>
            <li>so I spent hours researching amazon and other sites on the best beard trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li>The length adjuster works great and the vacuum picks up most of the clipped beard if the clipped length is short enough</li>
            <li>Early days but seems to hold charge just fine.</li>
            <li>I regularly clean the thing of hair with the brush, so I just don&#x27;t see how you stop this happening with normal use.</li>
            <li>does a good (no exactly clean shave) close up&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it tells you on the little led display in mm your cut length it also tells when to charge battery witch takes 1 hour for about 10 good shaves.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but works good</li>
            <li>I am using the second more narrow trimming head from my old trimmer as it fits and works perfectly with this new one.</li>
            <li>I have received the new trimmer since the original trimmer&#x27;s door broke</li>
            <li>And for me, if I have to clean the whole sink/counter for some hair it wouldn&#x27;t really matter cleaning it for all the hair.</li>
            <li>The static guard on the QT4050 meant I could never get anywhere near a close trim with it, always leaving me with a decent amount of stubble.</li>
            <li>If have to clean the sink of hair anyway, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s three times as much.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, the vacuum system gets nearly all the hairs, charge lasts long, the variable beard/stubble length settings work great too.    </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, and the early complaints about the screen pulling the beard hair seem to have been fixed.  </li>
            <li>If you are trimming a longer beard, or body hair, be aware that the longer trimmings can get jammed up in a wad at the top of the suction slot and get in the way of the cutters, so you need to keep stopping to clean them out.  </li>
            <li>It provides a perfectly even trim and the vacuum works very well to eliminate mess</li>
            <li>I use it hard and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Cons: - Large - Not for fine trimming - Buttons are not placed conveniently - Very Loud</li>
            <li>The high speed option is nice when hitting those extra hairy areas.  </li>
            <li>On my beard, the vacuum is marginally effective, even at high setting.</li>
            <li>The different adjustments is a nice addition, although finding that perfect length does take a few times unless you&#x27;re switching directly from another brand that does the same thing.</li>
            <li>the instructions are clear &amp; accurate</li>
            <li>battery lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and works as it should.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>But pretty annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I figured it opened on that side, but pulling it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>Mack.. I&#x27;m interested in ordering a QT4070/41, but there is a bunch of complaints as to whether the unit comes with a contour comb.</li>
            <li>: I totally understand your concern and will be glad to help you.&lt;br /&gt;Mack</li>
            <li>: Unfortunately, we do not have that information.&lt;br /&gt;Mack</li>
            <li>it has made his mornings so fast!</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just me, but this machine, while aesthetically competent and ergonomic, cannot seem to properly trim my beard.</li>
            <li>In short, the cover on top of the teeth that can be adjusted, is uncovered on one side and is a hassle when your trimming your beard.</li>
            <li>love it because it lets me keep a short stubble.</li>
            <li>The battery is pretty long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It gets pretty close, but not quite.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;ve been impressed.</li>
            <li>I have owned Philips Norelco beard trimmers since they first came out and this one does not deserve the name.    </li>
            <li>My husband used it once when he first got.  </li>
            <li>but I had to share this first.  </li>
            <li>It is a pity because he really liked it while it worked.</li>
            <li>At first I was turned-off by this remark for an item in this price category.</li>
            <li>Maybe the first models that Norelco sold did not contain this comb.</li>
            <li>At first I was leery about some of the reviews of this trimmer.    </li>
            <li>They were very helpful and ordered the part for me with no problems!  </li>
            <li>The girl said they have had tons of calls for this, so she knew exactly what part I was talking about.  </li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing this beard trimmer I read many reviews.</li>
            <li>The overwhelming majority of the clippings will be captured for simple disposal.</li>
            <li>Make sure you carry the charger with you until you know if you have the same problem.  </li>
            <li>Obviously doesn&#x27;t get it all but gets most of it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Amazon review.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple before, but this is the first</li>
            <li>bottom line is you want to trim exactly how you want and this one does.  </li>
            <li>your left with a lot more than stubble.  </li>
            <li>adjustment readout gives clear and precise trim</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li>Ironically, it causes more effort through the extra cleaning.</li>
            <li>Ironically, it causes more effort through the extra cleaning.</li>
            <li>This trimmer never fails to capture all the hair as I shave.</li>
            <li>(I think it has been assembled only their), It has so many advantages</li>
            <li>The QT4070 has the fancy digital display, the travel lock, and is somewhat more compact than the T-980,</li>
            <li>so you dont have to go over the same spot as many times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes me several passes to trim my beard, which I do once a week at most.  </li>
            <li>Would be higher rating if design allowed for closer trim under nose.</li>
            <li>I returned it and got the QT4050 which is a much better design that has the front teeth above the cutter.</li>
            <li>Okay, not a big deal, just turn it off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to give Philips the benefit of the doubt and say that this might have been a lemon.  </li>
            <li>simply didn&#x27;t cut all the hairs no matter how many times I went over it.</li>
            <li>First with scissors, then with a Remington, then Norelcos.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m making that claim about this trimmer while using the comb that came with the it; really don&#x27;t foresee having any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first replacement for the T980 was the QT4022.</li>
            <li>I hesitated at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;But my first impression actually trimming my beard (I first watch this helpful video to make sure I got the angle</li>
            <li>First off the battery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;ve added the digital display which is nice although i don&#x27;t really stray much from the 5mm setting</li>
            <li>As stated in most of the reviews above this beard trimmer no longer arrives with the correct comb.</li>
            <li>The first one died after about 10 years and the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge.  </li>
            <li>It seems to trim my face pretty evenly  and has yet to cut me.</li>
            <li>I rarely have to do much cleaning up and share a bathroom with a roommate</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok because I just look at the side measurements to see what the actual setting is.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>However, the default comb hasn&#x27;t any moving parts and will likely be a bit more durable over time as the contour comb eventually looses its spring ability.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to keep burning out after a while, first not holding a charge but still usable when plugged in, then giving up altogether.</li>
            <li>so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>, is that here is a free consumer insights resource (something companies pay millions for) which seems to be completely ignored by the people at Phillips Norelco.</li>
            <li>but fortunately the one from my old trimmer still fits.</li>
            <li>Also does not give consistent cut.</li>
            <li>Before I used the trimmer attachment on my electric shaver, which was ok but only cuts close to the face and throws hair all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;d be willing to cough up 80 bucks for a do-all bread&amp;mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li>I paid for the upgrade features like 1-hour charging and two comb options, but now find I would have been OK with the features of the QT4050 because the 4050 has only the desirable contour-following comb but 8-hour charging.</li>
            <li>Comfort should be your first priority.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH AGAIN!</li>
            <li>I know there are hair trimmers out there that offer every possible attachment, most of which end up in a plastic bag underneath the sink.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use, and the first embarrassing trim</li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s what I get for trying to expect a higher level of quality out of Norelco&#x27;s QT4070/41 beard</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t see exactly where I was trimming  </li>
            <li>With such a better performance, I don&#x27;t understand why _all_ trimmers and electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t use lithium ion batteries.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now used this trimmer for several months and the battery life is more than sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>People have different face shapes anyways :)  </li>
            <li>This is the first beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>In this condition, I was able to trim most of my body with only perhaps a third of a charge.</li>
            <li>I had a similar version that I bought 6 years ago, and I was fairly satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It worked well for the first couple months, but now it won&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li>The holding mechanism has completely snapped off and I have to secure it with a rubber band now</li>
            <li>I had to go over my face ten times to get most of it cut.  </li>
            <li>Works great and the battery last long.</li>
            <li>If you are trimming facial hair it should catch most of them while using to shave a childs head</li>
            <li>and i trim my beard much more often because this device&#x27;s variability can get the actual length i like.</li>
            <li>but after exactly one year the problems started (and the warranty of course was expired).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The battery seems ok (second time around).  </li>
            <li>Funny, the Peanut sells for $40.</li>
            <li>I have been using this trimmer for about two years and it runs as well as it did the first time that I used it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going on the first charge.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have time for the warranty return route when the first one died</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I had another Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer that worked the same way, but it had two heads on it that enter changed</li>
            <li>One was a smaller head that I could trim with better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend to those who can&#x27;t be bothered to shave on a regular basis and prefer the elegantly disheveled look as I do.</li>
            <li>first is the inability to replace batteries.</li>
            <li>the first problem is still here.</li>
            <li>Having used numerous trimmers over the past 15 years, I have seen improvements in trimmers but am still looking for the perfect one.</li>
            <li>For the first year I could charge this unit and get 4 or 5 uses out of it.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a better photo of the clear plastic compartment cover but as you can see it is just cheap plastic and that tab will break off sooner or later.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shaving products for years and had been satisfied with all but the last shaver I bought.  </li>
            <li>first pass</li>
            <li>bought the beard trimmer because I wanted better control over my facial grooming.  </li>
            <li>I thought at first</li>
            <li>First off I don&#x27;t go for the stubble look</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>I have also found that it is better for trimming my sideburns, especially in the whisker/hair blend zone.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>At first glance, it looks like the trimmer did a good job, but, then, I noticed that the hair length was fairly uneven at anywhere between 4 and 12 mm.</li>
            <li>the blue light looks cool.</li>
            <li>First, the guard that sets the trim length is varying distances from the trimmer so, depending on the angle that the trimmer contacts your skin, the trim length changes.  </li>
            <li>However, it is missing one key feature - a very close blade to trim the edges and make them perfect.  </li>
            <li>The cut is even and consistent.</li>
            <li>This is a really a quality product!</li>
            <li>I wish i had stuck with something smaller and cheaper for that matter that would do a better job.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this Norelco!!</li>
            <li>This one is fancy, digital, etc but the issue is it tends to throw hairs out the top.  </li>
            <li>It definitely catches the majority though, a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>But close enough most part of the beard.</li>
            <li>The first time I trimmed my beard</li>
            <li>Cleaning the clippers themselves isn&#x27;t much more work than \\&quot;standard\\&quot; open clippers and the wad of clippings that it catches will surprise you.</li>
            <li>However the T980, sadly no longer available, had a rigid pivoting guide that completely surrounds the blades.  </li>
            <li>Like many of you, I&#x27;ve gone through countless shavers/trimmers.</li>
            <li>I fussed about this one at first, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like this\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>However, I got in touch with Philips customer support first.</li>
            <li>However, it is my first one</li>
            <li>I always read the 1 star reviews first and look at the percentages of 1 star reviews.</li>
            <li>Not charging the first time - gave me some trepidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li>unit works better than the earlier version.</li>
            <li>I hope it will outlast my first one.</li>
            <li>With the comb mystery solved, I tried the product today and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what is advertised.</li>
            <li>My husband, really likes this trimmer!  </li>
            <li>The first one with the vaccum lasted me for years.</li>
            <li>it without any hesitation ;)</li>
            <li>This is my first beard trimmer that does not require a change of guards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it worked, it was stellar.</li>
            <li>so if you have a short beard it will probably get more.  </li>
            <li>reviews on this site are probably from use within the first month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It grabs some of the hair but missed most of them which left them in my sink.   </li>
            <li>had higher expectations for this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it did the most amazingly fast beard removal, cleaned up my mustache, and barely a hair in the sink.  </li>
            <li>well i still bought it anyway and used it for the first time today .</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The charging display is a bar graph type giving you a much better idea about the state of charge than a simple blinking LED.</li>
            <li>First off, the photo of the trimmer is MISLEADING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works pretty well but causes difficulty when trying to cut areas of your beard closer when you use the trimmer without the adjustable guard.  </li>
            <li>I have tried various trimmers over the years and this one I just love.</li>
            <li>First, this review is strictly about this product as a stubble trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first was the Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble</li>
            <li>Its my first trimmer that I didnt buy off some cheapo discount rack.</li>
            <li>the perk is ...that it vacuums your hair in the first place.</li>
            <li>take that into account, the comb did seem pretty uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how it does with more routine maintenance of facial hair.</li>
            <li>This is my third Norelco and I have been pleased with each trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth having this device for that purpose alone, because it isn&#x27;t very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beard is pretty thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 18 mm trim length is one of the longest I&#x27;ve seen, and since I recently decided to grow my beard longer, I needed something that gave me more margin for error.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a vacume to catch extra hair, so I love it.  </li>
            <li>On time exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer itself works pretty well, including the vaccum feature that supposed to keep your sink and house from getting hair all over the place.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer that I use at least 3 times a week for my beard and hair.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, all the rest have the guide (as I have traditionally seen) wrap around the razors so that this issue doesn&#x27;t arise at any beard trim length you&#x27;re going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>height adjustment is solid and won&#x27;t be a problem / adjusting as you trim, but I still haven&#x27;t been able to get it to \\&quot;be</li>
            <li>Also there is one more version of the same brand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first cordless trimmer</li>
            <li>Being able to assign numbers to trim levels can help you achieve the same look over and over.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>The battery so far has held up nicely and I rarely have to charge it...not like charging is a big deal anyway.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately as I have to post the unit back to US from Canada, the postage fee will chew up most of the refund.</li>
            <li>Guarantee\\&quot; they will first make you wait 3 weeks</li>
            <li>make sure all your facial hair grows</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>Especially as it fills up more, the Turbo setting becomes more necessary.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>BUT, the reason for my 2-star rating is simple, it doesn&#x27;t retain it&#x27;s ability to cut for more than 1 month.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a beard trimmer and it lives up to expectations.</li>
            <li>the first one lasted over 5 years.  </li>
            <li>and I decided to let it charge overnight to make sure it would last the 5 days I&#x27;d be on the road.  </li>
            <li>However, the length is pretty &#x27;hit and miss&#x27;.</li>
            <li>it without any hesitation ;)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I&#x27;m no longer at the hotel</li>
            <li>I doubt you actually need the turbo-boost, so it might be better to save and get</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of trimmers and these really are one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>and I definitely prefer the one that most people on here complain that theirs did not come with.  </li>
            <li>Great readout of how long you have the clipper set to, the construction just feels sturdier than the Remington, it&#x27;s now in daily use for me.</li>
            <li>Some trimmers require you to charge first.</li>
            <li>I found myself using the comb on the lowest millimeter setting and finishing my entire beard after removing it just to be safe.</li>
            <li>I hope this will get better as I learn to use it differently</li>
            <li>First one sent was DOA.  </li>
            <li>The first one was DOA.</li>
            <li>recently I saw this \\&quot;updated\\&quot; model on sale and figured that maybe they&#x27;d improved the design, or that I&#x27;d just make doubly sure to treat this one with kid gloves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this, I used the comb that came installed.</li>
            <li>I will always contact the manufacturer in the future to make sure the battery can be replaced, and if it can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll buy another brand.</li>
            <li>My first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I have ever owned (owned 4 in the past different brands).</li>
            <li>This My First trimmer</li>
            <li>(which is probably why they included it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>but not least a REALLY cool feature of this trimmer is it&#x27;s travel worthiness becuase</li>
            <li>It worked better when I only had a goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Works great until the door that holds in hair slowly chips away.</li>
            <li>The trap for the hairs really works and has saved a lot of cleaning time on the bathroom counter!</li>
            <li>Every time I use this trimmer it leaves a lot of hairs without being cut no matter how many times you retread at different angles.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco had the head attached with a hinge, which made it easy to clean but also completely removable if needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, considering how happy I had been with the performance of the T980, and my intended use of the trimmer for achieving stubble, I dismissed the negative reviews about trimming longer hair and purchased the trimmer anyway.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to clean, and tells you how much charge is left.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FIRST USE OF A BEARD TRIMMER .I</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still very please with my purchase and would say it&#x27;s worth the $52.40 I paid on amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to maintain a longer length and not be contained to shorter lengths only for my beard.  </li>
            <li>My T980 has finally bit the dust after many years of reliable servers -</li>
            <li>the motor is louder and higher pitched.</li>
            <li>after just two months of moderate use the battery would not hold charge any more.</li>
            <li>I found the product to be unsatisfactory in many ways and sent it back for a refund after a couple of trials.</li>
            <li>After many different purchases that were not satisfactory, this razor hits the spot.</li>
            <li>First it was the LED number system</li>
            <li>Most outlets in China have the universal adapter face built-in already.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought that the contour trimming comb works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;Not able to do closer trimming and in smaller areas.</li>
            <li>The door for chamber seems more substantial than prior model.</li>
            <li>First time, Philips replaced it for me, no problems asked (hence 4 star review).</li>
            <li>this product is recommended to me and it performs exactly is it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>The adjustable head on this beard trimmer was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Not bad , but expected more.</li>
            <li>in all a good clipper, will see how it holds up over a few years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a fairly good capacity, and shaves well, although it may take a few passes if your hair doesn&#x27;t grow all in one direction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for a few months now and it is a good product even though learning curve wasn&#x27;t easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These trimmers are great they charge super quick and last for a considerable amount of time on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly, doesn&#x27;t leave a mess, feels very well made, is adjustable to a very precise degree, charges quickly, and</li>
            <li>Now I have little in the sink and most is in the trimmer for easy disposal in the trashcan.</li>
            <li>This shaver does an excellent job of trimming beards down to a wide range of lengths.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, only four starts because I was hoping for a bit more from the vacuum function--it gets about 80% of the hair, which is certainly better than nothing--</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my nephew who seemed to really like all the great features on it, especially the vacuum!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is great - adjust in 1 mm increments, holds a charge a long time and the integrated vacuum feature is a hit with my wife.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased it, I was more interested in the trimming aspect; I had no interest in the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li>Vacuum works pretty well, catches most hair; probably about 80 to 90%.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works ok, better when the cut settings are low because it allows more hair to fall into the vacuum opening.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly, adjusts to the height of the cut well and the vacuum is super!</li>
            <li>love this trimmer, gives me the look of that afternoon stubble all week long without any real maintenance...just a 1 min quick buzz in the morning.</li>
            <li>So all in all its probably the best and maybe the only vacuum trimmer on the market, norelco also makes another vacuum trimmer</li>
            <li>This replaces a Remington vacuum trimmer that died after many years.  </li>
            <li>But, the Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, sure does come close.</li>
            <li>vacuum mostly works -</li>
            <li>It does the job and the vacuum system works to a degree (better than nothing).  </li>
            <li>I have read before that beard groomers which feature a vacuum are nothing more than a gimmick.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works much better on this shaver than the 980.</li>
            <li>Love the vacuum, although it (of course) doesn&#x27;t catch everything.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a vacuum to catch the hair.</li>
            <li>I like the fact I&#x27;m able to change the heights of beard trimming &amp; vacuum system intake assemblage.</li>
            <li>The door to the vacuum storage is ok</li>
            <li>I received my QT4070 vacuum beard and was extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the vacuum system would be able to handle it.</li>
            <li>vacuum feature is more of a novelty than anything.</li>
            <li>I guess I have thicker beard hair than most, so the vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped for.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it has a built-in vacuum to hold 99% of the hair.</li>
            <li>The vacuum does work, but mostly on shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Philips should work more on the vacuum part.</li>
            <li>The Vacuum is ok, as even with a day to day cut</li>
            <li>i love the length settings, tons of them, sets and holds well, holds a charge well, and the vacuum does suck up some of the hairs.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature worked better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Vacuum mostly works.</li>
            <li>Vacuum catches most the hairs.</li>
            <li>I love the vacuum it has on it</li>
            <li>In this model I would say 90% of the hair gets picked up from the vacuum and the turbo boost gives a much better trim.</li>
            <li>The vacuum makes up for it, but I need to use it on Turbo to collect most of the clippings.</li>
            <li>the vacuum is okay</li>
            <li>Bumping this up to four stars, with the fifth reserved with the hopes of one day having a better vacuum.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature collects about 75% of the hair, which is more than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>The vacuum function could work a bit better.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature works, and I&#x27;m glad to have it,</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature catches most of the clippings.  </li>
            <li>I love it with the vacuum.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum on this product takes care of most of the whiskers you chop off.  </li>
            <li>and I love the vacuum</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is what convinced me to go for this one over the one with titanium blades (or whatever), and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>The vacuum does an okay job but some facial/body hair will still escape and have to be cleaned up.</li>
            <li>not terrible, and like the size thing, could be overlooked if the vacuum worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vacuum is a life saver. :)</li>
            <li>Vacuum works ok.</li>
            <li>I love the vacuum.</li>
            <li>Love the vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li>The vacuum doesn&#x27;t get all of the trimmings, but it gets most of them.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is more than just a gimmick.</li>
            <li>Vacuum collected most (not all) of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new Norelco since my old one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum doesn&#x27;t suck up any where near as much as it should the guard at the top bends too easily when pressure is applied and it catches on my beard.</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice, even trim, blending different length cuts smoothly and precisely, and avoids the mess of whiskers falling all over the sink.</li>
            <li>and I love the vacuum!</li>
            <li>Love the vacuum!</li>
            <li>My main concern was that everyone said the trimmer cut their lip, but further comments said that the second (more traditional) guard was now supplied and so it was great.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, it works well, and seems powerful enough.</li>
            <li>It simply plowed through the beard like it was butter; super smooth, no nicks,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the super turbo mode (I guess if you have a REALLY burly beard?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mostly works OK, but cannot trim moustache near the nose, have to use other means.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this brand in earlier grooming products and the current model is far superior!  </li>
            <li>Norelco even but in a second more powerful setting, but the standard power level works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>a full charge and brand new, you might get about 10 - 20</li>
            <li>This trimmer really doesn&#x27;t work at all if you try to use it without the guard, the angle just isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to speed up the general trim.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I see how it could easily snap off if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>As a man who&#x27;s been trimming his own beard/hair for the past decade (ladies, if you see a balding man at the hairstylist that man is quote obviously RICH given today&#x27;s prices for a trim)</li>
            <li>This has been problematic since I would often get lazy and let my scruff grow out and then trying to shave would not be a pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li>Overall it seems like a very good design (I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a month)</li>
            <li>In general it&#x27;s great because before I had to deal with cleaning up a lot of hair in the sink and now the cleaning is very minimal.</li>
            <li>feel not as good as older model, vacuum less powerful or as easy to empty , but love quick charge and turbo feature.</li>
            <li>This particular one looks much sturdier and I really liked the fact it has a vacuum to it.  </li>
            <li>Norelco Beard Trimmer provides men the ability to maintain clean facial hair whether it&#x27;s a stubble, goatee, or full beard.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer now comes with the newer trim attachment which is apparently much better designed than the former large toothed attachment.</li>
            <li>Generally it&#x27;s working nice, but for me there some major problems:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Nice even cut and better than average short beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>The longer setting is nice for other body hair as well.</li>
            <li>There the trimmer lies flat, waiting for a more dignified home.</li>
            <li>You make ask yourself why I don&#x27;t just use hair clippers but the other nice feature on this is the vaccum.</li>
            <li>days after I originally purchased the trimmer (10 days after the guarantee ended), I got an automated email from Philips asking me to complete a survey and product review.</li>
            <li>Bought this one because of all the listed features, the other reviews made it seem like a nice trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>other thing I will say is while the vacuumm feature is nice</li>
            <li>It has a flat top which is a separate piece that pivots on a spring-loaded hinge.  </li>
            <li>the the vibration was of this trimmer, given how powerful and effective this little trimmer is.</li>
            <li>But I clean it over the trashcan now, instead of sending all the hair down the sink, so that&#x27;s better for the plumbing.</li>
            <li>It fits in the hand nicely and hardly makes any sound when turned on.</li>
            <li>The neat part about the vacuum is that it pulls the hair away from your skin, which actually makes it easier to get a good shave on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As some have mentioned, the standard comb for this trimmer isn&#x27;t great, but as mentioned in some other more recent reviews, mine in fact came with both.  </li>
            <li>They added a big bright digital display.  </li>
            <li>Which is great, but be careful of the door that you open when dumping the hair.</li>
            <li>Well, to everyone&#x27;s Great surprise, I left the bathroom looking like a drowned, mangy, disease ridden mutt.</li>
            <li>It is easy to empty and clean.  </li>
            <li>It charges very quickly and holds its charge for sometime, enough for multiple uses over more than a week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously though, I&#x27;ve used other trimmers that are no longer available which had better vacuum suction, but since those are no longer available, just buy this one and wipe the sink.</li>
            <li>When I used my old trimmer (4 setting), a lot would come off and my beard would look clean and even.</li>
            <li>i take it off completely as i like a clean shave, so its a nonissue.</li>
            <li>trim length dial was convenient and easy to use, and having the digital length value was a plus, but this was only mildly better than the manual adjustment I have on my existing trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loud has hell ( wife hates it)&lt;br /&gt;- not washable which i think is a deal breaker as it is tricky to clean after use.</li>
            <li>buut razor usually takes 2&#x27;3 passes over a given area to get good consistent trimming.</li>
            <li>While I love this product, I found that it was missing something important.</li>
            <li>You used to also be able to get a much closer shave with that attachment, and I would use that for my final pass.  </li>
            <li>I found this one to hold it&#x27;s setting better and really like the digital battery readout.</li>
            <li>Only real difference is the turbo mode and it&#x27;s sexy look.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer works very well, love the ability to adjust the height to all the different lengths.</li>
            <li>I was very reluctant to purchase the current product for fear it would not be any better.  </li>
            <li>have a beard trimmer from braun that lasted for longer than I can remember, but the battery is dead and I was looking for more precise trimming settings, so  </li>
            <li>To clean it out I take it outside and give it a quick blow with the leaf blower.</li>
            <li>The QT4070 does come with the contour following comb, which is truly the best of the two comb options for me at least.  </li>
            <li>But it really fell short in many ways which is why i had to return this product.</li>
            <li>Some guys in here really know their stuff about these, so read their reviews for more technical details.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have a beard trimmer from braun that lasted for longer than I can remember, but the battery is dead and I was looking for more precise trimming settings, so I thought it&#x27;s time for a change.</li>
            <li>The trimmer with length guide is better than the combs and will help the overall performance of the unit as a whole.</li>
            <li>Not too loud but then again with that kind of power you want it to be silent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal stiffer and doesn&#x27;t seem to flex enough to get down to the level it&#x27;s supposed to to let the blade cut right.</li>
            <li>The older unit had a little basket that pulled out, which also had screens on the side of the basket, keeping the airflow going, so it would vaccuum effectively until full.  </li>
            <li>And it does collect shavings very nicely, very easy to empty.</li>
            <li>this is very easy to use, a well made product for the money spent.  </li>
            <li>More power, better vacuum feature, ability to use it plugged in if battery is low (older model didn&#x27;t allow that).</li>
            <li>Maybe this is typical of all such trimmers, or maybe I have to practice more, but I can&#x27;t recommend it as a stand alone option to good old scissors!</li>
            <li>At best, it might be a 50% reduction in mess, but more likely it is somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 - 30% less hair falling to the sink/floor</li>
            <li>The thing that amazed me about this model is how much lighter it is, but with more suction on the vacuum.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum suction isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>The vacuum mechanism worked reasonably well and sucked up most of the hair cuttings (about 80%).  </li>
            <li>The battery life is good, lasting me multiple shaves (I haven&#x27;t counted exactly, but I really only trim once a week, so I imagine I could easily go over a month without charging).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I really did love the QT4070 as a trimmer and for its vacuum function.</li>
            <li>Suction is okay, you still have mess to clean.</li>
            <li>So overall the product seems to be of reasonable quality and does exactly what it says it does, trims all kinds of hair safely and without too much hair dropping on the floor.</li>
            <li>I liked the old T980 little better, but for me the new Qt4070 is functionally equivalent.</li>
            <li>The vacuum option was a great idea, but it is make shaving more difficult specially if you remove the cap.</li>
            <li>this will be great but there are many other trimmers that will do just as good for half the price and have better cutting accessories.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works good but remember you are buying a trimmer with a vacuum not a Hoover with a trimmer.</li>
            <li>The bay is easily accessed, if not slightly difficult to open without fingernails.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of listening to the positive reviews on this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The depth control locks positively through a wider range of adjustment than I think I will ever need.  </li>
            <li>have nothing but positive things to say about this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I know there is a lot of positive feedback (it fooled me</li>
            <li>/&gt;That was a positive experience since they made a no-hassle warranty replacement of the unit.</li>
            <li>It vacuums up the hair as I use it with no mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li>No mess or clean up when you are finished shaving.  </li>
            <li>I still shave standing in the shower so that there&#x27;s absolutely no mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>The vacume catches about every hair and there is no mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>No mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>I always had to clean up a little hair afterwards and a bit more</li>
            <li>Every time I use it I have to either grab a scissors or an older trimmer that did come with the right attachment to finish up the job.</li>
            <li>My first pass left a fair bit of hair in the sink, but this is partially because I filled up the vacuum chamber quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I always use the higher level as I don&#x27;t see any reason not to and it really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cutting action is excellent and precise.    </li>
            <li>This works pretty well for trimming your beard, but doesn&#x27;t work very well for edging or on your head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few different trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>it is pretty much just what I needed.</li>
            <li>So sure, the battery died during a long period of non use and no charge.</li>
            <li>i would say it&#x27;s my first one, but Nevertheless - i&#x27;m very Satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The end result looks pretty much like I used a cheese grater</li>
            <li>Charge-up time is pretty fast</li>
            <li>I have bought it for gifts for other people because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>Pretty much as advertised.</li>
            <li>I give this 5 stars because it does exactly what it is described to do, and does it very well.</li>
            <li>first when I started using it, I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>Other than a smaller chamber for hair that requires emptying far more frequently, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It is a pretty reasonable trimmer i found.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t just that it&#x27;ll trim while it charges, but it&#x27;ll run on any voltage just like pretty much all cell phone and laptop power supplies.  </li>
            <li>The charging cycle is so long (use &#x3D; 2-3 x per week), that I don’t know how many MONTHS it goes between charges.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I do not know if it is just a fluke that it was included with mine, so be ready to take a gamble on it if you need it.</li>
            <li>When I first got this it worked very well for about 3 months</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good stubble shaver, so as usual I go to amazon to get opinions.</li>
            <li>had good luck with Philips Norelco in the past.</li>
            <li>The vacuum actually works really well in it, and it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>With the adjustable length attachment on it, it&#x27;s nearly possible to get the right angle to get it to even cut any hairs at all!!</li>
            <li>the vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch all hairs, but most, which is more than I would have expected.</li>
            <li>The best part is the vacuum feature where I have not had to clean up a single mess.</li>
            <li>This was as advertised and when used was sharp and the vacuum worked great.  </li>
            <li>At best, there is SLIGHTLY less hair in the sink compared to a typical beard trimmer or hair clipper.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one I have owned, the first one worked fine, however, the  plastic clip where the beard hair is caught, broke, necessitating the replacement.</li>
            <li>My husband says he&#x27;s never used a better trimmer and is thankful to be rid of an older model he&#x27;s held on to for the last decade!</li>
            <li>It shaves down to a nice &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; length.</li>
            <li>My last Norelco trimmer died and I purchased the QT4070 and it is better than the older model I had.</li>
            <li>After more than 10 years using a Braun Exact 6 Universal, I was in the need of a new beard trimmer because Braun discontinued the supply of spare parts(battery and blades) for this model.</li>
            <li>It gets it down to a fine stubble, but for a smooth neck you&#x27;ll need an additional razor.</li>
            <li>I consider that to be a positive thing though, as an easy open hatch would be prone to opening by mistake.</li>
            <li>While they may not have a vacuum to clean up the trimmings, they wont leave you wishing that the vacuum they did have was doing more then just blowing hot air!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>many different sizes 1-10 that lights up in a nice big red LED</li>
            <li>While there is no mention of this practice in the accompanying literature, nor does Philips Norelco endorse or mention such use of this trimmer for that anywhere on their website that I can find, it is still a very capable tool that I have found fit for the job.    </li>
            <li>I bought it after reading a number of reviews on a number of different sites and came to the conclusion that it was one of the most highly recommended products in it price range.  </li>
            <li>I think they figured that the vacuum being better was the main thing and on paper,</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers I was replacing an older model Norelcom vacuum trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I was especially interested about its integrated vacuum system, one of the main reason for choosing this model.</li>
            <li>the vacuum chaimber saves the need for laborious clean up while the option for plug-in electrical or battery powered operation offer a choice of powerful operation modes.</li>
            <li>Pretty hard getting a good stubble with this.</li>
            <li>The width of the blade area is more than sufficient for face and other areas (more on that later).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a stubble trimmer, and I was reluctant to buy this one after reading all of the reviews, but there really wasn&#x27;t any other great option, so I finally just bit the bullet and ordered this one.  </li>
            <li>Its a really good trimmer, but like many other wrote the door to the vaccum chamber broke after a few months so that feature is gone.</li>
            <li>I mean, it gets a majority of the hair, which is nice, but you still have to clean the sink.</li>
            <li>If you use it correctly and know the right length to trim everything down to then this trimmer can be very accurate at giving you an even shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome trimmer, replaces my old Norelco, but many more features.&lt;br /&gt;Large digital height indicator prevents stupid mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Cuts perfectly even and the vacuum function actually works (my old one had a vacuum also</li>
            <li>The vacuum is an excellent feature that completely eliminates the mess I had to deal with while trimming my beard and mustache with an older trimmer.</li>
            <li>The battery power is also very decent with option of plugging in and using as well.</li>
            <li>This also means that I cannot easily trim my upper lip, since my nose blocks the front edge of the guide.    </li>
            <li>It opens easy with just a finger nail to open the door.</li>
            <li>It took a lot of arguing about it before he agreed, so beware, its not so easy as \\&quot;an extra step\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>cleaning is easy and the fact that it has no door is nitpicking in my opinion,  I open it, shake it and brush it</li>
            <li>doesnt get everything but enough to make cleanup really easy.</li>
            <li>It has a very decent battery and lasts quite awhile without a charge.  </li>
            <li>Easy to open and</li>
            <li>Smaller cutter teeth don&#x27;t pinch and cut skin as easy (not recommended for your privates without the guard).  </li>
            <li>This is a nice upgrade to my previous Philips Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li>First girl could not tell me anything but try to give me a coupon to get me to buy it from them, finally got a supervisor who confirmed the contour comb for beards is NOT included.  </li>
            <li>Works really well with several improvements over the older version that I&#x27;ve had for many years.  </li>
            <li>easy to use though with the mm specific dial,</li>
            <li>Makes getting various lengths easy</li>
            <li>when i trim the long part of my beard it works quiete well,  if the battery did not start dying so fast,  the vaccume probably gets95% or more of the hair.</li>
            <li>I had a previous model of this trimmer and really liked it.</li>
            <li>The compartment is easily removable and placed back with ease.</li>
            <li>and * definitely* found that the normal guard was better for me.  </li>
            <li>like that the collection part is now hinged so easy to open.</li>
            <li>The Phillips website says \\&quot;Contour following comb for a precise and even trim\\&quot; as the first line of the highlights for the QT4070.</li>
            <li>The digital display is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This definitely does the trick &amp; easy for him to use.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to return this and get my money back, but neither Amazon nor Philips make it easy to return this for a refund.</li>
            <li>I own the two previous models.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of nice adjustable trimmers out there for half this price.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product, better than any other vacuum clipper on the market.</li>
            <li>Digital length indicator makes it easy to set and verify length, even without my reading glasses</li>
            <li>The motor is strong enough to cut even the thickest hair in one pass.</li>
            <li>And the vacuum function really does capture a good deal of the clippings, making a lot of a mess to clean up in the sync.</li>
            <li>Battery charge is long enough and over all the unit is of good quality</li>
            <li>Battery seems to last a good long time.</li>
            <li>This new one improves on every single element of that one, which is rare for most products, so I had to give it five stars.</li>
            <li>The vacuum definitely catches some trimmed hairs but there are many that are not caught and you still have to clean the sink after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>It is large and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li>I bought this item purely based on the feedbacks.</li>
            <li>This one certainly isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>Kinda large for trimming a mustache</li>
            <li>After seeing the product in person, that is pure fiction.  </li>
            <li>It helps, certainly, but does not have the strength to catch everything</li>
            <li>Making this user-replaceable would have been smart.</li>
            <li>It certainly does what it is made to do.</li>
            <li>As others have stated there is a large gap between the blades and the housing of the trimmer</li>
            <li>but I think they may have changed that since my one certainly did; i.e. I received both trimmer guides in the box.  </li>
            <li>The noise level is certainly acceptable.</li>
            <li>The size is somewhat large for a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It has a large gap in the combs across the front of the trimmer blades, which just looks like a disaster waiting to happen.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this again and certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Like others said, if you angle the Stock trimmer head a certain direction it can jab you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It has certainly helped.</li>
            <li>so it stabs you and allows certain areas to trim too closely.  </li>
            <li>Two separate heads - one for getting close to the skin for a stubble appearance and the other to extend outward to trim your beard &amp; stache - even gives a clean smooth haircut.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it now comes with two heads, the sharper of which is not bad and the other is just fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The included double-ended cleaning brush seems suited for the task of brushing out the screen in the vacuum debris chamber, but also looks as though it will be easy to lose.  </li>
            <li>The beard remains uneven no matter how many times you go over it but wait!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vacuum is ok if you are using it for stubble or short beard, but it you are using full beard expect hair to be present in your sink</li>
            <li>it captures all the trimmings in a nice compartment and avoids the mess.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars because it does a nice job of minimizing the mess; but it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it.  </li>
            <li>the vacuum option makes  for easy beard and hair disposal................</li>
            <li>The vacuum stopped working very quickly.</li>
            <li>trims beard and mustache easily and the vacuum works.</li>
            <li>apparently wasn&#x27;t included in original release)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And to have the vacuum built in so that all the hairs are easy to dispose of when you are done shaving and trimming.</li>
            <li>The vacuum suction is strong, although when I use it on &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; some bits of hair do flick out of the comb.</li>
            <li>stars only because of the stiffness of the beard guide, but even that is something I can live with, and I hope it gets more flexible with use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, my wife bought me a new one for Christmas last year, and in my opinion, it is better in every way but one than the 980.  </li>
            <li>But compared to my previous trimmer which left stubble all over my sink and surrounding areas, it works great.</li>
            <li>all that i thought it would be but still worth the price since it easily adjusts to a wide variety of lenghts of trim</li>
            <li>I was so loyal to Norelco for the success of the T980 that I bought this product in an instant without thinking about it - what a mistake!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold in the hand, narrow and light and maneuverable.  </li>
            <li>So you have a date, and you need to trim that wild mountain man beard down to something that looks more civilized?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really strong and fast, and doesn&#x27;t jam like smaller trimmers do.</li>
            <li>This is by far superior then the previous model.  </li>
            <li>It easily trims to a variety of lengths, and the battery last much longer than you&#x27;ll probably need it to.  </li>
            <li>The unit charges quickly and has a useful digital battery indicator.</li>
            <li>The trimmer helps my beard trimmed tight and nice.  </li>
            <li>First off having a nice solid plastic body will be a plus, as there aren&#x27;t the metal grates anymore to get bent and rub against the vacuum motor blades.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected good quality ear trimmer with the  vacuum</li>
            <li>this trimmer is great if you like 5 different options to get the same exact length beard: really short stubble.</li>
            <li>Just great, except that the vacuum feature is far from adequate to avoid a mess on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>: it provides a decent, consistent trim, charge lasts a long time, it charges quickly, good adjustment function/display, vacuum function works reasonably well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I had found this Norelco trimmer sooner as it functions slightly better than the Panasonic with its vacuum and because the guard locks in place with the turn of the dial (the Panasonic&#x27;s guard would get bumped out of place sometimes, although I think they also have a new model with a dial to fix that).  </li>
            <li>I would say it is even better than the old Norelco, as I sometimes would get a nick on setting one with the old trimmer, and I&#x27;ve not nicked anything on any setting with the new trimmer.    </li>
            <li>The new one is &#x27;space aged&#x27; compared to the 2005 model and clearly retains the attributes of a good product.</li>
            <li>The convenient read out when adjusting the comb head makes trimming different parts of my beard (that might require slightly different lengths) easy and accurate.</li>
            <li>It will charge, trim and travel just fine though you may spend some extra time cleaning it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may work just fine for people with a 3/4\\&quot; beard or longer, but do not attempt to achieve an even, short look with this model.  </li>
            <li>I have successfully replaced batteries on their shavers, but their other products are essentially impossible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regular mode, you&#x27;re probably fine, but I always use Turbo for my beard.</li>
            <li>The Norelco Vacuum needs slightly longer beards, but was great for trimming when I grew me beard out while camping.</li>
            <li>However, I feel that the trim is much more consistent than other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I think the standard comb works fine for 3mm stubble trim.</li>
            <li>That may not seem like a big difference, and that&#x27;s probably why the product pre-testing made Norelco think this trimmer was fine...</li>
            <li>Does a fine job overall.</li>
            <li>It usually barely doesn&#x27;t get charged all the way from the time it takes me to trim, then clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li>As for myself, I don&#x27;t necessarily need that fine of an adjustment</li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears from many, many previous reviews that this trimmer had arrived with only  \\&quot;Stubble\\&quot; trimmer\\&quot;, and not the \\&quot;Contour\\&quot; trimmer.  </li>
            <li>you only plan to use this for a year, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Once you pop off the comb, you just can&#x27;t get close enough to do that fine tuning you would expect from a trimmer.</li>
            <li>4 years ago I bought an older version of this as my first amazon prime purchase.</li>
            <li>It does what it says it does...give a nice stubble, but there is no clean line trimmer on it</li>
            <li>this is a very high quality beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>For me this was not a problem it is a very high quality product</li>
            <li>Since she couldn&#x27;t get me the part, she&#x27;s now shipping me a full new trimmer, brand new, in the box.  </li>
            <li>if tight trims aren&#x27;t important to you this is otherwise a fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li>It holds it&#x27;s charge for a veryyyy long time, it feels sturdy and well made in your hand, the LED light is bright and clear, showing you which trim setting you are using, and the vacuum traps nearly all of the hair you have trimmed.</li>
            <li>Adjust to different size is also easy and the digital display is pretty cool to look at.</li>
            <li>To get a good and even result, it is best to trim the same areas from at least 3 or 4 different directions, as the comb is not very fine and doesn&#x27;t catch all the hair.</li>
            <li>The position displayed on the little screen is a nice plus.</li>
            <li>This is a nice trimmer, but the little latch that holds the trimmings broke after a month.</li>
            <li>The adjustable length option is nice but a little flimsy.</li>
            <li>I do love the vacuum feature that provides adequate suction to get the massive majority of the hair.  </li>
            <li>A nice little beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I encourage you to give it a try and experiment a little to find your own technique to deliver the results you want.</li>
            <li>I have this trimmer since last summer, it works fine and does it&#x27;s job very well, reason I give it 2 stars is battery life, which lasts 10 minutes maximum, with turbo on 5 minutes</li>
            <li>but it might be fine for someone who just wants to keep a very short stubble.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do in an efficient, quiet and clean manner.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s always so worried about making a mess in the bathroom, so I thought this vacuum shaver would be a great idea.</li>
            <li>and the vacuum works great at keeping mess to a minimum.</li>
            <li>also very good buy cant go wrong with this</li>
            <li>It greatly reduces the mess thanks to the vacuum, but does not get 100% of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>vacuum, finely adjustable increments, cordless --</li>
            <li>The trimmers head is good for trimming but if you want to get a clost buzz, you have to work hard to get the angle of the trimmers blade to your face.</li>
            <li>The large plastic guard does make it challenging to trim directly under your nose and line up my sideburns, but it is doable by using the unit and specific angles.</li>
            <li>The adjustable height is nice for trimming facial hair to a uniform height and the vacuum is effective at capturing the majority of the hair and not leaving a mess in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>(I have been using a Philips shaver for many years and never had a problem with it - this one seems a little bit more fragile because of the LED display, but still looks solid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer, but the vacuum function does leave a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t apply pressure, the trimmer just glides on top of my beard, not cutting anything; if I do apply pressure, the tines warp and I get an uneven trim.    </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great trimmer but on the lower levels it can leave my beard looking somewhat uneven.  </li>
            <li>The QT4070 is a huge improvement:  Congrats to Norelco for finally employing rechargeable battery technology that isnn&#x27;t obsolete by the time the trimmer leaves the factory.  </li>
            <li>accept that it vacuums up the hair which is really not that amazing of a feature because of how loud it is because of the suction.</li>
            <li>The battery and length display are a huge plus, and take the guesswork out of how much battery is left or if it is locked into the correct setting.</li>
            <li>Recommend 1) pulling off the cutters and tapping out the hair after every trim and 2) more thorough cleaning of the motorized parts (with a rag or something) and adding fresh lithium grease every few months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cost that much.  </li>
            <li>You were very helpful and spot on.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the feedback.</li>
            <li>I really like the features</li>
            <li>He said it does not cut or hurt him and it also goes over dimples and curve lines gently.</li>
            <li>not so much mustaches...</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>This makes the teeth be uncovered on one side and cuts the beard to a much shorter trim.</li>
            <li>and it cut really close.    </li>
            <li>you need to look around the web when ordering - really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Will cover whole head on 1 charge or whole body ymmv.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-no real 0 setting, have to use a razor to trim non-hair zones</li>
            <li>Nothing is going to get 100% of the hairs, but this one does really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really see the point of \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode, but having it there doesn&#x27;t hurt anything.</li>
            <li>From now on I&#x27;ll be more careful.</li>
            <li>This provides a precise cut to those who require such precision (not me).  </li>
            <li>Excellent cutting blade, as you would expect</li>
            <li>I like how it puffs out my beard as a real beard.</li>
            <li>Very well implemented.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I purchased the QT4070 this evening and after using it I&#x27;m absolutely dismayed at the design of the guard.</li>
            <li>I did not have to speak to a supervisor as some others have had to do, and the whole process took about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Probably would opt for a lower-end device if I were to repurchase as there really isn&#x27;t much difference.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vacume door is ready to break very disapointing  </li>
            <li>I save so much time now with pro results.  </li>
            <li>It has more length settings and cuts very well and the MM length display is much more useful then a dial with meaningless numbers on it.</li>
            <li>The problem is basically a gap on the front side of the trimmer that doesn&#x27;t keep the blade away from your face like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the comb has very plasticy, flimsy feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>In my opinion, a precision trimmer isn&#x27;t too much to ask for considering the price and the issue with the contour comb</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t demand much from a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Thanks to reviewers here</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand.  </li>
            <li>Why they don&#x27;t automatically provide this comb to anyone who wants it is beyond me.</li>
            <li>Given that without part #422203617711, this is a faulty product that puts the customer in danger of hurting himself, a responsible company should have taken this product off the market.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Norelco.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather just trim in the shower where I don&#x27;t have to worry about it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>As a hairstylist I expected a bit more.</li>
            <li>Within an hour the trimmer was fully charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Worked 3 times, now I get a yellow flashing light when I attempt to turn it on.</li>
            <li>If I wasn&#x27;t paying attention, the guide would drop two lengths and I&#x27;d end up with a much shorter cut than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about the guide, and haven&#x27;t really had any issues.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, get about 85% of the hair.</li>
            <li>Straight up no BS review.  </li>
            <li>The charger works well and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;They took some steps forward with this design but the gap in the comb(s) is a real issue for me.  </li>
            <li>: Minus one more star - This design is terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the package it looks like a real quallity product..</li>
            <li>The blades on this one, for some reason, really aggravate my skin.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is being precise, which is what you want with a beard trimmer goes out the window.  </li>
            <li>The recipient said it worked very well</li>
            <li>However, after years of use it no longer held a charge for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Not so much.     </li>
            <li>It does make the shaving experience much cleaner n</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t have the turbo feature or the \\&quot;best trimmer on the market\\&quot;, but you will not run the risk of stabbing yourself as one reviewer has said.</li>
            <li>Is that really too much to ask?  </li>
            <li>It works but you can&#x27;t really always achieve the length you select.  </li>
            <li>Once it was ready to go</li>
            <li>I disconnected the charging cord, followed the instructions, put on the Trimming Comb, set the length I wanted to try, and was ready to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Really vacuums all the hair, leaves no dirt</li>
            <li>The charge has held very well and the product still works just like out of the box.  </li>
            <li>my choice would have been much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So the straight razor came out...</li>
            <li>but she also wants to ravage me every time she enters the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I like the variance in the settings and the fast recharge time.</li>
            <li>The comb it comes with was absolute junk and messed up my beard.  </li>
            <li>The LED screen battery indicator is very usfeull.</li>
            <li>Really, what else can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Despite the name, the QT4070 really isn&#x27;t a mustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately Amazon&#x27;s return policy allows me to send it back</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much).</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any issues using the blade guard for trimming body hair- works very well.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d estimate 1.5mm is the absolute minimum.  </li>
            <li>Charges fast.</li>
            <li>As someone who wears his hair at a stubble look, this is very welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stock non-floating guide that comes with this unit does indeed appear like you should be more careful</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the features, but I wish it had interchangeable heads.  </li>
            <li>So for me this product works really well.</li>
            <li>a trimmer it works very well, but you will be using rubber bands and duct tape to hold it together.</li>
            <li>Got this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not shaving well.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to many shaving rounds and then use another machine to achieve the expected result.</li>
            <li>Knowing now what I do, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with a stubble capable trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It charges reasonably</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it really does not do a &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t even really suck in hair to help trim</li>
            <li>(though helps a bit)&lt;br /&gt;  attachment comb is to coarse\wide so don&#x27;t really separate hairs well</li>
            <li>What I really needed was a beard and mustache trimmer</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Panasonic ER224S.  </li>
            <li>What would it have taken to design the bottom of the unit so it stands up straight?</li>
            <li>thanks alot, Norelco.    4)</li>
            <li>I got a lot of quality mileage out of it and was very please.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even shave very close.  </li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t say much about the travel lock</li>
            <li>I also found that it didn&#x27;t make much difference how I held the unit against my skin.</li>
            <li>The AC unit is very compact too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vacuuming doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I really like this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>However the lid for the compartment that collects the hair is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>The hair catcher doesn&#x27;t work very well, so I end up cleaning up the hairs after every shave anyways, and the lengths are very inconsistent.</li>
            <li>I want it to be uniform, the blade guard is supposed to protect you from trimming to much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the swinging door design as much as I like the \\&quot;hair cup\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It does pick up about 80% of your hair, but you&#x27;ll still be cleaning up the remaining 20%, so it really doesn&#x27;t save you much</li>
            <li>Not anymore, thanks to this Lege&#x27;.</li>
            <li>and it can go from a very close stubble to much longer.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with cheaper trimmers for years and never got a quality trim without really working at it....  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their stubble.</li>
            <li>the suction on the vacumn really works.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the digital display showed shorter than the actual setting so if this is some kind of &amp;#34;computer glitch&amp;#34; you will not cut your beard to short.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Latch on the shaving compartment is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Now I have a rubber band to hold the door shut - a poor solution for what was supposed to be a great razor.</li>
            <li>My son loves the Beard trimmer so much, I&#x27;ll be ordering one for my husband.</li>
            <li>2nd time I bought a Phillips trimmer with a cheap Remington one in between.</li>
            <li>I do not use this very often now.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It feels cheap, especially compared to the Wahl Lithium Pro Mini I tried at my salon (although that cost 4x as much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Unit shows flashing yellow light pushing power on button.&lt;br /&gt;Unit</li>
            <li>I wish the blades could have been designed to be pushed up, so that the blades can get in really close, but no dice.</li>
            <li>This shaver absolutely rocks.  </li>
            <li>This unit was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>get a very even cut with this</li>
            <li>That would have been the humane response, and would have made me a much happier consumer of this product.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t trim very well, really.  </li>
            <li>Now the battery is much weaker and lasts 1 maybe 2 uses.  </li>
            <li>The number of depth settings makes it very versatile.</li>
            <li>The position and length stay very well.</li>
            <li>If a longer beard was my look, I would really like this device.</li>
            <li>if their job was really even intended to be helpful to customers and he said his job was really just to deflect complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will shape up every beard  and will do it fast.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a groomer at a reasonable price point with some added features, go ahead and buy this thing.</li>
            <li>battery lasts well and the power cord and connection is very well</li>
            <li>Lesson learned I empty it more often</li>
            <li>The display is very helpful, showing you charge status as well as length settings.  </li>
            <li>very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was really a bonus feature for me.</li>
            <li>That is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>you want a very closely trimmed bear</li>
            <li>I really like it, but the numbers started getting offset.</li>
            <li>Does the job but very noisy while running.  </li>
            <li>I was very please by the changes that were made.  </li>
            <li>The whole item is plastic except the blade and motor.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This seems like a very solidly-made trimmer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much hyped expectations either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charge life is very lengthy and I didn&#x27;t find myself bringing the charger onto trips with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After almost six months using it twice a week, the charge light turned yellow today, so I plugged it in to recharge.  </li>
            <li>I like the adjustability of the shaver and it has both of the snap on guides, so earlier criticism is no longer justified.  </li>
            <li>Cuts smoothly and has numerous features.</li>
            <li>I tried to use some trimmer oil on it and that was a mistake, as it created more drag on the blades.  </li>
            <li>Philips/Norelco customer service was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>they say this part is back ordered and have no estimate when the part will be available.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to remember 10 than &#x27;was it up one notch or two?&#x27;</li>
            <li>This Beard Trimmer is absolute junk.</li>
            <li>I have never had any problems with the unit, and it has functioned very well.</li>
            <li>I charged it again until the light went out and it that charged lasted through three ten minute trimmings and still had two bars.</li>
            <li>Bottom-line is this product is not market ready, nor does it perform as advertised.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and although i broke the plastic part that holds the door close it still keeps the door close haha</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>really disapointed..</li>
            <li>The material is very light-weight.  </li>
            <li>It worked as expected for me, and in fact, I have never used a better trimmer ever.</li>
            <li>Tank-solid product, very functional features....</li>
            <li>shipped very rapidly so it truly helped take it overseas for my cousin.</li>
            <li>But you don&#x27;t really need that feature anyway.  </li>
            <li>my wife really likes this model because it doesn&#x27;t drop my hair trimmings all over the bathroom counter</li>
            <li>Works very well for me..</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>I did reduce the hair spillage, just not as much as I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise as nice as the shaver seemed folks were really giving it awful reviews while their were slightly more good ones.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li>This thing works fantastic, as advertised (actually does .5mm trim) to give you the permament 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use Turbo much now.  </li>
            <li>bag would have been appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I would not expect much styling with this.</li>
            <li>It cuts fast without ant &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t cut the hair, very well.</li>
            <li>the company wants, I can send a picture of my face, after shaving.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>and I was ready to attack my Geico caveman lookalike face.</li>
            <li>Along the way, whole clumps of hair would stick to the shaver blades</li>
            <li>i just think you have to be gentle while doing it that sort</li>
            <li>I have almost spent $50 on this but trust me even a $10 trimmer can do a better job than this.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Actually better then expected.</li>
            <li>i bought Phillips norelco qt4070 for  my boyfriend and he really loves it.he keeps his  beard</li>
            <li>Went very short and was smooth leaving no hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>Even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts MUCH longer than the T980.</li>
            <li>So that makes the whole job quicker and easier.</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this again and would recommend it for anyone who wants stubble.</li>
            <li>thanks to person who commented and helped me correct my error.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;u need to think that will not collect 100%, maybe 95%, and it is very dependent of the trimming direction,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>since they have done away with the one he really likes.</li>
            <li>The spacing between the guard and the clippers makes it very ahrd to do some areas.</li>
            <li>Having this separate blade really makes a difference trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li>He let me see if the guide he had [#422203617711] fit my qt4070 and low and behold it did.</li>
            <li>So much for the 1st customer service guy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>The whole built-in-vacuum thing just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping time...</li>
            <li>Looks cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li>This razor not only has the best ergonomic shape for holding behind your head, but it is lightweight and the integrated vacuuming really keeps trimmings from flying all over the place while you buzz.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>fast ship and as described</li>
            <li>you have a trimmer you like to use or like to use a razor or straight edge to line your beard or goatee</li>
            <li>I got this trimmer because I prefer to have short stubble vs. a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this thing</li>
            <li>I really like this thing.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Philips replaced it for me free of charge but now the second one wont hold a charge anymore.</li>
            <li>It does what it is advertised to do, and  it does it very well.</li>
            <li>The window for the hair container was no longer able to be kept closed after about 3 months.</li>
            <li>Really Norelco</li>
            <li>It is also a real pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>really like it</li>
            <li>Speed control is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very well constructed.</li>
            <li>Cuts very evenly with one or two passes.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight trimmer.</li>
            <li>The combs are very flexible, so if you press it against your face, the teeth will flex</li>
            <li>and you will end up with a much shorter beard that you had intended.</li>
            <li>very dissapoointed from this purchase</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very usefull.</li>
            <li>DOES ITS INTENDED USE VERY WELL...</li>
            <li>but it is also very noisy</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really use it much.</li>
            <li>This combined with the D-Finer Precision Trimmer, and I effectively spent $50 more than planned, but feel like a pro. Trade-offs...</li>
            <li>have help up very well.  </li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t charge quite as fast as it spends battery power.  </li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I am saying thanks to Amazon ...</li>
            <li>Very uniform.</li>
            <li>Really like this product-</li>
            <li>The only thing I dislike is that it indicated free shipping, but when I used the $5 discount coupon I got charged $6.95 for shipping.</li>
            <li>there was still way too much stubble all over the sink.</li>
            <li>The cutter works very well,.</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it regularly and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>and I get a very even trim.  </li>
            <li>Makes the task of shaving much easier then getting out the cream and the Gillette.</li>
            <li>so I like to trim it without paying too much attention to detail.</li>
            <li>It is, however, a nightmare for those who are looking for a product capable of doing intricate beard designs and so on.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves his trimmer and really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>The trimming compartment fills up with one shave, so some people may need to empty the compartment more than once in a shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>Norelco Beard Trimmer retails at 49.99 and provides an efficient and fast trim.  </li>
            <li>it is much easier to use and keep charged.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Really like this product would recommend</li>
            <li>From the reviews I expected more.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does all that the ad said and it is done much easier than the ad leaves us to believe.  </li>
            <li>He looks very well groomed now and on Christmas Eve he was looking at another one at a store we were at</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>This leads to cleaning the chamber very often.</li>
            <li>The one I have cannot, and the whole thing had to be thrown away.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Battery recharges fast</li>
            <li>I really like the trimmer-</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine turning on turbo it in real life use.&lt;br /&gt;Update of 4/23/13&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They appear to have cost reduced the feature to the point where it no longer really works.  </li>
            <li>Too much hassle to return.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable trim length is very functional and works very well.</li>
            <li>and i really didnt think it would, but it saves me a lot of mess.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>Considering he is very opinionated on everything I buy, this is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li>REALLY?  </li>
            <li>get real people...</li>
            <li>Thanks Phillips and thanks Amazon for allowing me to purchase one.</li>
            <li>The actual device feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>and it cut much closer.</li>
            <li>Shame really.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The QT4070 looks very sleek.</li>
            <li>It does work very well.</li>
            <li>BUT THE REAL TEST WAS HOW IT WORKED .IT</li>
            <li>I found when I tried to go fast over longer areas</li>
            <li>so much I bought another</li>
            <li>The block shape keeps it from rolling around so much as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Turbo mode doesn&#x27;t help much either.</li>
            <li>If you put it in Turbo mode, then it&#x27;s a bit noisy but not so much.</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth, I replaced this product with the Norelco Multigroom 3100, which I have found to be completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li>But the real kicker was when the battery died.</li>
            <li>So much for cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HE loves it as much as I do.....</li>
            <li>REALLY?</li>
            <li>very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before this problem I was ready to purchase one for a friend.</li>
            <li>I really tried to like this thing.</li>
            <li>than that the trimmer works well, and I highly recommend for travel!</li>
            <li>trimming guide is marked in inches and mm with nearly 20 different positions so you&#x27;ll be able to maintain your beard at whatever length you prefer.</li>
            <li>I own another trimmer manufactured by this same company, and it simply doesn&#x27;t perform as well.</li>
            <li>The two stars are for nice cutting, quieter operation, and nice display of length and battery charge.</li>
            <li>Good cutting power, especially on Turbo, good battery</li>
            <li>The adjustable length is quite nice as well, especially with the digital display.</li>
            <li>For the same price go with more professional (what they use in salons) models.</li>
            <li>It sucks up plenty of hair but a fair amount still gets around the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Now that he has such a nice trimmer he actually enjoys maintaining his beard.</li>
            <li>One nice feature though is that when the batter IS dead, you can plug in and use.  </li>
            <li>For the additional cost, the QT4070 will provide a smoother and more even cut, with a much cleaner sink and counter, keeping its charge well, and providing a clear digital readout.</li>
            <li>iT IS FAR BETTER THAN THE LAST RAZERS I HAVE USED.</li>
            <li>I have been a bearded man for most of my adult life and have used trimmers for the last 20+ years.</li>
            <li>But even after shaving my entire head, the battery indicator is still full or near full</li>
            <li>I have had a beard my entire adult life and have had many trimmers.  </li>
            <li>, I am sure this trimmer is going to last for years with proper use and storage, the only downside is that some times this trimmer left some untrimmed hairs on my beard, nothing that some good scissors can&#x27;t fix anyway.</li>
            <li>This is a kind of messy look / on the go product.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the old model, looks nicer, and has the lighted digital reading of what length you have it set at.</li>
            <li>which while lacking the vacuum feature I have found more adept at getting to these hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved it, the problem with my old one was that it didn&#x27;t hold a charge after a few months of usage, and now it doesn&#x27;t even work well if its plugged in.  </li>
            <li>He has a thick beard but the trimmer does a good job.</li>
            <li>Very smart idea incorporating the vacuum as it greatly reduces the amount of stubble mess I used to have with my old beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>On high suction it works much better (not perfectly) but reduces the run time much more quickly.</li>
            <li>I very rarely write reviews; but the Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silver is certainly a PRO which needed reviewing.    </li>
            <li>I will not be buying another Philips shaving product in the future - I already ordered a Remington vacuum unit for haircuts that I had formerly been pleased with many years ago.</li>
            <li>The Norelco is better in all ways except that the vacuum doesn&#x27;t quite work as well and there are more hairs trapped in the removable comb.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve got more and more eyebrow hairs that just decide &amp;#34;welp!</li>
            <li>The vacuum was useful when I was testing it, but it got in the way more often than it helped on the low trim settings.</li>
            <li>The adjustments are very precise and doesn&#x27;t move like other trimmers.</li>
            <li>Finally, the vacuum works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>The vacuum option is great and doesn&#x27;t leave a messy sink.</li>
            <li>The vacuum provides terrific ease of use and keeps everything neat and tidy.  </li>
            <li>The tines on the trimmer head didn&#x27;t bother me one bit and the vacuum aspect is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>(apparently they removed it on the original change from the older model, but they now give you both heads in the packaging)</li>
            <li>the vacuum cup is nice and works well, but the door does open causing some frustrations...</li>
            <li>I do love this beard trimmer, but I will note that the vacuum does not work nearly as well as I had hoped which is why I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I love the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro, it is a bit loud</li>
            <li>This one does far better and the vacuum feature is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if it wasn&#x27;t for the vacuum (which only picks up 50-70%) I would return this.  </li>
            <li>about you dump the gimmicks, such as the LED display, Vacuum, and Turbo Button and just make a nice shaver that works?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very elegant design, battery life lasts very long, very easy to use, sucks the trimmed hair right</li>
            <li>This trimmer is certainly not one of the more inexpensive ones so why not have this included?</li>
            <li>The new one has a stationary comb that requires a steady hand or you will take a chunk right out of your beard.  </li>
            <li>The attached vacuum is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>The vacuum while not getting everything that is cut, it is a huge help and limits the amount of cleanup in the sink.</li>
            <li>the vacuum is not 100% accurate but like 95% .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vacuum cleaning door does not close as securely as I would like it to close.</li>
            <li>In the absence of an appropriate and timely action by Norelco, I think that the US regulatory agencies need to intervene and ban this company from selling their products in the US.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works well, but the latch to the door to the cuttings chamber broke, so I have to secure it with rubber bands to ensure the vacuum functions well and that the door stays closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having always held the bathroom garbage can under my chin to catch the hairs, I thought this vacuum feature would be fantastic.</li>
            <li>i am very please no mess with the vacuum and really does the job Better than the Wahl</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!!!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!!!</li>
            <li>the hair trimming is quite smooth, the vacuum works wonders !</li>
            <li>He does love how it doesn&#x27;t slide down to a different length easily</li>
            <li>Overall, this does exactly what I was hoping for, quickly and well.  </li>
            <li>A quick call to Philips cleared the issue up though, the rep knew exactly what I was talking about and he simply took my address and placed the order.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long time, has an accurate and easy to adjust length guard and the vacuum function is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:  Excellent razor, close shave, very little mess</li>
            <li>Far more powerful than other trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li>But that is exactly what the new QT4070/41 does.    </li>
            <li>and if it ever goes out, I will get me an exact new one</li>
            <li>The reason for the 4 stars, is the head of the trimmer is too fat to get right under my nose without taking the guard off completely.</li>
            <li>One note: If you don&#x27;t clean the blades or comb regularly and are traveling, make sure to pack it in ziplock as loose hair particles will spill all over!</li>
            <li>My husband has liked it so far, and I am so grateful that I don&#x27;t have to clean up after every shave (I mean, he tries, but not to my standards:)</li>
            <li>Philips could easily remedy this, but they probably consider it too minor of an issue to spend money on.</li>
            <li>Very quick to charge, and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and long battery life.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is good - I only have to charge this every couple of weeks using it every other day.</li>
            <li>So many setting options and the battery hasn&#x27;t needed a recharge since the original charge at least six weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Getting most of hairs takes many passes from various angles and the bulkiness of the head makes trimming mustache awkward and only moderately successful.</li>
            <li>had hoped Norelco would have sent the contoured comb for free and apologized for the trouble the original comb caused me.  </li>
            <li>As other users have said, it doesnt really catch most of the hair.</li>
            <li>the build in vacuum is very useful.</li>
            <li>Also the design is nice but the plastic feels a little cheap (minor gripe).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the razor is super easy, just open vacuum compartment door and empty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Touted as a Vacuum trimmer, it does a pretty good job overall with some room for improvement as it may not vacuum all hair although that may depend on the length of hair being cut.</li>
            <li>I have only ever used a cheap Whal trimmer, thought I would buy a decent one.  </li>
            <li>other than that, the vacuum does a good job of sucking in trimmings and</li>
            <li>its vacuum not suck 100% hair but other all things are good.</li>
            <li>thought I would have to do the same with this one to keep from trying to clean up a bazillion little hairs in my bathroom sink, but the vacuum works very well and cleanup is very easy and quick at my sink, as it gets most of the hairs, but not every single one,  </li>
            <li>As most other posts say, this comes with the correct guide to make it work</li>
            <li>I was able to get an extremely close to the skin stubble with this at its closest setting.    </li>
            <li>other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li>I have had to snake the drain more than once due to beard hair in the drain.</li>
            <li>I have owned many other brands.</li>
            <li>Yeah, sure, that&#x27;s what I need to drag across my face all bleery-eyed in the morning - pointed sticks!  </li>
            <li>There is a gap on top as other reviewers have said that allows a closer trim around your jaw and chin when angled incorrectly.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li>There at just too many sharp spots on this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>and there are other better trimmers out there.</li>
            <li>For the most part, he wasn&#x27;t even paying attention to me as I can hear people laughing on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>on a full charge and than the red light comes on showing that the battery is low.  </li>
            <li>but it does suck up 90% of them which is 90% more than any other machine</li>
            <li>But, it does collect the stubble, and you can&#x27;t say that about most other brands.  </li>
            <li>Was getting this for travel and was expecting it to be a tad smaller but am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on the Qt4070 and other beard/mustache trimmers, I took the plunge and ordered the QT4070.</li>
            <li>still working great after a few months the battery charges fast and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This has a kool blue digital light which tells you what mm the trimmer is on at the moment and also how full the battery is and when t charge it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands costing much more</li>
            <li>As is the case with several more recent reviews, my trimmer was thankfully packaged with both (in fact, this was the first thing that</li>
            <li>I originally had purchased the 4050 version of this razor, but it did not cut close enough for me due to the flexible guard design (I know that most people prefer this).</li>
            <li>However, other electric trimmers are better based on my experience.</li>
            <li>The other is spring loaded and works contours of your face better.</li>
            <li>If you share this opinion, you may want to look more closely at your other options.  </li>
            <li>-in-all I would highly recommend this unit for keeping a beard smartly trimmed.</li>
            <li>I consider myself lucky that the good come was in the box as I&#x27;m not very hopeful that the Contour Following Comb I ordered through Phillips customer service will ever actually arrive.</li>
            <li>It has a vacuum to help clean up, and a whole lot of settings.  </li>
            <li>I like the vacuum feature as I don&#x27;t have as much hair to clean up out of the sink after.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to read, it&#x27;s consistent, and it doesn&#x27;t move (unlike other trimmers and trimmer attachments I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>the vacuum makes clean up so much easier.</li>
            <li>vacuum didn&#x27;t catch everything, so a sink cleaning is still needed, although I must admit the clean up is much easier than I&#x27;m used</li>
            <li>It is as sharp as it was when I bought it, and the contour comb is easy to set and gives a consistent cut.</li>
            <li>When my trusty and much beloved Philips T980 recently gave up the ghost, I was a bit worried about replacing it with the new QT4070 due in large part to some of the adverse reviews I&#x27;d seen on Amazon.</li>
            <li>So there is a top comb which digs right into your skin like little knives as you use the device!</li>
            <li>If you want a clean, reliable stubble trimmer, look no further.</li>
            <li>There is no such thing as perfection though, so you&#x27;ll still have to clean some clippings off the rocks by the majestic mountain river</li>
            <li>As far as accuracy goes, the Norelco QT4070 is unbeatable and gives my face the look I want, pretty much everytime.</li>
            <li>so I only have to thoroughly clean it every couple months.</li>
            <li>Bought this Norelco to replace an old one that was pretty much falling apart.  </li>
            <li>In summary, I am very pleased that I spent the extra money for this model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less effective and causes more messy cleanup.</li>
            <li>so you have to actually clean out two things now, the trimmer and the left overs in the sink..  </li>
            <li>I pretty much have to insert earplugs to protect my hearing when trimming near my ears.  </li>
            <li>but it appears that besides emptying trimmings from the obvious compartment, you need to periodically clean the cutter head.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I was looking for a trimmer that was powerful enough to cut my coarse facial hair and that would be easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>You have to open the blade encasing and expose the rotary thing and clean out the hair, otherwise it will put strain on the motor.</li>
            <li>It is also neater to use, the hair is caught in a area that is very is to open and clean out.  </li>
            <li>door: the door clips shut with a tiny stub of plastic so packing the trimmer in a suitcase or quickly closing the door can snap off the plastic leaving it free to open while in use or storage.</li>
            <li>The main concern with this is that without the guard, it doesn&#x27;t cut very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>I only wish that it would have the ability to give a clean shave too, rather than just a close trim leaving stubble.</li>
            <li>Both the comb and the guard teeth seem much flimsier than the older T980, allowing the distance between the skin and the razors to vary depending on the pressure applied.</li>
            <li>Plus, the product comes with a tiny brush to clean up the hair.</li>
            <li>For those of you that can grow a dense, full beard before you finish breakfast and have a dark beard, 1mm may show a cool movie look.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I have a thick full beard and my favorite shave gel (Zirh)</li>
            <li>Also, I found that a significant amount of hair never ended up sucked up by the vacuum and would just end up on a counter anyway.    </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, sucks the hair right in without having to worry about hair falling all over us.</li>
            <li>To finish up, without the comb, I trimmed a clear beard borderline down to my neck in reverse position, without once feeling any pulling or discomfort of any kind.    </li>
            <li>good at trimming beard down to a specific lenght--vacuum of hair a</li>
            <li>The vacuum makes the clean-up easy, although some cuttings do stay on the unit head and a few more tumble out.</li>
            <li>I figured out that either there is a short or a loose connection triggered by disassembling the blade head to brush clean and or very mildly tapping to remove clippings.</li>
            <li>I liked the previous model, and this newer model is better than the previous model even when it was new.</li>
            <li>The unit charges very fast, and the LED display clearly indicates the charge level.</li>
            <li>The digital display is a nice touch and clearly tells you what setting it&#x27;s on and how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li>Battery life is holding and the vacuum does help clean up.</li>
            <li>Now imagine that after emptying the puffy mass, that you would now have to take the vacuum cleaner apart and clean every moving part within it because parts of that puffy mass had coated everything inside.</li>
            <li>Vacuum works well to keep things clean.</li>
            <li>: The vacuum collects some hair, but leaves a lot in the sink (even if you clean out the chamber between trimmings).</li>
            <li>The Vacuum feature on this razor saves a ton of hassle with clean up.  </li>
            <li>its vacuum chamber helps a lot during clean up..</li>
            <li>The teeth are sharp and cut with no pulling or tugging, and the vacuum feature works pretty nicely, although after a week or so of trimming the sink does need to cleaned.</li>
            <li>It was a hard switch for me, but I am very glad I chose this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Both of us like the vacuum feature, no hair to clean up.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works perfectly; so it&#x27;s absolutely clean.</li>
            <li>These trimmers/clippers  have a built in vacuum to save me from having to clean up the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>thing on the vacuum feature though, you have to clean it out after every use or else</li>
            <li>There are still clippings that escape the vacuum, but it does help with the clean up quite a bit.</li>
            <li>and then I have to clean out the vacuum too.</li>
            <li>Vacuum also does not work well - I should still clean surrounding area.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t vacuum everything up, so you will still need to clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>but overall it is hassle free, and it hasn&#x27;t pinched me yet, which is why I got a new shaving device; my Panasonic I just got pinches my hair, so does the Norelco, but Philips, it seems they did this one</li>
            <li>It becomes obvious after using so many of these that their product line gets better-engineered above a certain price point.</li>
            <li>The vacuum system is nice giving me less to clean up than my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Previous models were better insulated and motor much quieter.</li>
            <li>Overall a very rugged and well thought out device, worthy of anyones grooming arsenal.</li>
            <li>The previous models have been good shavers and didn&#x27;t have technical problems before the battery failed&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend you do not waste money on such a faulty product.</li>
            <li>The box I got with the comb clearly advertised it on the back, so this is an easy way to see if the comb&#x27;s included without opening the box.  </li>
            <li>Latch that keeps the door on the hair compartment closed is very flimsy and broke very quickly.</li>
            <li>It should be the same trimmer, but the new one seems much better - like the normal mode on this one is like Turbo on the old one -</li>
            <li>The vacuum works great letting very few whiskers fall into the sink.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and has a long battery life before it needs to be recharged.  </li>
            <li>The most common complaint from two years ago was that the guiding comb was not included, but I&#x27;m happy to report that it now is included with the product.</li>
            <li>After the first go around, I took off the removable &#x27;trimming comb&#x27;, then got what was left of the beard to a sort of rough stubble, ready to attack once more with my trusty razor (although I could have skipped that step and gone straight to razor, but I wanted to see if this trimmer could be a razor replacement.  </li>
            <li>Since this happened to both of the units, it seems pretty clear that it&#x27;s a design flaw.</li>
            <li>The first trimmer died completely after a couple months.</li>
            <li>A full charge now only lasts a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>It is sleek, maneuverable and the lighted digital display is cool.  </li>
            <li>First let me say that I bought this trimmer in the hopes that it would replace an old battery operated Wahl product that I use to shave my head.  </li>
            <li>Looks cool and is very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There were also a couple of nice additions since my last one which was several years old.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews related to the Philips Norelco, the Braun, the Panasonic and the Wahl products, and my final choice was between the Philips Norelco and the Wahl for good solid results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for basic trimming of your entire beard, however if you want to so some shaping on the edges, for instance to maintain your moustache or create a goatee, it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I had my beard professionally trimmed at the comfort of my house.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Boost is a nice quirk that I usually turn on as a norm -- why would I otherwise wish to prolong my shaves?</li>
            <li>The only problem was because I had a full beard (grew it for a couple of months)</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I had my beard professionally trimmed at the comfort of my house.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a keep it short and sweet</li>
            <li>charged it once I received it to full battery and haven&#x27;t charged it since and have been using it almost on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Still it is very cleaner than a normal razor.</li>
            <li>Not sure how people got hurt using this thing to be honest.</li>
            <li>The suction is much better and really helps with the mess of trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>It still leaves a few whiskers in the sink &amp; on my shirt, but not bad as compared the my original unit.</li>
            <li>I liked the digital adjustment of this trimmer, It doesn&#x27;t change on me or become loose and adjust itself like some reviewers claim.  </li>
            <li>vacuum and the digital display are interesting, but I don&#x27;t feel like they add much to the beard trimming.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to find a model that had a vacuum to help curb the mess on the sink that other razors leave.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is ok, I have black hair which did get on the sink, which meant that there was still clean up to do (nothing like the Philips video btw, which made it look</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vacuum sucks up most of the stray hairs from shaving, which is my favorite feature of this model.</li>
            <li>Digital trim length indicator is fine although length is also marked on the sides of the guard/slide.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  Ok this is going down to two stars.  </li>
            <li>and it will wear down and will not stay close any more.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a good trimmer with the vacuum option to minimize the mess when trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is useless, it doesn&#x27;t collect more than but a fraction of hair and is just one more thing to clean out.</li>
            <li>He likes the vacumn feature so there is no mess in the sink!!!</li>
            <li>The vacuum gets about 75% of the clippings, but I&#x27;d much rather have more juice going to the clippers - whats the point in a vacuum if the clippers suck?&lt;br /&gt;[Note</li>
            <li>The vacuum is superior to the vacuum on the earlier models.  </li>
            <li>Oh that sweet vacuum feature.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>The vacuum is cool and works..  </li>
            <li>but there is still a fair amount of clean-up of little whiskers required after trimming a short beard.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works quite well (until its hopper is full)</li>
            <li>Trimming takes a little practice but it does an overall good job.</li>
            <li>good all my hairs even, except in the mustache area which it left them a little longer, but withing acceptable and understandable limits.</li>
            <li>This is an obvious design flaw with this supposedly top model product - the next model down, that comes with the other comb, gets completely great reviews.</li>
            <li>it has a ton of cutting lengths and captures most the clippings keeping the sink relatively clean works great and the battery last a long time.. and mine was packaged with both heads</li>
            <li>So far, the vacuum function has not quite been up to snuff, but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li>They have other models which are far better, and much cheaper.      </li>
            <li>My older one would turn on while being in the travel case and being pressed lightly requiring me to come up with a way to securely cover the power button with something hard.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re keeping a simple mid-length beard, it isn&#x27;t an all-around trimmer as advertised and you&#x27;ll still need other tools to keep tidy.</li>
            <li>I use this all the time I am relatively new to a beard but this has made life so much easier.</li>
            <li>I wish the product designers/engineers would live with their &amp;#34;achievements&amp;#34; before vomiting them so readily onto the marketplace.</li>
            <li>After reading through many reviews, some good and some bad, I decided to try the Norelco.</li>
            <li>There were good reviews on it, but a lot of bad ones also, so I wasn&#x27;t sure in that buy at all.</li>
            <li>thus it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;mistake-proof&amp;#34; than previous trimmers he has owned.</li>
            <li>The compartment is easy to empty.  </li>
            <li>Most of the hair ended up in the bin with about 80% less trimmings in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those who previously used the T980 will surely recognize the design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually threw it out and still use my old Norelco brush because it&#x27;s much easier to clean with that one.</li>
            <li>The setting wheel is SO MUCH BETTER than previous setting ring design.</li>
            <li>Much much better than the previous generation.</li>
            <li>had the previous model which was better.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is really pretty nice at reducing the mess.</li>
            <li>I had the previous version of this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Lower price, less fancy products are way more practical.</li>
            <li>I had never had a legitimate trimmer before, I had my hesitations that this was going to be any better than the previous pieces of garbage I had ordered.</li>
            <li>The container on the previous version was a much better option.</li>
            <li>Seems to have more suction than previous models.</li>
            <li>sure if I would get the same one again, with how this is my second and now have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also does not contour very well around my jaw and leaves areas that are much more uneven than others.</li>
            <li>Had to replace an older model that would not hold a charge any longer.  </li>
            <li>Simply throw a few paper towels in the sink and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>Decent battery life</li>
            <li>this has more than met my expectations and i will not be without this or a similar product in the future.</li>
            <li>It also cuts super short on its lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>Works decent for the price.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the battery, which seems to last a week or better even with the turbo on, just drops to zero all of a sudden.  </li>
            <li>Also, I really love the digital display on it...showing all the different lengths or measurements (and battery power...e.t.c.) ...</li>
            <li>Had an older version of this product which I&#x27;ve had for years.  </li>
            <li>The whole operation lasted a maximum of ten minutes and was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>After my older Philips Norelco died permanently (the NiCad batter would not charge any longer), I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>and i couldn&#x27;t find anything else that did that that was in the up to $80 range nor didn&#x27;t want to cough up $200+ for an actual good all round trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have had this trimmer one week, but see below I&#x27;ve been using an older Norelco with the preferred comb for years</li>
            <li>used an older model before</li>
            <li>I am seeking out the older version.</li>
            <li>Also, any basic, corded trimmer will most likely outperform this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say much about the battery life but the turbo option is nice for someone with a thick beard.</li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer for people like me who have thick beards and like to let them grow out then trim them back.</li>
            <li>Overall, I cannot recommend this trimmer based on several design flaws I believe will be problematic for most users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just super glued the tab back on and works again.</li>
            <li>For me, it was helpful for quick touch-ups on my sideburns and, with my wife&#x27;s help, for cleaning up my neck in the back and around my ears.</li>
            <li>This product is not meant to last, they&#x27;ve focused on gimmicky details rather than a good, reliable product.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a contour flowing comb, which I&#x27;ve read older models advertised but did not contain in the box</li>
            <li>There is, however, the need to be more careful in the use of the QT4070 than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>If you do, it&#x27;s simple to hold the tines near the tips for support and use a jeweler&#x27;s file to smooth.  </li>
            <li>No, seriously, it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair at all.</li>
            <li>If you want to get a closer trim/shave (like the older model) then forget it.</li>
            <li>I still get a decent amount of beard hair all over the place.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly, and if if dies in the middle of a trim, you can always plug it in.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement to an older Norelco Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li>i only wish it were a bit more quiet.  </li>
            <li>The lack of decent head shave and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cutting - The shearing of the clipper even on regular speed is quite adequate for my beard.</li>
            <li>The standard comb, which many people complain about, and the guided comb, which suppose to solve the problems associated with the standard</li>
            <li>I wish a case was included in the package to keep everything (charger, extra comb, cleaning brush) together, but it is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging took more than an hour.</li>
            <li>This replace and older one I had.  </li>
            <li>Lighter weight than my older one.</li>
            <li>The design is composed of a plastic door, on a plastic hinge, with a 1mm plastic lip that clicks onto the main housing.</li>
            <li>The only aesthetic flaw is a white strip winding through most of the unit.</li>
            <li>Decent shaver.</li>
            <li>Yet it was difficult to think much real improvement could be made on that great product.</li>
            <li>my main issue with this one is that you have to keep cleaning out the filter where the hair is vacuumed into.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super simple to use.</li>
            <li>Mainly because of its integrated vaccum system... I do fully recommend it...</li>
            <li>Decent product.  </li>
            <li>her.&lt;br /&gt;It is still a decent razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rechargeable, super simple to use and never pulls or snags on my beard.</li>
            <li>Replaced older Norelco when I needed sharper blades and the catcher cup broke.</li>
            <li>i had an older version of this about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>older reviews say that you get one trimmer guard that pokes and causes un-even trimming, but rest assured, that is not the case any longer.</li>
            <li>Replaced my older model.</li>
            <li>The point is to recommend you see if any earlier Norelco blades you may have on an old razor will fit on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Update of 11/11/13&lt;br</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s super short stubble that you&#x27;re after...</li>
            <li>The biggest issue, is that this model only has a screen at the bottom of the compartment, so it quickly clogs of beard trimmings, and no longer vacuums them.  </li>
            <li>I was initially put off by the fact that it does not come with a charging stand, but I quickly found out that it does not need one.</li>
            <li>My older trimmer was wrapped in rubber and felt heavier.</li>
            <li>: Love the big internal dial that adjusts the length of the trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pay attention to more recent reviews, the unit now comes with two different guides.  </li>
            <li>I had one of the older styles of Norelco trimmers that I wore out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Secondly, the design of the blades and the large vacuum port is such that when you&#x27;re trying to trim the line of your mustache, beard, or sideburns, you cannot SEE where the blades are touching your face/beard, so you can&#x27;t tell where to trim!</li>
            <li>Its too new to know how good the batteries are and whether the trimmers will stay sharp for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The original is poorly designed; the contoured version is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>or so i look and see if i can find an actual good trimmer to replace it that won&#x27;t cost me an other pretty penny only to be dissatisfied again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My older clipper that was of similar design without the vacuum was much better.</li>
            <li>First, the razor is good enough that you don&#x27;t have to press hard at all to cut</li>
            <li>Blades are sharp and cut welll, but don&#x27;t use for fine detail or very close shaves.</li>
            <li>I can see the potential for breakage with some of the plastic pieces but the trimmer works well and the vacuum does pick up most of the trimmings for an easier sink cleanup.</li>
            <li>The vacuum catches the vast majority of trimmings, but be sure to rinse your face well afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve gotten with the vacuum, and it really DOES work!</li>
            <li>The vacuum works as advertised, but only manages to pick up 60-70% of the clippings (I mostly use this as a scruff trimmer).  </li>
            <li>As others have pointed out, the vacuum feature isn&#x27;t a shop vac so don&#x27;t expect it to catch everything if you are doing anything more than a daily trim.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum works ok but unless you&#x27;re just trimming short stubble it tends to clog just under the blades.</li>
            <li>What made me choose this item over others was its vacuum feature which had a plastic &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; where you could see the &amp;#34;trimmings&amp;#34; as well as being able to open this window to dispose of the trimmings.</li>
            <li>guess this is a pro, as the few times that I have used it I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge improvement in the speed and efficiency of shaving seeing as the regular mode does the job just fine in a timely manor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it because my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t make a mess with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you might need to choose a different trimming length than with the normal comb, especially if you hold your trimmer in a more angled way like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still a mess on the sink counter top when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>you might need to choose a different trimming length than with the normal comb, especially if you hold your trimmer in a more angled way like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li>Keeps most of the mess contained, but not all.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the super vacuum that is built in to collect the cuttings</li>
            <li>found that the measured guide for trimming was extremely effective and provided an even trim all around - I have trusted few trimmers in the past, but I was able to put my faith in this one, the guide just worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is really super.</li>
            <li>Hair gets stuck in the super teensy weensy vacuum hole.  </li>
            <li>Good battery power last long enough to shave all my body, and</li>
            <li>only problem for me is that for trimming my long beard I have to use an extra comb, but to be fair a 5 inch beard is a challenge for any trimmer and this one make it just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product, plain and simple.</li>
            <li>It gets fairly close when you take the blade guard right off, but it&#x27;s difficult to shave stubble evenly.</li>
            <li>fast charge and super long life.</li>
            <li>The power cord plug easily slips out of the bottom (and could drop in sink of water if you&#x27;re not careful) as the plug doesn&#x27;t seat itself solidly into the body of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t vacuum EVERYTHING, but much better than not having a vacuum at all.</li>
            <li>The only minor issue us that the vacuum didn&#x27;t work quite as good as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>i guess I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for self-shavers and others alike.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>I have trimmed my beard and moustaches with high quality barber scissors since about 1977.  </li>
            <li>Still, after you trim your beard to your desired stubble, even the minimum length setting is too high for mustache trimming.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this unit, but in the end I&#x27;m just returning it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>really liked it, unfortunately after having it for only 7 months the battery is only good for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>Many seemed dated a little older, and aimed specifically around the stubble comb attachment (newer reviews mention the dual combs now included and no problems).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>vacuum works much better than the old Wahl model this replaced, which is a relief since there are so few vacuum-equipped models available.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great but the compartment for storing the trimming is very small and needs to be emptied multiple times.</li>
            <li>its very noisy, my wife couldn&#x27;t bear sound its making even from other rooms when I am using it in bathroom.</li>
            <li>had about a 5 inch long beard and this trimmer could barley cut 20 strands of hair at a time with out me having to clean the blades.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a nice trimmer and holds charge for about 2 weeks when I use it every other day.</li>
            <li>Fun in that there is no mess to clean up in and around the sink, other than emptying the stubble compartment when finished trimming.  </li>
            <li>The functioning of the QT4070 is as described, but it is far too large to maneuver as a mustache trimmer unless you have a gigantic face.  </li>
            <li>do really like the digital settings to be able to trim to the exactness of a single millimeter.</li>
            <li>It works great, and for less than half the price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>A little battery-powered machine isn&#x27;t going to be able to suck up all the clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, charges fast, the vacuum feature actually works!</li>
            <li>I used to trim my beard with a little $5 set of clippers and these work MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>The display can&#x27;t keep track of the height of the attachment, every time you click up to a higher setting from 0, the display will flash the next size from the number on the display, then go back to the original size.</li>
            <li>It could probably go a little longer without the charge, but I like to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>little bulky like most.</li>
            <li>in all, I love this little razor, use it at home or on the road.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is nice and keeps down on the mess, but other than that there was nothing great about it.</li>
            <li>At first i was disappointed by the vacuum, but after I started emptying it more frequently during the shave, I became decently impressed by how much it actually keeps off of the counter...  </li>
            <li>The vacuum works good, although it&#x27;s not like a professional one that&#x27;s actually hooked up to a real vacuum.  </li>
            <li>I am exceptionally frusturated with the trimmers inability to lift the beard to make accurate cutting.</li>
            <li>The brush is a joke most likely will drop on toilet or lose it.</li>
            <li>I have bought many other electric razors and have spent much more on similar products</li>
            <li>-Only extra pieces are the other head it came with, a cleaning brush, and the A/C adaptor which is great compared to my old multipiece trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric beard trimmer, and certainly the last I will ever need.</li>
            <li>So as you shave, it easily stabs your face, or any other part of your body you may choose to shave.  </li>
            <li>In all, they are rugged, easy to maintain, and are built with quality not found in other brands.</li>
            <li>it is kind of hard to shape with because of the positioning of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I use it to keep at 2/3 mm and use the 1mm setting under the nose because it&#x27;s hard for the blades to work effectively.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of bulky as well and hard to get under the nose.</li>
            <li>Then I found another clip (black with a clear plastic movable part) in the box and removed the default clip (the all black one with the open end that caused the shaving issues); and it worked perfectly lol!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re letting your goatee/beard grow out and trim down a decent amount then expect to make many trips to clear out the hair trap and unclog the hole.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>A beard trimmer should be easy to use to produce an even cut, even over the concave surfaces and especially the flat and convex surfaces.</li>
            <li>I would not have bought this product if I wanted to use the adjustable comb because of the almost universal hatred displayed by previous reviewers, but I take it off and get a good, close, mess free trim.</li>
            <li>Vacuum works very well- far, far fewer hairs to clean up post-shave.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I had an older model for years and thought it was time for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In about a year the battery seems to discharge completely if it is jostled too much.  </li>
            <li>smooth adjust with a wide array of settings  *</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months now, and so far it&#x27;s worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Works well and is much neater to use than old trimmer.</li>
            <li>With the way it is designed, you can&#x27;t get the piece of plastic completely out of the way to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips offers a generous 24 month warranty and replaced the whole unit under warranty.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok, first of all, let&#x27;s establish a general scope of what 1mm means to a beard.  </li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t much matter if you&#x27;re stroking against the natural growth direction or not,</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who still wants some hair on their face but not for a complete shave.  </li>
            <li>If you buy straight from Norelco, it now ships directly with the contouring head that everyone is raving about in the comments</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of beard trimmers and (so far) have found this one to be very reliable.</li>
            <li>I tried using directly &amp; it took so much time to trim.</li>
            <li>I think the product has been improved because the old reviews don&#x27;t really reflect the product anymore.  </li>
            <li>I really like that I can use it while its plugged in, I couldn&#x27;t do that with my old one.  </li>
            <li>I really like it so far, use it for trimming my beards, or sometime trimming my body hair.</li>
            <li>This is a much lighter trimmer than my old one</li>
            <li>Sad to see Norelco hasn&#x27;t changed the design, otherwise it&#x27;s a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>Does not trim soft hair very well.</li>
            <li>The vacume feature is great and the blades cut well,even on thick beard,as long as you dont let the hair catcher get overfilled.</li>
            <li>It actually does what it says, which is rare these days it seems.    </li>
            <li>It seems that the battery is not holding the charge anymore, which kind of sucks since it doesn´t have two months.</li>
            <li>Simple and highly useful.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal since the setting is clearly marked on the side and the digital display is more just for fanciness.  </li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;m not going to rehash all the talk about this model vs others that are similar.  </li>
            <li>The picture shows a nice dark blue.</li>
            <li>While others have mentioned its minor imperfections, and some of them are true, to my knowledge</li>
            <li>The suction system is not perfect but is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra $15 bucks over the cheaper models in my opinion.</li>
            <li>their medical devices are as good as phillips&#x27; consumer devices, then I&#x27;m even more afraid of hospitals than I was before.</li>
            <li>I have not used the Norelco to trim a full grown beard 2 or 3 inches long</li>
            <li>few more notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when you take the beard combs off it wont shave close enough to even touch a weeks worth of stubble.  </li>
            <li>I quit using a normal razor because my neck seems to get reall iritated</li>
            <li>had it many year&#x27;s This one has a few improvements</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a better photo of the clear plastic compartment cover but as you can see it is just cheap plastic and that tab will break off sooner or later.ng and the notorious plastic clippings compartment, small plastic tab simply fatigued and broke off (should have been a metal clip)  </li>
            <li>Too bulky to be useful, cannot do actual detail trimming.</li>
            <li>The battery seems, to me, to have a normal lifespan between charges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that is good enough to please a lot of people.</li>
            <li>I had it on pretty much all the time as I tried to trim as much as possible.    </li>
            <li>why the normal mode exists)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Having purchased this a few months ago, I&#x27;m satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth ($35).  </li>
            <li>He has a long, full beard (think Amish).</li>
            <li>The Turbo feature is well worth the extra $10.00.</li>
            <li>I figure 2 years of service was worth a 2nd purchase.  </li>
            <li>Only the contour attachment is worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a year, the catch on the door of the compartment that collects the clippings broke off in normal use.</li>
            <li>Norelco products have managed to last me a long a while and sure have been reliable.</li>
            <li>Ok Razor, door catch broke in a few days.</li>
            <li>and my husband has not complained.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not enough to make it worth the money though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Now the battery lasts only for one use pretty much.</li>
            <li>2 is too short and 3 is too long they should make it more adjustable.</li>
            <li>However, you still need to clean up the sink as: 1) the chamber is small and fills up quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is my fourth Norelco beard trimmer (can&#x27;t replace the batteries economically in Norelco trimmers)</li>
            <li>I may have a defective unit and will update after a few more months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It broke after about 4 months of normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, worth it despite shortcomings.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is a good size doesn&#x27;t feel too small or big</li>
            <li>The touted &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; of shaven hair might be mildly useful, if it actually worked.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Vacuum is good but not great.  </li>
            <li>I liked the old one so much that I went ahead and bought this newer model despite all the reviews that had something negative to say about</li>
            <li>I think I got three solid full beard trims on full turbo the whole time before it was down below 1/2 battery.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually quite loud, so it would be better without the vacuum.</li>
            <li>Because really, and I mean REALLY, this trimmer was pretty much a huge letdown.</li>
            <li>While the vacuum does get much of hair, doesn&#x27;t get it all, even when set to higher speed.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the whole vacuum thing would be just a gimmick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and the vacuum gets a lot of the hair (though definitely not most of it).  </li>
            <li>trimmer has no problem with my long beard, altough the vacuum could be better</li>
            <li>The plastic door that holds all the loose hair broke the first week I had it, so now all the hair falls all over the place, defeating the whole purpose of the vacuum keeping everything clean.  </li>
            <li>The internal vacuum is great because it means less beard trimmings on my sink!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: This trimmer does a fine job for the price, but when it fully breaks I&#x27;ll be looking for other options.</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer, so far it functions as expected - most of the other reviews on here covered pretty well the pros and cons of</li>
            <li>Other than that, the trimmer seems to work fine</li>
            <li>Vacuum function is really useful.</li>
            <li>so my experience may not be as useful as full-faced beard users but for me the trimmer works well and the vacuum features works</li>
            <li>The vacuum just isn&#x27;t that powerful.  </li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth the majority of hair is still picked up by the vacuum</li>
            <li>Vacuum is powerful but some hair pieces still go around</li>
            <li>The vacuum design for this model makes it fun to shave.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is also worth having, I thought it would just be a gimmick, but it helps.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think the vacuum part is as useful as made out.</li>
            <li>For what its worth, try another trimmer and dont go for vacuum marketing</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a very long time (through multiple uses) and catches most of the hair inside.  </li>
            <li>But then you have to clean the compartment anyway, so the trimmings still end up getting loose anyway.  </li>
            <li>ever try to dry shave a months worth of beard on a straight razor?</li>
            <li>I added their battery-powered detailing shaver/trimmer to my arsenal last year, as I maintain a close trimmed van dyke (goatee plus mustache).&lt;br /&gt;Hardly any trimmings left in the sink, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The trim is even and uniform across my entire face, and the LED readout which indicates the length of the hairs makes it easy to taper the length from facial hair to sideburns in increments from 1mm up to whatever length you like.  </li>
            <li>It also keeps drains clear since the vac makes it easy to empty as well.</li>
            <li>The product still works adequately, however I probably would not have spent as much money if I hadn&#x27;t thought i&#x27;d get both blades.  </li>
            <li>I keep my beard short, nearly stubble, and this trimmer works quick and with no pull.</li>
            <li>My shaver went strong for the next two weeks of daily use!</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is as you have it recharging it like to roll around, would be nice to have a flat surface on the back</li>
            <li>That said, and based on reading hundreds of reviews on other brands of similar trimmers - this may be the best beard trimmer (at least for some beards) on the market today.</li>
            <li>I do wonder if most of the users rate it after a single use and never look back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible but takes a bit of work to get the blades close right under the nose.</li>
            <li>right outside of the warranty period.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer a week and the digital display doesn&#x27;t work right already.</li>
            <li>this is the only one that get&#x27;s my beard to the right length.</li>
            <li>I have a very coarse beard and it cruises right through it</li>
            <li>but my scruff looks like garbage right now, and the length is so low I cant fade it or anything.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s time they improved the things that really need improvement instead of the things that don&#x27;t (the turbo, for me, is completely unnecessary and the lithium battery is nice, but not a big deal): e.g., a hard case for travel (this machine is very fragile and easily breaks in travel - i need to come up with my own ways to protect it), and a charger-dock (its shape makes it volatile on slippery surfaces, like, say, a sink edge).</li>
            <li>Other than the new digital display it works just as the original - - EXCEPT the old charger is not compatible with the new model, AND it does not come with the case as did the original.  </li>
            <li>- Holds charge for a very long time - Looks cool</li>
            <li>I read the negative ones more than I did the positive ones.</li>
            <li>I used the trimmer for less than 5 minutes over the course of the first week and the trimmer required another full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this trimmer for a new one thinking this was an anomaly.</li>
            <li>The battery charges quickly and holds the charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a long time and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum function is effective, avoiding the mess almost totally.</li>
            <li>The battery charges quickly and lasts long.</li>
            <li>works well, charge lasts quite long and re-charges quickly.</li>
            <li>Not quite close enough for a young professional who needs to look clean cut every day.</li>
            <li>The quick charge is a Dog-send, and the battery life is pleasantly long.</li>
            <li>It would not stay closed at all which is pretty important given that the vacuum is one of the main differentiators of this product.</li>
            <li>charger works quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I even use this to give me a quick buzz if I feel like my hair is getting too long</li>
            <li>Battery lasts a long time, charges quickly.</li>
            <li>Taking the clipper apart to clean the cutting mechanism is also very easy to do (not so with many other under $100 clippers!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the combination of features it offers; it has a very wide adjustable range and a hair catching vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li>The channel it uses to vaccumm the hair gets clogged too easily and is very hard to clean (because you aren&#x27;t supposed to use water on this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vacuum might not suck up every single hair, but gets most of them.</li>
            <li>The old Norelco (without vacuum) had clippings all over the sink and counter--the QT4070 vacuum captures around 97%, which leaves the sink and counter pretty clean.  </li>
            <li>I would go back to my old philips in the future as it was simple and works effectively.</li>
            <li>the sharp plastic tines cause the most painful trim I&#x27;ve ever experienced  3) on 2 separate occasions, after setting the trimmer to level \\&quot;7\\&quot;, the guard has moved right in the middle of trimming- causing a large bald strip in my beard.  </li>
            <li>The last time I used this trimmer, I actually left off the heads for a closer trim and it was fine.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that it is relatively quiet, in comparison to an older trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised, it trims your beard without the mess in the sink or on the floor via the handy vacuum.  </li>
            <li>The hair guard is pretty decent, and gives you loads of options, so big plus there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not very user friendly.</li>
            <li>First, the comb head is cheaply made from soft, pliable plastic that bends, causing the trim to be uneven.   </li>
            <li>Looks classy in every way, but it&#x27;s really the EXACT same thing as the QT4050, literally .  </li>
            <li>guide is SHARP and doesn&#x27;t move smoothly over your face.  </li>
            <li>The customer rep was fantastic and sent one out to me with no hassle or questions other than to confirm the order.  </li>
            <li>the Qt4070 leaves a little more stubble than the old model, about 1 or 1 and 1/2 day&#x27;s growth, which is acceptable to me.</li>
            <li>You can quickly select the length you want, and the vacuum works as claimed, with almost no mess in my sink.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this, but it is the first and only one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>: Jim, we have reported this issue and the new QT4070</li>
            <li>: The contour comb is now included with the new QT4070 package.&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li>Every time I use it I get a new ingrown hair that gets infected.  </li>
            <li>but it when need a new one.</li>
            <li>After receiving the new QT4070</li>
            <li>Concluded it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>So now they are sending me a new 4070</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use this anymore and have ordered a new rechargable Wahl trim n vac which should be in soon.  </li>
            <li>After fully charging the new QT4070.</li>
            <li>I called Norelco about this and they shipped me a new one.  </li>
            <li>so I have had to buy a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>His shaver died and he needed a new one.</li>
            <li>I got this new model as a gift.  </li>
            <li>The new one arrived today, I charged it up and tried it.  </li>
            <li>I am new to electric shaving, so I was looking forward to some advice and tips.</li>
            <li>so I had to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>the display on it, and the suction is alright nothing I couldn&#x27;t live without, but makes things easier for cleanup.</li>
            <li>By chance, I today read the answers on this site to questions others had posed about this trimmer and learned Norelco added a new contoured comb to this trimmer after complaints from purchasers.  </li>
            <li>I called Norelco (866-779-0279) to purchase the new contoured comb.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new one in 2012.</li>
            <li>great--like new</li>
            <li>Look out new and improve me.</li>
            <li>downgrading a star for this, so - 4 star is my new grade.</li>
            <li>i bought this product about a year ago and its still like new.</li>
            <li>So I soaked just the blade in water-downed dish soap (Dawn), scrubbed it with a toothbrush and now the trimmer works like new.  </li>
            <li>And now I have this new one and have used it maybe three or four times and, already</li>
            <li>I dealt with it for a month or two, just holding the door shut... and debated on taping it shut or buying a new one.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no guarantee that the new one will have the comb, but we&#x27;re rolling the dice.  </li>
            <li>This one was also brand new, in the box and DID have the contour comb.  </li>
            <li>but i live alone so wouldn&#x27;t disturb someone sleeping.  </li>
            <li>The wifey loves the new cleaner-messy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking to buy my husband something to keep his newly grown beard</li>
            <li>His new toy I guess.  </li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;First off the one and two star reviews that mention the lack of the contour comb attachment are now invalid - it now includes it AND the new stubble</li>
            <li>Needed to find a new trimmer that could produce a stubble beard.</li>
            <li>The new one doesn&#x27;t cut evenly.</li>
            <li>so I had to get a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Philips and they immediately expedited a new one to me.  </li>
            <li>with this new one.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco sent a new one, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for a new trimmer to replace this one soon and this one will be going to the thrift store.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this new model.</li>
            <li>new model arrived.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s new</li>
            <li>May be hard to get at the mustache; otherwise, I really like it and am sure you will too.</li>
            <li>After I got familiar with the settings, it was much easier to use than the Remington that I owned previously.</li>
            <li>I bought this reluctantly after pieces broke on my last Philips trimmer, and its battery didn&#x27;t last long enough to give me a good trim, nor was it powerful enough.</li>
            <li>I have been using Philips Norelco for over 30 years, I wish I could add some old features into this new design and make one heck of a trimmer!</li>
            <li>Really liked the vacuum feature which kept the little hairs off my shirt.</li>
            <li>The parts listing in the instructions on the replacement clearly showed two combs, rather than the single \\&quot;trimming comb\\&quot; listed in the instructions for the original.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for 2 years now and the battery that started out strong (would last forever on a charge) just went down hill very fast.  </li>
            <li>Only time will tell if it holds up, but really it&#x27;s cheap enough that one could buy a new one every five or six months if need be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that the battery holds a charge much longer than the old one, even when the old one was new.</li>
            <li>It is harder to clean the cut hair out of it than a pull drawer, which I had with my previous&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t care less, so I wanted a fool-proof easy solution.</li>
            <li>This one is harder to clean too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>This had to be done for a reason, because if this unit was properly tested before it was released to consumers, this design flaw would instantly come to light.  </li>
            <li>Now it just kind of stays almost closed until I empty it.</li>
            <li>As far as this particular product is concerned:</li>
            <li>I originally had an older model (blue with a pull out vacuum hopper) and switched to this one a year or two ago.  </li>
            <li>The shaver holds a charge for a few weeks and has a really nice blue indicator for the power and length of cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>over all this is a 3 star product, it cuts (though misses a good amount of hair) and saves some time and guess work, yet you need a secondary smaller trimmer to finish the job.</li>
            <li>Trims like professional instrument producing effortless uniformity, and without the &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; mentioned in older reviews.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, it does what I intended it to do; trim my beard evenly with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>Still does an excellent job of cutting at various heights and it stays for weeks between charges.</li>
            <li>Never really been able to give myself that look with my myriad of different trimmers - until now.  </li>
            <li>the fit and finish is what you would expect with a low to mid level consumer device.  </li>
            <li>The QT4070 has a gap between the top guard and the side guard, which leaves the cutting surface more exposed.  </li>
            <li>Once it is off, open the hair filled chamber, tap opposite side and into trash can.</li>
            <li>The shave, even with the comb removed (thus the closest shave possible) is really not 5 o&#x27;clock shadow level - it&#x27;s more like 24-hours</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve spent over an hour on the phone trying to get the desired contour following comb and my time is precious like yours.</li>
            <li>Have used/still use multiple, various razors and trimmers, primarily Norelco and Braun.  </li>
            <li>&gt;* Found out that the best and fastest way to give me that stubble look is to remove the guide head entirely (0 mm) and use the cutting blades in a downward motion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product, but be prepared to replace it near a year in.</li>
            <li>recently tried to see if the two \\&quot;blade heads\\&quot; on my last Norelco fit this razor and they did.  </li>
            <li>least it looks more streamlined, and functions more or less identically.</li>
            <li>I can still use the old one by using masking tape to replace the latch, but this makes cleanup a lot more trouble (beard trimmings stick to the tape too).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time with poorly designed trimmers, the norelco is your best choice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it, does exactly what I expected, especially the short cut down to 1 mm.</li>
            <li>Has many useful features and the hair clipping vacuum function actually works, especially when trimming using short setting.</li>
            <li>It is, again, not a very precise product, but this method works fine for</li>
            <li>I only use it every other day and it is rare that I go a full week without having to plug it in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this trimmer get off the fence, build a new fence, climb on top and get off it again just to show the Philiips Norelco QT4070 how much you mean it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vacuum does work in normal use, but be aware it is not going to work on a bird&#x27;s nest beard -</li>
            <li>Vacuum system works very well and a real sink-cleaning time saver.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>While it does catch a lot of hair, there is still a good amount that falls in the sink, and the way the head is designed, the hair keeps getting caught where the vacuum sucks the hair in.</li>
            <li>For those who have complained about the vacuum not working well I would imagine you had a fairly good beard when you did this.  </li>
            <li>the vacuum works even better than expected.</li>
            <li>vacuum works better than expected</li>
            <li>Vacuum works better than expected.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature works way better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li>The vacuum concept works better than expected.</li>
            <li>This trimmer performs well at all settings, the battery maintains charge well, and the vacuum feature works way better than expected.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that said the guard wasn&#x27;t right, but as stated earlier, all are shipping with the new and old guard, so you can change them as you</li>
            <li>Yes, the instructions are very clear this unit is not waterproof, but I tried it anyway.</li>
            <li>The latter point seems to be a huge design flaw, leaving the razors entirely exposed and ultimately shearing skin twice in the first use before I resigned to using the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; head.</li>
            <li>It has a digital display that is very useful and tells you when the battery needs recharging/partially charged and fully charged by use of different colours.</li>
            <li>it is also very loud.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to guys who want to keep their beard in shape or who want to maintain  that 3 day old scuzz look.</li>
            <li>Battery doesn&#x27;t last very much if using the turbo function.</li>
            <li>(the small trimmer was available for the older model and works very</li>
            <li>after I received my new CONTOUR FOLLOWING COMB, the QT4070 is a FIVE-star trimmer--it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>after I received my new CONTOUR FOLLOWING COMB, the QT4070 is a FIVE-star trimmer--it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the new razor delivered:  A close shave, ease of use and most importantly no more stubble in the sink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Where they would naturally meet and form a right angle, someone (who obviously has never used a beard trimmer on themselves) decided those two parts did NOT need to connect.</li>
            <li>My old version of this died and this picked right up where it left off.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting a razor for a shorter stubble beard, but since I am light BLOND, it needs to be a little longer to give the same effect many guys with darker hair can have with even a single day&#x27;s shadow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get the mustache hair closest to my nose, but other than that, works great.</li>
            <li>we have first in appearance is a very modern, sleek looking accessory that has a blue digital readout.</li>
            <li>My only complaint, and maybe that is just my not being used to it, is that the trimmer is too wide to do a very good job in trimming the mustache.</li>
            <li>New trimmers now include two different guards, so it was unnecessary for me to contact Norelco to obtain a more comfortable guard.</li>
            <li>It takes about 10mins to do, is noisy but makes very little mess in the bathroom, and has really great results.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is great, Cuts uneven, hard to get straight edges....</li>
            <li>The only other con is the cumbersome shape of the cutter itself makes it less than great for side burn trimming.</li>
            <li>The vacuum component makes trimming care free without the need to clean up hairs which usually fall all over the sink and vanity top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The design makes it very easy to maintain a beard and keep it neat while the vacuum feature prevents a mess all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li>in all, this is keeping my old grey beard in good shape with very little effort.</li>
            <li>good product overall , the little vacuum cleaner is a bonus and works for me</li>
            <li>Too bad then I am forced to continue using the most awesome beard trimmer I have had in 15 years of beard trimming.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one back in 2007</li>
            <li>- Adjustable length with digital display make to find and maintain a consistent trim&lt;br</li>
            <li>It picks up virtually all the cut hair, and the tiny amounts it doesn&#x27;t get is pretty trivial.</li>
            <li>This is the first public review of a product I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
            <li>Like Conair and many others that were small hair trimmers with an attachment to cut the beard to length.</li>
            <li>Batteries and overall performance are stellar.</li>
            <li>My current model was purchased in 2013 and I was interested in upgrading to the 2015 version.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty quiet clipper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty darn big.    </li>
            <li>I keep my beard pretty short (4-5mm)</li>
            <li>Having to use a different product first then follow with this is a joke</li>
            <li>It has the exact same comb as the t980</li>
            <li>They recommend starting with a higher setting and descending until you reach the desired length.  </li>
            <li>So it was with some nervousness that I approached actually using the product for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it actually seems to allow a much better control of actual \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; length than was possible for me before with the floating guide on the T980...</li>
            <li>This is most likely due to cutter lubrication getting in there</li>
            <li>First, I thought that once I set trimmer for proper length, for me 5 mm.</li>
            <li>He wore the first one out and specifically asked for the same brand again.  </li>
            <li>I have a short beard and have tried many other brands before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two (first one last 5 years).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OLD time!</li>
            <li>Overall exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>cant say how disappointed i am that they discontinued the best trimmer ever made...</li>
            <li>One thing to be aware of is that, if you intend to use this product outside of the US, you will need an adaptor for your country of residance.</li>
            <li>The compartment that holds the hair needs to be cleaned out pretty regularly.  </li>
            <li>I use it probably 2-3 times per week to keep my beard in check, and with that the battery usually lasts a month or more.</li>
            <li>It works great, assuming you move slowly and work the same area several times.</li>
            <li>i left the first one at a hotel.</li>
            <li>For the price I would expect it to do a much better job than the $20 Target pickup from years past.</li>
            <li>Fans of the late lamented Norelco T980 vacuum beard trimmer will find a worthy replacement in the QT 4070, which does everything the T980 did and offers a better battery and illuminated display in the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Use your considerable influence, Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Also, unlike other people who purchased this trimmer, mine came with appropriate contour comb so no call to Philips was necessary (ordered in March of 2012).</li>
            <li>Gives me the exact same size of stubble throughout my beard and charges with no problems.</li>
            <li>Bought it after the battery in my old Norelco trimmer (which never lasted for more than a few trims) died completely.  </li>
            <li>I keep pretty short hair on my head and during work travels</li>
            <li>No small pieces, no moving parts, no chance of failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you only need the first 3 for a stubble</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a number of other trimmers and never been satisfied, but finally the QT4070 has come along.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 2-3 weeks into using this trimmer, and it is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>for the overall shave, it&#x27;s pretty inconsistent.</li>
            <li>I do not have a full   beard, just a partial, so your charging cycles will vary.</li>
            <li>So, I am still using the old one and counting the days until my new part shows up for the new model.  </li>
            <li>The positive attributes are the comb, which directs the hair in a particular way if you wish to have a longer length; and the adjustable hair lengths is the other positive attribute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my upper lip more than once using this thing, and I&#x27;m a very careful user.  </li>
            <li>What i found was that the second guard worked fine, but really didnt cut the stubble short enough.  </li>
            <li>Hair does not shake out as easily as with a removable trap, but the little tool brush helps sweep it out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s designed that way so that the little built-in vaccuum cleaner can easily suck up the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that you need to exercise a little caution with trimming your mustache on lower settings to avoid nicking your lip, but this is easily resolved by adjusting the angle of your cut.  </li>
            <li>easily, catches shavings an leaves little excess hair outof the unit.  </li>
            <li>WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE, EVE A CLUTZ LIKE I AM CAN DO WONDERS WITH THIS EASY TO USE DEVICE.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is better than the earlier one especially with the &amp;#34;Turbo-boost&amp;#34; switch.</li>
            <li>The regular speed and vacuum power is really more than enough, so I am wondering why they gave it a \\&quot;turbo boost\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li>I like to get a nice clean line at the edge of my lip and the bulky trimmer prevents me from seeing where I&#x27;m cutting.  </li>
            <li>I have had other vacuum trimmers and one will be at the top in ranking.</li>
            <li>In order to keep the sink relatively clean I have to empty it 3 times to complete a bi-weekly trim.  </li>
            <li>This model is more difficult to clean out.  </li>
            <li>The Vacuum is weak but what a nice tool!</li>
            <li>This trimmer seemed to be the best reviewed - with the least serious complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I suppose the vacuum would have to be ten times stronger to meet my original expectations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time to shave my thick beard and it worked fine, just as expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I felt I had to write this review because the ones written so far seemed to be giving it a bad rap, and if there had been more positive reviews (I can only speak from my experience with my own medium length beard)</li>
            <li>the new positive reviews from the last 6 montys</li>
            <li>The included brush suffices to clean miscellaneous hairs stuck to the blades (which conveniently require no oiling or other maintenance).</li>
            <li>charging time.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shave as clean as some other trimmers - leaves about 1-1.5 mm.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is an excellent feature, but the blade head is too big and impossible to use for precise trimming (upper lip, sideburns, ect).  </li>
            <li>so i purchased this product because  the concept of Vacuum Beard interested me.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, the vacuum feature works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I bought one of Norelco&#x27;s first vacuum beard trimmers some years ago.  </li>
            <li>Vacuum hair collector is a real plus!</li>
            <li>I miss the pop-up mustache trimmer that my first Norelco trimmer had, but the vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t leave room for one.</li>
            <li>The vacuum function does not work at all, after first use</li>
            <li>The one major complaint I have about this is that it kept catching and pulling on hairs which stung.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is neat and works pretty well.</li>
            <li>travel lock is great, it works well except hard to get in near the nose/mustache part of the beard due to</li>
            <li>I also used the trimmer on setting 6 or so to trim my mustache, something I&#x27;ve never really done before with any precision; the 4070 did a super efficient job, and for the first time ever my mustache actually looked neat and I felt I could rejoin society.  </li>
            <li>This product, with no attachment, WILL work to trim your beard down to a level where a once-over with normal razor will leave you with a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another issue is that due to the design of the blade guard, you cannot really trim right up under the nose.  </li>
            <li>I tried this on numerous occasions and it consitently missed hairs or left whole areas much longer or much shorter than everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually purchase this product from Amazon, I actually rushed by a local retail outlet even though I had to pay $10 more, since I had a professional engagement and needed grooming in a hurry.</li>
            <li>So in summary, I really have no clue why this product has such a high user rating.</li>
            <li>My problem with this trimmer, as many people have mentioned, is that it leaves a very uneven shave.</li>
            <li>There just flat out aren&#x27;t any good cordless trimmers that are strong enough/long lasting enough to get a beard trimmed up without it taking over 30 minutes and having to re-trim the same area over and over to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not very good for trimming mustache/under the nose, too bulky to get an even trim.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it catches hair and reduces the mess in the sink for easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer vacuum collects a majority of the trimmed hairs and clean up is a breeze would definitely buy again</li>
            <li>I am coming from a T970 which I enjoyed using for a couple years now, and one of the features I was sad to be losing was that the t970 came with a special detail trimming head if you remove the guide.  </li>
            <li>I love the LCD display, the life on the battery is long, the vacum really helps to reduce the mess.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the battery lasts forever and the built-in vacuum works great as long as the hair isn&#x27;t too long and isn&#x27;t wet.  </li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t shave everyday, the hairs start getting too heavy to be vacuumed properly, causing the vacuum feature to not be as awesome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vacuum on this model appears to be more powerful, picking up all my shorter hairs, and only having a bit of trouble with longer hairs.</li>
            <li>I purchased this beard trimmer because I have sensitive skin and live in the NE.  </li>
            <li>The new model uses a lithium ion battery versus the old NiCad -</li>
            <li>Are you going to spend nearly $30 for a new cutter head when you paid $45 for the unit?  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco T765 stopped charging, so I bought this new model.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Norelco T980 that I had used for 7 years with this new model Norelco QT4070.</li>
            <li>The month before the spring mechanism of the contour-following comb broke and that made the comb less comfortable.</li>
            <li>The QT4050 says the exact same thing, but the picture online for that product clearly shows the pivoting contour comb.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, it does shave closer, albeit slightly less comfortably.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer has the power to easy handle my goatee without pulling or missing</li>
            <li>I like how it trims everything easily and isn&#x27;t too messy.</li>
            <li>First the display started showing inaccurate information (ie battery level) and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn off until it died completely and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on at all.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with the settings slipping, no problem with the suction which worked as well as anyone could expect and my beard trimmed evenly, quickly and perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Now I have a full set of facial hair that within several days grow quite out of control.</li>
            <li>something that would keep my beard short enough that I might still have a goatee as opposed to a full beard; yet, something that would preclude nicks and cuts that might cause breakouts.      </li>
            <li>Only reason i keep it is that it does a fair, not good job, of doing an even trim even for longer curly bread heard</li>
            <li>the only way to make it work again is to put it back on the charger for a full charging period.  </li>
            <li>However I am on my second and the first wasn&#x27;t even a year old.  </li>
            <li>my other clippers cut stubble nice and short,  they just don&#x27;t have a vacuum,  </li>
            <li>Im super careful when doing my lip because of all the warnings people had,</li>
            <li>so i was careful but still quite quick with it.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve had several occasions when a full battery is immediately drained, simply by pushing the power button.</li>
            <li>Pretty solid so far.</li>
            <li>I have to clean up far more after even a casual trim.</li>
            <li>It already came with the special guide mentioned by some other reviewers.</li>
            <li>He loves the product, he never gets nicks, the settings are very convenient and the little vacuum keeps the counter clean!</li>
            <li>, I would have preferred a washable trimmer instead of a vacuum system one, I spend more time cleaning the trimmer that cutting my beard, and the vacuum system isn&#x27;t perfect, it make some mess frequently.</li>
            <li>Be sure to open on the other side, I can see that a good pull on the wrong side could break the door.</li>
            <li>First off, my original prime order, was not marked as delivered until the third day, in which it never actually arrived.</li>
            <li>However after about one year&#x27;s use, one day all of sudden the battery just broke down and couldn&#x27;t hold any charge any more.</li>
            <li>I use it to keep a pretty consistent stubble and to shave down my sideburns.</li>
            <li>To some extent it really pulls the hair into vacuum chamber while trimming but not as much I expected, I still have to clean up the fallen hair.</li>
            <li>This new design trims just as well, and work a lot better in the tight spaces around my upper lip/nose.  </li>
            <li>First off the old one I have had a spring loaded slide where the vacuum would suck the whiskers.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a competing product with built-in vacuum from any other manufacture, so I decided to go with the Qt4070 despite mixed reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not perfect, the battery is very good, one month of use with a single charge...</li>
            <li>Was very loud and the trim guard makes it hard to get the space between your top lip and your nose.</li>
            <li>If it lasts at least as long as my last one did (15 years), it truly will be a great investment.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s essentially mess free.</li>
            <li>trims very well, but the item i received is not the design of the one in the first picture, it is however the same as the pic further in the album.</li>
            <li>As one who is generally disappointed by nearly every gadget I buy in one way or another, I am surprised to say that this is indeed the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Overall, Good product with cool features but somehow has troubles cutting all my hairs.</li>
            <li>The little notches that keep it closed are cheap plastic and because it fills with hair so quickly, you have to use the door all the time.</li>
            <li>The Remington model is about half the price and ten times better at trimming your beard.</li>
            <li>But its impossible to have a perfect shave with only this machine.</li>
            <li>They are basically they same, although I got more with my T980 which I also paid less</li>
            <li>This trimmer is a definite step up from my older Norelco, which essentially had only the most basic feature of a trimmer:  </li>
            <li>Replaced the slightly older model as I forgot the older one when traveling back to the USA for an extended period.</li>
            <li>I like this unit due to the fact that the guard setting can simply be rotated in, a very cool feature.  </li>
            <li>I have down graded my original review to two stars and that is generous.</li>
            <li>I went with this one because the [[ASIN:B002C741MM Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer]] is selling for 4x the original cost due to demand!</li>
            <li>no mess!</li>
            <li>My old trimmer made a huge mess in the sink every time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different trimmers and have been less than happy.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item on the basis of reviews which said the device is fine, the problem is that they omitted the contour comb, but you can obtain the missing part by calling the company.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and so far I&#x27;ve used it for about 30-40 minutes in total and haven&#x27;t charged it since the initial charge.</li>
            <li>The previous version of this vacuum trimmer seemed to work better for me.  </li>
            <li>While better than my previous, the vacuum catches about 85% of the trimmings (even on the turbo setting)</li>
            <li>Quieter and this vacuum works better than the previous model I owned.</li>
            <li>I like a very little amount of stubble, so with this Norelco model I can trim my beard without a comb and just get a very close shave, without it being clean.</li>
            <li>Less trim blades than the previous model, importantly, and the reason for return, the new super battery does not hold a charge...</li>
            <li>To change the cut depth, you rotate a thumb-friendly control that both physically raises and lowers the removable guard, and also lights up a large and easy-to-see LED readout that gives the depth in millimeters.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know it is mine only like this or others also have same problem, but I am very dissapointed with battery life, I thought first that after few charges it will improve but it is same battery meter lines just drops and have to recharge it again, so I have to use it plugged most of the time.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am wrong on that, but one thing I am right on is this is not near as good as the old model I had at TRIMMING YOUR BEARD.  </li>
            <li>Large range of length settings, starting from 1mm.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the new type \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot; is as good as the one on the old T980, but with a bit of attention it works well enough for me to do the job with only a little poking and snagging on my face.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the chamber big enough, but even the vacuum \\&quot;tunnel\\&quot; (between blades and chamber) remains pretty free as well.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good product, but its difficult to judge if it is better than a trimmer at half</li>
            <li>Such a tremendous waste of resources and poor design on an otherwise great device.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trimmer is less than 30 days old now and the vacuum chamber won&#x27;t close any more.</li>
            <li>The blades on this thing are cheap, which I tried to overlook, but my little Wahl Lithium ION has way nicer blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A helpless feeling came over me because as it grew, I knew the mess my trimmer would create became larger, and drowning in my own fear and facial hair</li>
            <li>There will still be some hairs left in the sink, but the vast majority of them are sucked up by the vacuum for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>Very different from the previous vacuum model, but I liked it.  </li>
            <li>And trimming directly with the metallic head works, but is not very pleasant - and the result could be better.  </li>
            <li>It trimmed so smoothly and with so little mess that I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working---until I checked my beard and the vacuum chamber and saw how well it was doing.</li>
            <li>Lastly, while the unit claimed to be able to hold an extra-long charge, in the two instances that I used it, the charge was completely gone after single and relatively brief beard trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Still long enough to clean up my beard...</li>
            <li>Long lasting battery and gone are the days where I have to clean up the sink when I&#x27;m done shaving/trimming.  </li>
            <li>I cannot more highly recommend a personal grooming item short of toilet paper, if it can be counted as such.</li>
            <li>Can run a little warm but that&#x27;s to be expected with any sheering mechanism as the friction builds up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I examined closely and the cheap little plastic tab on the door had basically worn out/bent in too far.</li>
            <li>It worked a little better in protecting my face because the space between the sides of the comb, in which the razor sits, was smaller</li>
            <li>The suction could be a little better, but it definitely helps keep things cleaner.</li>
            <li>it is hard to find a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>Hard to trim mustache area, and most importantly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In a world where you have limited time to shave your face thicket and even less to clean the sink below you there comes the mighty Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li>My only complaint which existed on the T980 is that I have a hard time trimming right under my nose, I have to remove the guard and carefully trim my moustache area right under my nose, but I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at</li>
            <li>The vacuum does pick up most of the hair trimmings, however it does miss some and there still is a slight mess to clean up in the sink when finished.</li>
            <li>Works great on my husbands very thick roughage.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of the vacuum container, but it certainly was not sufficient when i took off 2 months of beard growth.</li>
            <li>I only use it every other day during the work week but even using it every day you can easily get a week out of one charge.  </li>
            <li>The charge seems to last long, so you could get to those special places.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my first with the built in vacuum which does a fairly decent job of preventing larger cleanup efforts.  </li>
            <li>This cheaper design has a fixed head that has flexible, pointy tines that approach the blades from either side but leave a large gap over the blades themselves and the vacuum entrance.  </li>
            <li>No other trimmer had vacuum, and it really works well!</li>
            <li>Well, the vacuum part of it does seem to work, so the whiskers mostly end up in the little compartment.  </li>
            <li>Every day is just more than my husband is going to do, so I wish the vacuum was a little stronger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Subjectively, the vacuum catches a little more hair than my old one, though still not all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t get every whisker but it was so much better than no vacuum and worked at least as well as is reasonable to expect.  </li>
            <li>Vacuum is a little effective with pulling in next to 70-80% hair in the trimmer</li>
            <li>and it just seems like a huge waste of resources.</li>
            <li>On this unit, the Norelco engineers clearly decided to add an element of danger to the trimming process by modifying the design of the plastic guard, and thus leaving the blade virtually exposed on the shortest settings.  </li>
            <li>It is several upgrades form my last one especially with the lithium battery that makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>When you hold it, one can clearly see the length of the trim in millimeters and the remaining charge.</li>
            <li>Conversely, Philips did produce a \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; beard trimmer that was woefully under-performing and cumbersome, so this line of trimmers is clearly an improvement.</li>
            <li>I almost steered clear of this product based upon some of the reviews I read below.  </li>
            <li>, i always have to be careful where i trim (especially for the 0.5 stubble) because it makes a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;door hinge/lock&amp;#34; broke almost immediately</li>
            <li>The agent also mentioned that I can rinse the head under water, but the manual clearly says not to.</li>
            <li>The guard height is a backlit digital number - much easier to see than the old one.</li>
            <li>I made it extremely clear</li>
            <li>Its has a clear number display that lights up showing the head length.</li>
            <li>This is clearly a feature that Phillips either took out oradded at some point in the production.  </li>
            <li>The unit that I received did NOT have the guard with the spring actuating clear guard that follows the contours of your face.  </li>
            <li>They have made several improvements in this model over the old trimmer that I definitely appreciated.</li>
            <li>Much stronger than my old Norelco, which held on by a tiny clip&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Previously, the sliding piece would adjust to the angle of my skin and allow for a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Wife agreed to pay half to keep the sink clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve run the 2 units side by side, both fully charged, and suction difference of the vacuums can be clearly heard.  </li>
            <li>Catches about half what it cuts, so you still have to clean up.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a T980 Philips Norelco beard trimmer that was about 6 or 7 years old.</li>
            <li>It works and is okay, but it is not nearly as effective as the T980.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original Entry:&lt;br /&gt;Having read so much about the contour comb issue, I chatted with Philips-Norelco and got the following information.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have it near anything to accidently trigger it and drain it.</li>
            <li>&quot; his old beard and mustache trimmer</li>
            <li>I found that for very short whisker lengths this worked very well</li>
            <li>Just like my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s intended to do as far as trimming.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t even use it for a long time because it scratches your skin, and the metal teeth get so hot that burns you.</li>
            <li>They should of kept making the old T- 980</li>
            <li>So concerned that I contacted Norelco directly.  </li>
            <li>They fixed the spring loaded comb problem.</li>
            <li>I thought I would just need to be more delicate when shaving with it.</li>
            <li>Bought this trimmer to replace my old Norelco</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li>Then I waited with the unopened box for a week until I decided to risk opening it, and here the contour following comb was inside the box the whole time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably bump it up to 4 if I really like it, but not 5 for having to order an extra part.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten used to using on old Wahl Trim N Vac with the guard removed.  </li>
            <li>However I also have a goatee and trim it weekly with an old Norelco that was rechargeable but losing the ability to hold the charge.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use my old trimmer until Philips can install lithium batteries that can hold their charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow I believed this until I tried it.</li>
            <li>The trimmings have to go somewhere, and seeing where they go, at least, might be better than not seeing.</li>
            <li>..I&#x27;ve noticed so far...</li>
            <li>They have fixed that issue here.  </li>
            <li>They direct hair into the row of blades for trimming, and the length at which they are set by the user should provide for an even trim.  </li>
            <li>You have too hold the trimmer nearly perpendicular to your face to get any trimming done.</li>
            <li>It trims and collects all the hair quite well, charges rapidly, and doesn&#x27;t nick my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used it once and returned it since trying to trim it was a hit/miss situation where in some part it completely removed my beard and in some part it cut to what I set it to.</li>
            <li>The beard length settings are way too far apart.  </li>
            <li>And as the cutter is near the corner of the shaver, it will go as close to a curved surface as you let it--no guide to help out.</li>
            <li>You can also shave very close with this trimmer (no guide on the corner), for those that want such a thing.</li>
            <li>For those like me with sensitive skin, not a plus.    </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine them coming up with this prototype and having guys try it who have used early models.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>And, although not the most convenient solution, there at least seemed to be a solution to the comb issue... call and ask for the contour comb.</li>
            <li>and I really like all the different sizes it has and the way it presents them.</li>
            <li>I had been using painter&#x27;s tape to keep my old trimmer from doing that.  </li>
            <li>I can re-use an old one but</li>
            <li>And of course the product has to be held at an angle to be used, the blades are set back from the leading edge, and no hair ever grows straight</li>
            <li>I asked my wife if it looks professional (and she thinks 24-36 hrs of beard on me does), and she said &amp;#34;no, that just looks like you haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple/few days.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Norelco T980 when it gave up after a couple of years.</li>
            <li>is complete each time.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, mind you, and not once has the trimmer nicked or cut it.  </li>
            <li>It cuts very well and I like that it has the digital readout for the blade length and battery strength.</li>
            <li>have a professional Wahl clippers that I will continue to use instead.</li>
            <li>I was surprised it worked</li>
            <li>Which isn&#x27;t a big deal really.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does catch some, but it is by far &amp;#34;mess-free&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>And the LED display is a real plus especially for knowing when you need to charge it.</li>
            <li>Besides that fiasco, I was expecting some type of travel pouch to come with the trimmer, since on the Amazon product page, it clearly has pouch check marked as one of the features that comes with the 4070.</li>
            <li>Arrived early, and I have used the product for over a month without charging it.  </li>
            <li>It significantly reduces the mess that you would otherwise have if it didn&#x27;t collect any trimmings.  </li>
            <li>My old trimmer stopped holding a charge and became a corded trimmer.</li>
            <li>It was not comfortable to use for precise trimming around the mouth and nose because it scratched/poked my lips and nostrils.  </li>
            <li>not cut even close to the claimed 1mm stubble setting, even with the guide completely removed</li>
            <li>so I am unable to write a detailed review, however he likes it and says it better than the last one he had.</li>
            <li>The blades are inset too far to work as a mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably one of the laziest people alive when it comes to beard grooming.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, isn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li>I prefer a medium to shorter length beard and found it either would not trim this length well, or would only trim for me at the stubble settings, much shorter than I preferred.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; setting is a bit ineffective and found it easier to remove the guard all together and take to the face directly.</li>
            <li>Ive used so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades seem absolutely identical to the T780, and that looks like the only component that is interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The blades seem absolutely identical to the T780, and that looks like the only component that is interchangeable.</li>
            <li>You need to hold the trimmer almost completely perpendicular to your skin to get the blades to touch the edges of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:October 2014</li>
            <li>but then you have to be near an outlet.</li>
            <li>At this point you might as well buy a $40 T-edger trimmer that will last you much longer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i imagine i just got a defective unit as far as the battery goes,  </li>
            <li>Went straight back to this baby.</li>
            <li>i read most of the negative reviews</li>
            <li>This product really surprised me.</li>
            <li>this unit, the plastic is so soft on the blade guard that rather than causing the hair to stand up, the guard just bends.</li>
            <li>I purchased this nearly 2 years ago to the day.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned the trimmings out of the cutter unit and fixed the jam.  </li>
            <li>so Phillips have fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised, however.  </li>
            <li>The QT4070 digital readout ensures I have it set to the correct length, and lets me know how much battery power remains.    </li>
            <li>I can diversify my professional look to a tailored beard or stubble</li>
            <li>After 3 years of ownership it died and the old model was replaced by this</li>
            <li>Problems started early on.</li>
            <li>AT LEAST , TRIMS A LOT MORE  </li>
            <li>Regardless, the trimmer came with one of the old style guides as well, so it looks like they&#x27;ve learned their lesson on that one.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a hurry or just don&#x27;t have the time for a complete shave then this is for you.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco completely met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to replace my old Philips trimmer that this one updated.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very well made trimmer.</li>
            <li>I used it on both the 1mm and 0mm (removing the guard completely) settings.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>The Trimmer is loud.</li>
            <li>My old one held a charge for years before giving up the ghost.  </li>
            <li>The bigger one included can still shave very close</li>
            <li>Removing the guard gives access to the clippers directly.  </li>
            <li>No problem trimming near nose area.</li>
            <li>I still cannot get the desired length I once had with my old trimmer....</li>
            <li>As a result, the trimmer either trims to a very close stubble length, or does not trim enough, depending on how you angle the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Oh also my old one use to flash orange when it needed to be charged</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Norelco trimmer for years, but the old one had an irreparable fault.</li>
            <li>but when I tried to use it at my destination I found it completely</li>
            <li>Caught nearly all of the beard.</li>
            <li>Does not trim as closely as my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>It indeed has the spring-loaded comb as well as a fixed one.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the fixed comb yet but having it means that if the spring loaded one gets damaged you can still use the trimmer.</li>
            <li>This Norelco can&#x27;t do it nearly as close.  </li>
            <li>the \\&quot;old technology\\</li>
            <li>It has now died completely after 2 years and 3 months post-purchase.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;m really surprised this isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li>If you use this on your head, you must not tilt the trimmer at all or your hair will be exposed directly to the blades.  </li>
            <li>The Qt4070 is the updated version of my old Philips Norelco Turbo beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After three months Fox Industries contacted me directly to take care of the back-ordered part issue.  </li>
            <li>It felt like it was pulling them out completely rather than trimming them.</li>
            <li>The two comb guards that provide height adjustment don&#x27;t completely cover the clippers.  </li>
            <li>Overall very satisfy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>However, you can fully retract the length guide and expose the cutters so that you can have complete</li>
            <li>the turbo is a joke, just loud.</li>
            <li>(that finally completely wore out).&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Mine came with both covers so the company must have got the feedback and fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>If my old one had a corded mode I would probably still be using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmings door broke early on.</li>
            <li>It is much faster and easier to do the two-phase approach (trimmer, then blade shave) than to try to make a five-blade razor chop through 1/4 to 1/2 inch facial hair.</li>
            <li>So far it has fulfilled its purpose.  </li>
            <li>Vacuums up about 80% of trimmings; all problems that the device might once have had seem completely resolved.</li>
            <li>Definitely a dual-use device that performs very well.</li>
            <li>Overall, really dig it.</li>
            <li>The unit is much bulkier than my last one.</li>
            <li>Dear Amazon Shopper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be clear, for the vast majority of you, this trimmer is not likely to be worth $50.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cordless, which is convenient, but I&#x27;m rarely far from the sink, so I can&#x27;t comment on battery life.  </li>
            <li>So far he hasn&#x27;t had any problems, but he worries a bit that the door that holds the hairs might break eventually.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I remove the comb completely and just trim away.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t use the combs, I cut directly to the lowest hair length.</li>
            <li>Also the comb adjustment is stiffer and the comb doesn&#x27;t accidentally change position during use like the old Norelco used to sometimes.</li>
            <li>and god forbid you get near the beard</li>
            <li>so I decided they would have fixed the issue.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this newer model and found out that I mis-calculated - they do not seem to have fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li>QT 4070 does as advertised but it&#x27;s loud ...</li>
            <li>Replaced my old Norelco and it is improved over that one.</li>
            <li>He had another Norelco shaver, but it wasn&#x27;t quite as loud.</li>
            <li>My early bday gift to self was quite a treat.  </li>
            <li>Husband loves it as now does my 17 year old son.</li>
            <li>So far this trimmer does as advertised.</li>
            <li>had to have it replaced 3 times as the trap door busted twice and the sucking action stopped.</li>
            <li>A replacement for my 5 year old version.  </li>
            <li>no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>Depending on your beard size and how much you trim, you may have to do multiple empties of the hair trap.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>You would literally have to be &amp;#34;duck facing&amp;#34; while placing the trimmer vertically directly onto your lip.</li>
            <li>So far, it does well, but I do hope this trimmer lasts even a fraction of the 10 years my Wahl Trim-n-Vac lasted.</li>
            <li>The charge holds for a pretty long time and when it eventually withers connect it to the outlet and finish what you started.</li>
            <li>However, the trimmer motor is somewhat loud so Norelco should do something about this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a modest beard going on, and this trimmer (with the adjustable guard) fits the bill.</li>
            <li>When I searched online and saw the relatively low price, I was ready to purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall the trimmer is constructed really well and feels efficient to use.  </li>
            <li>Amazon replaced it in a timely fashion, and second one works very well.  </li>
            <li>Does everything the description says it will do, neat features so far no complaints.  </li>
            <li>This was purchased to replace an old Remington unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, the shave has been closer.</li>
            <li>Plenty of power and no problems so far.</li>
            <li>This unit could not hold a charge (while off) overnight which is a far cry from 50 minutes of run time Norelco advertised.</li>
            <li>but this trimmer is too loud to notice that.</li>
            <li>My only real problem with it is that the door broke after about two weeks and now will not stay shut.</li>
            <li>This is the old one for reference:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have for years old model Norelco beard trimmer</li>
            <li>Another observation is that my moustache is harder to trim than my beard even though it is not thicker than the latter, perhaps it is related to the nature of my own anatomy than to this product in order to give the benefit of the doubt to the latter.</li>
            <li>Maybe cause I work out and lift weights frequently, I like heavier things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Norelco trimmer died after years of service.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the whole point of a beard trimmer is to get all of your hair trimmed neatly to the same length.  </li>
            <li>I received both head attachments and neither one works well for me; even the nicer spring loaded one tends to catch my lip while I attempt to trim up close near my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not have this problem with my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li>This one is working well so far.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised at what the device turned out to be...</li>
            <li>Initial impressions were very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels much ligher than the T980 while offering a seemingly larger hair chamber and the LCD display, which deserves its obligatory mention.</li>
            <li>also really like the adjustable length guide and the digital display.</li>
            <li>Also unlike my old razor, this Phillips does not require oil.</li>
            <li>I have ridiculously sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to replace my old T-970.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to person&#x27;s looking for a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t break the bank and offers a quality shave.</li>
            <li>one &amp; ONLY gripe: this thing REALLY needs a</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s 6 months old.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>Pros - holds a charge and charges fast, neat display, vac actually works, you can use it plugged in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my old Panasonic did.</li>
            <li>I prefer the fixed head because I find it easier to manipulate but not by much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old trimmer did it will as the settings were without comb&lt;br</li>
            <li>but also the alternate floating guide that so many have lamented is missing.  </li>
            <li>I used some heavy duty Wahl clippers for a while, and it worked okay, but they are big and bulky.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go any further if don&#x27;t mind to spend few bucks more.</li>
            <li>be worth getting the &amp;#34;downgraded&amp;#34; model and the extra money does not gain extra quality.</li>
            <li>love my old one, but it is missing a tine on its contour following comb.  </li>
            <li>They tried to make it more compact but the bristles are too short and firm.</li>
            <li>but it was ok, just like a standard shave cut -- healed in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will likely rate better once I receive and can use the missing the piece.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;d like to cut straight to the small things that have stuck out to me rather than do a full review  Pros -Charged</li>
            <li>I am surprised that a product with such good reviews can perform so poorly.    </li>
            <li>The charge holds for a few hours, and it stays within the machine for a few weeks without loosing charge, so that&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li>works well, good trimming, with adjustable length of cut,but vacumn effect ois mediocre</li>
            <li>Good razor, but over-priced and useless features.</li>
            <li>It seems difficult to find a good beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the guide is made using flexible prongs which bend a good 3-4mm.</li>
            <li>I was unable to get as good a trim on my face, where I keep my beard at 4 mm, as with the old 980--it</li>
            <li>They have been good about reembursing me for those items but it gets tiresome dealing with them and the paper</li>
            <li>Looks like a good and well designed product, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging time and power was good (one hour for full charge).</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I keep my stubble shorter than this shaver was really good for.</li>
            <li>The vacuuming is good but not perfect - there will still be some hair on and around the sink.</li>
            <li>Turbo is outstanding for thick stuble.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is not great but works as good as my old one did.    </li>
            <li>hint bring back the old one!!!</li>
            <li>While this does a great job as a shaver the implementation of the vacuum is flawed.</li>
            <li>Vacuum doesn&#x27;t suck up everything but to be expected and still a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Once you have used a vacuum beard trimmer, you won&#x27;t want to go back to a trimmer without this useful</li>
            <li>The vacuum is surprisingly useful, the length selector feels sturdy and the device feels well made overall.</li>
            <li>- The vacuum feature of this trimmer picks up about 70% of the hair that would normally get all over the sink when using a normal razor/trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love the vacuum feature on this trimmer, however the door that holds the waste bin doesn&#x27;t stay secured.  </li>
            <li>but then I realized the vacuum function from this is actually quite useful if you plan on trimming hair on your head which otherwise can get quite</li>
            <li>I doubted the vacuum would be of much worth, but it actually caught about 90% of the hair.</li>
            <li>Tried all angles and hair stills falls and makes a lot of mess that have to clean, with and without turbo funcion</li>
            <li>The vacuum function really eliminates the mess and clean up.  </li>
            <li>it reduces the mess I had to clean up before.</li>
            <li>Turn the vacuum on and be amazed at how it collects so much of the trimmed ends.</li>
            <li>that said it&#x27;s still much cleaner than without the vacuum.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum thing works very well, but don&#x27;t expect it to work with out emptying the cut hairs.</li>
            <li>the vacuum function... doesn&#x27;t get it all, but really prevents a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Despite some reviews that disagreed on the vacuum effectiveness, I do feel it works very well.</li>
            <li>The built-in vacuum make for a much cleaner and neater bathroom sink surface.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think the vacuum system really ever worked</li>
            <li>whole vacuum thing is a joke.  </li>
            <li>Well it can trim a beard, but the vacuum gimmick is really just that</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature makes it very neat to use.</li>
            <li>The vacuum cleaner of the Norelco really works well.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is very helpful, as it can be used anywhere.</li>
            <li>The vacuum function works well except if you trim too much at once</li>
            <li>A trimmer without the vacuum feature like I&#x27;ve used for years is much easier to use for this purpose.</li>
            <li>The vacuum also works very well, capturing 95% of the clippings I&#x27;d estimate.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum does not make it really &amp;#34;mess-free&amp;#34; but it just makes it produce &amp;#34;less mess&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Vacuum system doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>and I really like the vacuum.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature works a little better than the earlier model, but is a&lt;br /&gt;little more difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li>I thought the vacuum was not going to work very</li>
            <li>It does vacuum much of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li>Vacuum really works trapping hairs.</li>
            <li>I end up with just as much hair in the sink when I shave as I do in the vacuum container.</li>
            <li>Vacuum works really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the vacuum doesn&#x27;t really work that</li>
            <li>I really like how it trims my beard, the vacuum feature, and its ability to hold a charge.</li>
            <li>The vacuum didnt pick up a whole lot either.</li>
            <li>so i use the &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; less pointy head which is better suited to the long lengths as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my previous model I was always trying to remember how long it had been and guess how many trims I had left.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the battery life isn&#x27;t so long, I had a previous model, which had a much better battery&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>If you have long facial hair or move too quickly the trimmer won&#x27;t collect it all</li>
            <li>One is pointy and inaccurate and the other ones shortest length starts at around 2.5mm length... making it hard to get a good clean-ish scruff look.  </li>
            <li>If four or five hairs in a sink bothers you then the trimmer isn&#x27;t the issue if you know what I mean :)  </li>
            <li>My husband has a beard longer than the maximum trim length of this shaver, but, since he does cut his sideburns and shave his neck (or, rather, lets me do so), and since his 20-year old Norelco is getting very tired, I figured this was a good tool to try out for the job.    </li>
            <li>and I generally get a new trimmer every 3 years.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s essentially the old T980 in a new shape with an upgraded Li-ion battery and some fancy new display technology.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a big gap in the guard that you could easily stick your chin all the way down into.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Strong trimmer (doesn&#x27;t bog down through my thicker facial</li>
            <li>The receptacle that the vacuum feed to is tiny and once it fills up the hair will cease to be vacuumed and head right for the sink.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is very clean and sleek - it fits comfortably in the hand, has a cord that attaches to its bottom, not someplace inconvenient like a side (you can use it plugged in or not), and the controls are intuitive.</li>
            <li>I was almost detered due to the ones about \\&quot;huge gap between the guard\\&quot; and \\&quot;mawwing your upper lip\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Although it picked up about 90% of the hair, enough hair was left on the bottom of the sink, to require further clean up.  </li>
            <li>I know that the comb head can be removed, and I&#x27;ve done precisely that, but the blade does not feel sharp enough to do precision marking.</li>
            <li>In the past it was easy to start trimming at a setting</li>
            <li>It is not so easy to get into small spaces like under your nose.  </li>
            <li>also use it to trim my hair and it gets pretty much all of it, really mess</li>
            <li>The door that houses the cut hairs is opened slightly now, but it is not bad....</li>
            <li>Clipped hairs are vacuumed into a small but efficient little holding area under the blade, and it&#x27;s easy to dump out the hair and clean the hopper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as how effective the vacuum is, it&#x27;s no better or worse than a Remington I used for many years.</li>
            <li>They have reduced the overall size of the unit from past systems and it is now a very comfortable size.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the trimmer due to the 20+ positive reviews and the lack of a decent alternative.   </li>
            <li>The trimmer comes with a little brush to clean it up with when you are finished using it, and for those who travel, there is a travel-lock that prevents the unit from accidently being bumped on during travel.</li>
            <li>Works really well and sucks up 80% of all the hairs that are trimmed and saves the clean up time by a lot.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older version of this same trimmer because the old one wasn&#x27;t holding a charge.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent replacement for my old Norelco trimmer (which broke when I dropped it in the sink.</li>
            <li>The built in guard quickly slides up and down to adjust the length</li>
            <li>Worked fine last spring, but took it out to trim my new winter beard, and DEAD.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always been happy with the design however the QT4070 is a production FAIL!</li>
            <li>i forgot to say no mess</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>No mess anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The text on the box says it \\&quot;captures hair for no mess in the sink.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>cleaner is &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;  option, as there is no mess after trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought both this and the other &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; based shaver from Remington to test them side by side, and the Phillips wins by a mile.  </li>
            <li>The attachment does come completely off to expose the base blade but it still doesn&#x27;t seem to cut very close, my older cheaper one cuts closer somehow, for more special places.</li>
            <li>Better than my previous Norelco which lasted 15 years!!!</li>
            <li>: It is tough to determine exactly where the cut will stop, so if precision is important this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is a very modern, sleek looking device with a digital readout of the guide height in millimeters (and analog scales on opposite sides of the guide that indicate guide height in both mm and</li>
            <li>This replaced a less expensive Wahl and I must say it is far superior and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>other than that, it is easy to use and keeps it charge for a long time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost unusable on my melon, because when I turn it upside down to do the top of my head, the suction is barely enough to keep any stubble in the catch compartment and it clogs almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>-The vacuum does not work anywhere near as well as it did with the older T980.  </li>
            <li>The blade is wide, I wish it came with additional smaller sizes that you could put on, for those special places.</li>
            <li>Cons: It heats up pretty fast, when I turn on the vacuum it stops after about 10 sec.</li>
            <li>The vacuum part works pretty much as well as can be expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly, without the vacuum working better, it was just not worth keeping and had to go back.</li>
            <li>But the little plastic \\&quot;door\\&quot; which houses the captured hair is very cheap and it&#x27;ll become loose</li>
            <li>No bulbous weird shapes like some other brands, and now the inclusion of a more modern, light-weight and compact switching power supply that accepts 100V-240V means the kit is lighter overall and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is not 100%, but it gets most so that a simple wipe down on the sink gets rid of all the remaining hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Norelco elctric razors since the early 80&#x27;s, so I had high hopes for the Philips Norelco Qt4070/41 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I&#x27;d rather clean up whiskers from the sink than have my goatee look uneven and not straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>he cut his mole with it, which I can understand happens, but I find the length not low enough for a sexy shadow, slightly scruffy but not lumberjack level.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this is the case with this trimmer as it seems to shave stubble fine on the cheeks and chin yet</li>
            <li>I think the battery is better, but its not fair to compare it against an old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As many other reviewers, I found this unit to be uncomfy to use in that  the guide blade is too sharp and catches your skin.   </li>
            <li>but the fine trim head should be included, especially for those that did not have the previous model.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my older, smaller Norelco I trimmer I had for years.</li>
            <li>Battery charged quickly, and it comes with two different trimmer guides, and the last model only had one.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I use the trimmer mainly for beard stubble</li>
            <li>This trimmer does the job decently well, but several gripes lower the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the comb head is much more solid yet flexible, although the trimmer is pretty weak, which is why I bought this other trimmer in the first place.</li>
            <li>In particular, I also appreciate how short you can trim your beard using the comb.  </li>
            <li>The first one I owned after a couple of months it would not shut properly, so it would open up while shaving and hair would fall all over the place.</li>
            <li>cannot use the turbo charger anymore, an &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; is displayed on the screen and the trimmer stops working completely; sometimes the same happens during normal use!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had an older version of the Norelco beard trimmer which I used regularly until the hair collection cup fell apart.</li>
            <li>I had an older model that finally died.</li>
            <li>but this is second best, just because i dont want to risk being disappointed by anyone else.  </li>
            <li>All functions are exactly the same as listed on the box and the shaver is the same one.</li>
            <li>Have recently acquired my first ever &amp;#34;Trial Run&amp;#34; of facial growth - and am</li>
            <li>Norelco is always releasing better and newer models, which makes your efforts pretty useless.  </li>
            <li>The only way to get a decent trim out of this thing is to use NO ATTACHMENT AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>Then, I had to do two separate requests for the paperwork to send this back because the first time their customer service team totally forgot.</li>
            <li>I have used this trimmer several times and it does a decent god trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li>i opened it for the first time and found it doesn&#x27;t work just after i flew back to China last month.</li>
            <li>My older similar model lasted about 8 years.  </li>
            <li>So immediately bought this model as it looks similar to my older model, with the exception of the display.</li>
            <li>Decent enough trimmer, but</li>
            <li>I had a older model of the same trimmer and this replaces it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>The different length settings up to 18mm, was the main factor.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to replace the older version of the same product.</li>
            <li>Storage chamber for the hair is very small, other thatn that it is good to use and compact to store for travel purposes.</li>
            <li>Not bad as long as the hair is not too long.</li>
            <li>The door to remove the accumulated hair is a little fragile (could easily break).</li>
            <li>I would rather the vacuum feature work less effectively in order to have the trimmer work as expected - if a trade-off is required.</li>
            <li>Meaning, it will have to be plugged in for a little longer than it takes you to shave to stay at full battery.  </li>
            <li>Second, the vacuum feature did not work to pull the trimmed hairs into the device; instead, it seemed to scatter the hairs all over the sink and the surrounding area to a much greater extent than my previous trimmer</li>
            <li>It actually takes longer to clean with the vacuum because I have to detail the vacuum chamber with a small brush on top of just swishing some water around in the sink and using a piece of toilet paper to mop up any hairs around the sink.</li>
            <li>Ive owned several vacuum shavers and all worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is my second Norelco Vacuum Beard Trimmer and this operates smoother than the first.  </li>
            <li>Vacuum actually does work well and the settings a pretty precise.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>The vacuum actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li>: the cutter can&#x27;t get the right angle tp trim mustache edge due to part of the housing being in the way.</li>
            <li>Also, the other reviews say you have to call and order the right trimming head, although they since have updated it</li>
            <li>This trimmer was really sharp right after I had purchased it.</li>
            <li>you have been chosen to deliver the opening speech at a last-minute high society affair - no problem, it operates while plugged into any 5-star establishment&#x27;s standard AC outlet, so you can use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, here are the high and low points of the trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you need somethign to keep that beard/goatee trimmed on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This one seems to have the same high quality.  </li>
            <li>He highly recommends it and it last for years.  </li>
            <li>I thought to myself, I don&#x27;t want to waste $20-30 dollars on a cheaper trimmer and find out that I don&#x27;t really like it, because I was too cheap to buy a more expensive trimmer with features I wanted.</li>
            <li>- it took off the hairs cleanly and quickly, with just a couple of strokes (I had to play with the orientation a bit - you need to stroke with the closed part of the guard forward, not the open side, or you&#x27;ll get choppy results).</li>
            <li>the vacuum is not the end all be all of keeping the sink clean, there is plenty that it doesn&#x27;t pick up, but generally it works well enough and the vacuum does help to keep things cleaner.</li>
            <li>not saying it gets all of the hair, but easily 80% of the hair is sucked up into the little vacuum compartment.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Perhaps a consistent cut on a flat surface however my face and chest are not flat.</li>
            <li>The vacuum section makes it a little clunky and not that easy to get an even trim across the face.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly for business trips (to avoid carrying the power cord) and the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>The clever vacuum system keeps the hairs from ending up all over the place</li>
            <li>bought this to replace my older turbo vacuum model....</li>
            <li>I bought this unit to replace an older Norelco Vacuum Beard unit I used for YEARS.  </li>
            <li>..the main feature for me was the vacuum feature: it does not work as advertised plenty of hair is going</li>
            <li>the battery holds a decent charge and the vacuum function somewhat works (not the problem).</li>
            <li>I have a plug in of a similar shaver/beard trimmer that has a vacuum that is much better at maintaining the mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Philips Norelco&#x27;s older vacuum model, which could not do a stubble beard.  </li>
            <li>The main reasons for my purchase was the vacuum system that captures hair inside the trimmer handle as you cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update my review in a few months down the road, with a better overall opinion compared to this first impression of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I called Philips Norelco about having it fixed to keep hair from spilling out all over my counter, and they told me my only option was to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco Qt4050 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer, Black]], which seems to be a good combination between the other two Norelco Vacuum beard trimmers,</li>
            <li>Big improvement over my past trimmer - strong motor that does  great job trimming, has a long lasting battery and even a power boost for tough beards.  </li>
            <li>The levels are fairly satisfying as well, you can keep a decently long beard tame with this thing, so</li>
            <li>: Doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate waste, Reservoir fills up quickly</li>
            <li>There is still a small mess to clean at the sink, but it may take about 15 seconds to clean up.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this also leads to a better cut from what I&#x27;ve seen so far, as previous razors would discard trimmings onto the head while shaving leading to a &#x27;rough&#x27; hairline profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>My only gripe with it is that it is very loud, when trimming your face near your ears.</li>
            <li>Requires frequent cleanups even during a single use as the vacuume does not work very well.  </li>
            <li>I keep my facial hair trimmed to 4 mm (setting # 4, pretty short) and the vacuum clipping storage compartment is large enough to not need emptying until after trimming</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for its vacuum.</li>
            <li>The vacuum scoop is right up against the blade and is just as long</li>
            <li>I really like the gauge that gives the length, and it seems plenty powerful to quickly take down relatively thick hair.</li>
            <li>One of them did a too short trimming than I set it to, but on the second cone it was decent, but it didn&#x27;t feel like it was cutting right with this cone, maybe because of the vaccuum, which by the way, does a nice job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>80% of the standard hair mess is not on my counter due to this amazing trimmer.  </li>
            <li>There were a few reviews that commented on the guard being terrible, but Philips is now shipping this clipper with the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; guard as well as the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; one, and the good one is great.  </li>
            <li>product stays charged for a long time, the display works really well and is responsive.</li>
            <li>Like the instructions say, start long and progress shorter to get a feel for how it cuts, you get the hang of it fast.</li>
            <li>I like the vacuum, but too much plastic around the trimming edge makes it hard to get a close precise trimming.</li>
            <li>Clearly this was a well used personal groomer complete with stubble residue!</li>
            <li>There is a small plastic piece that snaps into the housing of the trimmer to secure the door and that piece broke off.</li>
            <li>Light weight, small size compared to a lot of wired trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems so far to work fine, but hard to get the beard uniform in length.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts a long time and charges fast.  </li>
            <li>For the 50 bucks people pay for this thing, one might think Norelco could throw a small moustache comb into the box (fortunately, I retained the one that did come with the Wahl Trim-n-Vac).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast so it never gets tangled even on long hair.</li>
            <li>Light and small for travel.</li>
            <li>I use it daily instead of normal combing and forego the 1 to 2 week haircut I would otherwise need.</li>
            <li>I used to trim every two or three days, since cleanup with a normal trimmer is such a chore.  </li>
            <li>Simple enough and quite fun actually.</li>
            <li>Call Phillips, who now seem to be aware of the problem, and they will send you the closed comb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vacuum door opens too easily so can make a mess if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li>It broke of within the first couple of month requiring scotch to keep door closed.  </li>
            <li>I had to return the first one because the LCD got destroyed after shaving a wet beard.</li>
            <li>maybe about the same amount a the qt4050, and motor is louder at normal than it</li>
            <li>After a few months the battery shows full charge.</li>
            <li>negative I have is that the plastic door on the front that holds the vaccumed hair will come open and doesnt have a good latch on it to stay closed.</li>
            <li>;  It&#x27;s true, you don&#x27;t have clippings flying all over the counter, nor is it without a few.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it for a few minutes in the morning, plug it in to charge it, and it reports full charge.</li>
            <li>It seems with this trimmer that being afraid to make some minor mistake is not the way to go if you expect to have a nice even shave, and no you do not have to apply pressure, just let it trim the full length of hair up to your skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever use turbo because I just don&#x27;t consider my facial hair to be thick enough to be worthy of it, but I may try using it more in the future for the vacuum</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only one little problem and that&#x27;s the difficulty of getting the little bit of mustache hair right below the nostril, not so easy to pull my lip out that far.</li>
            <li>(but what isn&#x27;t nowadays), but unit and parts are tight when assembled gently and work very well for an under $50 clipper.</li>
            <li>the vacuum doesn&#x27;t capture every hair but far less to clean than before.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that the trimmer takes a minimum of an hour to charge for full use and they (Philips Norelco) experimented with a vacuum to catch the hair in a compartment which could work as an advantage (for users with short beards) or disadvantage (for users with long beards).</li>
            <li>There is a little bit of clean up to do, but it is way easier to clean up the little hair that is missed than when I had no vacuum.</li>
            <li>This maintenance free trimmer includes a vacuum system that captures cut hair, keeping the mess off the bathroom counter and in the sink.</li>
            <li>Would really recommend someone who wants not a clean, but close, shave give this a go.</li>
            <li>shortcoming, at least for me, is the blade doesnt prtrude long enough to easily trim/edge without the attachment afixed.&lt;br /&gt;Suppose for that I would need one of the professional models, whihc wasnt exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>Lastly, anyone looking for a vacuum beard trimmer will be hard-pressed for other options, as there just aren&#x27;t that many vacuum trimmers out there.  </li>
            <li>Also the length guide seems to get in the way of getting close with the trimmer to certain areas such as my upper lip close to my nose.  </li>
            <li>If you use the trimmer with the turbo function, you get a decent suction and also a decent cut as long as you use the contour following comb.</li>
            <li>after 6 weeks of ownership, it no longer holds a charge.&lt;br /&gt;After fully charging the unit, it&#x27;s good for no more than 3 trims - that&#x27;s less than 10 minutes of actual usage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its REALLY hard to find a strong performing beard trimmer now days</li>
            <li>/&gt;Knowing of the many stories of the little hair-compartment door breaking, I&#x27;m being very careful when opening and closing that, and so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean up has now been reduced to simply washing the missed trimmings down the sink, and dumping the trimming compartment&lt;</li>
            <li>The reviews here go back to 2010 with complaints that the contour head was not supplied as advertised, and yet, nearly 2 years later, mine arrived in exactly the same condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much a long affair in the shower with my current trimmer, as my stubble just goes everywhere and normally covers the entire bathroom.</li>
            <li>It looks cool, and there are fancy digital displays to remind you just which setting you are on, but the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; leaves my beard scraggily and uneven, with hairs that refuse to be cut no matter how slowly, how many times, or in which direction I run the appliance.  </li>
            <li>I have seen so many other units its for so much less money, but I have no idea if they would perform like this one.</li>
            <li>and are not the same as the arbitrary units used by many other trimmers, so use a not-very-close setting to start with until you get a feeling for the settings or you may end up with a shorter beard than you planned.</li>
            <li>Head of the trimmer is too wide and flat to fit a human face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only other missing element is the travel pouch which was nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>Just be certain not to put a loose fold of skin into the cutters, it CAN cut the skin if you do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First one I got did not work, Amazon took it back and sent me a new one.  </li>
            <li>: Do you think a new amazon order will include it, or would they have inventory dating back before it was included?&lt;br /&gt;Mack</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like about this new model is it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel pouch.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is life-changing and no man who wears stubble daily should have to live without this.  </li>
            <li>They added a  new Li-iion battery, a new TINY auto-switching power adapter ( I travel a lot with it) and a digital read-out of the trim setting.</li>
            <li>The new comb is a solid piece of plastic that does the job and has no parts that can break.</li>
            <li>There are only a couple things about this trimmer that I didn&#x27;t like but that I can live with.</li>
            <li>That said, I fear this new unit will be plagued with the same issues.</li>
            <li>Bought a new one to replace a lost one of same type.</li>
            <li>$30.00 total they wanted to get a new part sent.</li>
            <li>this beard trimmer was meant to replace the existing basic beard trimmer I already have, I&#x27;ll compare this new model to it.</li>
            <li>new trimmer is about 1&amp;#34; longer than my existing unit, and definitely thicker.</li>
            <li>I received my new trimmer last week and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try</li>
            <li>The trimmer finally started to wear out, so it was time to shop for a new one.</li>
            <li>I had used cheap trimmers and some of those interchangeable numbers (does anybody ever really use the nose trimmer adapter?) and wanted to step up my game a bit.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable feature is great for cutting the beard and mustache and different lengths.  </li>
            <li>Just as expected: simple, clean, adjustable, european plug adaptor without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>significantly reduces the mess around your sink.&lt;br /&gt;-Duel AC and battery operation protect you from the rechargeable battery dying mid trim.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesnt get all hair or give a very even neat trim without SEVERAL passes, who knows maybe my face fur is coarse</li>
            <li>The offset on the head also makes it less useful for trimming the hair around my ears, etc.</li>
            <li>(This is readily evidenced by pulling up hair at different spots in your beard and seeing completely different hair lengths).  </li>
            <li>I really hope the Philips Norelco engineers \\&quot;run\\&quot; back to the drawing board, and ensure the next generation of this trimmer re-focuses on quality and effectiveness of its core features.</li>
            <li>I really hope the Philips Norelco engineers \\&quot;run\\&quot; back to the drawing board, and ensure the next generation of this trimmer re-focuses on quality and effectiveness of its core features.</li>
            <li>big thing for me since i constantly forget to charge it is that you cannot really use it while charging, the cable doesn&#x27;t stay in place at all</li>
            <li>understand why so many negative reviews, am I not enough of a razor expert in order to critique it further?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was worth the upgrade from the previous</li>
            <li>- I have use for only the contour-following comb.&lt;br /&gt;The unit works well under all the same conditions I used the T780.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco has always done some things on all their rechargeable products that are customer-hostile and have really irked me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I use it for total hair cuts (my hair is very short) and it works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The digital guides make it much easier to know what length you&#x27;re about to trim to and keeps you from having to keep up with multiple beard guides (which I always lose)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since this is my second one, I have been very cautious with it, yet the result is the same.</li>
            <li>Really, the guide fingers are like cats claws, and too thin to file smooth.)   </li>
            <li>only thing I miss is a timer of how much battery I have left, in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is the wide trimming blades, which measure at least 1-1/4 inches.  </li>
            <li>I got tired of my husband old trimmer that didn&#x27;t really give him a clean look to his beard.</li>
            <li>I have a 12+ year old norelco shaver (from my pre-beard years) that I still use occasionally and a 5+ year old norelco beard trimmer that&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;as</li>
            <li>works well on African american hair too, very close shave.</li>
            <li>Already, it&#x27;s developed the same problems as my old one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the old model, it was completely removable, except the fastening tabs were so fragile they broke within weeks.</li>
            <li>The door latch only seems to last about 5-6 months no matter how gentle you treat it.</li>
            <li>In fact, this is so annoying I almost took two stars off, but I still think it&#x27;s the best trimmer out there for the basic task.</li>
            <li>The old version was 10x better, this one is worse in every way.</li>
            <li>but I just think they&#x27;re either misusing the product or are just being super harsh.</li>
            <li>This is an adequate product, but I find that the design of the clips tends to make the trimming uneven.  </li>
            <li>This is because of the hair vacuum vent on the top creates distance between the trimmer head and face which makes it hard to get a close trim.</li>
            <li>Digital height read out is nice but unnecessary.  </li>
            <li>This is not a double trimmer, it only works (barely) when you have the comb on and want to trim your beard with a certain number.</li>
            <li>only use the &amp;#34; &amp;#34;contour following comb&amp;#34;&amp;#34;, as the other one is pretty much useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still when i want an actual good trim i have go back with my other small trimmer to adjust what this trimmer missed.</li>
            <li>It does an outstanding job cutting and the vacuum catches all hair so my sink stays clean.  </li>
            <li>They have also improved the vacuum system on the new models.    </li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is new to me</li>
            <li>vacuum is new to me.</li>
            <li>The vacuum system actually works very well.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;vacuum&#x27; deal is a mixed bag of tricks - it doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li>but the suction on the vacuum is far, FAR inferior.  </li>
            <li>It even has a vacuum that sucks up most of the hair.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Qt4070/41 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro, first of all ... has a really long name.</li>
            <li>Vacuum function not perfect but catches a good deal of hair.</li>
            <li>Vacuum will not capture all hair but significantly reduces mess.</li>
            <li>This shaver is nice but not great if you were looking to have a shaver that has a quality vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>It really does catch 90% of the hairs which is way better than other vacuum trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>The major flaw is with the plastic guard that is supposed to cover the blade.  </li>
            <li>Three problems, two of them major.    </li>
            <li>Major:</li>
            <li>Personally I never get that involved with exact measurements when sculpting facial hair, but for the facial enthusiasts your need for preciseness will be satiated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this was my first trimmer, I think having bought other ones makes me somewhat viable as a reviewer.      </li>
            <li>The edges are not sharp at all now.</li>
            <li>Seeing as I need to shave a little more often than once every two weeks I had to resort to other buying options.</li>
            <li>Majorly reduces beard hair all over the vanity/sink.</li>
            <li>Major pain.</li>
            <li>This is a major part of that.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried the first comb, the one provided on the machine (there is another, alternate comb in the box), but it works well enough.</li>
            <li>(A major turn off to a GF or wife).</li>
            <li>dumb idea, why not put it on the bottom like remington USED to make instead of the top front.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Few things I found that could be better are, the flap which holds the collected hair is weak.</li>
            <li>The more number of times I opened, the latch got weak.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a major pro for me.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has two major faults.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the smaller models even without the comb attached and the size makes it harder to get the edges and corners right without hitting their surroundings.</li>
            <li>The battery did not last very long at all on the first charge, but that seems to have been a fluke.</li>
            <li>The brush for cleaning the collected hairs and such is small and easy to lose.</li>
            <li>Even if you are trying hard to keep the flat top of the guide comb flush against your face, you eventually have to turn a corner, like at your jaw line.</li>
            <li>this is for beard, you can always use sink to catch the waste though if you&#x27;re not careful, sink can get clogged quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was very noisy, used antiquated NiCad battery technology, the vacuum rubbed the case and strained if you held it the wrong way, the comb clogged easily, the length adjustment changed too easily by accident, was difficult to re-attach to the trimmer, and I was forever dropping the filter screen when tapping the hair compartment clean.  </li>
            <li>so i didnt have to use a second machine for sideburns but the vacuum feature is the sole reason I bought this in the first place</li>
            <li>The hair vacuum is cool, it can be a bit tricky fully cleaning out the hair canister especially if the hair is wet,</li>
            <li>As many others noted, the guards are very hard on the face and you have to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, if you have too much length to easily shave with a blade (say, after a long, casual vacation), this trimmer can reduce the length down to something easily manageable with a blade.</li>
            <li>The digital display that indicated the length to which it is cutting is nice - but what is astonishingly bad is the discomfort - no - pain experienced while using it!</li>
            <li>The digital cutting length is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li>I hope the system becomes better in future versions - as is, it is definitely not the dream machine being advertised, at least as far as that feature is concerned.</li>
            <li>In fact, it is a nice size to trim and neaten bearded areas other than the face, for those who are so inclined, without worry of clipper heads pinching any skin, they are well designed and simply do their job without risking any minor blood loss from the dreaded clipper bite other trimmers can give.</li>
            <li>I must have been satisfied initially with its operation, because I bought another a few months later for a second home.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of person that needs trimming daily, I&#x27;d expect you could still get a month or at least a few weeks out of each charge, and the charging is fast when it is needed.</li>
            <li>far as the actual trimming, while it does an overall good job, I found it difficult to get to the moustache hairs under my nose and the beard hairs close to my ears.</li>
            <li>Long battery life is the only positive.</li>
            <li>I decided that, other than the negative reviews regarding the comb, it seemed to be the most highly reviewed.</li>
            <li>So why bother having to clean out a small hair collection chamber that doesn&#x27;t work anyhow?  </li>
            <li>of the negative gripes were about the stubble comb, but I have used both the stubble and the curving comb, and both work fine, though I prefer the stubble comb with my shorter beard.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great in allowing me to grow a standard beard/mustache that will go well with my nazi youth haircut and black V neck sweater accented by a plaid collared checkered shirt as I sip on and pretend to know all there is to know about coffee and/or craft beer while discussing the unfairness imposed on poor people.</li>
            <li>The QT4070/41 comes with two guards, one has an opening that&#x27;s kinda sharp, and one that&#x27;s closed and smooth.</li>
            <li>After extensive search of all brands and models available, I wanted to buy the previous discontinued model because it was smaller.</li>
            <li>sounds harsh and it is harsh if you use the other one lightly you will be fine.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the twenty dollars extra over their other models?  </li>
            <li>I had to use a burly nail file to round of the sharp points to mostly alleviate this design</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Norelco beard trimmers from this particular line for a long time and have gone through three of them.</li>
            <li>I got this one to replace the older version that I had for a long time.</li>
            <li>Norelco appears to have spent so much time firming up the housing of the trimmer and adding a little LCD display (totally unnecessary), but they dropped the ball on the most important part of a VACUUM trimmer.</li>
            <li>The vacuum strength is much greater than I expected and the blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li>good that they now include the guiding comb, but hard to use the blade only portion to trim upper lip etc due to shape even when you take comb off</li>
            <li>You still want to do it over the sink or trash basket, but there&#x27;s a whole lot less mess to clean up, which is about where my expectations were.  </li>
            <li>The result was arguably the best trim I&#x27;ve ever had, owing to the innovative cutting design (flat head versus slanted, as with other trimmers), the consistency of the cutting, and the efficient motor, providing the torque needed to trim through a wiry undergrowth of facial hair (the turbo button is useful here).</li>
            <li>Better collection box design (hinged), and it&#x27;s less bulky and slightly shorter than the T980.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine, the only problem was the small door</li>
            <li>all the way in the other direction to make it slip the other way, and then it was fine.</li>
            <li>I had an older Norelco trimmer that was basically the same thing, and I used it for probably 5-6 years, but it was starting to die and pieces were breaking, so I had to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I use a different setting for my main beard and for my mustache above my lip and on the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li>After less than a year, the battery only lasts a couple minutes if lucky.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t have the smaller mustache trimmer that older models had.</li>
            <li>I am embarrassed actually because, prior to it arriving and having read the reviews (particularly the one telling customers to contact Phillips), I visited the Phillips website, opened a customer services chat and requested a contour trimmer guide.  </li>
            <li>Searched far and wide and this particular trimmer appeared to garner recommendations towards that end.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing is you might have to clean it out in the middle of the shave, depending on how much hair you are trimming; but all it takes to clean it is popping it open and giving a few hard blows into the chamber.</li>
            <li>Based on the large number of negative reviews on here, I called Philips to see if they would be willing to send me the comb that \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t\\&quot; cut or jab you.  </li>
            <li>The best one I have found, out of the handful I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: removing one star, as this is one of the few beard trimmers at this price point that does not include a fine trimmer attachment - very annoying.</li>
            <li>Seriously dont know why all the good reviews, this thing is so unbelievably loud and is no better than the 15.00 Wahl buzzer Ive had for ages</li>
            <li>The trimmer works well used it 2 times so far, and the vacuum system works makes for very little clean up.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but this trimmer only delivered moderate results.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write back if I have any issues later on, but I have high hopes that nothing will happen.</li>
            <li>The unit felt a little &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; which surprised me because most of Phillips&#x27;s razors are heavy.</li>
            <li>not as much mess and easy to empty and  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s also hard to line up to do a direct trim at the neckline because the guards block your view a bit - never had a problem with a full trimmer that had detachable guards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might be a little bit more expensive than a normal one you can get, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks real cool though european styling on the trimmer, although nothing was as easy to use as the old remington mb 70 or mb 400 That stood up on its base.</li>
            <li>Turbo mode is very useful when the beard gets a little too long.</li>
            <li>So, I have to judge the unit unacceptable now, which is too bad as it is a great beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for beard trimming but bad for edging and neck shaving.</li>
            <li>With the (fairly lame) comb removed it works with amazing speed.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for 3 months, but recently the clasp that keeps the vacuumed hair trapped in the bay has broken.  </li>
            <li>and I generally like it.</li>
            <li>always use it in &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; fan mode and the vaccum sucks up about 90% of the hairs which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Also having a clear digital readout is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This unit will stay charged no matter how long you leave it in the drawer thanks to Li-ion batteries, FINALLY.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco CLEARLY markets the 4070 as using their \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>That did not present much of a problem because the cord is quite long.  </li>
            <li>I took the clear molded plastic packing shell out of the box and put it on my bathroom shelf above the sink.</li>
            <li>digital display is superfluous, there are clear mm and inch marks on the combs that serve the purpose without consuming battery power.</li>
            <li>First impressions: feels cheap and uncomfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Ladies if your guy cleans up after himself, it takes a lot of time and is frustrating as we are extremely lazy, this saves it, this is a great gift.</li>
            <li>The only issue I ran into was that the removal of the attachments is not explained clearly in the instructions.</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to buy this because everyone said it doesn&#x27;t come with the comb, so I ordered the extra part from Phillips Norelco before buying the product and it turned out the trimmer came with the contour following comb and the regular comb</li>
            <li>My only objection to its form-factor is that the thing is LOUD.</li>
            <li>Barely cuts.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>I threw this away and back to my old Norelco T1000.    </li>
            <li>I then bought the QT4070 knowing, (after reading the reviews), that I would have to have the same spring loaded comb as my old T970 and the QT4050.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because I had the old version for about 6 years until the battery finally died.</li>
            <li>A big improvement over the old models removable receptacle.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how short it will trim compared to my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>Took double the time from my old trimmer to trim my face.</li>
            <li>Old Norelco trimmers used to last a lifetime until Phillips took over the company.</li>
            <li>Fast charging, and because you can use it from cord and battery, make this not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Overall, the QT4050 is far inferior to the QT4070</li>
            <li>And once you do, the blades just barely cut anything at all.    </li>
            <li>The height is displayed digitally in millimeters on the front near the adjustment dial, but you can see it in both millimeters and inches when you view it from the side.  </li>
            <li>I had lost my old trimmer on a recent trip, so I replaced it with the QT4070.</li>
            <li>It does not cut nearly close enough.  </li>
            <li>and it barely made a dent in the beard growth.  </li>
            <li>I like to use the bare blades on my neck just below the jaw line.</li>
            <li>This is the second Norelco product, used the old model until the battery would not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought this to replace an old Remington that finally gave up.</li>
            <li>Worked for a month and now will barely cut a hair on my face.  </li>
            <li>I charged the battery up completely when I got back, used it once</li>
            <li>I tried the first guard, and not only are the points on it sharper making it more uncomfortable, but there&#x27;s a big opening in it</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned it for roughly 6 months now and am very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With my old trimmer, this was no big deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a solid build and bulkier than any machine I have had and slightly loud, but</li>
            <li>but so far have not cut my lip at all, and have goten a way closer shave than with the second head everyone was asking for.  </li>
            <li>but the beard barely comes</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews here, I was hesitant to buy the 4070, and continued using my old one with a cord for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to replace my old Norelco selectable height trimmer (which lasted me for ten years).</li>
            <li>After setting it to &amp;#34;3&amp;#34;, it trimmed by mustache short, and nearly obliterated my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old T980, which was starting to fall apart.  </li>
            <li>One thing I had to get used to was the size of the trimmer head is not as wide as the head of the whole body</li>
            <li>but it is not alarming at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it broke after only 9 months of use after I had the old model for years.</li>
            <li>The charge level is readily apparent on the front display.  </li>
            <li>I believe I&#x27;ll be doing so in the near future.</li>
            <li>It lost a star because its larger size and loud noise.</li>
            <li>Works well, is not too big but is a bit loud -my</li>
            <li>With no attachment, you can actually trim your facial hair to a reasonable level and finish it off with a standard razor.  </li>
            <li>It does trim my mustache (unlike some reviewers who said their nose gets in the way) but it just barely works.</li>
            <li>Holds enough charge to complete a beard trim.  </li>
            <li>After the order the one I received developed the same issue - after two or three months not holding charge.  </li>
            <li>No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Same as old trimmer I have been using.</li>
            <li>but it barely works.  </li>
            <li>use this frequently, so have short trimmings.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty much everything else works as expected.</li>
            <li>I had one of the early models of this type of razor and this one is definitely smaller and sleeker.</li>
            <li>I tested it out of curiosity and my ears actually hurt when I shaved near them.  </li>
            <li>My old remington beard trimmer finally stopped charging a couple of months ago</li>
            <li>but I have to get used to the height adjustment apparently.  </li>
            <li>Norelco also changed the design of the cutter head such that the head itself must be completely removed for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>trimmer arrived with both of the described heads - a fixed \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; head, and a spring-loaded \\&quot;comb\\&quot; similar to the T980.</li>
            <li>2 DAYS EARLY ON STANDARD SHIPPING .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once so far and taken it on a 3 day business trip.</li>
            <li>only problem so far is the brush</li>
            <li>the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold charge, and even running plugged in would barely crank the motor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a beard trimmer for several years to replace my old Norelco and this is it.</li>
            <li>Finally decided to replace it when it was about 5 years old, because it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the fixed guide, since I trim my beard</li>
            <li>Tried a similar charger from his old one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have enough time to shave regularly with a razor and shaving cream</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m quite careful with all of my appliances and this is the first thing that&#x27;s ever actually \\&quot;died\\&quot; on me without any cause.      </li>
            <li>I had used it maybe 4-5 times at that point and hadn&#x27;t dropped or in any way been rough with it, so it&#x27;s pretty inexcusable for it to break in that short of a period of time.</li>
            <li>only thing that i have to say is that the battery runs out if u dont use it.i used it for 10 minutes the first time and after 2 weeks the battery was empty.</li>
            <li>This maybe the most poorly though out and inadequately tested product that Norelco has ever released.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money simply because it looks futuristic and cool</li>
            <li>Might be a really good trimmer but was too afraid to use it.</li>
            <li>Powerful and non messy.</li>
            <li>okay, but not great.</li>
            <li>There were comments on the trimmer&#x27;s head being a bit difficult to use, catching on your skin et al.</li>
            <li>The concept is ok but the fabrication is poor.</li>
            <li>(so it says something that a broken trimmer does a better job than this one).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not great.</li>
            <li>I would love to give the product more stars, but without a contour following comb it is worthless.</li>
            <li>build quality (broken door)&lt;br /&gt;-Vacuum feature is more of a gimmick.</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with the guard.</li>
            <li>and i use it in turbo mode) and falsely advertised to do  &amp;#34;mess-free trimming&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s more mess-over-half-left trimming (why 2 not 3 stars, for lying).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Opening the door in the front of the trimmer allows a puffy little hairball to fall right out, without spreading trimmings all over the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Set for #3 blade, press against the right temple, apply a little pressure to get the hairs to stand up, and run it across the brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though the price seems reasonable, other classic trimmer brands such as Wahl and Remington and Andis have offerings in the same range.</li>
            <li>The vacuum system is also much improved with the hinged door eliminating the need to remove the entire \\&quot;basket\\&quot; system as on the prior model which broke on me after about 20 uses.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 1 star was because the vacuum works very well and with very short shaves</li>
            <li>vacuum, and this sadly is a big one, as it was really the only reason I wanted to replace my existing working unit.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is my favorite feature I can shave in my big mirror in my bedroom even in my car when I am late for work.</li>
            <li>Likewise, the door is also a part of the storage volume, so when you open it up, shavings are likely to fall out and create a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital blue cutting depth and charging indicators look very nice; however, the rotary length selector lacks grip and is not smooth to turn, i.e. it feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Well this new model has a huge vacuum that is not spring loaded that makes it hard to get the actual razor close to your face.  </li>
            <li>Having bought other ones which don&#x27;t nearly aggravate my skin like this one, I now think that it&#x27;s a design flaw on this particular model.    </li>
            <li>First off--like other critical reviewers you&#x27;ll find here, I also had major problems with the comb.</li>
            <li>Charges very fast, less than an hour.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is not really useful, most of the hair falls down, so why bother.</li>
            <li>It is certainly not designed for hair that is much over  an inch or two</li>
            <li>The vacuum chamber holds about 10 hairs, so it needs to be emptied frequently.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum sticks out too far from the blades and the blades won&#x27;t even make contact with your skin.</li>
            <li>There is an opening near the teeth of the device for the vacuum to operate.</li>
            <li>4) while the vacuum in this trimmer does function, it frequently gets full/clogged.  </li>
            <li>What surprised me was how well the vacuum works in containing the beard clippings.</li>
            <li>Misleading product marketing  Philips sells a nearly identical model (the [[ASIN:B003U8K6M6 Philips Norelco Qt4050 Vacuum Beard Trimmer]])</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vacuum has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>But still, you can feel the soft air being blown from the vacuum</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I wouldn&#x27;t replace it for as long as it still does what it&#x27;s mean for, trimming hair.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well the vacuum works in the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to receive both as I read a number of reviews before purchasing and many people complained that their unit only came with the fixed head and had to separately contact Philips to get the other head.</li>
            <li>The vacuum isn&#x27;t loud.</li>
            <li>But vacuum does not work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>Had to replace my Phillips Norelco Vacuum trimmer that was about four plus years old, and falling apart.  </li>
            <li>The trim head is wide enough that trims do not take a super long time</li>
            <li>I did find a recent review that said the new packages came with a contour head and a regular head.  </li>
            <li>Very nice cutting length readouts, 1 digital in millimeters next to a charge indicator and a pre-set display in inches along the side where the trimming heads seat.</li>
            <li>Sleeping wives will appreciate that the vacuum is MUCH quiter and then sound is less harsh.  </li>
            <li>It gets a bit tricky to use around the lips due to the large opening for the cutter.</li>
            <li>coz you still need to clean 20% of the dirty sink, might as well clean 100%.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised, BUT has one flaw, the \\&quot;hair drawer\\&quot; in the old unit really collected the clippings, this unit is inferior in that category as around half the clippings fall on the sink not</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not in love with this model compared to previous versions for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>vacuum option is very nice, although there is still some leftovers in the sink, it leaves much less mess than regular trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;Charging takes less than an hour.</li>
            <li>2 power setting, multiple shave levels and no mess.  </li>
            <li>a sharp, professional look.&lt;br /&gt;It was able to pick up at least 80% of the hair trimmings that it cut -- not</li>
            <li>be getting a different beard trimmer in the very near future.</li>
            <li>a few said they got the right one.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s messy and requires a shower right after.</li>
            <li>The original vacuum trimmer was much better - too bad they keep changing.</li>
            <li>Looks a bit ridiculous, but it still works fine, so I deducted a star.</li>
            <li>it wasnt much, and it seemed like the hair did not fall far from the sink so the mess was diminished.  </li>
            <li>A solid value, easy to empty hair trimmings cups, with oh so much less hair falling into the sink than before.</li>
            <li>- I would have paid less in the first place...</li>
            <li>After playing with it for a little while more I noticed the guard does bend a little bit when you put pressure on it too.</li>
            <li>and I find the non pivoting head better unlike other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;Great that it works while plugged in and the vacuum works well aside from a few hairs on the sink.</li>
            <li>I could not get it to click down to say &amp;#34;1MM&amp;#34; After playing with it for 10 minutes I moved the guard out as far as it could go (to the 18MM or whatever mark) and all the way back down, and sure enough I was back at 1 frickin MM on the display.</li>
            <li>I love the vacuum feature, the turbo setting cut my tough beard with gusto, and the length adjustment was generally adequate (though the settings were a bit wide apart, so 3 was too long and 2 was too short).    </li>
            <li>but, the rest falls into the sink....which isn&#x27;t very much at all, and it&#x27;s not a big enough deal or a big enough mess of hair to really point out, or even mention to me, so...  </li>
            <li>Sadly, mine was dark brown, but after 50 years, it is best to keep mine a little longer</li>
            <li>have a full time beard that I like to keep fairly short, a little longer than 5 o&#x27;clock shadow short.</li>
            <li>Not bad but not very good.</li>
            <li>Also, if you decide to trim a really long beard into a fairly short beard, same problem, the vacuum isn&#x27;t powerful enough to contain that volume and length of hairs.  </li>
            <li>The guard is larger and can&#x27;t trim right under my nose in the mustache area as well as previous</li>
            <li>I had the older model Philips Norelco vacuum trimmer that finally died after 5 years of regular use</li>
            <li>The vacuum ensures no mess.  </li>
            <li>no mess with the vacuum.  </li>
            <li>As with all shavers, the blades just became too dull for my application, so I got this new one which is the same as the first!</li>
            <li>The only model that has this power and features and the contour comb is the QT4090, a special release unit that only a few stores have - neither Amazon or even Norelco had it to sell to me.  </li>
            <li>This is my first cordless trimmer, so I am downgrading the size and power of the vacuum (my other one died after 10 years, but was a beast that could cut my beard and shave my head).  </li>
            <li>Battery does not last long, and where the older version cut in one swipe, this takes two or three.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of trimming hair short as long as you cut against the lay of the hair.</li>
            <li>As my older Norelco T980 finally started to show its wear after its remarkably long life, I decided to upgrade to its replacement top-of-the-line trimmer.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly recommend the trimmer!</li>
            <li>Charges fast and also holds charges longer than other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will trim your beard, or other areas very close without hurting.  </li>
            <li>I was on the phone for 20 minutes with customer service ( at least the lady was friendly) trying to figure out why I needed a replacement, and mixing up the part number.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts very well and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li>he doesn&#x27;t really have anything to compare to other than a razor blade and cream</li>
            <li>hard to clean also.</li>
            <li>I went straight with the contour comb, so I can&#x27;t say how the other one works, but it works like a charm with the contour comb and there is no nicking anything even on setting one.</li>
            <li>Works very well compared to our other trimmers.</li>
            <li>Bought this when my last Philips Norelco trimmer bit the dust after 15-20 years of use and I expect this one will last just as long, Norelco products are build very well and I will stick to this brand.</li>
            <li>Now i have to shave my whole face because one side has a .5 mm trim and the other a 2mm trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay since I can use it both on my head and beard, and not leave a mess.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of time to get use to the length of the guard since you don&#x27;t immediately see how much you are trimming due to the&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Can&#x27;t really use it for trimming your head hair due to the design of it.</li>
            <li>The door has not broken off as other people claim in their reviews.</li>
            <li>The latch that holds the door closed is a tiny piece of plastic that does not seem to be durable at all, and after being used consistently, seems inevitable to break.</li>
            <li>It has a few more trim levels and a little change in style.</li>
            <li>However, the vast vast majority of the hairs get sucked in...which means no mess!</li>
            <li>So, if you have a nice thick beard you&#x27;re trimming, suddenly you go around your jaw line and shave it down to a stubble.</li>
            <li>Ive used this for about 2 month now, thats about 10 shaves, and have not a single problem.</li>
            <li>Does not have the detailed small trimmer that is very useful for cut hair behind the ear and close to the nose</li>
            <li>I was a hair concerned ordering this with the complaints about the comb, but when I received it I found that the box contained both the new comb everyone seems to hate, as well as the good trusty old contour comb.</li>
            <li>My wife likes the look of using this without the guard on the majority of my facial hair (which is fine with me - no razor burn), so I use this every other day to cut everything down and then with the guard to manage my goatee and sideburns.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad that this blade does not come standard with the QT4070, but if you have one, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>have taken EXTREMELY delicate care with this since day one and clean it with the brush after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very dissatisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Like anyone presented with the option, I went straight for turbo mode and never looked back, and so far haven&#x27;t seen any diminution of indicated battery power after half a dozen uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The T765 was much better at cutting and it was much easier to pop the guard off.</li>
            <li>It seems to be on infinite back order and recently looks like it was removed from Phillips&#x27; website completely.</li>
            <li>Some old reviews were critical of an earlier version but this one seems to have all the problems resolved as of January 2014.</li>
            <li>My beard trimming now consist of ten minutes of mowing the beard with the trimmer from every conceivable direction - and then another 10 minutes using my comb and scissors to cut all of the beard to the same length.</li>
            <li>I have only had it a short time, but so far it performs well.</li>
            <li>I sent back under warranty and received another, which developed the same problem after a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a downside in that it takes an hour to get a full charge and also charge does not last long, less than the 50 min it claims.  </li>
            <li>recently, did a patch job on the old T980 catch compartment (duct tape and a big rubber band) door and have resigned myself to charging every time before use.  </li>
            <li>Unless your mustache grows nowhere near your nose, you&#x27;re going to have a difficult time getting the trimming blades to the top of your mustache.</li>
            <li>Not only does my woman think I&#x27;m immaculately groomed and rediculously sexy with my fierce beard game</li>
            <li>top of that their 45 day risk free warrantee is worthless since they can&#x27;t seem to email, snail mail, or fax a form to return</li>
            <li>Most tend to suffer from poor design, and when my last razor broke (battery kept getting weaker and weaker), I started hunting for the oh-so-familiar Norelco cordless.  </li>
            <li>I have professional hair clippers that I used to use, and I feel that they did a better job, but that is an unfair comparison&lt;</li>
            <li>It is the same with the pointed guard (the guard is not sharp as a needle - I was just giving an example).</li>
            <li>You will then find hairs all under and over the little mechanism that causes the blades to work in the first place (not the razors themselves--the part that moves them).</li>
            <li>Little bit on higher cost</li>
            <li>Does this mean that they are shipping this unit with both because of the calls to replace the original one that was jabbing users?</li>
            <li>first unit broke when the latch to the little door broke off.</li>
            <li>I love the vacuum bit, makes trimming significantly less messy.</li>
            <li>I know of no other such device that will vacuum the stubble, which is a definite plus as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>The built in vacuum keeps the blades clear of whiskers from clumping up like my last one.</li>
            <li>Since it was the model with the turbo boost for the vacuum I assumed it would have the handy-dandy contour following comb that was with the old one.  </li>
            <li>I definitely like the vacuum feature as well as my &amp;#34;wife&amp;#34; who now doesn&#x27;t get nearly as upset when I trim my beard.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is ideal for the lady friend because girls hate hair in the sink.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature works poorly and any one who buys a trimmer would be better off with a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>Then again, this is true of every single trimmer I have tried, and is not unique to this model.</li>
            <li>Only con is that the storage space for the hairs is pretty small and you have to empty it pretty often.</li>
            <li>The plastic is a little cheap and flimsy, and it is sharp on the underneath side, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me.  </li>
            <li>The door that the hair gets sucked into also feels weak and can probably easily be snapped off,</li>
            <li>They become totally blocked and jammed with shaven whiskers VERY quickly because the vacuum is not powerful enough to remove them.  </li>
            <li>For weeks I struggled using a tiny trimmer with a cheap comb and eventually I quit because the mess of hair left in the sink hardly made it worth shaving my face; as a result, I watched as daily my beard grew incrementally, looking ever closer in appearance to the heckled fur on a chihuahua&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature actually works pretty well and now it comes with the curved guard, so I started with that one and never tried the other one.</li>
            <li>Ok well that is not so bad, right?</li>
            <li>the naked trimmer (i.e. without either of the guides) is not prominent enough (what I&#x27;ve been used to in the past) to get a good trim for definition making it kind of awkward to use for that.  </li>
            <li>First charge showed fully charged but when I took it off charger it shows Orange (7 minutes or less time left).</li>
            <li>the head height has a flexible plastic brush that when pressed against your face bends and makes the height adjustment pointless because it shaves you super short...</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that I find the vacuum to be sort of pointless since you have to clean up anyway.  </li>
            <li>A few facial hairs still hit the sink, but this razor captures ~95% of regular trims, and the facial hair container is an adequate size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The screen does make it a bit harder to clean up once it is dumped but you figure out little tricks as you go .</li>
            <li>Only other thing I&#x27;d note is that if you use it for trimming chest hair, the compartment fills up pretty quickly and you&#x27;ll need to empty a few times.</li>
            <li>I was a little wary of the vacuum as I thought it might be a gimmick, but in the end I&#x27;ve been really happy with my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>your time the first few times you use it to understand what direction and angle to get what you want.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it on my eyebrows I started with a very high Millimeter setting and turned it down a bit and repeated until I got the length I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I can generally trim an area with only a couple of passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only complaint is the cheap door on the raiser keeps popping open.</li>
            <li>i keep a 3-4 mm beard in general with occasional 2mm cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The edges are sharp and it&#x27;s not a smooth, comfortable experience at all.</li>
            <li>I remove the guide to trim my mustache, which I like natural length, just trimmed above my mouth, unlike Wolf, who looks like he runs the trimmer flat over his mustache.  </li>
            <li>Seems to hold a charge for a long period, so far no cons.</li>
            <li>Both left shaved divots on my face, barely trimming the rest.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;setting&#x27; is likely when the trim measuring guard is removed, and you use the bare trimmer on your face.</li>
            <li>The old one did for a long time, but then two of the plastic attachments cracked.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I put up with my old piece of junk trimmer for this long.</li>
            <li>There is a bigger gap at the sides of the bare guard.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it was worth the money I paid for it...</li>
            <li>The system cut pretty well with few split beard hairs.     </li>
            <li>I have to make sure to hold the door shut while I&#x27;m using the trimmer which is not ideal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery - The first charge for three hours and until the lights went out as instructed - had a run time of about five minutes before it was dead.</li>
            <li>clogs with hair in the first few seconds of use.</li>
            <li>It cuts pretty evenly with few strokes.</li>
            <li>The first one I had a few years ago, and it became faulty within around 2 months of usage.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the small increase in price.</li>
            <li>I have moderately thick hair and it takes me a full charge to do a trim because I have to go over and over my beard.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish it was easier to clean.</li>
            <li>While it cuts the hair, it digs in and is less comfortable than my previous razor.</li>
            <li>That leaves the need to clean the sink and brush all the hair from the collection chamber which seems to have a static charge to make this task as annoying as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to have to wash some of the trimmings down the sink anyway, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s 1/2 of them or all of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i was expecting a larger and less tight space for the hair, so it&#x27;s easily removed.</li>
            <li>Ever since I got it for him he has been sporting at least a little bit of a beard, and trying out different lengths, no more clean shaven hubby for me :-)</li>
            <li>the vacuum works just not as well as I had hoped but in the end it is less of a clean up then usual and most of the other comments about the turbo setting having to be used is mostly right but depends on if you can waste a little extra time not to use it.</li>
            <li>It now has a vacuum attached, which is great if you need a really small vacuum but not so great if you want to trim facial hair as this places the cutting head further back meaning that you can no longer use it to trim either closely, trim an edge or follow contours as the cutting edge being so far away from the front precludes</li>
            <li>Since you cannot use water you need to use this very small brush to clean it every time.</li>
            <li>The latter is exactly like previous models going back</li>
            <li>The vacuum barely worked  on the lower model</li>
            <li>Upon opening the box the first thing I noticed is that the product itself is actually just black and white but the image makes it seem like it has a teal tint, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li>This comb feels very comfortable on your face and it is the only one you&#x27;ll ever need (the other one is garbage), but you&#x27;ll need to remove it later on if you want to get to those hard to reach places, like under your nose.</li>
            <li>the second blade, that moves, is set back far enough that this likely affects the length as well, but I assume this is a safety measure so that I don&#x27;t slice the skin off my face.  </li>
            <li>Battery charge life is long, and charge time is relatively short, around an hour from a dead battery to full charge, and numerous trimmings between charges.</li>
            <li>Also, I generally clean the bathroom and the vacuum that the shaver has sucks up a lot of the trimmed hair which helps me out tremendously😉</li>
            <li>Gussied up a bit with &amp;#34;digital&amp;#34; readout, instead of small printed numbers in a window,  but other than that pretty much</li>
            <li>, the vacuum (no other trimmer has one yet), the ease of adjustments, and low maintenance.  </li>
            <li>I had the G380 several years and the Ni-Cd batteries weren&#x27;t lasting very long, so a new trimmer was a must.</li>
            <li>The stubble head differs from the comb in two main ways: it has no spring-loaded tail; instead resembling a single, flat, solid unit atop the trimmer; and it has the \\&quot;guard\\&quot; teeth in front of the razors removed.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to other buyers.</li>
            <li>So eliminates a mess making a mess free trim?</li>
            <li>I wish there was a half star because I really would have given it 4.5 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about a year and a half, I noticed the door on the front of the unit wasn&#x27;t holding shut very well and as a result the suction power was suffering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The attachments aren&#x27;t very helpful for trimming less than 6 mm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting used to it, but my previous trimmer was much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first, I thought the two buttons controlled the trimmer and the vacuum features, respectively, but upon closer inspection of the manual, it appears that one is a power button (activating both trimmer and vacuum), and the other is a \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button, increasing the power to both the trimmer and the vacuum.  </li>
            <li>I was also surprised at how quiet and relatively minor</li>
            <li>You will either get a very short cut near your lip and a long cut under the nose.    </li>
            <li>Lastly, does not allow for detailed sculpting without removing the guard completely, which is still hard to use due to the unhandy size.</li>
            <li>Vacuum keeps the mess to a minimum, and the ergamomics are better than my past trimmers.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a super thick beard</li>
            <li>so instead of taking a solid minute to clean up after yourself on a non-vacuum model, you take a solid minute to empty the little basket that they give you.  </li>
            <li>The problem is, that part broke rather quickly, and now i have the little door held closed with a rubber band.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews are people with thin beards who were smitten with the product during the first week - I&#x27;m certain they regret the purchase a few weeks later.</li>
            <li>It is just that the rechargeable battery, which came fully charged, worked very well until the initial charge went down.  </li>
            <li>Preferably start with long length for the first use and go down step by step - they tell you to do so in the user manual</li>
            <li>Preferably start with long length for the first use and go down step by step - they tell you to do so in the user manual</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a mess to clean up afterwards due to its vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>It has a big open space right where the trimmer is at, if you trim at a little bit of a strange angle be prepared for a very short or bare</li>
            <li>What i had seen on one post was a guy saying that he had read the other reviews and despite that was having no problems with the main guard and that actually it gave him a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this model again, and in general I would certainly pay a little extra for the vacuum feature again as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main draw for this product is the vacuum system that captures hairs for \\&quot;mess free trimming.\\&quot; In truth, it&#x27;s a highly deceptive product that leaves a giant mess in the sink, cuts very unevenly and has an almost unusable mustache</li>
            <li>but it is just a little large for travelling.</li>
            <li>Really does reduce the mess, but don&#x27;t expect perfection.</li>
            <li>It really helps with the mess of the cut hair.  </li>
            <li>The only detractor is the missing trim head for fine detail work that the previous trimmer had.</li>
            <li>There are no flat surfaces anywhere on this trimmer, so you can&#x27;t rest it on either end.</li>
            <li>How are we as consumers supposed to keep waste out of landfills if lazy companies sell us products that never last more than a couple years and can&#x27;t be repaired?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new trimmer after I used this one once because I don&#x27;t want to have to worry about having a bald spot in my beard if I wasn&#x27;t careful enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new model, only comes with the wide blade, no narrower detailing blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m upgrading over a 10 year old model that had a loose door and tended to turn on inside my luggage.</li>
            <li>This means that if you change the orientation of the razor with your face, then you can accidentally lean it forward to where the razor blades are directly on your skin and loose the height guide you&#x27;ve specified.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t care much about those things then you&#x27;ll get the same shave from the T-980 for much less money.    </li>
            <li>I much prefer the guard on my previous model (and that is on the current Philips Norelco Qt4050 model).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Since everybody wants to see the cons - the capacity of the clippings container only lasts half a trim before it spits hair everywhere.</li>
            <li>I thought my previous Remington trimmer had more consistent trimming and the vacuum worked a tad better, but the battery life was horrible and it ultimately couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li>but I have to say that I&#x27;m cleaning less hairs than normal!</li>
            <li>It is good, but not as expected, I mean it does not give me the option to do different bird styles, all what I can do is normal shaving, which sometimes sucks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vacuum certainly helps reduce mess, but it won&#x27;t eliminate it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a very large amount of adjustability, which is fine as long as you aren&#x27;t trying to do anything crazy with your facial hair.</li>
            <li>The current depth setting is also indicated by two small rulers on the sides of the guard - right side metric, left side inches.</li>
            <li>I can plug it in, and use it right away after it is dead, but if the battery is failing now, how long can it last?</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing, if you&#x27;re like me and were tired of cleaning up the mess after a trim, say hello to this gem.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get everything but definitely eliminates the mess and trims very well.</li>
            <li>it could maybe use a slightly stronger vacuum, but that may increase bulk of the trimmer and decrease battery life, so I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>Vac really helps out on preventing such a mess and keeping hair from trapping in your beard.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only 30 days to return it, which for me was not long enough to discover the battery problem.</li>
            <li>The cut is fine, but now the broken door clip has made me go look for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re trimming over a sink, you&#x27;ll still see some hair trimmings in the bowl, but far, far less than if you use a trimmer without a vacuum.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; feature is really neat, and I&#x27;ve fount it helpful when I&#x27;ve let my beard grow a little longer</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need the little LED lights in the handle</li>
            <li>I did my homework on the new model norelco, but had concerns over some reviews I read concerning the&lt;br /&gt;adjustable blade guard being sharp edged and nicking users.</li>
            <li>Smooth, close and reaches that tough spot under your nose.</li>
            <li>, the drawer for the trimmed hair fills up quick, it&#x27;s not a very even trim, and it&#x27;s not a strong trimmer.</li>
            <li>- NO vacuum trimmer out there will!  </li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable con paired to others I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>Even though few trimmings are not collected into the vacuum chamber, they are few enough that they are easily wiped out &amp; drained into the sink.</li>
            <li>like the battery indicator, so I can easily see if I have enough batter for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;After a 20+ minute marathon trimming where I slowly stepped down the length setting, the battery indicator barely seemed to go down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>vacuum feature contains the mess at least 90% better than our going everywhere and clogging up the drain.  </li>
            <li>And if you lengthen the setting to recess the blades, those flexible pointy little daggers become the problem that more than one reviewer complained about.</li>
            <li>But if you are trimming a longer length off it does not vacuum as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can steadily grow my facial hair without looking homeless, but I can also mow it down whenever I start looking like I belong in a Geico commercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from not being able to pull the hair receptacle out to dump those little suckers in the trash like the 980 let me do (this one&#x27;s hinged), which I prefer, this is a terrific trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little loud with the turbo mode on...louder than a regular pair of Wahl or Conair hair clippers, but not obnoxiously loud.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricy to be missing such an important feature.  </li>
            <li>On the plus(?) side it uses lithium batteries so it goes full power until it stops unlike Nicad batteries which warn you by slowing down a little one or two shaves before stopping.  </li>
            <li>I also quickly found that due to the flexibility of the guide using a low setting results in a really uneven cut.  </li>
            <li>Vacuum feature leaves very little mess and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>but you still will have a little mess to clean up</li>
            <li>Yet if you have a fierce man beard this will cut it, it just won&#x27;t catch much of it in the little vacuum deal it&#x27;s got.</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to aiming for straight edges because of the extra space that the vacuum area encompasses, but you will figure it out.  </li>
            <li>As some other reviews that have one star ( only one star because 0 stars is not an option), the plastic cover that covers where the hair is trapped breaks easily and good luck getting the online rep to understand anything about the broken part, they will keep asking you to look at a web page with accessory parts that do not include anything remotely similar to what you are saying is broken.</li>
            <li>Battery life new was flaky, the head is too bulky (due to the vacuum feature) and can&#x27;t trim evenly under the nose and around the ears.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It trims his beard perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Also, I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the trimming comb attachments.</li>

            <li> another one-thought it to be one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used/owned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> could be your best friend, but for what I was looking for it was overkill on features, and underwhelming on delivering the 5 o&#x27;clock look.</li>

            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ability to use both corded and cordless is also an excellent feature; my battery arrived drained, but plugging it in allowed immediate use.</li>
            <li> I use the rigid guide, and set the trimmer at 6mm, for a perfect beard.  </li>
            <li> thing I like best about this Phillips trimmers is its design and ergonomics.</li>

            <li> The reality is that about 80% to 90% get sucked into the trimmer&#x27;s container, which is great, but it also means that the remaining 10% or 20% end up in your sink.</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;This is a great addition to your trimmer.</li>
            <li> However, after just setting it to the length I hoped would be correct, I just pushed in through the hair to the skin and let it fly and that seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a great trimmer</li>
            <li> QT4070 is a great trimmer with an improved adjustment dial for beard height.  </li>

            <li> Does a great job trimming.  </li>
            <li> the turbo vac&lt;br /&gt;system is great.</li>
            <li> Works great for me.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s everything I had hoped for great beard trimmer</li>

            <li> Amazing beard trimmer!</li>
            <li> For those two purposes it works amazing!</li>
            <li> The battery life is also absolutely remarkable, as I have not recharged it once yet.  </li>
            <li> Unsurprising, because surely you have a personality to match that marvelous appearance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m good for another 10 years!!!  </li>
            <li> Great product and good price.</li>
            <li> In short, Norelco continues to improve on the design of its vac/trim system and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve owned from them - and they are among the best if not the best out there at this mid-level price</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is good and does a great job of trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> I think they were successful in creating a lower quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without</li>
            <li> I have always had Norelco products, but love this one the best !</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever tried, it shows how many mm you are trying to cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for measured trimming, But could do better at trimming without a measured length.  </li>
            <li> a great product and good seller</li>
            <li> and the best part is the way the length setting is able to be locked</li>
            <li> Good quality razor leaves a great finish and look.</li>
            <li> They are very happy with it and intend to use it for many years.</li>
            <li> Just as listed and timely sent , nice!</li>
            <li> but I am still having a good amount fly everywhere.</li>
            <li> i had it for a year or more and works , functions excellent.</li>
            <li> I have been a hair stylist for many years and am very impressed with this clipper.</li>
            <li> THAT IS NICE!</li>
            <li> but with just a bit more power it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> The readout is a wonderful idea... and would be much better if it worked correctly.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, provides great stubble look all the time.</li>
            <li> After trying many trimmers this one has been the best one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many trimmers, razors, and shavers and this one seems to be the best one out there.</li>
            <li> all family members say it is the best razor they have ever owned! :)</li>
            <li> though it was kind of bulky!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the best.</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with its design and how well it works.</li>
            <li> I called Philips Customer Care (with whom I&#x27;ve always had a pleasant experience)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to those in the market for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Very light, battery life is very good.</li>
            <li> works great good good good good good good good good good</li>
            <li> Please note it does not increase in .5mm increments, which is fine because the 1mm setting is the perfect length for a groomed stubble look.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very good at that, on turbo it cuts better, and is faster than the Remington.</li>
            <li> , I know that philips makes the best shavers on the market, but to be honest, I haven&#x27;t found the QT4050 or QT4070 to be better then</li>
            <li> Sounds good.</li>
            <li> and it does a perfect and smooth job with trimming with sizes...</li>
            <li> This good for nothing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> The result is as good as any trim I ever paid for...</li>
            <li> Couple that with good Lithium batteries and this trimmer is just about as close to perfection as you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer does a good job on the moustage and beard and keeps the clippings from clogging the drain.</li>
            <li> Prompt Delivery, Reciprocity,Restraint seller and Product received In Good Condition.</li>
            <li> Battery life seems to be good.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, works great for trimming and turbo mode is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Good for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Bought this as hopefully a good stubble trimmer, but even without the guard (which is the lowest setting)</li>
            <li> I don travel a good bit and this lets me know</li>
            <li> Got a good beard trim from this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t suck up all the hair, but it does a fairly good job of it.</li>
            <li> So yes, it looks good.</li>
            <li> (what else would it be good for?).</li>
            <li> (what else would it be good for?).</li>
            <li> If you need a good beard trimmer, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> really good trimmer, doesnt snag.</li>
            <li> Both have beards and both loved it.  </li>
            <li> Works great as a beard trimmer for the length but not so effective to create the lines you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because this is a good trimmer otherwise.</li>
            <li> :  Trims good.  </li>
            <li> Vacuums good.  </li>
            <li> There was actually a good three-week period in which I didn&#x27;t use it at all.  </li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in good shape and in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have been delighted with the product.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer</li>
            <li> It has a good range of hair length settings.   </li>
            <li> This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good product but tricky to learn to use.  </li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product but not meant for longevity.</li>
            <li> He says that he likes this trimmer; it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> The adjustments are good, and it does a good job in trimming the beard.  </li>
            <li> It is not quite as good as that one and that s why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
            <li> The battery is good.  </li>
            <li> , it really is a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li> in-all when i find a good replacement, this thing is going</li>
            <li> in-all when i find a good replacement, this thing is going</li>
            <li> If all you need is a beard trimmer, avoid combo kits as they don&#x27;t have good auxiliary tools.</li>
            <li> To summarize, this is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> So being the fair minded man that I am, I gave it</li>
            <li> This is a good, well-made, trimmer.</li>
            <li> To get a good trim, I need to see where I am trimming while I am trimming.  </li>
            <li> think this trimmer is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> Good product guys.</li>
            <li> It appears to be fairly well constructed, time will tell about its durability.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> I jumped to this shaver as a replacement, but it doesn&#x27;t cut anywhere as good as the Remington did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good purchase and I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for a good amount of time before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> It works, hair is sucked in, and my face looks good.  </li>
            <li> the 8-9mm settings are a good compromise between a beard and stubble to maintain for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It would have been good to know beforehand that this was the case</li>
            <li> It looks good.  </li>
            <li> Good trimmer that keeps a good charge.  </li>
            <li> good product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the battery, display, and vaccum system.</li>
            <li> It does a good</li>
            <li> battery life seems to be quite good.</li>
            <li> A good trimmer</li>
            <li> but it was a good one.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, great idea, but</li>
            <li> Great for beard, body or even shaving your own head&lt;</li>
            <li> life is good..</li>
            <li> He looks good.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is just as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> think I made the best available choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lithium Ion battery - 1 hour charge - good battery life&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shopped for a good versatile trimmer that could leave the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look with precision.</li>
            <li> --it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Its a good trimmer, but not for close ups.&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
            <li> Battery seems to hold a charge for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> It is a good equipment, but is not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It does a good job just like my Phillips Norelco shavers have always done.</li>
            <li> Battery life has been good also</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall good product if it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; up 100% of clippings but a good 90-95% (you&#x27;d need a shop-vac attached for the rest)</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift that was requested specifically because of its good qualities and reliability.  </li>
            <li> Does not do a good job of keeping the whiskers vacuumed.</li>
            <li> Good razor though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good on making edges and trimming place like under the nose.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a good trimmer to maintain your scruff, go with this one.</li>
            <li> i have been using this item and so good, if you want to cut you hear this item is so good</li>
            <li> Its good.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t the perfect fit for our needs.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good and it can run on AC as well if plugged in.</li>
            <li> Battery life good.</li>
            <li> He loves it and mine is still good except mine</li>
            <li> Good trimmer for that &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; / &amp;#34;Lost&amp;#34</li>
            <li> A good storage/travel&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the best beard trimmer currently available for a number of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but none of them did as good a job as this.  </li>
            <li> and i loved it .</li>
            <li> Excellent, does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> so I looked for a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Good tool</li>
            <li> loved it, until it died.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco used to be really good.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We&#x27;ll start with the good.  </li>
            <li> Now all that has to happen it it gets here in good shape</li>
            <li> It recharges fairly</li>
            <li> He loved it.</li>
            <li> but otherwise it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> but i found that it didn&#x27;t catch all the hairs and was fairly noisy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, precise control</li>
            <li> I have a beard that I keep fairly trim.</li>
            <li> As good as advertised.</li>
            <li> Its good quality for beard length control, and shaping.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> seller sent the item in good time as well.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> Its good compare to all,but it some times cutt the skin without clip</li>
            <li> Good price too</li>
            <li> But it does a good job and the lighter weight is a plus.</li>
            <li> Philips ownership seems to be good for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up going with the Conaire iStubble and loved it.</li>
            <li> ---it&#x27;s a good idea.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> The battery life has been really good, too.</li>
            <li> Was a good trimmer for a couple of years and then stopped working a month after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> Really good trimmer.</li>
            <li> But not so good for getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the fact that it catches a lot of the hair (not all, but hey nothing is perfect).</li>
            <li> A good buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for the trimming that I want.</li>
            <li> The vaccume  on it works good</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> great for the man who does his own beard.</li>
            <li> My wife commented that my beard never looked so good.</li>
            <li> good product based on paid value..</li>
            <li> I use guard setting 3, which is fairly short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good trimmer.</li>
            <li> The travel lock is good.</li>
            <li> and he loved it.  </li>
            <li> For the money it was a good product.</li>
            <li> this is so good</li>
            <li> Its good, and the vaccum is a good function.</li>
            <li> Will recommend for any person who is looking for good grooming device.</li>
            <li> All the things that I loved about the T980 were still there in the QT unit.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> and it just didn&#x27;t do a good job of sucking up the hair...</li>
            <li> Good trimmer</li>
            <li> i get the item its a vary good shaver .</li>
            <li> and it has a good weight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for trips once you know which attachment of the two</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re good</li>
            <li> good news:&lt;br</li>

            <li> Received in good order.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good.</li>
            <li> But for what it is designed to do I think it is really good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, the good bits.</li>
            <li> the not so good.</li>
            <li> The battery life is not as good as my Norelco shaver.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my norelco beard trimmer for almost 14 years and loved it.</li>
            <li> Loved this.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at catching a good amount of shaved whiskers in</li>
            <li> and I am struggling to find the best angle to obtain a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I was initially very pleased with this trimmer and it still does a good job with the trimming.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how it would work on a full beard but for stubble it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the sink nice and tidy and he says that it makes shaving a breeze!</li>
            <li> Not bad - but not the best.</li>
            <li> The QT4070/41 beard trimmer is very nice, I like the flexible head attachment and that the length adjustment is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> this is a ultimate buy best i ever done do not miss out best stubble cutter ever</li>
            <li> It trims my beard perfectly and charges up quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, and once you call and get the superior contour comb guard(I have posted images in the product image gallery of the differences between the 2), you&#x27;ll have a truly great product.</li>
            <li> an exceptional amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It came quickly and I am very happy with the Qt4070</li>
            <li> The learning curve was quick and the results were excellent.  </li>
            <li> ,  I too have found the effects of this razor very nice, and it&#x27;s easy to use!</li>
            <li> I can still say it works great, but the plastic was indeed very cheap.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very good and advanced...</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> , i was very pleased.</li>

            <li> Glad we found it here on Amazon at a great price.,</li>
            <li> I have used this model beard &amp; stubble trimmer for years and been very satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li> : The design is very handsome.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it plugged in as well as on battery is a great bonus.</li>

            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> He is very pleased with this one also.</li>
            <li> I love this razor for shaving my beard flip it on turbo and it cleaned up just about everything some hairs fly</li>
            <li> but it still works great better than having hair everywhere</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and efficient and the product lived up to all its claims, very pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for about a month now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with my gift to him of the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Great product with many features.</li>
            <li> Works great with outstanding battery life.</li>
            <li> and I would be more than happy to pay for it...</li>
            <li> Very satisfied</li>
            <li> by Philips Norelco and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the way it worked</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the design and the trimming of the QT4070.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product, from a wife&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer with many adjustments.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with his trimmer.</li>
            <li> Rated this five stars as I am very pleased with the trimmer and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I would be more than happy to pay for it...</li>
            <li> The many settings for hair length work great as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and have been very impressed... worth every penny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that you will be happy with this product should you choose to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great machine and gives you better control over the trim level.</li>
            <li> but I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> A ton of settings to trim those fly aways and just make his beard look more clean/put together.</li>
            <li> But, it breaks every 3 months even with very light use!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great none better take from a guy who has had a beard for 45 years</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer itself, it is really great.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Got this based on the reviews and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> it seems well made, nice controls and a good battery.</li>
            <li> but this one does a fare superior job of keeping my whiskers nicely trimmed.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, nice adjustable settings.  </li>
            <li> If you want stubble or a nice beard trimmer this is a good buy</li>
            <li> One is the stabby kind like people mentioned, but it does a good job getting closer.</li>
            <li> The shave is perfectly even at any set length and this thing is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The ability to adjust length right on the trimmer, without all the attachments, is awesome.</li>
            <li> And it has so many lenth settings, its really a great device to own.</li>
            <li> I would say it is the best available, but it could be better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I think this device has the best combination of attributes available, now I just have to be a better user of the tool.</li>
            <li> fortunately for me, it fits perfectly in my Braunpouch :)</li>
            <li> fortunately for me, it fits perfectly in my Braun pouch :)</li>
            <li> the cut is exceptional, the battery life is good, the trimmer does its job exceptionally well, I just wish they had designed the door on the whisker compartment better.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this beard trimmer!</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s better!  </li>
            <li> i love Amazon reviews!  </li>
            <li> I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li> but when you are charging it use a timer to make sure you don&#x27;t over charge it!</li>
            <li> and they said I would be okay to return the shaver in 3 days - the 46th day after buying the shaver!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you dump out the hair before transporting it as movement will cause the hair to fall out everywhere from the trimmer!</li>
            <li> Shaver was excellent exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> think more of a 48-hour shadow!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with how well the vaccum works.</li>
            <li> The first, and best trimmer I ever owned was a Panasonic which they ended up discontinuing -  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I can use it many times before charging it again!</li>
            <li> This product allows him the stubble he desires and allows me to still see his handsome face!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Amazon refunded my money and let me keep the trimmer, which is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I have never seen it look better!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love some recommendations to try as an alternative to this!</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I got it!</li>
            <li> You just cant expect the best result from the first try.</li>
            <li> I have always used Wahl trimmers for my goatee, this the first Norelco trimmer I have ever owned, and the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned....</li>
            <li> love it !</li>
            <li> This is an excellent beard trimmer which works exactly as described but may have a design flaw.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> I have never used better beard trimmer in my life!</li>
            <li> Love the turbo mode!</li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise, the new timmer worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I liked my $20 Whal much better. :P</li>
            <li> I used to love it when I grew out my goatee, but for a full on beard its not the greatest.  </li>
            <li> Great shape and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> He said it works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> i bought this product as a christmas gift to my husband and he loves it easy to use and its great to use on his beard.</li>
            <li> It is easy to adjust the lengths, and it does a great job of trimming.</li>
            <li> Works great and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li> This is my first trimming tool, the vaccume is great at greatly reducing the amount of hair that drops out.</li>
            <li> I just used my QT4070 for the first time, and I was kind of impressed.</li>
            <li> My husband has full beard and mustache and loved it!</li>
            <li> Great fine adjustments for any length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That seemed fine to me, because besides that, it sounds like a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking and easy to use trimmer.</li>
            <li> Amazing, if you have a beard you need one.</li>
            <li> For me, I find using themachine with the hair grain as oppose to against the hair grain works amazing.</li>
            <li> The rest of the performance is amazing</li>
            <li> Phillips now ships the QT with the correct crumb and it really is an amazing trimmer.</li>
            <li> The electronic readout to accurately set the millimeter hight for the shave ...  was great ...  until it broke.  </li>
            <li> This light trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li> The difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> The clippers make me look amazing.</li>
            <li> but it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> thing has the precision, can handle a stubble beard, cuts amazingly well</li>
            <li> The battery on this thing is freakin amazing, I never do reviews but had to submit a review just because of the battery.</li>
            <li> This kit works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> and after i did it worked amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing when you think about it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing device.  </li>
            <li> Amazing beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> Think of it more like a good ride-on mower as opposed to a lawn edger.</li>
            <li> Nice to have it around if i need it....</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful, has great battery life and a good length selector.</li>
            <li> I received the QT4070 today with a nice mantle of scruff today.  </li>
            <li> it is nice.</li>
            <li> More competition would lead to greater innovation, but the Phillips-Norelco turbo vac trimmer does a great job for now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice trimmer..</li>
            <li> it cleans its own hairs up through vacume built in brill</li>
            <li> It gathers about 60% of it, which is still nice.</li>
            <li> This razor is the perfect indulgence for the man who wants a quick-charging mustache/beard/stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, feels good, cuts good.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if there were some way of integrating it into the trimmer; but there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I can see Turbo mode being a handy feature for the hairier mammals of our species, however.     </li>
            <li> The LCD display shows battery level, as well as trim length setting, and there are length index marks along the side of the trimmer as well, a nice feature if the LCD ever goes on the fritz.     </li>
            <li> and I have been able to keep my beard looking good.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who grew a beard for a Christmas production and he discovered he liked the beard.  </li>
            <li> Nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> In addition, the hair catching system doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I own three of these one set for hair &amp; one for my beard.</li>
            <li> The turbo boost in this model is nice, and I use it on occasion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all-around Great!!!  </li>
            <li> The travel lock is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> Until a month ago, about 5 months after I bought it, it would spontaneously turn on by itself.  </li>
            <li> --I kept that guide nice and level like a couple of reviewers</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good beard trimmer but make sure you keep that charger with you.</li>
            <li> honestly have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Fits my hand nicely.</li>
            <li> The adjustable settings are nice as well 1-18mm I believe.</li>
            <li> It seemed like the best no-fuss solution, without the vibration of the Wahl and yet more powerful than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok because it is still fairly close.</li>
            <li> It trims nicely and without pain or pulling.    </li>
            <li> nice led display too.</li>
            <li> Trims evenly and nicely.  </li>
            <li> I LIKED IT</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no charger stand or wall mounting unit, and it doesn&#x27;t stand on its own.</li>
            <li> The shave is excellent, and Norelco sends two styles of head which is really helpful.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is a good quality trimmer...</li>
            <li> It does a good job of collecting most of the hair that you trim.</li>
            <li> I also own the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This kind of misleading marketing annoys me.  </li>
            <li> and it comes out looking nice.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have a carrying case or pouch to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NICE IDEA</li>
            <li> Its nice and</li>
            <li> The suction of hair is nice</li>
            <li> I like to cut my own hair and beard.</li>
            <li> A mustache trimmer would have been nice, but I can&#x27;t dock for something I knew it didn&#x27;t have and bought anyway.</li>
            <li> My T980 is still good, but the cutter unit won&#x27;t click into place any more, as the flimsy design causes a break at the housing.</li>
            <li> But now, I think I will just research on my own.</li>
            <li> Has a turbo mode which I haven&#x27;t even needed to use yet, but nice knowing it has it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of soothing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being able to use it while plugged in is good.</li>
            <li> I hope I won&#x27;t need it, but it&#x27;s nice to have it.</li>
            <li> length adjustment is nice and seems to work quite well.</li>
            <li> This fits nicely into my compact / travel shaving kit, so I like it just how it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice even trim and</li>
            <li> I have owned a lot of norelco beard trimmers and this one is as good or better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found incredibly nice</li>
            <li> It will also leave you that nice stubbly 5-oclock shawdow look if thats the look you want.</li>
            <li> I own the norelco everything</li>
            <li> trimmer feels nice in the hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The seller send the item in a nice packed way.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> overall though, the greatest trimmer in the world lasted me over 7 years, if this one gives me 5....ill be happy.</li>
            <li> It has a great feel in your hand and the digital readout is awesome.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice settings.</li>
            <li> I am loving it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice touch and makes cleanup easier.</li>
            <li> The charger/power cord is nice and small/light, not bulky at all</li>
            <li> Charge indicator is nice as is the travel (power) lock although I haven&#x27;t needed it yet.</li>
            <li> Every man should own one of these</li>
            <li> It would also be nice if the product had a stand.  </li>
            <li> so it will not roll of a cradle would be nice.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t pickup everything, but you can&#x27;t honestly expect that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice having the trimmer altogether in one piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight shaver for light-duty trims.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> My dad also liked it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very well made and does an excellent job keeping my beard well groomed.</li>
            <li> Design is nice looking.</li>
            <li> This thing really makes everything best and even.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a detailer, you may want to purchase a cheaper one to complement the nice trims of this product.</li>
            <li> I have treated this thing so nicely.</li>
            <li> it worked, I liked the thing alright.  </li>
            <li> He likes to keep a nice beard.  </li>
            <li> liked it</li>
            <li> And no, I don&#x27;t work for or own stock in the company.</li>
            <li> This was a really nice upgrade from my 8-year-old trimmer.</li>
            <li> doesnt trim as close as i would have liked, and seems to leave longer straglers.</li>
            <li> Loving this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Talk about nice.</li>
            <li> Turbo button is nice to have as well.</li>
            <li> Efficient, effective, no nonsense trimmer.</li>
            <li> I really liked that trimmer though and it served me well for years, so this was the replacement of choice.    </li>
            <li> Nice Job to the Phillips/Norelco engineers</li>
            <li> so so - doesn&#x27;t really vaccum well.&lt;br /&gt;Probably perfect for just sideburns and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Otherwise quite nice</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the number handy</li>
            <li> Nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li> This is the best and really does pick up 90 percent of the beard hair.</li>
            <li> I just bought the stainless steel Wahl and an very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The turbo mode is a nice feature</li>
            <li> very happy with this trimmer works very well</li>
            <li> A nice trimmer</li>
            <li> and this is a really nice upgrade.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job on my beard and mustaches.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer for what I need to do</li>
            <li> so I find that perfect area instead of being too much or too little.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I found not as effective in reaching &amp; trimming these &#x27;nook &amp; cranny&#x27; type areas of my face.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Durable and flexible; nice that you can charge it or use it plugged in.</li>
            <li> Will not take any kind of charge and cannot even use while plugged in.</li>
            <li> The power boost button is nice.  </li>
            <li> The flex head is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> THis product is great as it has the dual trimmers as opposed to the combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head is a great part of the shaver as it makes trimming some areas much easier.  </li>
            <li> not as close a shave as i would have liked.</li>
            <li> It gives him a nice even trim.</li>
            <li> I was using a Phillips Norelco beard trimmer, and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think they could have done better improving what I think is a good product</li>
            <li> Not as good as the model it replaced but better than anything else on the market...</li>
            <li> This works just as the model before it, which I own as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would have been nice if it came with a carrying case.</li>
            <li> Somewhat inconsistent cuttingâ€”I find beard hairs not cut and just kind of bent.</li>
            <li> For those of you that keep a beard, it&#x27;ll be nice to have.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t see the issue.</li>
            <li> Could be better; A good tool to have</li>
            <li> the motor must have busted) and I liked how it vacuumed up stray hair</li>
            <li> But it has done a nice job on keeping my beard nice and trimmed.  </li>
            <li> system is nice</li>
            <li> The beard guard works effectively on non-mustache areas of the face.</li>
            <li> and I get a nice even shave</li>
            <li> It does a nice job trimming</li>
            <li> Really nice to have the trimmings door latch working again...</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t remove the battery so it is a fire hazard as it will become warm after being on for a period of time.</li>
            <li> Nice Norelco</li>
            <li> The vacuum works great, and creates the perfect 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, which every man should have.</li>
            <li> works great,  lost a star for  the vacuum which is anything but perfect.  </li>
            <li> I own the older T980 which was excellent.  </li>
            <li> The contour comb is perfect for my beard while the stubble comb is fantastic for keeping sideburns and up around my ears clean in between haircuts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek, light, great hand-feel, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco does a great job with minimum hassle in addition to keeping all the hair in the unit and not all over the sink - well worth the money!</li>
            <li> but still well worth the buy!!!</li>
            <li> I love this razor, it gives an excellent consistent shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> My wife hates hairs on the sink and I am not always great about getting it clean.  </li>
            <li> Here are all the features he likes: comfortable to hold; cleans easily; collects hair so it doesn&#x27;t go all over the sink; good battery life; attractive design;</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleanly addresses my good looking beard!</li>
            <li> this is the best machine i ever used, fast, not noisy, light, the vaccum is useful (not the best but good)&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY happy with this product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pulls hair on normal speed, works perfectly on turbo (no pulled hairs).</li>
            <li> First things first, great shaver, maybe the best WHEN you have all the parts.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY nice product, i was looking for a compatible replacement that will help me clean up after i shave with the my edger.</li>
            <li> The dial for length works great and the vacuum to suck up most of what you&#x27;re shaving off works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought this, said to be very good and easy to clean</li>
            <li> I think if you can adapt your trimming stroke to the new guide you will be very happy with this trimmer...</li>
            <li> It is new trimmer from Philips which is perfect for stubble lovers.</li>
            <li> Which in my book is a excellent new innovation and a must have on a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did an exchange though Amazon and the new one has worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is very good and the vacuum works great.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it may make even more sound than the razor, but its great and seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its smooth, good battery life, nice adjustments</li>
            <li> So this is a great product for guys who can, and do, proudly count themselves as part of the old fashioned bearded society.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve own so far.  </li>
            <li> Great product with quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The turbo option does a good job of capturing the hair and more so, lifting hair a bit to do a better and faster job of trimming.</li>
            <li> trim evenly, easy to use, and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> good shave and a strong battery life.  </li>
            <li> However, it was easily returned, customer service is good.</li>
            <li> Good function and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, doe s great job trimming my beard, it charges quickly and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer, the vacuum feature is superb.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts evenly and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to change the length setting.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t have this charging issue (which is very easy to fix)</li>
            <li> Very easy to adjust beard lenght without damaging plastic changable head.</li>
            <li> The latch is a flimsy piece of plastic that breaks very easily.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and seems to be well-built</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The didital display is very easy to read.</li>
            <li> adjustments are VERY easy, and quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> this is the best designed, best working beard trimmer--especially if you are interested in the stubble settings; this one has 18 length settings, and the very short ones work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one has been pretty good!  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions state that you should use a moustache comb (or any fine-toothed comb) in preparation before using the trimmer, very good advice which I certainly always follow.  </li>
            <li> I find it effective and very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Took me a while to realize that you could disassemble it to clean it out. :P</li>
            <li> Very nice and quick.</li>
            <li> Very good product @ reasonable price</li>
            <li> Very good, but require cleaning very often.</li>
            <li> The contour comb was included and so far, impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is by far the best beard trimmer I have ever seen...great for goatee too...</li>
            <li> and they were totally nice and able to take care of it for me.    </li>
            <li> There are many nice features - from it</li>
            <li> This moustage and beard trimmer is so far the best one I ever had.</li>
            <li> This is good for trimming lightly to keep that groomed look.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Since the comb doesn&#x27;t wrap completely around the blade, you have to hold the trimmer perfectly level to get an even cut.</li>
            <li> so it serves mostly as looking nice than functional for me.  </li>
            <li> There is a free 3 year extended warranty in the box so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the Best electric shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the kind of precision cut that I was expecting in regards to having so many adjustable settings.</li>
            <li> So far I am  very happy with this.</li>
            <li> and I liked that one better.</li>
            <li> By far the best trimmer out there.  </li>
            <li> their predecessor the T980, that was by far the best philips shaver</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have gotten so far.</li>
            <li> So far so great!</li>
            <li> The best beard trimmer by far.</li>
            <li> However, I honestly found the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; trimmers to be better.</li>
            <li> , so far this has been the BEST Norelco electric razor that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s far from perfect.</li>
            <li> It seemed as though I had to do more work than I bargained for to get a nice even shave.</li>
            <li> sure I&#x27;ve not used it, but it&#x27;s nice to know</li>
            <li> It was a great purchase and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful a suction as what Wayne experienced, but unlike what Garth would rate it, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It has great battery life and a powerful motor</li>
            <li> I have used both the hinged and fixed comb-heads and find both work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t keep the trimmer at a perfect angle to your beard, it&#x27;s not hard at all to lop off a lot more than you intended.  </li>
            <li> Product works great and the vacuum part surprisingly works really good.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the beard trimmer and the vacuum feature is great!  </li>
            <li> It is indeed a good machine: effective, efficient and quick.</li>
            <li> I still enjoy the ability to adjust easily and that function still works great.  </li>
            <li> It trims my beard very well and its easy to dial in the perfect length.</li>
            <li> Excellent trims with no mess.</li>
            <li> It works great and was priced right.</li>
            <li> After using it for 6 weeks I can happily say it was the right choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and you don&#x27;t have to search for guards!  </li>
            <li> Some very fine hairs do fall through..</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have very fine, downy whiskers (who does?)</li>
            <li> This means that someone can easily compress the comb, resulting in a trim SHORTER than that set on the unit!  </li>
            <li> Gives him the perfect stubble look, and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess, so we&#x27;re both happy.</li>
            <li> Works great, easily adjustable, and it is very easy to clean up</li>
            <li> Great battery life, easy clean up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a win win situation, try it and if you like it keep it if not send it back.  </li>
            <li> I have had many trimmers and this is by far the best one I have used.</li>
            <li> The best part, is that I was able to use the precision trimming blade from my old Norelco trimmer that died.</li>
            <li> However, it falls short of being a wonderful replacement for my cheapo Remington target pickup of yesteryear (whose own battery has been failing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I would suggest anyone that likes a good clean trim to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard looking fresh, powerful motor and totally awesome</li>
            <li> my result is I love the product, but it dies out very easily</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome but has one major flaw...</li>
            <li> feature I bought it for -- the vacuum -- didn&#x27;t meet expectations, but I was so impressed with the trimmer itself that I still think it&#x27;s deserving of 4 stars.</li>
            <li> very good, better than older models</li>
            <li> While its functionality is excellent, it gets in the way of the blades if you want to use just the bare blades.</li>
            <li> At first glance, this shaver seems great.  </li>
            <li> And my first trim was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I will probably upgrade to a 5 star review if the battery doesn&#x27;t die on me in the first year.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s first beard trimmer/shaver so we don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it works great with no issues.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 years ago for $15 with pretty great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked great for first 3 months.</li>
            <li> This product was great for the first 8 months or so that I had it.</li>
            <li> A good trimmer should feel sleek and cool, IMHO.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;the design is very great (easy to handle and light).&lt;br /&gt;But between this and the new generation philips 5100</li>
            <li> It does a great job keeping the sink clean and provides a precise trim.</li>
            <li> I already own some older Norelco trimmers and they work great.</li>
            <li> the right one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable comb is very accurate at determining the length of the final cut and you can trim without great caution as it adjusts and tracks perfectly.</li>
            <li> It has several depth settings for the best trim and is very easy to change those as well.</li>
            <li> The spring actuated guide is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The tines on the face guard are very cheap</li>
            <li> the Norelco turbo is a very light, easy-to-use trimmer that does its job</li>
            <li> Very comfortable trim.</li>
            <li> Broke within six months of very light use.</li>
            <li> Very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I have a very light goatee which was probably</li>
            <li> has very smooth operation.</li>
            <li> The unit feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> Also like the adjustment for length, it is very precise.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet so holds charge and stream line shape is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable shaver</li>
            <li> But yes I&#x27;d say this was a very fantastic buy</li>
            <li> A pretty good presentation of it&#x60;s qualities brought me to buy it and the great expectations I had vanished just by the very first use.</li>
            <li> nice product, easy to use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it holds a good charge and does an adequate job on the face.  </li>
            <li> Opens easily to dump shavings.&lt;br /&gt;Adjusts lengths easily, nice display shows length of cut.  </li>
            <li> Of course, having a shaver head makes it easy to get nice</li>
            <li> The reason i&#x27;m so positive on this uint, however, is that it DOES A GREAT JOB at sucking up the hair from my beard.  </li>
            <li> Great product and all of the positive reviews are well deserved.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, no stabbing, and works great around the body.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean!</li>
            <li> When you just want to trim you beard to 2mm or more, it works fine!</li>
            <li> Luckily, the trimmer does a very good jobontinuing to make the right comb.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to adjust the guard, the power is great, the vacuum is great, and I look like Ryan Gosling now.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer WAS very good, but it completely stopped working after 9 months.</li>
            <li> My experience has been very good so far.</li>
            <li> Works very well for those who wanna maintain a uniform stubble!&lt;br /&gt;Battery life&#x27;s great, easy to clean, and what not!!</li>
            <li> okay option for a 5 oclock shadow shaver.</li>
            <li> This saves me from losing the 15 heads that most razors come with.</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> The one that was on the trimmer in the box is the one most people are complaining about.</li>
            <li> If Norelco is able to replace it with one that works as advertised, I will update this review  with a more favorable rating.</li>
            <li> I am about to spend more money on probably some clippers and use them on my beard.  </li>
            <li> i just don&#x27;t want anyone else spending $50 or more just to have your face with bumps and infection.</li>
            <li> okay, I don&#x27;t want to buy another though.</li>
            <li> On lowest setting it still does not remove all hair (yes I know it&#x27;s a trimmer and no shaver, but there are many cheaper trimmers out there which do a better job).</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I think they have top notch products.</li>
            <li> There are better and cheaper units out there, that will trim your stubble without slicing up your face.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t hold this trimmer at a perfect angle on you face, expect some very short patches in your beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a goatee man and was looking for something to keep it trim while also being able to pull off that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look by putting a close trim across the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> Trimmer makes me more handsomer.</li>
            <li> works very well  GREAT BUY</li>
            <li> Okay trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li> The build quality is very solid- to the point of impressive.  </li>
            <li> The shorter the hair, the better the job.  </li>
            <li> And I haven´t had to charge it yet, so that side is ok.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Works good, could be more powerful</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it tells you what length your going to cut at on the LED display.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and the battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li> Been using this item for many years and want to continue to</li>
            <li> All I can say is that the Wahl is now being gifted to someone.     </li>
            <li> Also, many reviewers before me seem to be selective readers.    </li>
            <li> It grows in many directions.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this yet, and once I have more information about it</li>
            <li> When mine breaks, I&#x27;ll buy another one. :-)</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that I use it to trim my beard ( I got with a 2 mm for sexy stubble)</li>
            <li> I think for the price, you wont find a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> This newer model is much better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on a beard yet because I keep my facial hair shorter these days, but it gives a perfect length of stubble on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two already and will buy more when X-mas rolls around.</li>
            <li> The larger display is very welcome.</li>
            <li> I actually do love it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re MUCH better off buying a pair of clippers like a barber uses.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it works when plugged in</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product!</li>
            <li> it was much better made.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I did buy this.  </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this shaver because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More cleaning work.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> (A feature I love.)  </li>
            <li> It is the most civil way to create that crafted stubble look without shaving in advance.</li>
            <li> With the guard on it was ok at trimming the rest of my beard.</li>
            <li> They mostly work</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line is this one works even better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grab this dam trimmer because ITS FROM Philips and its top of the range</li>
            <li> but most people do not have that option.</li>
            <li> I would rate this as the best on the market most definitely.</li>
            <li> I sure it&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and hit it on something.  </li>
            <li> My research showed this to be a top model.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I love Philips Sonicare oral care products.</li>
            <li> Great product and vacuums very well.  </li>
            <li> When I update, I&#x27;ll be sure and list the phone number to call</li>
            <li> It looks more like a head shaving E-razor than a face shaver.</li>
            <li> I plugged in the trimmer and was immediately able to use it with the AC adapter.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love that there is a hair collector chamber in this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than nothing though&lt;</li>
            <li> I read most of the differing reviews before making my choice.</li>
            <li> - sometimes the cheaper option is the better option.</li>
            <li> I love the travel lock feature so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get turned on and drain the battery during flight.</li>
            <li> I tried my best to get adjusted but have just called norelco to exercise the 45 day money back offer.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, the combs for the 4050 and the 4070 are _interchangeable_, and with a phone call to Philips, I was able to get them to provide the 4050&#x27;s comb--model number</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> But wait there&#x27;s more.</li>
            <li> Great quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Overall an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> In this case you might be better off with a non-vaccuum model.</li>
            <li> I havent been able to find replacement blades for this, but</li>
            <li> I started using this to keep a low stubble and its not the greatest for that.  </li>
            <li> I challenge you to find a better one, and let me know if you do find one.</li>
            <li> It does everything it says it will and better...</li>
            <li> But the battery, even on TURBO mode, is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I know many of you may not use it for that</li>
            <li> This trimmer has done the job many times over.</li>
            <li> QT4050 is much better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I tried using this alone and would spend 15 min or more before deciding &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34;, now I start with a Wahl corded trimmer to do 90% of the trimming then finish with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Okay...</li>
            <li> I used it once a week at most.  </li>
            <li> This thing is awesome if you want to keep a scruffy look, no matter what length you keep your facial hair at.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase though and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I travel quite a bit and find that if I&#x27;m out any more then 3-4 days that I need to bring the charger with.</li>
            <li> as I can&#x27;t tell for sure as the model # wore off.  </li>
            <li> and he was pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> So, after more research I decided to give the QT4070 a try.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best beard trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> The deficiency is mostly, in my view, at the level of accuracy and ease of</li>
            <li> better...</li>
            <li> On Turbo not too many hairs get away though.</li>
            <li> yes if you find my comment is helpful :)</li>
            <li> This newer version works very well for adjusting beard height, and the contour comb piece is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my 4th trimmer in almost as many years.</li>
            <li> It does work OK.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had better ones.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QT4070/41 Beard Trimmer 7300 is on the top end of their line of trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Great deal with fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that if I charge it longer I will get more that one trim when using it cordless.  </li>
            <li> Have never been so satisfied with a trimmer before.</li>
            <li> You are also able to take off the guard to be able to get even closer.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> well although it does require the charging cable to unlock so make sure you don&#x27;t forget it when you travel</li>
            <li> Thus I needed something I can have with me out in the field and be able to shave at a moments notice.</li>
            <li> I began shaving my head in 1996 and since then I have been using many many shavers to do so.</li>
            <li> What I realized is that not only it is great for taking it with me while traveling, I can (and do!)</li>
            <li> In addition, I love the feature that is has for locking the power button while traveling.</li>
            <li> and it does an okay job.</li>
            <li> :  -Lithium ion batteries are so much better.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pick up all the clippings but it picks up most.</li>
            <li> : Used to trim head and body where trimming the hair on my head is the most important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lowest setting is now much better for the stubble look, be it on your face or head.</li>
            <li> , it does a better job of what it was designed for - STUBBLE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased that the floating guide is NOW INCLUDED</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a month and it works better than the barber&#x27;s for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> and I am not in love with it.  </li>
            <li> They really honed the design this time, great upgrades.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and more that it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Mine came with both head attachments which I am glad about.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> This is one of the better trimmers I have bought, I just wished it was designed to trim the stache evenly.    </li>
            <li> I was considering getting a body trimmer and using that, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did not.      </li>
            <li> In sum: after more than a month using this trimmer every day, I have had no nicks, no breakouts, and no worries.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with its build and quality.</li>
            <li> I have to repeat motion many times, then touch up with scissors.</li>
            <li> So had this on my Christmas wishlist and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> With this comb you will not be able get the lower stubble settings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;  trims most of your face hair almost even&lt;</li>
            <li> Since deciding to stay with a close-trimmed beard three months ago, I thought an electric trimmer might help me keep it at desired length better than scissors.  </li>
            <li> After reading through many Amazon reviews, the Philips Norelco QT4070 appeared to be the one to get.  </li>
            <li> After a month or so of use, I not so sure.  </li>
            <li> I COULDENT ASK FOR A BETTER SHAVER</li>
            <li> It worked at speed until the end, then asked for more</li>
            <li> you purchase this trimmer to keep your close beard and stubble looking pop-album ready--you&#x27;ll be pleased with its performance, features, and especially the awesome battery life.</li>
            <li> Glad they have more business</li>
            <li> This is okay.</li>
            <li> However, the predecessor to the QT4070 is much better made.</li>
            <li> More length settings than you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> I have many complaints about this trimmer:     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d trim, move the trimmer to the side, trim some more, etc.</li>
            <li> It collects most but not all of the trimmings</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that more people have this.</li>
            <li> They work very well and do a great job of doing what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> it does an OK job.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I will use it and it is OK for what it is.</li>
            <li> The price point is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Upon trying it, I really like this unit and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Some engineer tried to safe money for the company but making that part cheep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t capture everything, but it works better.</li>
            <li> Awesome job, goes above and beyond to get the job done.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVE</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t need any elaborate setup with something on the floor or even a towel around your heck.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Then I tried the contour guard, and it is a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I got a much more even trim, and I think it helps do a better job of trapping the trimmings and getting them vacuumed up.  </li>
            <li> I have used a beard trimmer for better than 15 years and this trimmer is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> impression of this shaver is that the designers attempted to drastically lower the cost of materials, but compensated by making the product \\&quot;look\\&quot; better.</li>
            <li> catches probably 70%, which is better than 0%!&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that, it was affordable.</li>
            <li> The company surely knew that I would need one posting it to Australia.</li>
            <li> i bought this for myself, and am glad i did.</li>
            <li> Fast charging is also a great feature.</li>
            <li> Since the MB 70 doesnt seem to be availavle any more and the batteries gave out on mine</li>
            <li> this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life has been great, charges fast and</li>
            <li> It shaves ok.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is adjustable for cut length, which is my favorite feature of this product.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s to hoping the Peanut works out much better than this...</li>
            <li> It will collect most stubble in the built in container.</li>
            <li> Husband says works ok, but wish it would cut shorter.</li>
            <li> I was searching for years for the perfect stubble beard trimmer, and I&#x27;m glad I finally found this one.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Quite satisfied with the performance and suggest that everyone consider this type of trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, its awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Bought another for my son in law</li>
            <li> /&gt;I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using a version of this trimmer for many years.</li>
            <li> so buy it you will love it</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great for changing from stubble length to eyebrow length.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming eyebrows is very inaccurate with scissors and takes time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awesome not having a bunch of clip-on guards laying around for the different</li>
            <li> Potent motor, turbo function is a plus.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it&#x27;s light as a feather!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t suck up some of the hair coming off, but does grab most.</li>
            <li> /&gt;See my product update at the top of this review.smart.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, I can&#x27;t find anything better.  </li>
            <li> See my product update at the top of this review.</li>
            <li> If you have more body hair (chest, legs, etc)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it has the hair catcher though</li>
            <li> The 2 different guards work excellent.  </li>
            <li> He will love it.  </li>
            <li> Probably his favorite gift of the year.</li>
            <li> When I go to the barber he is able to give me a &amp;#34;shadow goatee&amp;#34; and I love the look.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> otherwise, i don&#x27;t really understand the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased with this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is great and charge is incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I have to use it 2-3 times over to produce an OK shave.</li>
            <li> and I have used many.</li>
            <li> would buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will grow to like this one even better as I get better with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beard/mustache trimming are excellent, and I like the contour following guide better than the one that comes on the unit itself.</li>
            <li> This product had better reviews, but shame on me for getting fooled twice.</li>
            <li> The trimmer seemed to be losing most of its charge without my using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It looks like others may have had better luck.</li>
            <li> sure keeps the stubble</li>
            <li> And I love it because it contains most of his shavings leaving me with a cleaner bathroom.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I love the vac feature as it does contain most of the hair.</li>
            <li> The length settings are locked in(opposed to a slide guard found on many) at the MM length and no worry about the length attachment accidentally sliding creating a bald landing strip on you check.  </li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, for those guys out there who cultivate that \\&quot;I don&#x27;t need to shave everyday\\&quot; look, this may be the thing for you.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this one is more robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad I got this for him.</li>
            <li> It also came with 2 types of &amp;#34;caps&amp;#34; for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li> It has so many features</li>
            <li> 5-stars for sure.</li>
            <li> I feel better about myself now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for my acne</li>
            <li> It works great, just keep in mind when going from a longer beard to much shorter your need to go in steps.</li>
            <li> I love it,  </li>
            <li> More hair fell out of this contraption then was caught in it.  </li>
            <li> Mostly, I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much more effcient trimm withouth the guide comb</li>
            <li> IN GREATER AMOUNTS THAN OTHERS</li>
            <li> tips and guidelines | 10 more words required...</li>
            <li> one more...</li>
            <li> The digital display for length and battery indicator are awesome.</li>
            <li> It has improved in being lighter weight, easier to hold and has a better grip.  </li>
            <li> I like this one even more since you can use it</li>
            <li> We are extremely satisfied with our purchase.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get a better trimmer buy the Norelco with the pivoting head/comb.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way better than before :)</li>
            <li> That said, I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not that much worth for this price but good to prefer becaz of  lot many options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> This one is much more efficient and easier to set.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer fit the bill nicely.  </li>
            <li> It replaced a Braun which had a much better build quality</li>
            <li> The trimmer that this one replaced was OK</li>
            <li> it does come in handy when he&#x27;s half-way to a beard and needs to &amp;#34;mow the lawn&amp;#34; before shaving it all off or before using another trimmer to get closer but not baby&#x27;s butt smooth.</li>
            <li> The different blades from the T980 (mustache trimmer head) fits perfectly on the QT4070.</li>
            <li> The clippers won&#x27;t give you a 000 length (against the skin), it&#x27;s more of a 1/16\\&quot;, maybe 1/8\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love the improvements in this model.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Four stars because overall it strikes the best balance between effectiveness and scratchiness.  </li>
            <li> Did an ok job while it worked.</li>
            <li> It is, in my mind, the perfect trimmer, but after many years of use it is starting to wear out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but figured this one warranted one (pun intended, as you&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Slimmer, stronger, better quality.</li>
            <li> and that was more accurate in both length and catching errant hairs.</li>
            <li> My last trim was at 7 mm and that was the best yet.</li>
            <li> But i think I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> always start from the lowest setting and be sure the display matches for each click (or you will wind up with a shorter cut than you planned for!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What more would one ask??</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a case that somebody forgot to put it in the box, but more like they don&#x27;t offer the contour comb with this product anymore.  </li>
            <li> I wish the attachment had finer combs to grab the hair better.</li>
            <li> but most of it get sucked.</li>
            <li> The Remington is okay as well, but I find it under-powered.</li>
            <li> This Norelco is MUCH better trimming my beard,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It sucked 85% or even more.</li>
            <li> - you are not carrying the carpet hover in your hands :)</li>
            <li> smooth, nice, and even :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nigh unusable, and leaves me with much more stubble than a millimeter, which the cheaper Qt4022 can do with ease.</li>
            <li> Sure, it has a lithium battery, but for 50 bucks?</li>
            <li> ; beard look. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 4070 is a much more polished product than the Scruff Sculptor and represents a much better value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome battery back up.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with my choice of this model.</li>
            <li> I have had this product before and it worked for many years and it broke.</li>
            <li> As many have already stated it doesn&#x27;t capture 100% of the hairs</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than a stick in the eye</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Then add a cheap pin hinge, and you&#x27;d be all set!</li>
            <li> This works OK</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to trim and fade my beard to give it</li>
            <li> I just writhe thinking about how many of these are going to end up in a landfill.</li>
            <li> sure not going to trade it in hope</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> but it does pickup most of the hair.</li>
            <li> It has more settings for the beard trimming and it does a better job capturing clippings.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for a while after receiving the package so wasn&#x27;t sure if I can return the item.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it is the battery life...</li>
            <li> The trimmer could be better on the neck</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> -i don&#x27;t understand why it makes difficulties for others :)</li>
            <li> but once it died I discovered a better</li>
            <li> Still love it tho!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally recommended, it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Really love the Trimmer.</li>
            <li> With many of these reviews, check the date they were posted.</li>
            <li> Only flaw ive found is that it isnt the best edger for around ears or around goatee</li>
            <li> The next best thing.</li>
            <li> but I have to imagine there is something else better out there</li>
            <li> My bathroom is no longer a mass of hair and I love</li>
            <li> I love that it adjusts</li>
            <li> and I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> Norelco is always releasing better and newer models, which makes your efforts</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something newer and better, BUY THIS</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something newer and better, BUY THIS RAZOR.</li>
            <li> If it takes me more than 90 seconds to get someone to say &#x27;the additional head on the way, thank you sir&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have had many eletrical/elecronic razors before this</li>
            <li> Has many calibrated levels and gives a smoth and even beard....</li>
            <li> Powerful, holds charge good, plenty of attachments to use with it.</li>
            <li> but i wanted something that would be able to work cordless/corded and something that would be able to trim and line my beard/ goatee</li>
            <li> I went with this based on reviews and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> most trimmers give you 20-30 mins of work for 10 hours of charging.</li>
            <li> Mine came with the \\&quot;sharper\\&quot; comb as well as the more \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; comb.</li>
            <li> The 0.5mm setting is what I wanted - this does many fancy things, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for a beard/mo mower.</li>
            <li> In actuality, hairs still go everywhere and while it does suck in a handsome amount, a lot still ends up on the floor</li>
            <li> Use whichever one works better for you.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> --if you follow this guideline you won&#x27;t find a better trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The battery still holds up well, and mostly all of the hair gets pulled in by the vaccuum (some will get away though).  </li>
            <li> an ok job of sucking up hair into the holder.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> a good job not cutting your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are bald, or want to be, those settings can be used on the top as well as on your chin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wisk out the head once every three days, and make sure blades are lubricated.</li>
            <li> I still find it easier to trim the top of my mustache with scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just promises a bit more than it can deliver.</li>
            <li> - Many length adjustments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have this norelco cause</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, although i cant really see a difference with the turbo mode, but still that is a plus.</li>
            <li> , he seems to love it also for the shaving part.  :-)  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After a bit of convincing, he said that I could opt for a refund.</li>
            <li> I do wonder how many people have had to settle for the QT4050 as a replacement, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I picked this up to replace an aging Norelco trimmer that had been dropped too many times.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely satisfied and would recommend it .</li>
            <li> Buy a cheaper model that does more.</li>
            <li> Can get a close shave if you take the top off.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of settings and lengths you can set from stubble to grooming a longer beard.</li>
            <li> I do like to use the Turbo setting to make sure.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for many uses.  </li>
            <li> it should do a better job of that because I still have to get my razor out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to admit though that the Philips gets a more even trim than the iStubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> Works mostly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Norelco should reissue the T980 or make a better replacement.</li>
            <li> I will say it is better than not having it</li>
            <li> Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It does what it should, love that it collects the hair</li>
            <li> and they have too many attachments to deal with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It sucked 85% or even more.</li>
            <li> - you are not carrying the carpet hover in your hands :)</li>
            <li> smooth, nice, and even :)</li>
            <li> but I figured I&#x27;d give it one more chance.  </li>
            <li> Ok im</li>
            <li> Trims without having to go over areas too many times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> get into the top part of mustache, though, because I have a nose.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> you do NOT have a nose, then there won&#x27;t be any problem getting to the top part of the mustache.</li>
            <li> This newer model has more adjustment&lt;</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> My favorite trimmer ever.  </li>
            <li> A better design would be like the Wahl Trim-n-Vac, which used a removable cup to capture trimmings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with the Norelco QT4070.  </li>
            <li> I have had one for about 10 years and love it, too.</li>
            <li> You will need to shave a couple times a week or more to maintain the desired length.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> i get a better look with my symple T shaped trimmer made by Andis.</li>
            <li> From what I have read it has begun to be shipped with the better comb in box.</li>
            <li> and I love the travel lock feature for when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like keeping the length of my facial hair to about 4-5 mm and this trimmer does that job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love the QT4070.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I love this trimmer, but it&#x27;s not without its flaws.</li>
            <li> I love the battery life and the fact that it is maintenance</li>
            <li> The unit costs more than some of the others, but what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> It has more settings for beard length</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer</li>
            <li> It does everything I wanted it to and more.  </li>
            <li> I do not use the turbo mode, which could catch more hair, I am not sure&lt;</li>
            <li> okay, you&#x27;ll still find hair in the sink.</li>
            <li> I have a Remington that I got from Amazon that works way better.</li>
            <li> Much more even shave.</li>
            <li> Norelco is stylish and holds a charge adequately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does an okay job.</li>
            <li> I personally use this machine for groin areas and it works perfectly, now you might ask why I use this for that</li>
            <li> previouse model was much better.</li>
            <li> I returned that trimmer because of some things I didn&#x27;t like about it and then bought this one; I like this one a lot more.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Razor better than advertised.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you could find a better trimmer at any price.</li>
            <li> So many features to like.</li>
            <li> i top notch.</li>
            <li> Most trimmers I&#x27;ve tried get around 20% of the hairs on each pass.  </li>
            <li> they require me to put more wording don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> But after reading about how much better the contour comb was, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gives me the most even shave I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer in hopes of cleaning up my bathroom more than my beard.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews discussing the type of clipper guard this came with, so I was pleased when I got mine</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t trim the top of your mustache!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> This one is a lot more fool-proof.  </li>
            <li> battery life is excellent and the noise is low.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was better.</li>
            <li> For many reasons I preferred the \\&quot;dead\\&quot; one it replaces.  </li>
            <li> Love the dialing in of the mm length.</li>
            <li> Like many I got this as a replacement to the T980 model which I had for years.</li>
            <li> I had this model and it felt like a better built unit in every aspect.  </li>
            <li> I trim my beard, maybe more.</li>
            <li> love the vacume suction function</li>
            <li> glad I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In all those years they can&#x27;t stay on top of their design, manufacturing and quality control systems?</li>
            <li> Bottom line I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d buy 6 more and use them for each day of the week</li>
            <li> The above was written in mid-March 2015 and the razor performed flawlessly for another 3 months.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper.</li>
            <li> i like better than before</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the clipper&#x27;s blades are worn</li>
            <li> so I was actually able to use the T980&#x27;s mustache trimmer on the QT4070 (the parts were interchangeable).</li>
            <li> Combs need some redesign so that they will do a better job of lifting hair and guiding it into the cutter.</li>
            <li> After studying many wildly-mixed reviews, I had some concerns with the newer razor.</li>
            <li> Most of my comparison will be to the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> most prominent difficulty with this trimmer is that it is quite imprecise for edging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> And I love it.</li>
            <li> Effective and precise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it now comes with the contour head</li>
            <li> The price is also up there, this probably the most I would spend on a trimmer</li>
            <li> in all, it works OK</li>
            <li> The locking function is wonderful, I can lock it and toss it in my luggage for international flights, and it never turns on unexpectedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> like being able to charge it in one hour out of the box, and being able to use it up to 50 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apart from this the trimmer is well made and the designed thought out with a stylish touch to it with the LCD which indicates the battery level and trimmer size setting once adjusted.</li>
            <li> I love the precision of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, I wish it had more power</li>
            <li> Does part of the job, but could work better...</li>
            <li> used for about one year and love it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has more minute legnths for trimming.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER...</li>
            <li> So just make sure you register it because you may be talking to customer service a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is much better than just dropping cut hairs everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought this one and it works so much better,</li>
            <li> Job well done&lt;br /&gt;Trimming is great and fast.</li>
            <li> It captures about 50% of the trimmings, which I guess is better than none</li>
            <li> I did break the latch for the hair storage area door, but have been able to keep using by holding it shut while in use.  </li>
            <li> it is a OK feature</li>
            <li> so I stopped and made sure that it was locked into place and everything seemed OK</li>
            <li> The charging cable doesn&#x27;t hold itself too strongly when connected, so it can very easily get disconnected when charging.</li>
            <li> This product looks great, works great, and the vacuum feature is a fantastic feature.</li>
            <li> It works great and the vacuum is good.</li>
            <li> Has both trimmer guards and a better vacuum collection system/filter, great product!</li>
            <li> As others have said the vacuum system isn&#x27;t perfect but better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the Vacuum Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum and whisker collector works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Despite the fault of the vacuum not being perfect, I would still recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> Vacuum is awesome.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is awesome.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is awesome.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a wonderful feature</li>
            <li> The vacuum system works as advertised which is awesome.</li>
            <li> This one has a vacuum to suck up the hair and keep it out of the sink, however, it does not work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> vacuum feature isn&#x27;t perfect and still leaves quite a bit of hair in/around the sink when trimming (That being said,</li>
            <li> The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect, but gets about 95% of the hair.  </li>
            <li> The built in vacuum is not the best</li>
            <li> the vacuum isn&#x27;t the best!  </li>
            <li> The T980 vacuum worked perfectly...</li>
            <li> The vacuum works but isn&#x27;t perfect.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum picks up between 80-90 percent of my weekly trims, which is impressive</li>
            <li> The vacuum is awesome as well.  </li>
            <li> Works as stated but vacuum not the best</li>
            <li> I bought this Phillips Vacuum trimmer after reading reviews online and determining which would suit me best.</li>
            <li> This lets me get the setting exactly right to keep a nice, even trim that blends in nicely.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product, works great and doesnt pull your hair when shaving like others razors.</li>
            <li> Length options are perfect and the vacuum on this trimmer makes for a nice clean trim.</li>
            <li> The turbo setting allows for a nice clean cut that looks better than my cheaper trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The device locking mechanism is unique and effective.</li>
            <li> It even looks cool and the quality build is top notch!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I originally got this because I had a nice beard going...</li>
            <li> nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The QT4070 has a strong motor, a more durable cover for the clippings catcher, and the digital display for battery and height is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a great product particularly if you&#x27;re looking for the stubble look.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much the best Beard Trimmer you can buy.</li>
            <li> excellent, exactly as described and works very well</li>
            <li> ok, first the good:  </li>
            <li> So happy to find the shaver that has replaced my older Norelco beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had an older model which I used for 10 years, and I&#x27;m happy with the upgrade.</li>
            <li> I feel the best way to really have a clean looking beard is to have a barber clean it up for you.</li>
            <li> but when you&#x27;re in your own bathroom, an additional 15% of 1000 hairs is a lot of stubble to go searching around your granite countertop to clean up.</li>
            <li> They have plenty of power, particularly with the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; and they cut through hair great</li>
            <li> though, this is a great trimmer, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great features and highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;View</li>
            <li> Great product, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The receiver loved it very much.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, and charge time is very fast.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with how nice and easy it is to use and how clean it keeps the sink with its vacuum ability.</li>
            <li> It operates smoothly and effectively collects cut hairs through a strong vacuuming feature.  </li>
            <li> Powerful, quick charge,works great</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use and charges very quickly.  </li>
            <li> These complaints are minor, though, and I still consider this to be one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All around, this is a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Would be pretty good for sideburns and goatees and the likes.  </li>
            <li> especially good for that stumble look</li>
            <li> Pretty good for keeping a close cropped afternoon shadow.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job otherwise, though.  </li>
            <li> This one is really pretty good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall good product and haven&#x27;t had any problems in the first month of owning it.</li>
            <li> (when you take off the guard) is pretty good for a stubble.</li>
            <li> but it does pretty good.</li>
            <li> I watched a good Youtube video review of this 4070 that recommended charging it overnight before you use it for the first time</li>
            <li> Works pretty good</li>
            <li> Works pretty good out of the box</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still cuts pretty good</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve had in a long time</li>
            <li> first of all i got to say that its a good beard trimming pruduct.</li>
            <li> But it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> The charge has lasted more than a week and the vacuum function is great, and keeps my bathroom tidy.</li>
            <li> With beards and stubble becoming popular again, after 30 some years of being clean shaven, I decided to give a beard a try</li>
            <li> With this main head i get a really awesome length of stubble which is exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The new model incorporates great updates that add to its utility.  </li>
            <li> The new one works great.  </li>
            <li> by far the best beard trimmer i have ever owned would buy this its well worth the money</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Not being able to easily trim neat sideburns defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased at how easy it is to keep my beard trimmed with this unit.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> Good, clean design, clean trim line for detail, charges easily and maintains charge&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> Most of the hairs found their way into the chamber and so were easy to dispose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to trim that area so easily.  </li>
            <li> But I can say that the length dial works, and the blades cut quick and clean, and the unit holds a battery charge fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked this specific one for its features, It works great with one exception.</li>
            <li> Best everyday trimmer that I own.</li>
            <li> More precise and better feel than the Conair.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean, and portable.</li>
            <li> Good one, easy to use, Vacuum is working good and most of hair got collected.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s very easy to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect but gets up most of the hair, making clean up easier.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a nice feature and greatly reduces cleanup.   </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature does, surprisingly, capture a good chunk of the hair.</li>
            <li> vacuum feature works great, and keeps things nice and neat.</li>
            <li> Well engineered, feels good in the hand, and most importantly, performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a gimmick of course, but it is mention as a feature and makes the device sound like &#x27;very precise&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I think this product works fine for most parts of your face.  </li>
            <li> (2) DO NOT TRY TO CLEAN UNDER RUNNING WATER!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured okay, that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> clean!  </li>
            <li> The blades stayed sharp and the battery life was excellent; but one too many times in the humid environ of my bathroom spelled the end for this</li>
            <li> Never a nick, no razor bumps, nice comfortable and clean shave.    </li>
            <li> This product is as good as always and even works better than the older model I replaced.</li>
            <li> It is very clean and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very good quality product and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> This looks like a very good product, and I&#x27;ll definitely keep it.</li>
            <li> The vacuum allows you to get a clean shave perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and the vacuum works great.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works  great and is very easy to use</li>
            <li> Also, the built in vacuum doesn&#x27;t do a very good job either, and I still have to trim over the restroom sink.</li>
            <li> mess,&amp;#34; it should be more accurately put as &amp;</li>
            <li> and I think the trimmer guide/gauge is probably is more accurately functional for shorter settings.</li>
            <li> * more precise trim  *</li>
            <li> This model doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as closely and the unit seems lighter and more cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Well, this was it and it is incredibly lightweight but sturdy enough!</li>
            <li> I find it much more comfortable not to shave too close</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head for nearly 18 years and this is one of the best, most reliable, and what I most appreciate, the low maintenance and ease of clean-up.  </li>
            <li> This is a GREAT trimmer and I am glad I didn&#x27;t take heed to the negative reviews from people who must have been trying to eat the damn blade, lol.</li>
            <li> and so far the trimmer works great as well.  </li>
            <li> I will gladly give mine to anyone for free.</li>
            <li> So far its working great</li>
            <li> The contour-following comb is the more comfortable comb to use; the &amp;#34;fixed comb&amp;#34; sometimes grabbed my beard while trimming.</li>
            <li> just make sure that your face is smooth.</li>
            <li> The battery life is fantastic, I think I charge it maybe once every 2 or 3 months at most.</li>
            <li> In the end, like most things, you have to compromise and decide what is important to you.</li>
            <li> The first worked great and although over time had lost its ability to hold a charge for as long as it used to, it still worked great.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been quite happy with this purchase thus far.</li>
            <li> Great length if you&#x27;re young and in college.</li>
            <li> The trim was even and the trimmer itself was much more comfortable to hold than the T980.  </li>
            <li> After a lot of shopping, reading and trying many of the trimmers available</li>
            <li> If Yours does not come with the More \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; comb, you can contact Norelco and they will send you one free of charge.</li>
            <li> While OK, I found it to be cheaply made based on the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> I am able to find a setting that keeps my beard well trimmed and at a level that I am comfortable with.</li>
            <li> i love the led light</li>
            <li> I got it, plugged it in, charged it for an hour, and proceded to get the most comfortable beard trim in my 30 years of wearing one.</li>
            <li> This is the most important feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak about the longevity or reliability of the product, but so far, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and it has great battery life which used to annoy me with my old cadmium powered shaver.</li>
            <li> Great job keeping those peaky whiskers in control.  </li>
            <li> I shave my beard very close to the skin and this shaver does a really good job.</li>
            <li> I should also mention, I&#x27;ve had a handful of instances where the battery just kind of &amp;#34;quits&amp;#34; when using the trimmer fresh off the charger.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good trimmer when trying to get close to the edge of your goatee</li>
            <li> This thing is powerful and effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this thing for weeks now, and it does a darn good job, and it does it fairly fast, too.  </li>
            <li> Good looking and works really well</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco products are well engineered and this one was very efficient and did a good job</li>
            <li> When not using the guards you cannot get a good straight edge because plastic covers the blades so you cannot see your lines.</li>
            <li> I use it everywhere, and this trimmer has been very versatile with a good battery life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeking alternatives, but I suppose no one wants to spend time making a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wish it was as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works really well with good consistency.  </li>
            <li> It works fast, feels good in my hand, and trims just as I want.  </li>
            <li> Had they included the correct comb and if the vacuum worked as good as their old model this would be the best trimmer on the market.  </li>
            <li> vacuum piece is cool and the design of the unit is awesome</li>
            <li> The vacuum capability works incredibly well, cleaning up is not a hassle.</li>
            <li> The vacuum  system was a brilliant idea to create.  </li>
            <li> It cuts great and the height adjustment is awesome, it actually seems to work better than any of the removable spacers on other clippers and has way more options for height.</li>
            <li> I consider this a non-issue though, since on its own this trimmer&#x27;s usefulness is extremely limited (nil in my case), meaning its battery life is at best only as good as that of the product it is functionally tethered to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (well - not entirely true, because it does let some hair fly), but all in all a great idea......until you end up with great big holes in your beard!    </li>
            <li> I owned previous breard trimmers from Norelco that were excellent and much more reliable.</li>
            <li> I love the readout showing the millimeter setting - makes it easy to read and reliably accurate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really easy to be used and so smooth, you will certainly love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been a loyal Norelco user and was glad to be able to replace the inadequate trimmer with one which measures up to the quality I expect from the company.</li>
            <li> clean and very smooth when done.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand how this trimmer has so many positive reviews...</li>
            <li> So nice to be able to offer a positive recommendation for a Norelco product.  </li>
            <li> Such a good product, works better than i thought it would!</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer, I was pesimistic at first as to how effective and well it would work, but wow this thing is great!  </li>
            <li> Such a great trimmer, I had a cheap one before and very happy I decided to spend some extra cash and get this trimmer which does not pull my hair at all, does not cut my skin and reduces the mass drastically with its vacum</li>
            <li> The removable contour comb is very comfortable, and the trim with the contour comb is as good as I was getting from my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> It cuts hair easily and effectively unlike some that make the right noises, but no noticeable difference to your beard.</li>
            <li> Perfect, precise, powerful, safe and the head is easy to remove and put back (no fighting involved)</li>
            <li> I currently own a Braun that I&#x27;ll probably keep using over this just because it does have the trimmer guides, but I certainly would have been satisfied with this</li>
            <li> Great trimmer well worth the price, would certainly buy again...</li>
            <li> sure to order the version that contains the contoured guide as well as the original guide.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slim design fits perfectly in the medicine cabinet and it holds a charge extremely well.</li>
            <li> Other than that i am very Happy with it.</li>
            <li> Also the trimmers work sharply for a perfect trim.</li>
            <li> The trim you get is nothing that you can&#x27;t get form other trimmers, but having the clippings vacuumed is priceless.  </li>
            <li> but it sounds cool when you hit the button!</li>
            <li> However, if anything I&#x27;ve mentioned makes this product connect in some way with your intended use, it might be worthwhile to pick up if significantly discounted.discounted.</li>
            <li> will love this rascal...buy it and smile!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have pointed out the contour head works best</li>
            <li> advantage, the vacuum feature is awesome, especially on high speed.  </li>
            <li> but I find it easy to use and sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model is more powerful and has better controls.</li>
            <li> But on the plus side, it charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> I do wish that the chamber for the cut hairs was removeable for easy dumping, but whatever.</li>
            <li> It also charged very quickly and never lost power in the 20 minutes I needed to trim up the beard.</li>
            <li> When done in the shower (water off), makes for ridiculously easy cleanup, bonus points if you can reach the can without getting out.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust and very quick</li>
            <li> the attachments, it cuts from 1/32 inch to 23/32 inch, making it easy to keep your beard trim, or to maintain that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to adjust with length measurements listed in both mm and increments of an inch as well as an LED number setting.  </li>
            <li> If that is so, then this is a best example of how engineers can screw up a great product into an useless on.    </li>
            <li> Let alone that the prongs on the comb bend easily...</li>
            <li> I have found the trimmer to be easy to handle</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li> After just a couple of months of very mild use, the latch on the trimmings collection chamber broke.  </li>
            <li> Easy to adjust size.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and use.</li>

            <li> The trimmer is easy to hold and control.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> The buzzer itself it great the only issue is the comb that attaches to the top.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, makes clean up a breeze, and resulted in a trim that brought many compliments from my friends.</li>
            <li> This one, however, has a hole in the guide which makes it incredibly easy to slip up on the angle you&#x27;re shaving at and cut your beard as if there&#x27;s no guide at all.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and achieve the desired length of your beard.</li>

            <li> Easy to handle and maneuver.  </li>
            <li> easy to adjust size</li>
            <li> This made it easy to trim hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li> The teeth bend too easily</li>
            <li> It also caught the trimmings in a screen which made shaving and trimming more convenient - nothing to clean up.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Braun could easily go 30+ uses before being needed to be plugged in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Length is easily selectable by twisting a knob.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer cuts evenly and the adjustments for length are easy to set.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so easy to out of there with the provided brush</li>
            <li> ehhh, trying to get a close shave with this &amp;#34;vacuum shaver&amp;#34; is not all that easy.</li>
            <li> He reports that is easy to use &amp; meets his expectations.  </li>
            <li> After investigation, I found that you can easily remove the cutter unit.  </li>
            <li> The rotary click dial makes it easy to set and read.  </li>
            <li> and you can easily dump the hair into the sink.</li>
            <li> It is not so easy to adjust the correct Hair size.</li>
            <li> one is a rubberized comb that bends easily and</li>
            <li> the hinge breaking easily makes me leave it at 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> it dies easily for some reason.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the trimmer was easy using the included cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Outside of having to judge better by looking at the length this is great.</li>
            <li> The trim length is easy to adjust with a dial and the length lights up.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a great product that comes exactly as described, and does exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Easy to change settings and</li>
            <li> I have never used a trimmer this easy and as efficient.</li>
            <li> either case, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> The plastic parts don&#x27;t move in/out easily.</li>

            <li> The LED is easy to read.</li>
            <li> easy conversation was told the replacement blade would be in the mail</li>
            <li> The teeth could not be made out of firmer plastic, or shaped so they will not flex so easily?</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easily switching trimming lengths</li>

            <li> This was so easy to use.  </li>

            <li> trims easily and evenly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my beard and hair all one length so it gets a workout every week, and has been going strong for a month or two now, I think.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a nice box so would look good for a present.</li>
            <li> the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another product from Phillips Norelco and would strongly recommend that no one else does, until they fix their customer service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to replace my older trimmer with this one.</li>
            <li> I thought the older model was good.  </li>
            <li> Overall a nice product and good value.</li>
            <li> Bought this thing 3 years ago and still running strong.</li>
            <li> do not have a strong beard so for me, I remove the comb and use the machine on the lowest setting which is 0.5mm for an even stubble and buying this machine was all about the vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I strongly advise you to not to buy this and save your money.</li>
            <li> The motor is strong, with no noticeable decline in power when on battery alone.</li>
            <li> thing has a lot of good reviews, I just wonder if anyone giving it 5 stars has ever used the older model.  </li>
            <li> It all plastic doesn&#x27;t look strong.</li>
            <li> Initially i loved it as it replaced my aged trimmer which was not doing a good job.</li>
            <li> Perfect, reliable and very handy for beard or stash norelco products have always been good product for me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> The vacuum works great and gets most of the trimming.</li>
            <li> Vacuum feature is great but didn&#x27;t see any use of turbo mode except more noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum function isn&#x27;t that great, but it comes with two shaver heads, once that pivots, and one that gives you more control.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, love the accuracy of the guide and do feel that the vacuum is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> Great battery life and love the vacuum system.</li>
            <li> this model does a nice job in collecting hair with its vacuum system and also does good job trimming beard</li>
            <li> I do wish the vacuum was a bit stronger but honestly, I have nothing to compare it to and it DOES catch a good portion of the hair.</li>
            <li> and I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this purchase if you need a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> a Norelco get a Norelco&amp;#34; so I ordered this one and there isn&#x27;t anything special about it, yea it catch most of your beard hair in the suction trap</li>
            <li> it does not vacuum all of the beard remaining but only 75%-80%, still the trimmer is very good quality and great value for the price</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s a whole lot better than no vacuum.  </li>
            <li> i bought tht month ago, and im very satisfied with its abilities, its not 100% vacum the cut hair, but its very convient for everything else,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very safe for body grooming, so this really does it all.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for general hair/beard trimming.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the many features provided by this efficient and easy to use and clean beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first stubble and beard trimmer to obtain that stylist, stubble look that is popular now for us men.</li>
            <li> bought the pro, the trimmer works pretty nicely</li>
            <li> It is ideal for traveling since it runs for a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> far I am loving it!</li>
            <li> Beard never looked better and this thing will hold a charge for a month with full beard trimmings every 3 days.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good beard trimmer , the blades are sharp yet surprisingly don&#x27;t cut the skin .</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer, love the vacuum system in it.</li>
            <li> First, as many reviewers have pointed out, the door holding the beard trimmings is very cheaply constructed.  </li>
            <li> Pros: it looks and feels great - and I enjoy the vacuum since it catches most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature didn&#x27;t work great, but sufficed and the rest of the features were so good that it didn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> Just set the length (I use 6-8mm) and run the trimmer down you beard  or mustache and it trims it to that length perfectly.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is hand&#x27;s down the best beard grooming tool.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if it cut the hair down all of the way.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I could put it on 4mm, and still shave down to the skin if I don&#x27;t keep it at a perfect angle.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It was certainly an oversight on Norelco&#x27;s part, and they should certainly be happy and willing to ship out the replacement comb for customers who ask for it.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is why this was purchased --- and it performs beautifully.</li>
            <li> Having tried many (+10) electric beard trimmers in the past, including this model&#x27;s predecessor, I can easily say that this is the best trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, I&#x27;d bet that no other beard trimmer can do any better.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very good looking, comfortable to hold and holds a charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li> and when I was looking to buy a new trimmer I figured it was a good choice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use and accurate</li>
            <li> I tried the 3mm setting with plastic guide against my skin and it felt fine.  </li>
            <li> But, the trimmer shuts off if you try to use this fine trim head in Turbo mode.</li>
            <li> But, it works fine without being put into Turbo Mode.    </li>
            <li> Norelco should provide that fine trim head.</li>
            <li> Just what ti was looking for use it to shave over A month and still half power on the battery best i have had</li>
            <li> This trimmer works just fine for my needs.</li>
            <li> it does the job fine because it does say &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still working fine</li>
            <li> this trimmer may work out fine.  </li>
            <li> so if you slightly tilt the machine while shaving, and NOT hold the machine perfectly at an 45 degree angle, it will eat a piece of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He says it doesn&#x27;t do fine lines.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is the first trimmer that I&#x27;ve actually been happy with!</li>
            <li> At best it get half of the shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Drilled holes for two self-tapping screws which works fine, but</li>
            <li> light and easy to use</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QT 4070/41 Beard Trimmer 7300 does a fine job trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has a beard and it works fine</li>
            <li> Mustache/beard trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past have always been excellent multi-taskers, allowing me to trim much more than the name</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, handles easily, and retains it&#x27;s charge well.</li>
            <li> This is the first real, quality trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had (after a series of not so great trimmers).</li>
            <li> and it is working fine.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works just fine.</li>
            <li> it works just fine...</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even interested in such feature, but using it I have to say that I am impressed...</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine.  </li>
            <li> so it would be easy to cut yourself though fortunately it hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet.</li>
            <li> It has worked fine so for me.</li>
            <li> My previous Norelco trimmer worked perfectly for 13 years.</li>
            <li> This is a fine beard trimmer</li>
            <li> I had it for a month and a half now, and are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Fine battery life for cordless use.</li>
            <li> This replacement for a previous Norelco, does an excellent job of removing all the stubble from my scalp and trims my beard with  consistency.</li>
            <li> trimmer works fine</li>
            <li> WORKS FINE AND INEXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET</li>
            <li> My previous Norelco trimmer worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery works fine.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure depending on creativity and practice, I can create better and cooler cuts which my barber can never do because he&#x27;s not me.</li>
            <li> It would work perfectly for about 2 or 3 trims (5 minutes or less each time).  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even interested in such feature, but using it I have to say that I am impressed...</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> That said, it also cut way better and more consistently.</li>
            <li> I was using although it doesn&#x27;t trim as fine as the Wahl</li>
            <li> It works fine, but you can&#x27;t use it while you walk around your house, for ex, because a part of the hairs will fall on the floor.</li>
            <li> it works fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one star is for the trimming capability which was fine until the battery died.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises and mows your face just fine.  </li>
            <li> * Easy and precise adjustment&lt;</li>
            <li> Not only powerful but clean up is perfect!!  </li>
            <li> works great, has compartment that catches 95% of shaved hairs (beard, moustache) and easy to clean the compartment, many different shave levels, 2 speeds, comfortable shave</li>
            <li> However, as I said before, the T980&#x27;s trimmer works just fine on the QT and, of course, the QT fits in the T980&#x27;s case.</li>
            <li> Trimmer cuts fine</li>
            <li> Works fine, but I&#x27;ve had problems:</li>
            <li> My advice: QUICK!</li>
            <li> The trimmer feels powerful with decent speeds, looks elegant and the closeness settings are good.</li>
            <li> I love this beard trimmer - cordless, charges quickly, and even has an electronic lock for traveling</li>
            <li> He really likes it, one of the better trimmers that he&#x27;s tried!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect, but my sink is not full of trimmings when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers he has ever had and it gets the job done in no time plus gets rid of the mess.</li>
            <li> He likes it just as good as his old one!</li>
            <li> It seemed like a lot of R&amp;D went into making this product innovative and easy to use, but what&#x27;s all of that worth if it&#x27;s just going to stop working so soon?  </li>
            <li> I have had quite a few beard trimmers and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li> The device is simple, easy to use and does an great job.</li>
            <li> They used to come with an added attachment to trim tight spaces and it was perfect for trimming my mustache and chin.  </li>
            <li> Great vacuum works as advertised but cannot use easily to cut around ears or trim sideburns</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess free trimmer with best results.</li>
            <li> The fine adjustments fit whatever length you want.  </li>
            <li> I am still perplexed why Norelco &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; a perfectly fine product and made it into a piece of junk?</li>
            <li> Works fine for about 6 months, then the blades need replaced, but there are none available.  </li>
            <li> Wish they did not use so much cheap plastic on this unit, otherwise it would be just fine for me.</li>
            <li> If you are doing this, put your trimmers (and certainly any razor you might own) away and lock them</li>
            <li> my biggest grip with it is the fact that the integrated guard keeps me from being able to get right up under my nose easily.</li>
            <li> I had to make sure he charged it correctly the first time to prevent any battery damage, but other than that it was a flawless purchase</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer which certainly met my expectations, and the vacuum works well also!  </li>
            <li> It trims smoothly and evenly and is easy to clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Replaced this with a Remington after the battery gave out; this is a huge improvement in:    </li>
            <li> I had an old Philips Norelco beard trimmer and it was perfect, being 8 years old, it was time to let it rest.</li>
            <li> The guard isnt accurate at all.</li>
            <li> CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP.</li>
            <li> It should come with a \\&quot;contour\\&quot; comb that doesn&#x27;t have a huge gap in it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t flow smoothly across my chin without stumbling but again overall its great.</li>
            <li> As I travel, this is a huge inconvenience for me.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it three stars is because of a huge problem I have with this product.</li>
            <li> It is a huge pain in the</li>
            <li> I had huge expectations for this product because of the reviews, but after 2 months of use</li>
            <li> This is a huge problem.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was accurate</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a huge upgrade from one without it.</li>
            <li> Its by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li> Philips description of everything this trimmer does was 100% accurate.</li>
            <li> For those purposes, this was a huge advance over the 10yr/old model I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> The great thing about Amazon is that they&#x27;re taking it back for free.</li>
            <li> It is quite, accurate  and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Second worked great and still does.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s much more powerful</li>
            <li> and now the part shows that it will be available October 6th.  </li>
            <li> They can place a back-order for $15, but if I want to free part</li>
            <li> The quality of trimming though is reasonable and effective.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s an easy clean up.</li>
            <li> For some bizarre reason the setting between 3/8 inch and 5/8 inch is \\&quot;15/32\\&quot;, not 4/8, and the longest depth is 23/32, not 6/8.</li>
            <li> I found the shaver to be quite easy to clean, using the included cleaning brush</li>
            <li> A smooth precise trim.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is perfect for everyday trimming.</li>
            <li> I primarily use this for trimming my head - bald head...</li>
            <li> I use that trim head on the QT4070 also, because it does fit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do any hairline or detailed trimming/edging, but I suspect I could not get the John Water&#x27;s stache&#x27; with this device.</li>
            <li> My one gripe with this, and it&#x27;s the same my friend has experienced, if you travel with it, even if you lock it</li>
            <li> It was a no hassle phone call and within a couple of minutes I received an email order form and will be receiving it in 7 to 10  business days all free of charge.  </li>
            <li> He says it trims well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Not too light to use though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> digital display is great.</li>
            <li> Feels light and plastic.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> With the T980 no longer available, it appeared that my options were either the QT4050 or the QT4070.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ll send it to you, free of charge.</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse, unruly beard that grows in all directions and this trimmer does a great job contouring my beard using the attached guide.</li>
            <li> Built-in adjustable guard instead of having to change to different guard heights is a great feature.</li>
            <li> im guessing they are available.  </li>
            <li> broke off (cheap).  </li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> , vac works as designed and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic to keep my beard looking</li>
            <li> Overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that there is a table in the instructions that give you the length in inches for each available setting of 1 to 18,  </li>
            <li> I received this product free of charge via the vine</li>
            <li> Does a great trimming job and has various lengths.  </li>
            <li> -It gives a great trim (WITH the NON-included contour following comb).  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, clean \\&quot;interface\\&quot; and leaves an even stubble.</li>
            <li> This does a great job and is sleek and smaller than the one he had.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is also quite comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Obviously, that was something I was happy to see</li>
            <li> man up can just call Philipls and have them send it to you for FREE.  </li>
            <li> Also in order to have an even and smooth cut, you must go over atleast twice</li>
            <li> Great trimmer overall.  </li>
            <li> Lower-cost models like the QT4050 have the better comb (per Amazon description), with a slower charger, but would be worth the savings.</li>
            <li> Only flaw in an otherwise great design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for a few months now and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> However, after fully charging a second time the battery life was great.  </li>
            <li> I found it easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to take apart and clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;very light in weight.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to clean, charge and store.</li>
            <li> Easy clean up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he said it works great for trimming his beard which he keeps very short.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a non-impressive re-design of a product that was previously fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a non-impressive re-design of a product that was previously fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and works like the description.</li>
            <li> Fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is really important.  </li>
            <li> This is a solid trimmer with great battery.  </li>
            <li> I have to rake this over my face over and over to get all the hair which it just won&#x27;t do, always have to finish with a cheap $20 Remington.  </li>
            <li> This is a great item for facial trimming.  </li>
            <li> This product is great and adjustments are as simple as pushing a button.</li>
            <li> The digital depth indicator is great as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light weight design, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely beyond happy with my decision of going forward with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Plastic feels cheap... turbo mode does</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the look that</li>
            <li> Its light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Light weight but</li>
            <li> Also nice is the LED readout indicating how much battery life remains, though the battery does recharge rapidly in the event that it does die.  </li>
            <li> One of these cheap pieces of plastic broke off and now the door won&#x27;t close...</li>
            <li> I like the dial-up trimmer guard and the razor is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Overall a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the battery indicator light, which lets me know when the battery is draining away.</li>
            <li> It is actually more like one day&#x27;s worth of hair not 5 o&#x27;clock shadow</li>
            <li> The overall mechanism works great</li>
            <li> I can not say enough great things about this.</li>
            <li> Great for the stubble look or for maintaining a short beard.</li>
            <li> Mine broke after 4months of light use.</li>
            <li> Been using it for several months now and it works great.</li>
            <li> They offered to ship this comb free of charge.  </li>
            <li> They sent me a pouch free of charge.  </li>
            <li> It trims my goatee very evenly and cleans up nice.</li>
            <li> If the sound is an indication I could trim my hedge with it.</li>
            <li> my getting used to the light motion required to cut evenly</li>
            <li> My beard is light colored</li>
            <li> but the short warranty period isn&#x27;t too great.</li>
            <li> Just an overall great product.  </li>
            <li> The great part about Phillips, is that they offer a 45 day money back guarantee on their products.  </li>
            <li> Works great for overall shortening to achieve stubble and blending sideburns.</li>
            <li> trimming settings that I think are fabulous, you can choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...,</li>
            <li> Well just before Christmas this pass year the light in my head came on and that&#x27;s when I found it with u guys.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great shave.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, and it was more than I wanted to spend, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Ordered for the precision trimming levels and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> While not an important consideration for me</li>
            <li> So, the battery and cheap door hinge are my hangups.</li>
            <li> On that note I did test that the cutter head from this unit does in fact fit and work in my T980.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> it actually makes a great line to frame my face.  </li>
            <li> The cut on the QT4070 is so smooth.</li>
            <li> For what your getting with this product, the price is completely justified.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap..</li>
            <li> I really liked the product and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> The guy I spoke with said it wouldn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> Cuts well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy Clean Up</li>
            <li> He uses it regularly and says it does a great job.</li>
            <li> It works great with my mid length and shorter length beards.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind plugging it in constantly its great, but don&#x27;t leave home without the charger.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t clean the blade easily after use.</li>
            <li> I bought mine and it stopped charging after 3 months of light use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic I believe.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this razor and has been working well for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s replaced for free.</li>
            <li> Worked great initially.</li>
            <li> Also had a cheap plastic feel to it...</li>
            <li> lines that I got from this is precise.  </li>
            <li> rarely leaving any shavings on the counter top.</li>
            <li> Multiple settings and interchangeable heads along with a hair reservoir makes it a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> it gave me the feeling that it was a cheap product.</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> trimming settings that I think are fabulous, you can choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and keeps the cut hair off your neck and shirt.</li>
            <li> and you definitely enjoy with this.</li>
            <li> available and they lock into position.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the improvements.</li>
            <li> And Norelco really should provide the 15 Cent moustache comb its own instructions</li>
            <li> and I press the trimmer to my face until I stop hearing the screeching sound of hair being cut.</li>
            <li> A tad on the cheap plastic-ee side</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very portable and fits quite nicely with the rest of my stuff when I am traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that the trim is comfortable</li>
            <li> , this is great to avoid slippage and surprisingly not standard with all trimmers.</li>
            <li> If you maintain a beard or stubble, you need to trim it everyday and the norelco is the perfect tool for the job.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable and adjustable.</li>
            <li> I lightly rinsed it anyways, and it survived.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to clean with the included brush.</li>
            <li> I primarily use the QT4070 to maintain a 1 mm &amp;#34;designer stubble&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several beard trimmers, but none that have done as great of a job.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I am getting the results that I was looking for with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> it came with an attachment that &#x27;catches&#x27; the beard hairs while he is trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Better price on amazon than in the stores-- and the convenience of shopping online with free shipping</li>
            <li> makes me smile... :)</li>
            <li> said this should not happened and immediately agreed to send a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li> Shaving still preforms great for shaving, but there&#x27;s obviously a wiring/charging issue with this unit.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t fit anywhere</li>
            <li> I got it last week and up to now works great.</li>
            <li> I think I could use a rubber band to secure the hatch, if the latch breaks.</li>
            <li> I finally tried this one and it&#x27;s been great for over 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Buyers beware that the door latch is a bit cheap</li>
            <li> The cheap construction has not made an impact, but it will.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I haven&#x27;t had this Trimmer but just for a short period of time, and it works very well and great for me!!!  </li>
            <li> I think it would be a good product for someone with longer beard hair but for me it is completely unusable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the QT4070 twice now, but I&#x27;m already ready to dub it the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than a regular trimmer in this regard, but not quite as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> not that good, the Last philips I bought was better and cheaper too,&lt;br /&gt;next</li>
            <li> I can say without a doubt that the 4070 is far superior to anything I have used before.  </li>
            <li> Especially trimming without the guides on the neck or anywhere you want a clean spot, it does an exceptional job!</li>
            <li> The trimmer guide for the beard isn&#x27;t as good as my old trimmer, though.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic was great while it lasted (not quite as good as this one), but the battery not being able to hold a decent charge after less than a year is unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it get&#x27;s them all but having 80-90% less hair to clean out of the bathroom sink is a great thing!</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good upgrade from my old unit.  </li>
            <li> I rated it as a good trimmer, but it takes quite a few passes and patience to get a good trim.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, still charging it up</li>
            <li> and I expect it to be as good as my old 4021</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s actually good news because I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement cutter head in quite some time as all were back ordered.</li>
            <li> The QT4070 is far superior in almost every way.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It is preforming as good as my old Phillips Norelco bread trimmer.</li>
            <li> So far so good after a month.  </li>
            <li> I loved the old Norelco</li>
            <li> Far superior device, so I say go for that one and skip the Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/14/14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cut is as good as my wahl corded monster of a trimmer, which really surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good replacement for my old Norelco</li>
            <li> Vacuum function is lacking for sure and would be nice if it had an attached pop up mini trimmer to get more precisely around the mouth and ears.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge really well, vacuum works wonderfully and the different size options are great as well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works OK, the suction  is good.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum system is a nice bell and whistle, but it isn&#x27;t 100% effective.</li>
            <li> The vacuum does a good job of collecting most of the trimmings and</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair, but it does a really good job of getting most of it.</li>
            <li> Works great but vacuum get in the way when trying to line and trim mustache</li>
            <li> The vacuum collects about 90% of my beard trimmings (makes my wife happy because they no longer clog the sink).  </li>
            <li> vacuum feature is great; captures and stores 90% of the shavings  *</li>
            <li> I discounted the vacuum feature but the price for this model was attractive</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised and the vacuum feature is great.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works great and gets about 90% of hairs.</li>
            <li> This is great because of the vacuum.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works great.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works great, cuts well at length.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works great</li>
            <li> The vacuum seems to work great.</li>
            <li> The vacuum mechanism is great and catches about 70~75% of the hair.</li>
            <li> Vacuum function works great when the turbo mode is on</li>
            <li> The vacuum works great.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is great.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum is great.</li>
            <li> He said the vacuum feature isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> yhe vacuum works great.</li>
            <li> Vacuum function is kinda bs but shaver works great</li>
            <li> It has the vacuum option so the trimmings don&#x27;t fly.</li>
            <li> The hair vacuum works great.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is great.</li>
            <li> the vacuum is great.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum works great</li>
            <li> Vacuum works great.</li>
            <li> the vacuum thing on it doesn&#x27;t work all that great but cuts</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works great.  </li>
            <li> works great, the vacuum system is a must have.</li>
            <li> It seems like a novel and great idea; the vacuum suction picking up your stubble, a rotating gear to adjust height, a display that shows battery life (what?!).  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, battery lasts a long time - great for travelling.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very pleased with this new model.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this new one.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Other than that very good device.  </li>
            <li> I was fine with out it and while it does keep the sink clean -</li>
            <li> I cannot use the product to mark up or line up or whatever the term is, my mustache and beard in a fine line to clean things up.</li>
            <li> I still use a razor to shape my beard and neckline which I am fined with because I never use electrics for full shaves but this is an easy way to keep it trimmed evenly</li>
            <li> It works ok for the 5 O&#x27;clock shadow, but other than that, its not that great.  </li>
            <li> Really, I highly-recommend it for the product and price!!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks again, Amazon &amp; Philips-Norelco!!!</li>
            <li> absolutely works as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks PHILLIPS and AMAZON !!!</li>
            <li> Very unfriendly in use!!!</li>
            <li> very nice product and low price</li>
            <li> Very powerful motor.</li>
            <li> I use this for a short stubble trim all the way up to side-burn cleanup, so the range is very nice.  </li>
            <li> It trims to 1 mm and is very powerful when fully charged.</li>
            <li> Very worth your purchase.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> I am new to trimmers and found this one easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> I waited to get this on special and finally got it at a great price with free shipping.</li>
            <li> pleased with the results, and it does a better job than my older trimmer.</li>
            <li> The older style norelco accuvac had a much better method for retaining trimmings via a removable basket and vacuumed up more of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect (it probably gets about 75% of the hair), but for the most part I had no other problems.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is incredible compared to other trimmers that I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> It is pretty quiet and the battery life is very good as well.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum catches a lot of the clippings, but you will want to clean the sink after trimming to keep your fellow sink users happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say in comparison to the older Norelco vacuum beard trimmers this is the best.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum on the unit works pretty good, and the led screen is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> It has nice features but the vacuum isn&#x27;t very strong so you&#x27;ll still make a mess&lt;</li>
            <li> This new model has a better design, is more comfortable, comes with two heads to guide the trimming process.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent Trimmer, Photos are same as the original, made of high quality material from china</li>
            <li> A clean accurate cut</li>
            <li> I got this because four years ago I bought the older version, and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and clean design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Working for me very well so far, holds a charge great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The unit charges easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, while this beard trimmer has some challenges, if you are a traveler who wants a shaver that doesn&#x27;t have multiple parts to carry, this one is adequate, and while it has some annoyances it is the best option I could find.</li>
            <li> My mind was made up after I read the 4 and 5 star reviews that pretty much confirmed that if you \\&quot;know how to glide over your face instead of dragging and digging it into your skin you will love this product\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> Within a week, you&#x27;ll be able to fully enjoy what Philips should have built in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I have owned and liked older Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li> I get a quick and easy trim of my beard.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty good about this for 8-9 recharges and the unit worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Pro: charges fast and vacuums pretty good.</li>
            <li> Despite usually spending a lot of time on it at 18mm, I still need to go in sometimes and trim my face hedge with a Wahl, as it&#x27;s not always perfectly even (despite me shaving precisely how instructed).</li>
            <li> The variable trim lengths are super easy to adjust and to read.  </li>
            <li> I even shaved the whole head with it once just for curiosity and the result were pretty good.</li>
            <li> It gives a quick and easy trim and seems to have plenty of power and battery life.  </li>
            <li> Exelent beard trimmer not recomended for shaving anything longer will clog up and hurt you, very nice for keeping clean facial hair has my Recomendation.</li>
            <li> The plastic door is very flimsy and breaks VERY easily.  </li>
            <li> down side is that it is not as good at catching all the cuts hairs as perhaps I would like.  </li>
            <li> This works fairly well, but has a major design flaw: the guard to adjust length isn&#x27;t continuous, so the blade (at any guard length) can trim significantly shorter than you intended.  </li>
            <li> but if you own the t980 both the heads fit on it and work so will just ues that for mine new .</li>
            <li> The battery life is great and the vacuum is awesome, no more sink full of clippings.  </li>
            <li> Good led indicator for charge too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it would be better if the blade protruded out a little more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and trim the stubble nice and soft with no pain.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and quick to charge.  </li>
            <li> good quality, easy to use, charge holds for a week or so, overall acceptable qualtiy.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean out, I use a fingernail brush, and just takes a quick swipe.</li>
            <li> The vacuum built in is handy in keeping MOST of the fine stubble from getting on the counter.  </li>
            <li> As a satisfied owner of a Norelco T980, I was pretty interested in the idea of a replacement trimmer that was quieter, lighter, offered better battery life, and wouldn&#x27;t have any battery memory issues (the T980 used Ni-Cad batteries).</li>
            <li> Great battery life, long cord, cuts well.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this so far.</li>
            <li> While it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted, there didn&#x27;t seem to be a better option</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for three months with my original charge.</li>
            <li> The digital screen showing the setting and more importantly the battery level is also nice.  </li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and after using the Remington Titanium (POS) for the past 10 years let me just say this trimmer is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Original revieew March 2014:   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep this, but I wanted to let others know that if you don&#x27;t need fast-charging, get the lower model, and more importantly, in terms of comfort, the contour-following comb is better than the fixed comb.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not, I&#x27;m sure, the best trimmer in the world I do have plenty of experience, and do know what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Setting is locked, so no depressing the comb with the application of pressure, so it&#x27;s the safest one yet!</li>
            <li> after using it for the first time I fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the Philips Norelco QT4070 so far.</li>
            <li> Twice now,  Not sure what&#x27;s the deal is with this, but it is inconsistent garbage for anything but perfect stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did my first trim at 12 mm and it was the one with the most missed hairs - and a lot of post-trim scissor work.</li>
            <li> I think Philips realized that everyone wanted the original trim guard, so they just started including both.</li>
            <li> The first lasted for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Yes, the 4070 now comes with the spring-loaded contour comb familiar to T980 owners; no calls to Philips customer service needed!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I am very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> First, the 0.5mm closest shave is not what I experience -- more like 1.5 to 2 mm on my stubble.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Some background why that is significant.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time and I&#x27;m pleased so,far.</li>
            <li> Have the original version of this item-can&#x27;t find the cord so I have to buy</li>
            <li> This feature SIGNIFICANTLY increases the ease of cleanup, which is this product&#x27;s saving</li>
            <li> It works ok, but doesn&#x27;t do exactly what I was expecting it</li>
            <li> Very glad I had saved the old case.</li>
            <li> it keeps the hair off my counter and he likes that it actually trims his beard successfully.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of trimming and the built in vacuum is easy to dump.</li>
            <li> Check first to make sure the rechargeable battery can be replaced.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure he likes it-- ESP.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend with a short beard and it is really nice!</li>
            <li> This trimmer delivers famously on the first one.  </li>
            <li> The QT4070 blade cuts very smoothly and evenly, much better than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I have had a beard/mustache for many years using lots of different trimmers but the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 7300, vacuum is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Love love love the vacuum design.</li>
            <li> this is brilliant piece of kit if you cant be  botherd to shave just take it down to a five oclock shadow brill.</li>
            <li> In summary, this is fine and it appears the battery will last longer, but having used both, I would prefer my Remington with a good battery.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is fast, easy to use, easy to clean, handles trimmings well, and does a great job maintaining different beard lengths.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s not so good on fine facial features, setting length, and portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great to clean up my beard when I let it get too long.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, trims beautifully, and is endless adjustable and sucks up the trimmings perfectly.  </li>
            <li> hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally looking at norelco&#x27;s shaver line, but those are for clean shaves.</li>
            <li> he says the battery has a very long life, and the trimmer does a great job of trimming.  </li>
            <li> This means I cannot use the trimmer to clean up around my neck.    </li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s beard and stubble trimmer is clean.</li>
            <li> You will still have to clean out your sink afterward.   </li>
            <li> you have to clean up around the sink.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve got a clean trimmer and a clean sink.</li>
            <li> Gives a clean stubble length shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy that I decided to spend a few more bucks for the added features of this model.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve been using it so much that the battery wore out, and (no doubt thanks to your dashing good looks)</li>
            <li> but it keep the bathroom clean.</li>
            <li> This is the third beard trimmer I have owned and, by far, it is the best.</li>
            <li> And the door is better than the previous tray, which broke on me and required fixing with super glue, as another reviewer also experienced.</li>
            <li> You will have to spend your time to clean your sink nevertheless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bit better than the old one and the QT4070&#x27;s noisier turbo mode, yet more so.  </li>
            <li> Then I lather up and clean up basically.</li>
            <li> job at reducing clean up.  </li>
            <li> I end up having to use scissors to try and clean up the areas this trimmer cannot handle.     </li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to have a clean shave though.</li>
            <li> But you still need to clean op your sink.</li>
            <li> but then there is the clean up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t capture all of the hair, but it captures alot of it and makes clean up easier.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still have to clean up the sink and counter afterward.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: 1/7/14, the door to clean out hair does not close.</li>
            <li> I had to clean the bathroom as hair was all over and returned the trimmer immediately.</li>
            <li> I would rather have a couple hairs to clean up then hundreds.</li>
            <li> but this device encourages me to keep a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to clean up at all.</li>
            <li> I like a clean line &#x27;tween my goatee and the rest, so it&#x27;s not my bag.</li>
            <li> look without having to be clean shaven all of the time.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who does not like a clean shave.</li>
            <li> This would get my 5 star if it were a bit easyier to clean out.  </li>
            <li> I took out the guide comb and tried to get a clean line for the mustache and the trimmer couldn&#x27;t cut any hair.</li>
            <li> but so far I am more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times and directions I go over my beard - there are far too many un-cut hairs.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use water to clean</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t do that just use the brush provided with it to clean it.</li>
            <li> It did reduce the clippings in the sink and sped up clean-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its either this or manually clean up my sink which is 10 times worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean up now takes 2 min tops compared to 5-10 mins.</li>
            <li> The readout got stuck when I dissasembled the razor to clean the hair out</li>
            <li> Keeps the sink clean and</li>
            <li> From a design standpoint, I don&#x27;t understand why this gap exist because the hair will stick around if you don&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li> The vacuum/container keeps the area clean from trimmed</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t create clean edges, it won&#x27;t cut stray hairs...</li>
            <li> You will still need to clean the sink.</li>
            <li> I actually use the cheap Gillete trimmer/shaver for beard because that requires no charging and battery life is quite good.  </li>
            <li> I find I have to take it apart and clean 4 to 5 times every use.</li>
            <li> You WILL still have to clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li> If you expect to not have to clean up any hair, this is not the product for you</li>
            <li> not convinient to clean.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t clean it with water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still having to clean my sink after every mornings touch-</li>
            <li> Does not cut as close as i thought, does leave an after shave shadow, you will have to shave with a razor after to achieve a clean look.</li>
            <li> since I like my beard trimmed close and clean</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try it since my old one worked great for years</li>
            <li> Incredibly long-lasting Lithium battery has meant I&#x27;ve needed to charge it only after a whole month of use</li>
            <li> easy to use and neat, powerful, and precise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer/vac, but is missing some of the things that would make it an outstanding one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good or better than expected.</li>
            <li> Awesome features, overall good quality, love the vacuum and digital display.</li>
            <li> Very nice and the charge stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought the unit was for the adjustable length setting, which turned out to be very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked great during that single charge.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is nice and does well with getting most of the hair.</li>
            <li> The vacuum intake also prevents a good accurate markup.</li>
            <li> This does a nice job and vacuum gets 95% or more of the whiskers.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is nice and collects most of the hair.  </li>
            <li> The hight adjustment have a positive click to them and they lock in place, much better than my previouse Norelco Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I would give it five stars without hesitation if the claim that it &amp;#34;does not make a mess while trimming&amp;#34; were true.</li>
            <li> works great, vacuum catches a good bit of hair, and long battery life</li>
            <li> I still shave my face, but when I just want to trim around the edges with the razor, I&#x27;ll use this to whittle down to 1mm, and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> easy to use, just have to find right position how to hold trimmer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to set the shaver for the right length and it stays locked while shaving.</li>
            <li> After many years of using a different brand, which did not trim evenly and could not hold a charge for even 24 hours, I am extremely happy with my new Norelco.</li>
            <li> Compared to any other trimmer on the market, I venture to say this is the most superior.  </li>
            <li> You can really control the length pretty good, better than most trimmers with different attachments.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean, and I love the digital read out.</li>
            <li> Oh and also it actually is not as bulky as it looks, fits very nicely in hand, and pretty light.</li>
            <li> , instead it&#x27;s right on this thing!</li>
            <li> They try to tell you that shaver doesn&#x27;t come with that part and that the part is for the QT4050, but it says right on their box that it&#x27;s included!  </li>
            <li> just right!</li>
            <li> working perfectly   great battery life   very sharp and strong blades  </li>
            <li> Good value for not having to clean up clippings from the entire sink area.</li>
            <li> I liked my old trimmer, but it would not hold a charge and was no longer making clean cuts.  </li>
            <li> If you elect to clean it with water, I would advise being careful not to let water drop through the screen that leads into the vaccuum mechanism</li>
            <li> This version is head and shoulders above the older version - more precise trimming levels, sturdier filter screen to catch trimmings, just a more solid product and a very good price.</li>
            <li> Keeps his beard nice, short &amp; clean looking!  </li>
            <li> Based on the reviews saying the contour comb for a full beard as I have is not included (thanks to everyone for your accurate reviews!)</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer off amazon and it has been a pretty good product so far.</li>
            <li> Does great on general shaving, not so much on edging up however.</li>
            <li> Great service and product worked as expected.</li>
            <li> The settings seems to be accurate and useful.</li>
            <li> It was pretty good, bought it to replace a 2-year old QT4050.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY AS EXPECTED- COMPLETELY HAPPY WITH THE PURCAHSE.</li>
            <li> I keep my beard pretty short and for me this shaver works great.</li>
            <li> I would give the old one a 6 star rating, it was absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> My Wahl went about 6 months on its first charge and it was much more powerful.</li>
            <li> She does a better job and doesn&#x27;t charge much.  </li>
            <li> It says it will go to .5mm, that is true</li>
            <li> I have owned this for 20 days now without being able to get a straight answer out of Philips or their parts department.  </li>
            <li> The accuracy of the different settings is quite good.</li>
            <li> and it actually feels good to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; with it.  </li>
            <li> which by the way I loved until the day it found it&#x27;s way into my toilet...still ran it just was never the same!  </li>
            <li> update with full review after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> The battery still has a good bit of the origingal charge left.  </li>
            <li> , this model has several good features</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good about this trimmer.</li>
            <li> After much research, I decided to replace my battery operated trimmer with this more robust Philips.</li>
            <li> I really have had none better so this one gets 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product gently, and I really enjoyed it, but now it is a pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> length setting also has a good solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Sound fun?</li>
            <li> I had just as much hair on my hands and on top of the trimmer than in the hair catch.</li>
            <li> but thats true for all clippers.</li>
            <li> Most of them were corded and it was a real production shaving and then cleaning the area afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard (except for the neck), which I like to keep about 3 millimeters longer than \\&quot;stubble.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I really like how many choices I have for the beard length.  </li>
            <li> I was able to work around them (by using superglue) until the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.  </li>
            <li> Tapping the whole trimmer on the trashcan/sink is more</li>
            <li> Now on to what is not so cool.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy and would recommend it anyone that uses a trimmer regularly..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be more than a gimmick when I bought it, but my sink has been much cleaner since then.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts much longer, we&#x27;ll see over time, seems like the more you use it the battery seems to deteriorate.</li>
            <li> well and good, but hoping for a unit that will last longer than (under) 11 months!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head has the widest range of lengths I&#x27;ve seen on any unit so far, and allows you to adjust 1mm at a time which is nice.</li>
            <li> The corded trimmer is much quicker and gives more even cut.  </li>
            <li> I would have paid more for one that had replaceable batteries and cutter units that were reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I really like this razor and expect to use it for many years.</li>
            <li> I love the whole concept</li>
            <li> for an on-the-go shaver, but doesn&#x27;t quite match up to a full kit of barbering tools.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about battery life on the go since I keep it plugged in most of the time.  </li>
            <li> Suction is not sufficient even after full cleaning.</li>
            <li> It collects virtually all hair if you don&#x27;t let the collection chamber get too full and brush off the filter.  </li>
            <li> I purposely selected the top of the line model because I don&#x27;t expect to make this purchase very often.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell if this is a true replacement for myT960</li>
            <li> I am loving this trimmer so far.</li>
            <li> The battery now retains a full charge as described in the literature and reviews.</li>
            <li> but I would be very happy if I could stop the engine that sucks the hairs</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: 5 days later, Phillips made good when the replacement trimmer arrived.  </li>
            <li> I have used it around tricky places such as my neck, and it serves you good...</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature was kinda cool, but I don&#x27;t see why it just wouldn&#x27;t always be on.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good trimmer that does what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> Although I have always maintained it neatly,  It is a full faced</li>
            <li> And it also sets it up for a full &amp;#34;smooth shave&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The battery seem to last though which is good.  </li>
            <li> really what more would you want from a trimmer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bad!&lt;br /&gt;(you always had to keep it on full power mode, i have no idea</li>
            <li> What started off as 1 week of use (10+ sessions) with a full charge ended up being two x 5 minute trimming sessions.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal I did when I bought the above product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a full beard for 30 years and have used Norelcos since the beginning.</li>
            <li> Many settings allow for a really customizable beard.  </li>
            <li> It is a dream come true for this type of appliance.</li>
            <li> I was also delighted, as pointed out in a prior review, that the mustache blade that came with the T980 works with the QT4070.</li>
            <li> I really like being able to dial in length to the mm</li>
            <li> While the button is held, the shaver ran, and it reported a full charge.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a trimmer who has a full beard.</li>
            <li> but if it means I&#x27;m cleaning up 1/2 as much hair as before that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you&#x27;re trimming a full beard, then this will work.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless the led length indicator is really cool</li>
            <li> Died after 8 months, will try to get it repaired through warranty but not hope full.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift to my son and he liked it while it worked, he liked it enough he wants another one.</li>
            <li> I have used it around tricky places such as my neck, and it serves you good...</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a Lithium-Ion battery, so you should keep it charged full at all times to preserve the battery life.</li>
            <li> have a goatee and a full beard</li>
            <li> It is good for alot of facial hair and you can trim your hair as you like it.  </li>
            <li> He uses it all the time and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely none of the problems that so many others have reported on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have a full beard 365 days a year, so I trim my beard</li>
            <li> View the full video review here: http://bit.ly/AmazonNorelcoReview</li>
            <li> good product only thing lacking is precision shaving.</li>
            <li> only issue I have with it is the close shave, it isnt as good as Remington</li>
            <li> I use it on a full beard, the contour comb set to 3 mm.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for over a month at a rate of 3 full face shaves per week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the battery is good for about two weeks with daily use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance, I would have loved it except they didn&#x27;t even package the charger or the different style options.</li>
            <li> so there were no doubts in my mind that Philips Norelco was a good brand to go with especially the QT4070.</li>
            <li> Loved it initially.</li>
            <li> Have used several times and found this product has good battery life.</li>
            <li> - I use it on my neck and cheeks with a full beard.</li>
            <li> My man and I love this trimmer and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer.</li>
            <li> So this is a good product with cool features such as the hair catcher where you can throw them out in the trash and there arent hairs all over the sink.</li>
            <li> This is not a BAD product at all.</li>
            <li> Not bad).</li>
            <li> Not bad,</li>
            <li> I think the vacuum is great idea, but it will need a better intake design and far more suction before it is really functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either they have changed the guards that are provided with the trimmer, or some people are impressively adept at injuring themselves and will probably die soon from walking down the street, or something similarly hazardous.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum function on this doesn&#x27;t work that great, my 12 year old Remington MB 70 that this item is replacing has a vac that works much better.  </li>
            <li> In particular the Norelco T980 was so wonderful that the sharp contrast between it and this product are part of the reason I&#x27;m posting this review.</li>
            <li> The adjustments are very straight forward and easy.  </li>
            <li> The height adjusts easily, and the readout is great, but you have to make sure it is set to what you want by checking the readout since the way the head adjusts isn&#x27;t as obvious as my last trimmer just by looking at it.</li>
            <li> It seems like there aren&#x27;t a lot of good dedicated beard trimmer options available right now, but I would avoid this one if possible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the vacuum works surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum isn&#x27;t as good as the T980</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard Trimmer is a good product.</li>
            <li> The vacuum seems indeed a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum portion works good.</li>
            <li> The good here is the vacuum that collects trimmed hair.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is a good idea, but doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Our son loved the vacuum feature on this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this one and loved the fact that it has a self contained vacuum to keep hair from going every where.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works surprisingly well</li>
            <li> Vacuum feature is good, though don&#x27;t expect it to get everything.</li>
            <li> Cuts good, but returned it because the vacuum is nonexistent.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum function seemed good</li>
            <li> The vacuum collection is surprisingly helpful.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is not as good as I&#x27;d hope for</li>
            <li> Used the Philips Norelco T980 Beard Trimmer w/ Vacuum for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It had some deficiencies, and I am happy to say that they fixed everything for this new model.</li>
            <li> I must say that my new QT4070 has been just great so far.</li>
            <li> Vacuum isn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped, but it provides a great shave and I love the digital display.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to adjust and the number of settings that it offers.  </li>
            <li> I used to own the previous Phillips-Norelco trimmer model and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> precise range from 1 to 18 mm permits him to shape his beard easily and as he wants.</li>
            <li> Charging the battery is quick and keeping its battery charge longer than most is appreciated.</li>
            <li> The product came nicely packaged easy to open but had to be charged upon trying to turn it on.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I have found that easily and effectively gives me an even 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> The comb flexes nicely with facial contours and the length settings are easy to use and stay reliably in place.</li>
            <li> The adjustable guard is easy to use and the digital display is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> Strong vacuum keeps the sink &amp; counter clean and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This trimmer isn&#x27;t perfect but it SIGNIFICANTLY reduces the mess from a beard trim to the point where its not hard to clean up what is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First: it&#x27;s easy to &amp;#34;override&amp;#34; the guide lengths.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard, and thus have had beard trimmers, for almost 30 years, so I have some pretty strong ideas about what a trimmer should and should not do.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: its pretty easy to make one of the combs work for face, head, body, whatever...</li>
            <li> However, it is worth the inconvenience since the quality of the cut is so much better than the Qt4070 and much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge and its functions were pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> It catches most of the hair where before I had to clean not only the sink but the counter top where the trimmed beard flew everywhere.</li>
            <li> The contour comb and dialable length settings make it easy to trim your beard to a consistent length.</li>
            <li> Like the easy way you can dial in the exact length of your beard (1mm to 18mm).  </li>
            <li> First, if you want the scruffy look, this is an easy way to get it and keep it.</li>
            <li> A month or two of 3-4 uses a week pretty easily</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for, sleek, easy to read number system.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is, I would guess, about 90% effective at capturing the hair, and the attachments are both easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Working from the neckline up with the top flat part against my skin with the comb lifting the hair and the cutters in the first line of attack, I got barber shop results in three passes, one with the setting on 18, and one on 16, and one quick fix-it trim with the comb removed (give it a good pull to remove it, slip it on with no force whatsoever when you have the right vertical angle).</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved this gift and so did I. I particular like that the vacuum catches most of the hairs</li>
            <li> the philips blades dont need cleaning or oiled they stay sharp all the time it also has a great length guide built in</li>
            <li> the razor works great and it keeps the stuble to itself unlike other one i had.</li>
            <li> works great, as expected!</li>
            <li> With that said I think it is a great trimmer for the price, don&#x27;t let other comments make you think otherwise.</li>
            <li> Other than that, quite happy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experiences with other trimmers, but I can say I am perfectly happy with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> , the dial-operated hair-length control is nice; it&#x27;s easy to clean out the hair collection chamber; and it keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> works great ,cuts nice and battery last a long time</li>
            <li> A charge seems to last a pretty good amount of time and the ease of adjusting for trimming lengths is nice, but the other shortcomings outweigh these nice features.</li>
            <li> - This does an ok job of trimming for 5 o&#x27;clock, but isn&#x27;t that easy to get under the nose or nooks and crannies (as the unit is quite large), so you have to really work it.  </li>
            <li> Nice shaver from philips, the vacuum prperty works fine.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, metal &amp; rubber build instead of cheap plastic and is contoured to fit the hand.  </li>
            <li> A VERY PRECISE AN COMFORTABLE TRIM WITH NO MESS.</li>
            <li> The product is very good so far, used it just a 3-4 times, less friction, easy length set up, Vaccum heally helps, smooth on skin.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is very nice and makes the razor much easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> Nice smooth comfortable enjoyable new useful necessary</li>
            <li> I had the previous top end version of this trimmer and had it for many years before problems happened (mostly plastic part cracking/breaking).  </li>
            <li> The compartment fills up quickly and the overflow just sprays about your bathroom like mushroom spores.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for one month and found:  - The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature must be on 100% for this to adequately vacuum/trim my hair..... and even then...  -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really fast razor and easy clean up so shaving can be done while I wait for the shower to heat up.</li>
            <li> Better than the older model I replaced</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t lose any pieces, because it&#x27;s just one piece, and it&#x27;s super convenient for traveling.    </li>
            <li> My older Norelco T7500 was a reliable companion for many years.  </li>
            <li> This model is larger at the top and takes up more space while traveling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27; m sure they would love to charge extra for the power cord if they could get away with it.</li>
            <li> charge feature allows you to quickly charge the trimmer before leaving on a trip.  </li>
            <li> in that it lacks the travel lock, quick charge, and turbo functions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was still some mild shavings that found its way in my sink.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the blades don&#x27;t cut skin, or I&#x27;d be bleeding all over.</li>
            <li> So I tried it out yesterday and enjoy it (so far) even more than the T980.</li>
            <li> A tremendous time saver and always looking &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My old razor had one and it was very convenient, and also good for areas around your lips for mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> I like their older model better</li>
            <li> The comb on top doesn&#x27;t allow for an even trim, I find that no matter how many times I run the trimmer over my jaw line it still doesn&#x27;t trim at the same length.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I like my older one better, this unit will nick you if it can.</li>
            <li> Four stars because it includes the contour-following comb, which is more comfortable than the fixed comb which is attached when it arrives packaged.</li>
            <li> * Turbo mode to take care of business in quick order&lt;</li>
            <li> Super close \\&quot;stubble\\</li>
            <li> But if you like a tighter beard with more detail, this trimmer cannot function at the most basic level.</li>
            <li> Ok, first of all the trimmer works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I have older and cheaper Philips that shaves better than this.</li>
            <li> Keeping that in mind, I quickly run over my beard once a week with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> And for the most part it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> shaving unit seems okay on my first attempt, but it is just that it gets hot</li>
            <li> There is a nice battery indicator replacing what used to be just a blinking red light.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a worthy replacement for the T780.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;While my old Norelco head was easier to precise trim, this unit collects the beard stubble much better</li>
            <li> It is made from much sturdier material, handles easy and cuts cleanly.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly, and can also be used with the supplied cord.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite gotten use to the digital display yet, as the 7100 didn&#x27;t have it, but I am sure i will be glad to know the amount of charge I have when it gets close to dying on me.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement purchased by a (formerly) loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great, and sucks up most of the hair when you put it in turbo mode.  </li>
            <li> i purchased many trimmers, nothing like this..  purchased ones double and triple the price , you will not find any thing better than this!!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I think I got lucky.</li>
            <li> I took my trimmer out of the box (which btw comes with the contour following comb as well), plugged it in to charge while I read the user manual, and took it for a nice smooth drive....</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The guards removed quickly for shaping my scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 7300 &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; a lot more sturdy than the older model.</li>
            <li> Positives: it cuts evenly and quickly.     </li>
            <li> I like quick charge capabilities and LEDs showing remaking power.</li>
            <li> i definitely recommend to buy for your boyfriends/husbands ,  you&#x27;ll receive many kisses  :))</li>
            <li> Had one older one that I got in 2010, seemed more durable than this does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We even used it to do a quick trim of my husbands back/chest hair as we were headed to the beach.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> I prefer and use the more \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; comb which is what my older clipper had.</li>
            <li> Also, it does good edge work (and, apparently &amp;#34;manicured stubble looks&amp;#34;) with the attachments off.  </li>
            <li> The razor charges quickly and holds its charge.  </li>
            <li> I have had a beard most of my days on this planet and used many different beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li> After that, it charges quickly...</li>
            <li> I tried super glue, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I took my trimmer out of the box (which btw comes with the contour following comb as well), plugged it in to charge while I read the user manual, and took it for a nice smooth drive....</li>
            <li> and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> keep my beard a bit longer than the hair on my head and the QT4070 allows me to quickly trim my my beard.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and seems to hold the charge well.</li>
            <li> If you travel outside the US often, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about charging this unless you are gone for more than 2 months or trim more than 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> This does a decent job, but I was looking for more of a stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> great to see how much battery is left too, just twist the wheel or remove the guard and it lights up the lcd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily, Norelco&#x27;s warranty policy has provided me with two replacements.</li>
            <li> and it is simply adequate.  </li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;rogue hairs&amp;#34; that manage to evade the electric trimmer, but I like the ability to plow through all the whiskers quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, stubble is in fashion.</li>
            <li> Also the Quick Charge is better/great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but the vacuum on the trimmer is not that good the Vacuum on the Old model was a lot better.</li>
            <li> Works great as a beard trimmer, but don&#x27;t expect much from the vacuum system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I use it more often when my beard hair is shorter, the vacuum system works better.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works ok too and helps keep most of the hair from flying around as you trim.</li>
            <li> I really like the vacuum concept, though it doesn&#x27;t work all that great in application.  </li>
            <li> Works great and the vacuum makes clean-up much easier (no complaints from my wife about wayward</li>
            <li> The Remington MB200 design is better, but I really love the vacuum and lithium ion technology on this one.</li>
            <li> I wish that the vacuum function had more sucking power in order to get most is not all the hair that you cut.</li>
            <li> I think the vacuum works better than most people give it credit for.</li>
            <li> But the vacuum works great and it shaves very well.</li>
            <li> Really like the vacuum system and trims beard great.</li>
            <li> Even with the vacuum not being the best I still give this five stars because it simply makes beard trimming a snap</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Price is on the high end of most beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> It is also MUCH easier to clean!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it holds a good charge and the vacuum works pretty good in it</li>
            <li> It works really Great for me, and all the features work very well...including the vacuum too!!!  </li>
            <li> The teeth barely if ever catch on your skin and get caught, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> and, it&#x27;s pretty precise...</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the entire experience.  </li>
            <li> I use it for a beard on the 12 setting and it is very consistent even without the form-following comb.  </li>
            <li> I have had great success with other models but this one belongs in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of how functional it would actually be, and I&#x27;m happy to write that it&#x27;s done an incredible job!  </li>
            <li> I first noticed how flimsey and cheap it looked and felt.</li>
            <li> Both feel sort of cheap, but they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I could replace my dead Norelco T960 since it was the best beard trimmer I have used (and I have used several over the years).</li>
            <li> First of all, Philips Norelco was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty comfortable, lasts a while on a charge</li>
            <li> I bought this over six months ago and it is still running dependably on its very first charge.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and handles pretty well</li>
            <li> I would like to alert prospective users of this product that its electrical cord if one chooses not to use its battery feature that one ascertains that the plug that goes into the trimmer be well pressed into it so it does not get unplugged as it happened to me on my first two uses of this trimmer, fortunately it has not happened afterwards.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this trimmer as it is very similar to the T980.</li>
            <li> product looks goods, trims good (except for the upper lip), but I spent a good 10 minutes cleaning this after I was finished.</li>
            <li> This product looks goods, trims good (except for the upper lip), but I spent a good 10 minutes cleaning this after I was finished.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for a long time and does a good job at trimming.  </li>
            <li> over all it is a good product as long as it keeps working</li>
            <li> the charge stays good for a long time.</li>
            <li> (I use the 4 mm setting for my head, can&#x27;t say how good it is for long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it to me to spend the 45 minutes in the bathroom shaving my scalp and face when I can use this awesome tool to trim down to a nice stubble in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The adjustment system works nicely and the vacuum catches most of the trimmings so it keeps things much cleaner .</li>
            <li> I wish the vacuum was a bit more powerful, but I&#x27;m sure that would&#x27;ve pushed the portability and noise levels to the limits of this structure.</li>
            <li> The system itself is much quieter than the older models which is nice.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is nice and trim and my sink is mostly clean.</li>
            <li> find that this thing is great if you want to cut down all the way to 1 day stubble</li>
            <li> It is great- just dial the length up or down for desired hair length.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I had an older similar older Norelco I liked better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great product but not exactly show in the picture....!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and is very handy, you can carry it with a small bag.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> Pretty incredible little machine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a whole new world of enjoyable shaving he says!</li>
            <li> The vacuum is nice, but you´ll still have to clean your sink.</li>
            <li> If having a great vacuum is your main concern</li>
            <li> - The vacuum system does not work effectively, still have to clean up after almost every</li>
            <li> That said, I figured this new one would have to be a better design</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any more, so I gave him the new one for his birthday</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not terrible but it also doesn&#x27;t live up to</li>
            <li> The new 3/4\\&quot; tall illuminated number makes much more sense in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they just keep getting better with each new model.</li>
            <li> This new one is so much better.</li>
            <li> Customer service was better this time - sending me a new unit</li>
            <li> good cut and the vacuum is what we both like very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer, and I highly recommend it, but I wouldn&#x27;t treat the vacuum as a deciding factor, it doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> Just as I found on the internet reviews, consistent, powerful, accurate.  </li>
            <li> For years I was wonderfully happy with Norelco&#x27;s previous top-of-the-line model, the T980.</li>
            <li> But none the less, I&#x27;m still relatively happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the quick easy adjustability with the turn of a dial because I like to trim the areas directly around my mouth (mustache and soul patch area)</li>
            <li> It is lighter than my previous beard trimmer and has a great feel in your hand.</li>
            <li> Over the last 8 months, when I had a full beard, a goatee, or now that trendy 5&#x27;oclock+ stubble</li>
            <li> but it actually does a pretty good job of sucking in the beard particles and makes cleanup  </li>
            <li> The vaccum feature that catches hair is super useful.</li>
            <li> This is my third one in twelve years, and it does a pretty good job of keeping my beard and moustache trimmed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary - I only give the trimmer a three star because its performance is a long way from being what is advertised and or perfect.</li>
            <li> Also easy to get a straight line and trim moustache.  </li>
            <li> Its easy convenient and fast.</li>
            <li> I cut mine pretty short, I use the 3 or 4 millimeter setting, so with a good even cut</li>
            <li> but this is the higher model supposedly with much better battery life and much shorter charging time.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very efficient and easily used beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The T980 cut more consistently but the OT4070 definitely does a more than adequate job.</li>
            <li> I like a very close beard which this product does easily.</li>
            <li> He said it&#x27;s easy to use and cuts really well.</li>
            <li> The cut hair storage compartment opens easily, making throwing out the hair a breeze (though the enclosed brush or a Q-tip make it much easier and thorough).</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last long but otherwise its awesome!</li>
            <li> had a very old Norelco Model and was a lot more effecient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A far better design would have been a trim head NOT with a flat, movable top, but with a single-piece, CURVED top, negating the need for moving parts to maintain contact...</li>
            <li> Every single time I shave this product does seems to leave a good deal of hairs without being cut forcing me to have to go over them with scissors.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good and the vacuum function works well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works pretty good but do not expect it to pick up everything.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is also pretty good.</li>
            <li> The settings are just right, offering many length options and it is a plus to have a vacuum function so hair doesn&#x27;t go everywhere although, it vacuum doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job sucking in the cut hair.</li>
            <li> Sink clean up is still very much required.</li>
            <li> Also, he is not critical of this particular trimmer--he rates it as GOOD, and very likely as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Great results and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess in the sink</li>
            <li> I works great and reduces the mess created 10 fold.</li>
            <li> Same problem as many before me: batteries will not hold a charge!</li>
            <li> Says he can shave in 5 minutes verses an HOUR or more with his old Norelco shaver!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> but I find that I have to go over and over more times to get an even cut than with my old Norelco!</li>
            <li> The little Norelco beard trimmers keep getting better &amp; better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold, the digital readout is nice, and the battery charge is certainly up for a lengthy trim job of hair, beard and body.  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job, better than the Sharper Image model I previously used until its battery died.</li>
            <li> Then the trimmings are more easily picked up by the moderate suction.</li>
            <li> that you need an extra step to get the advertised product but Philips has a very quick turn around to make sure you are satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neither will this trimmer, with any of its accompanying attachments, effectively trim a scraggly beard unless you&#x27;ve been living in a cave without a razor for half a year or more.  </li>
            <li> After my first beard trim, I opened the vacuum compartment and found that it had collected most of the trimmed hair, although my basin almost looked like it was painted in beard hair :-).</li>
            <li> Good quality trimmer, no hairy mess to deal with, easy to clean,with good battery power digital meter lets you see how much power you have.</li>
            <li> It trims facial hair right away and does a pretty good job sucking all the hair in.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it as much as I keep close stubble and the stubble comb works just fine.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum itself does an ok job but gets clogged easily and doesn&#x27;t quite capture</li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up all the hair, but it picks up most of it!</li>
            <li> The vacuum for whiskers works better than I thought making for easy cleanup.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and feel it does a fine job.</li>
            <li> The adjuster to set the height is easy to use and the different heads come off easy to clean the unit.</li>
            <li> no bad surprises and the charger work both on US and other countries so all good</li>
            <li> first off the trimmer does a good job and the vacuum feature is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco beard trimmers before and they typically are very nice.  </li>
            <li> I was floored by how powerful and clean this cut after using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> you know you will be chucking out in a couple years, or go with a higher quality unit with better construction and decent, available reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Other than that it does a good job, the hair trap thing fills up quickly.</li>
            <li> Tilting the trimmer up at all allows the blade to basically come in contact with your skin if you really pressed it, since there&#x27;s a huge gap in the guard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for a few months now and its really great.  </li>
            <li> for its primary function of trimming a beard,  it really  works quite well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need an LED light to tell me the setting</li>
            <li> It also looks very sleek and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s fast, comfortable, I found none of the &amp;#34;sharp comb&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really fantastic shaver, and I really like it and recommend it to everybody.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trims real well and comes with the two heads now, smooth and stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From my experience of a few months its turned out to be a 5 star razor for getting a great stubble</li>
            <li> This is a great performing trimmer, with few drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I received the trimmer last night and was quite impressed with the neat packaging and the clear and concise instruction sheet that came with it.</li>
            <li> it was as smooth as if I used a straight razor.</li>
            <li> But the battery life is amazing only had to charge it once in a while..</li>
            <li> The cut quality is great, no problems with pulling or an uneven cut.</li>
            <li> now, it is quiet and powerful and trims my beard safely and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> It does not shave much and you do not get that smooth face after you shave.</li>
            <li> They are very flimsy and made of cheap polystyrene plastic.</li>
            <li> This thing helps keep my amazing facial hair in line- no joke!  </li>
            <li> The solution is to always use a light touch, but really?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just get a cheap split leather pouch for it, but I really shouldn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because this is a nice trimmer overall</li>
            <li> Overall I have liked it.</li>
            <li> The tines on top of the comb are too soft.  </li>
            <li> I wish that it was like my old one, where the container popped all the way out, but all in an all, it&#x27;s a great trimmer and especially for the price!</li>
            <li> He says it trims everything better than his old one</li>
            <li> For longer lengths (taking sideburns from two inches to 23/32) I had to start off with a scissors and then use the shaver to even things out, which wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> or so it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but still useful.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great, love the vac feature, as does my wife who was tired of cleaning out the sink.  </li>
            <li> It is different, but if you slide the guide along your face instead of trying to stuff your chin into the blade slot, you will have a much more comfortable experience.    </li>
            <li> Though there were some negative comments most of them said the product is so good.    </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because I liked the fact that it had 18 different length settings.  </li>
            <li> This beard trimmer does have some nice features, like the length of cut setting and digital display.  </li>
            <li> The QT4070 is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> About once a week for the goatee, so I didn&#x27;t need a professional clipper and don&#x27;t use all that many accessories.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t promise you&#x27;ll get the proper comb in your box, but if you DO, it&#x27;s a really nice shaver.</li>
            <li> was so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This one is okay, but it&#x27;s loud and clunky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Turbo mode will make short work of any kind of grooming.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also rare to happen, but it does.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how effective it would be for those who might need the extra power.  </li>
            <li> The only nitpicky thing I would find needs improving is that it would be nice if it included a stand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve charged it only once ever, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> The digital readout is great for old eyes.</li>
            <li> nearly a year later it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li> , I plugged it in and charged it and the convenient charge level lights showed it was charged, and it was quite powerful without the chord upon use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I grew a beard just so I could use this....totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The setting display and overall LED display is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have over a day&#x27;s worth of stubble, forget about it.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> you can see, the positives are far greater than the negatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only reviewing this product for what I&#x27;ve experienced so far.</li>
            <li> Anyways, have not even used it yet, maybe it will be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> IF it has a powerful trimmer, because it does not have a turbo button.</li>
            <li> really nice thing is it only has two attachments - not the 10 or 12 things you have to keep track of.</li>
            <li> in all, this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is more important to me as I keep only chin hair and need to get my sideburns and around the chin hair just right&lt;</li>
            <li> you keep a beard - this is probably worth it.</li>
            <li> I believe it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> quality razor, was worth every</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> This one has the same design flaw, but only time will tell if they&#x27;ve used a more durable plastic.&lt;br /&gt;The QT4070/41 7300 feels good in the hand, on the face and moving through the beard.</li>
            <li> So far so good as far as build quality is concerned.</li>
            <li> This on replaces my old Norelco T980 - I have been looking for the T980 replacement for many months.</li>
            <li> fits nicely into a standard travel bag</li>
            <li> The philips Norelco, seems much better than my old Remington trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does come with both &amp;#34;guards&amp;#34; - and i liked the contour following one for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i had an old one used to provide better results</li>
            <li> It is a surely useful tool that goes over my expectation.</li>
            <li> cleaning out more frequently is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the most versatile and utilitarian beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> In the interest of deciding whether it&#x27;s worth it to spend the additional money, I will compare the two.    </li>
            <li> so far I can tell you already I&#x27;m going to love this thing.</li>
            <li> I reached out in desperation for Amazon&#x27;s website, where I found the Philips Norelco QT4070 and a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> This is no where near as good as my old one.</li>
            <li> So when I saw this product mentioned in GQ of all places, I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is significantly larger than my old trimmer but a great fit in my hands and works really well.</li>
            <li> And most importantly, the length settings are different in the two models!</li>
            <li> So far this one is even better.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have never had a more comfortable trimmer, with or without the heads.</li>
            <li> My old Remington does much better with it&#x27;s guard set on the shortest setting.  </li>
            <li> So it was rarely used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The suction function doesn&#x27;t catch everything though, but it&#x27;s still worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> The Remington does have one distinct advantage: close shaving neck hairs.</li>
            <li> Some of the most worthwhile money I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> Still, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well, personally I would have liked to get something like 0.5mm when the cap is removed; but that&#x27;s not an issue at all.</li>
            <li> but I like my old trimmer better.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice improvement over my last Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> Still a nice improvement over the removable collector on my last unit.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li> still worth the money...</li>
            <li> I must admit, as others already have, that the hair collection system was better on my old T980 but all in all</li>
            <li> While the trimmer is still usable, the door can come open on it&#x27;s own and sprinkle it&#x27;s contents in a clump in my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So the rechargable Lithium-Ion battery is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may be useful to know that the 0.5mm setting is with all attachments removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few trimmers in my time, and this is by far the best</li>
            <li> The door to remove the whiskers is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> - Comes with useful attachment  </li>
            <li> But I do not think it worth $50 .Someone</li>
            <li> but my old one felt better and had a trimming attachment and a case which this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> However, whenever I tried to maneuver around angles of any kind (jaw, chin, even around the lip) the gap between the comb would be enough for my skin to make contact with the razor</li>
            <li> Much easier for maneuvering, better trimmer guard, cuts hair a lot shorter and truer to what I consider real stubble.</li>
            <li> I sent it in anyway, paid my own shipping costs, and haven&#x27;t heard back from them.</li>
            <li> I have been using beard trimmers for approximately 25 years and this is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> All in all, well worth your money</li>
            <li> exactly what I want,  holds a charge for a good long time.  </li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> But I have many concerns regarding parts that are at the same time cheap &amp; over-engineered.  </li>
            <li> So far, this one seems to do a better job of capturing the hair trimmings.</li>
            <li> I rarely charge it and it keeps going on.  </li>
            <li> The popular Philips Norelco did not even last a year.</li>
            <li> so i think it&#x27;s worth having</li>
            <li> The T980 came with two blades, a wide blade that was used with the contour comb and was good for trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> it not covering the top of the unit completely.  </li>
            <li> liked the amount of hair it left on my face in the 1mm setting, and i like the feel of the hair</li>
            <li> Pretty cool</li>
            <li> The digital screen is nice and the battery display is a must have.</li>
            <li> While the pictures look nice, it&#x27;s made as cheaply as possible out of plastic.</li>
            <li> turbo button is nice and I always have it on so it has enough power to suck the trimmings up.&lt;br /&gt;I will always stick with Norelco beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> Even came with a blade guard attachment that you could use for your more sensitive bits.</li>
            <li> As a trimmer alone it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I will tell you this problem was more the fixed.</li>
            <li> It trims better than my old one and is faster as well.</li>
            <li> I also include a fresh bottle of Wahl clipper oil which is a must to maintain your trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and of course the 1 hour charge is super convenient and the digital display that shows the cut length is very easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though the vacuum does work fair enough, it leaves much more to be done on my part which leads me to think it just might be a gimmick after all.cleaning section has 17 steps?</li>
            <li> Though the vacuum does work fair enough, it leaves much more to be done on my part which leads me to think it just might be a gimmick after all.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with how well the vacuum works; if you trim at least once a week, it will collect almost all of your whiskers (unless you&#x27;re Robin Williams, or a member of ZZ Top).</li>
            <li> The vacuum &amp;#34;hopper&amp;#34; sucking up all the trimmings has made my bathroom far more tidy.  </li>
            <li> Settings for beard length allow for more precise trimming and vacuum function is a must.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the addition of the 2-speed vacuum accessory as it catches most of the trimmings.</li>
            <li> Having read several extreme negative reviews of this product I was hesitant to buy the shaver but did on the basis of the very good to excellent reviews.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it does a great job of trimming and has a large selection of lengths to choose from.</li>
            <li> whole operation lasted a maximum of ten minutes and was a lot of fun.d (give it a good pull to remove it, slip it on with no force whatsoever when you have the right vertical angle).</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature was especially intriguing to me.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a nice touch</li>
            <li> the vacuum is really nice.</li>
            <li> Vacuum is a nice plus</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is nice and the fact I don&#x27;t have to deal with changing combs to get</li>
            <li> The vacuum is nice, but not a necessity.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done and the vacuum is nice.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is nice.  </li>
            <li> does the job, but not quite as effective of a vacuum as i would have hoped.</li>
            <li> Vacuum is nice but does not catch all hair.  </li>
            <li> It works well and because of the vacuum it keeps my sink nice and</li>
            <li> I like the vacuum, the LED height indicator is a nice feature as well.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum still not so effective</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is nice but not 100%.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the electronic display too (cool blue LED lighting) and I find the adjustment system (to adjust the length of the beard) easy to use.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> , I decided to give this handy dandy vacuum one</li>
            <li> I would have also liked it if the blades would protrude farther then the vacuum tube.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature grabs 80% of the clippings and is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> The vacuum function is a nice add-on, but doesn&#x27;t suck in all the hairs (I still have some fall into the sink).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice because we don&#x27;t get hair all over the bathroom sink since there is a vacuum inside it.</li>
            <li> Vacuum not as effective.</li>
            <li> He really liked the way it trimmed his beard, and how the vacuum feature worked.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is not 100% effective and hair still gets all over the place.</li>
            <li> The vacuum, though a nice concept, is positioned so that you can&#x27;t use the blade to outline your mustache, sideburns, etc...</li>
            <li> vacuum is nice.</li>
            <li> Tidys up the beard maintenance experience but have yet to experience a trimmer with vacuum that is as effective as those that just trim.</li>
            <li> The vacuum function was nice but it did not keep all whiskers from ending up in the sink.</li>
            <li> My man was very pleased with his new trimmer, we were both surprised that this system also has a built in feature that vacuums as they trim.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and fast my concern is without head</li>
            <li> I just had my own intentions when I bought it with a vacuum!</li>
            <li> The first one my husband has ever owned and it was easy for him to set it up for his beard and trim it to the length he wants.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s vacuum feature it should be easy to keep the bathroom clean!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s kind of a molded guard that prevents putting nice sharp edges around my beard for a clear shaving line.  </li>
            <li> Love the compartment that vacuums hair for no mess trimming</li>
            <li> Even with the vacuum capability, you&#x27;re always left with a sink full of hair, but it does a nice job of catching quite a fair amount in the little recepticle.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is great as well and leaves no mess</li>
            <li> This new is comfortable to handle, seems like it might be a bit sturdier, trims very well and adjusts easily.</li>
            <li> It does catch some hair, but It just seems to clog up and most of the hair ends up in on the counter top anyway like any other trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Picked this guy up recently and was excited to see how many ways I could put this to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, as many, MANY other reviewers have stated, the trim head combs are flexible and not rigid.  </li>
            <li> The clean up is so much easier and it cuts much better than his old one, which he says used to grab and pull at the hair sometimes, so he had to go slower with it.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s okay, for a beard trimmer it has way to many length settings.</li>
            <li> Not the most powerful vacuum ever, but it does help pick up probably 70-80% of the trimmings allowing an easier clean up of fallen trimmings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shame, since otherwise it was rather excellent; though the vacuum feature was a bit gimmicky; I still ended up leaving stubble trimmings everywhere to clean up.</li>
            <li> and it does not bother me that the chamber isn&#x27;t the easiest to clean since I don&#x27;t have a need from it to be completely hair free between trims.</li>
            <li> Sure, you&#x27;ll definitely notice a reduction of hair falling on your sink, but you&#x27;re still going to have to do some clean up.</li>
            <li> Make sure to clean it regularly so it does not get clogged with air.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- holds good charge and overall does a decent job trimming</li>
            <li> So far works very well and trimming is very easy.</li>
            <li> Adjusting the trimmer is accomplished via a rubber coated adjustment wheel that is accessible on both sides of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stand on its own, and it takes up counter space when laying flat.</li>
            <li> Both of those were good with beard-length hair, but extremely inconsistent with stubble and my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> Much to my surprise (and relief) the contour comb was included in the original packaging.</li>
            <li> The recharge lasts a long time, and it just looks so stylish!</li>
            <li> , the cutter itself feels nice in the hand, although it must lie flat as there isn&#x27;t a vertical stand for it.</li>
            <li> The good news is the trimmer has yet to pull my beard - something other brands seems not to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Durability is good, other than the latch on the hair holding compartment</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the good reviews written here - I suspect that many of them are based upon the reviewers&#x27; initial thoughts, and not based upon their long term experience with the device.</li>
            <li> Good quality trimmer, other than one part:  </li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> Also make sure you clean it out after every use or the vacuum suction will be reduced.</li>
            <li> * Built in vacuum to clean up MOST of your stubble&lt;</li>
            <li> It just wouldn&#x27;t turn on right after shutting it off, I couldn&#x27;t get it to show any signs of life on the charger either</li>
            <li> The door for the compartment holding cut hair protrudes a bit on the right hand side.</li>
            <li> So sometimes to get every hair the right length you need to find the angle</li>
            <li> /are right for you.</li>
            <li> If you get it at the right angle, it shaves well.</li>
            <li> You just have to hold it at the right angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> but you have to angle it just right.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> The Trimmer Pro arrived right on schedule.</li>
            <li> I pulled my beard from day 1 right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The hair-trap door swings outward, pivoting from a hinge that&#x27;s located on the right side...</li>
            <li> You must align the fastening slots just right to get it to slip on.</li>
            <li> So I took the chance and that review was right.  </li>
            <li> Man up, get the right tools.  </li>
            <li> This is the right tool.</li>
            <li> and it does the job right.</li>
            <li> I provided the model and serial #, and she said they would ship me a replacement 405 right away....  </li>
            <li> , she checked their stock and said the [#422203617711] would go right out at no charge.</li>
            <li> so you need to stay right over the sink or trash can.</li>
            <li> You also end up scraping your face if you put it on the lower settings because it places the blade right against your skin.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it could trim right under my nose.</li>
            <li> Now I can say I did the right thing.</li>
            <li> The feature I like is the hair collector, which collects the trimmed hair in a container right below the cutter so almost no cuttings end up in a wash basin or the floor.</li>
            <li> It seems like most beard trimmers rip out more hairs than they cut, and many times, you find yourself going over the same spot multiple times because they just won&#x27;t cut certain hairs.</li>
            <li> The variable trim settings are great--just take some experimenting to get the right length</li>
            <li> If you hit your lip with it your are not doing it right.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with the new trimmer/shaver and cannot recommend it well enough.</li>
            <li> * Light in weight,Trimming Fast, rapid Charge, easy to adjust the comb, 99 % vacuuming the trimmed hair, clear display,accurate, cord and cordless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it caught pretty much everything I didn&#x27;t pull off manually, and at the end the sink and surrounding area were hair free</li>
            <li> Low average at best.</li>
            <li> I was able to get it to turn back on and finished my shave, and the unit display showed the battery as full except for when it was showing me the \\&quot;E\\&quot; symbol.  </li>
            <li> First trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased and am completely satisfied so far.  </li>
            <li> First off it did not come with the advertised contour following comb (advertised on Amazon and on Norelco&#x27;s own website).  </li>
            <li> If the older models were available, I would trade the QT4070 in an instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> trim, fast and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light than the older model.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get much use because I have a job that requires clean shaven face.</li>
            <li> Charges fast, its clean since it has a trash compartment.</li>
            <li> And this one is a great improvement as I can finally trim my beard quickly and properly.</li>
            <li> If you are an avid eletric beard trimmer user then you would see that the guiding comb (both of them) comes in handy and can be used over several application.</li>
            <li> removable guide is a very nice feature, as it can be easily removed by pulling straight off of the trimmer from any height setting, and when placed back on the trimmer, is still at the last height you dialed in.  </li>
            <li> I hav used many trimmers and this one tops the list, its so easy to use, light weight, good battery life and less mess comes with this product.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to adjust, and a series of blue lights monitors the battery status.  </li>
            <li> I recently decided to grow a beard and this trimmer makes it very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It may take some getting used to until you get that perfect shave down, but once you do you&#x27;ll understand what you need to adjust for the future shaves.</li>
            <li> Cons -The vacuum to pick up hair isn&#x27;t the greatest and sometimes the area that sucks hair in will get clogged, but it&#x27;s an easy fix.  </li>
            <li> Blades are sharp, cuts cleanly without catching or pulling.</li>
            <li> He says the vacuum is pretty effective too.</li>
            <li> the vacuum part is sweet, works for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a fantastic stubble and beard trimmer from a well respected name in this category.</li>
            <li> it is a good shaver but the plastic filter holder should be removable for proper cleaning, over the time the hair and skin dust will ge to the filter... overall is a good shaver/trimmer for a daily use...</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this new trimmer so much....</li>
            <li> The vacuum is also more powerful and does a better job of pulling the hair into the catch chamber than the old trimmer.    </li>
            <li> for something better, worth to pay a little bit more.</li>
            <li> So Philips if you&#x27;re ready this find a way to put the brush in the handle of the trimmer like have a little spot that you could snap it in and out, and it would near perfect.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to use and cuts precisely with its multiple adjustments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of using this trimmer, I would recommend it to anyone looking for something easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> Most of the others were designed for &amp;#34;pseudo beards&amp;#34; i.e. stubble or intricate goatees and artistic facial hair.</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum that makes the bathroom sink clean up so much easier!</li>
            <li> Using the old blades improved the experience significantly and one of the blades was a special blade for close fine trimming which was not part of this new razor.  </li>
            <li> The blades do a fine job, and by the time they wear out I&#x27;ll just replace the shaver or get a new set</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal setting, it does a fantastic job trimming hair, and keeping any trimmings cleany vacuumed into it unit&#x27;s storage compartment.</li>
            <li> I never had the problem with the one this replaced, but the QT4070 goes one step further and has a nice solid click for your setting providing even more confidence that it isn&#x27;t going to inadvertently slip on me.</li>
            <li> Great idea - no more wiping the hair trimmings from around the sink</li>
            <li> The vaccuum feature works about the same on both trimmers, catching most (but not all) short hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of trimmers in the past 10 years and I&#x27;m happy to report that this trimmer is the iPad 2 of the trimmer industry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more quiet to run, battery lasts longer, and the digital cut height display is nice.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to get precise trim lines, and the turbo mode cranks up the trimmer speed and vacuum to the point where almost nothing drops</li>
            <li> The hair collection chamber gets full really fast.</li>
            <li> this was a big issue for me with my old trimmer, and I am more than pleased with this trim...</li>
            <li> This one has cool features like led lights and fast charge with LiIon battery</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great and holds charge very well (only charged it once so far</li>
            <li> this was a big issue for me with my old trimmer, and I am more than pleased with this trim...</li>
            <li> Normal skin tissue cannot fit into that gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> The Conair looked really nice and felt nice in hand (felt better than this Norelco), but it was awkward on the face.  </li>
            <li> This apparently now comes with both of the heads that many people said Panasonic should have included.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a cordless rechargeable trimmer, with quick charge, Lithium Ion battery for sure, with a vacuum and adjustable head that trimmed well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the average shaver, this trimmer strikes me as being good for all of two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver is nice and the lithium battery lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> The charge is long and the turbo is nice.</li>
            <li> The suction is adequate if the trimmings are not too large.</li>
            <li> , I did like the old fashion style AC plug and cord on the old one better, this new one has a huge plug that does not plug into the wall socket with the ornamental outlet cover in my bathroom and the cord is cheap.</li>
            <li> The vacuum does a wonderful job at reducing hair mess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not overly impressive, the vacuum will not get all the hairs, but it does reduce the mess created significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hopefully it will last until someone makes a decent vacuum based replacement that doesn&#x27;t do more harm than good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vacuum feature, while somewhat gimmicky, does clean up a fair bit of the trimmed hair... but more on that in the cons below.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t expect to be able to get a full clean shave out of it, but it gets it down to a fairly minimal amount of stubble to be able to easily shave it with a companion device.</li>
            <li> but it does a decent job of trimming beards and when removed the guard it works great down to 0.5mm for that 5oclock shadow look.</li>
            <li> about every &#x27;nearby&#x27; model of Norelco will share the same charging system, but be sure to read the exact voltage/current specifications on the adapter to make sure you don&#x27;t rush the razor to an early death.  </li>
            <li> I would still buy this unit again, even over a new T980 if it was available.</li>
            <li> The new comb head on this trimmer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thought Phillips wouldn&#x27;t have a problem sending me a new part for free (seeing as it&#x27;s a piece of plastic).</li>
            <li> One review even said to call and complain to get the new cover for free.  </li>
            <li> I can live with it since the T980 is no longer available.</li>
            <li> After a week of light use (4 times for about 2 mins each time), I set the travel lock and made a trip to New York State.</li>
            <li> And the little vacuum feature is a great plus!</li>
            <li> Phillips customer service was easy to deal with and immediately sent me a whole new unit!</li>
            <li> It has an awesome vaccuum technology and can remove almost all of the hair without the cap, its an awesome trimmer; the only downside is that you have to try to shave with the trimmer upside down because the blades are not long enough so thats how you can get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> I also was a huge fan of the older T980, which finally gave out on me after many years of reliable shaving and trimming.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous model of this shaver, and loved it.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Norelco T980 and loved it.</li>
            <li> In future, perhaps a trimmer operating with lower noise emissions would round it out to a perfect score.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What attracted me to this product was the fact that it seemed more solid and powerful than the Panasonic (the Turbo button does work) and like the Wahl had the one hour charge with the Lithium Ion battery.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is sleek looking and appears to be of good quality, but too early to tell if it will last the rigours of the guarantee period.</li>
            <li> It is great at sucking hairs up, the only reason I use it to get the majority of my unwanted facial hair off my face.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to maintain their beard on a day to day basis.</li>
            <li> Its great for back of the neck cleanup and facial hair trimming.</li>
            <li> These are all improvements over a trimmer that was good enough I would have bought another of the old one if needed.</li>
            <li> when I trim my beard I do typically trim a fair amount off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have previously owned the 7100 version of this trimmer, and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The trimming is very uniform and quick.  </li>
            <li> Far superior to my last Panasonic beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> the hair tray got full really fast, so I ended up cleaning it pretty often while trimming.</li>
            <li> None the less its a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light up numbers are kinda gimmicky, but are sorta nice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t praise enough the vacuuming feature of that trimmer - just love it that I don&#x27;t have to clean much after it.</li>
            <li> I need around 4mm, and this 4070 make this a breeze to keep my blond shadow beard at the current perfect length (and if I get fickle and want it longer, a few clicks of a dial</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take real good care of it, so after a few years the door to the clippings holder broke and the battery degraded to where it need to be charged prior to every use..  </li>
            <li> really annoyed that I threw away more good money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> good so far, it does not get close enough without the guard to do my head as I would like.</li>
            <li> I got a good trim the first time I used it, as I was able to apply techniques learned from 10 years experience with the Wahl Trim-n-Vac (the only other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used).  </li>
            <li> Every single man should own this product.</li>
            <li> The Phillips-Norelco turbo vacuum is noticeably more powerful, it cuts a lot closer, has a lithium battery and can be used with the cord.  </li>
            <li> Hairs still fall but not as many as you would expect so the vacuum is worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> use it on my head and an occasional beard.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature is great and works well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Philips Norelco, and have used their electric shavers for years, but what made this unit really stand out to me was the built in vacuum that captured a lot of the cut hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works great as a trimmer, but don&#x27;t rely on the vacuum system to capture all of your hair if you have thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum seems to be a bit more powerful too.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum - Well... to me this is more of an advertising gimmick than it is an engineering/design success.</li>
            <li> Amazing, the vacuum really works, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great, the vacuum compartment contains the hair, the adjustable settings are a big plus compared with interchanging heads.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> In hindsight, maybe I didn&#x27;t work at it enough to get a full clean shave as most of my shaves are early in the morning when i&#x27;m rushing out</li>
            <li> Turbo button is great, it actually makes vacuum collection work!</li>
            <li> This new model is very powerful and I like the length calibrations.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but it still makes mess</li>
            <li> Another cool thing about this trimmer is how easily it pops apart and snaps back together for cleaning.</li>
            <li> It cuts clean and has pretty decent suction.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Philips Norelco beard trimmer that was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would give me a good tight trim, and this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no mess.  </li>
            <li> The only issue i had was the battery indicator not being very accurate.</li>
            <li> very fast</li>
            <li> Very Fast charging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery life is great - I charged it before a 3week vacation and had more than enough battery life to last the entire trip (using it about every-other day).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cup was replaced with a very secure door, so I don&#x27;t expect that to fall apart anytime soon, and there&#x27;s nowhere for hair to collect outside of the cup because there is no cup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is very modern looking and can be operated cordless also.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the trimmer from the actual Phillips website &amp; it only cost me $10-15 more, which I happily paid to get the actual working trimmer.</li>
            <li> Thank u very much for helping out.</li>
            <li> And the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Maybe that has an impact on my impression of this new one, but wow is this thing powerful and precise!</li>
            <li> : This is a fantastic product, much better than all the other options.</li>
            <li> As far as the trimming goes, it seems to work just fine</li>
            <li> so I spent hours researching amazon and other sites on the best beard trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li> The length adjuster works great and the vacuum picks up most of the clipped beard if the clipped length is short enough</li>
            <li> Early days but seems to hold charge just fine.</li>
            <li> I regularly clean the thing of hair with the brush, so I just don&#x27;t see how you stop this happening with normal use.</li>
            <li> does a good (no exactly clean shave) close up&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it tells you on the little led display in mm your cut length it also tells when to charge battery witch takes 1 hour for about 10 good shaves.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but works good</li>
            <li> I am using the second more narrow trimming head from my old trimmer as it fits and works perfectly with this new one.</li>
            <li> I have received the new trimmer since the original trimmer&#x27;s door broke</li>
            <li> And for me, if I have to clean the whole sink/counter for some hair it wouldn&#x27;t really matter cleaning it for all the hair.</li>
            <li> The static guard on the QT4050 meant I could never get anywhere near a close trim with it, always leaving me with a decent amount of stubble.</li>
            <li> If have to clean the sink of hair anyway, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s three times as much.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, the vacuum system gets nearly all the hairs, charge lasts long, the variable beard/stubble length settings work great too.    </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, and the early complaints about the screen pulling the beard hair seem to have been fixed.  </li>
            <li> If you are trimming a longer beard, or body hair, be aware that the longer trimmings can get jammed up in a wad at the top of the suction slot and get in the way of the cutters, so you need to keep stopping to clean them out.  </li>
            <li> It provides a perfectly even trim and the vacuum works very well to eliminate mess</li>
            <li> I use it hard and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Cons: - Large - Not for fine trimming - Buttons are not placed conveniently - Very Loud</li>
            <li> The high speed option is nice when hitting those extra hairy areas.  </li>
            <li> On my beard, the vacuum is marginally effective, even at high setting.</li>
            <li> The different adjustments is a nice addition, although finding that perfect length does take a few times unless you&#x27;re switching directly from another brand that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> the instructions are clear &amp; accurate</li>
            <li> battery lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works as it should.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> But pretty annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I figured it opened on that side, but pulling it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Mack.. I&#x27;m interested in ordering a QT4070/41, but there is a bunch of complaints as to whether the unit comes with a contour comb.</li>
            <li> : I totally understand your concern and will be glad to help you.&lt;br /&gt;Mack</li>
            <li> : Unfortunately, we do not have that information.&lt;br /&gt;Mack</li>
            <li> it has made his mornings so fast!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just me, but this machine, while aesthetically competent and ergonomic, cannot seem to properly trim my beard.</li>
            <li> In short, the cover on top of the teeth that can be adjusted, is uncovered on one side and is a hassle when your trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> love it because it lets me keep a short stubble.</li>
            <li> The battery is pretty long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It gets pretty close, but not quite.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve been impressed.</li>
            <li> I have owned Philips Norelco beard trimmers since they first came out and this one does not deserve the name.    </li>
            <li> My husband used it once when he first got.  </li>
            <li> but I had to share this first.  </li>
            <li> It is a pity because he really liked it while it worked.</li>
            <li> At first I was turned-off by this remark for an item in this price category.</li>
            <li> Maybe the first models that Norelco sold did not contain this comb.</li>
            <li> At first I was leery about some of the reviews of this trimmer.    </li>
            <li> They were very helpful and ordered the part for me with no problems!  </li>
            <li> The girl said they have had tons of calls for this, so she knew exactly what part I was talking about.  </li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this beard trimmer I read many reviews.</li>
            <li> The overwhelming majority of the clippings will be captured for simple disposal.</li>
            <li> Make sure you carry the charger with you until you know if you have the same problem.  </li>
            <li> Obviously doesn&#x27;t get it all but gets most of it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple before, but this is the first</li>
            <li> bottom line is you want to trim exactly how you want and this one does.  </li>
            <li> your left with a lot more than stubble.  </li>
            <li> adjustment readout gives clear and precise trim</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Ironically, it causes more effort through the extra cleaning.</li>
            <li> Ironically, it causes more effort through the extra cleaning.</li>
            <li> This trimmer never fails to capture all the hair as I shave.</li>
            <li> (I think it has been assembled only their), It has so many advantages</li>
            <li> The QT4070 has the fancy digital display, the travel lock, and is somewhat more compact than the T-980,</li>
            <li> so you dont have to go over the same spot as many times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes me several passes to trim my beard, which I do once a week at most.  </li>
            <li> Would be higher rating if design allowed for closer trim under nose.</li>
            <li> I returned it and got the QT4050 which is a much better design that has the front teeth above the cutter.</li>
            <li> Okay, not a big deal, just turn it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to give Philips the benefit of the doubt and say that this might have been a lemon.  </li>
            <li> simply didn&#x27;t cut all the hairs no matter how many times I went over it.</li>
            <li> First with scissors, then with a Remington, then Norelcos.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m making that claim about this trimmer while using the comb that came with the it; really don&#x27;t foresee having any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first replacement for the T980 was the QT4022.</li>
            <li> I hesitated at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;But my first impression actually trimming my beard (I first watch this helpful video to make sure I got the angle</li>
            <li> First off the battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;ve added the digital display which is nice although i don&#x27;t really stray much from the 5mm setting</li>
            <li> As stated in most of the reviews above this beard trimmer no longer arrives with the correct comb.</li>
            <li> The first one died after about 10 years and the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge.  </li>
            <li> It seems to trim my face pretty evenly  and has yet to cut me.</li>
            <li> I rarely have to do much cleaning up and share a bathroom with a roommate</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok because I just look at the side measurements to see what the actual setting is.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> However, the default comb hasn&#x27;t any moving parts and will likely be a bit more durable over time as the contour comb eventually looses its spring ability.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to keep burning out after a while, first not holding a charge but still usable when plugged in, then giving up altogether.</li>
            <li> so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> , is that here is a free consumer insights resource (something companies pay millions for) which seems to be completely ignored by the people at Phillips Norelco.</li>
            <li> but fortunately the one from my old trimmer still fits.</li>
            <li> Also does not give consistent cut.</li>
            <li> Before I used the trimmer attachment on my electric shaver, which was ok but only cuts close to the face and throws hair all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;d be willing to cough up 80 bucks for a do-all bread&amp;mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> I paid for the upgrade features like 1-hour charging and two comb options, but now find I would have been OK with the features of the QT4050 because the 4050 has only the desirable contour-following comb but 8-hour charging.</li>
            <li> Comfort should be your first priority.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I know there are hair trimmers out there that offer every possible attachment, most of which end up in a plastic bag underneath the sink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first use, and the first embarrassing trim</li>
            <li> Guess that&#x27;s what I get for trying to expect a higher level of quality out of Norelco&#x27;s QT4070/41 beard</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see exactly where I was trimming  </li>
            <li> With such a better performance, I don&#x27;t understand why _all_ trimmers and electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t use lithium ion batteries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used this trimmer for several months and the battery life is more than sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> People have different face shapes anyways :)  </li>
            <li> This is the first beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> In this condition, I was able to trim most of my body with only perhaps a third of a charge.</li>
            <li> I had a similar version that I bought 6 years ago, and I was fairly satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It worked well for the first couple months, but now it won&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li> The holding mechanism has completely snapped off and I have to secure it with a rubber band now</li>
            <li> I had to go over my face ten times to get most of it cut.  </li>
            <li> Works great and the battery last long.</li>
            <li> If you are trimming facial hair it should catch most of them while using to shave a childs head</li>
            <li> and i trim my beard much more often because this device&#x27;s variability can get the actual length i like.</li>
            <li> but after exactly one year the problems started (and the warranty of course was expired).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The battery seems ok (second time around).  </li>
            <li> Funny, the Peanut sells for $40.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for about two years and it runs as well as it did the first time that I used it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going on the first charge.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have time for the warranty return route when the first one died</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I had another Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer that worked the same way, but it had two heads on it that enter changed</li>
            <li> One was a smaller head that I could trim with better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend to those who can&#x27;t be bothered to shave on a regular basis and prefer the elegantly disheveled look as I do.</li>
            <li> first is the inability to replace batteries.</li>
            <li> the first problem is still here.</li>
            <li> Having used numerous trimmers over the past 15 years, I have seen improvements in trimmers but am still looking for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> For the first year I could charge this unit and get 4 or 5 uses out of it.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a better photo of the clear plastic compartment cover but as you can see it is just cheap plastic and that tab will break off sooner or later.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shaving products for years and had been satisfied with all but the last shaver I bought.  </li>
            <li> first pass</li>
            <li> bought the beard trimmer because I wanted better control over my facial grooming.  </li>
            <li> I thought at first</li>
            <li> First off I don&#x27;t go for the stubble look</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> I have also found that it is better for trimming my sideburns, especially in the whisker/hair blend zone.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> At first glance, it looks like the trimmer did a good job, but, then, I noticed that the hair length was fairly uneven at anywhere between 4 and 12 mm.</li>
            <li> the blue light looks cool.</li>
            <li> First, the guard that sets the trim length is varying distances from the trimmer so, depending on the angle that the trimmer contacts your skin, the trim length changes.  </li>
            <li> However, it is missing one key feature - a very close blade to trim the edges and make them perfect.  </li>
            <li> The cut is even and consistent.</li>
            <li> This is a really a quality product!</li>
            <li> I wish i had stuck with something smaller and cheaper for that matter that would do a better job.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this Norelco!!</li>
            <li> This one is fancy, digital, etc but the issue is it tends to throw hairs out the top.  </li>
            <li> It definitely catches the majority though, a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> But close enough most part of the beard.</li>
            <li> The first time I trimmed my beard</li>
            <li> Cleaning the clippers themselves isn&#x27;t much more work than \\&quot;standard\\&quot; open clippers and the wad of clippings that it catches will surprise you.</li>
            <li> However the T980, sadly no longer available, had a rigid pivoting guide that completely surrounds the blades.  </li>
            <li> Like many of you, I&#x27;ve gone through countless shavers/trimmers.</li>
            <li> I fussed about this one at first, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like this\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> However, I got in touch with Philips customer support first.</li>
            <li> However, it is my first one</li>
            <li> I always read the 1 star reviews first and look at the percentages of 1 star reviews.</li>
            <li> Not charging the first time - gave me some trepidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li> unit works better than the earlier version.</li>
            <li> I hope it will outlast my first one.</li>
            <li> With the comb mystery solved, I tried the product today and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what is advertised.</li>
            <li> My husband, really likes this trimmer!  </li>
            <li> The first one with the vaccum lasted me for years.</li>
            <li> it without any hesitation ;)</li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer that does not require a change of guards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it worked, it was stellar.</li>
            <li> so if you have a short beard it will probably get more.  </li>
            <li> reviews on this site are probably from use within the first month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It grabs some of the hair but missed most of them which left them in my sink.   </li>
            <li> had higher expectations for this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Instead, it did the most amazingly fast beard removal, cleaned up my mustache, and barely a hair in the sink.  </li>
            <li> well i still bought it anyway and used it for the first time today .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The charging display is a bar graph type giving you a much better idea about the state of charge than a simple blinking LED.</li>
            <li> First off, the photo of the trimmer is MISLEADING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works pretty well but causes difficulty when trying to cut areas of your beard closer when you use the trimmer without the adjustable guard.  </li>
            <li> I have tried various trimmers over the years and this one I just love.</li>
            <li> First, this review is strictly about this product as a stubble trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> first was the Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble</li>
            <li> Its my first trimmer that I didnt buy off some cheapo discount rack.</li>
            <li> the perk is ...that it vacuums your hair in the first place.</li>
            <li> take that into account, the comb did seem pretty uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it does with more routine maintenance of facial hair.</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco and I have been pleased with each trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth having this device for that purpose alone, because it isn&#x27;t very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard is pretty thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 18 mm trim length is one of the longest I&#x27;ve seen, and since I recently decided to grow my beard longer, I needed something that gave me more margin for error.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a vacume to catch extra hair, so I love it.  </li>
            <li> On time exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer itself works pretty well, including the vaccum feature that supposed to keep your sink and house from getting hair all over the place.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer that I use at least 3 times a week for my beard and hair.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, all the rest have the guide (as I have traditionally seen) wrap around the razors so that this issue doesn&#x27;t arise at any beard trim length you&#x27;re going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> height adjustment is solid and won&#x27;t be a problem / adjusting as you trim, but I still haven&#x27;t been able to get it to \\&quot;be</li>
            <li> Also there is one more version of the same brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first cordless trimmer</li>
            <li> Being able to assign numbers to trim levels can help you achieve the same look over and over.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> The battery so far has held up nicely and I rarely have to charge it...not like charging is a big deal anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately as I have to post the unit back to US from Canada, the postage fee will chew up most of the refund.</li>
            <li> Guarantee\\&quot; they will first make you wait 3 weeks</li>
            <li> make sure all your facial hair grows</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> Especially as it fills up more, the Turbo setting becomes more necessary.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> BUT, the reason for my 2-star rating is simple, it doesn&#x27;t retain it&#x27;s ability to cut for more than 1 month.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a beard trimmer and it lives up to expectations.</li>
            <li> the first one lasted over 5 years.  </li>
            <li> and I decided to let it charge overnight to make sure it would last the 5 days I&#x27;d be on the road.  </li>
            <li> However, the length is pretty &#x27;hit and miss&#x27;.</li>
            <li> it without any hesitation ;)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m no longer at the hotel</li>
            <li> I doubt you actually need the turbo-boost, so it might be better to save and get</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of trimmers and these really are one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> and I definitely prefer the one that most people on here complain that theirs did not come with.  </li>
            <li> Great readout of how long you have the clipper set to, the construction just feels sturdier than the Remington, it&#x27;s now in daily use for me.</li>
            <li> Some trimmers require you to charge first.</li>
            <li> I found myself using the comb on the lowest millimeter setting and finishing my entire beard after removing it just to be safe.</li>
            <li> I hope this will get better as I learn to use it differently</li>
            <li> First one sent was DOA.  </li>
            <li> The first one was DOA.</li>
            <li> recently I saw this \\&quot;updated\\&quot; model on sale and figured that maybe they&#x27;d improved the design, or that I&#x27;d just make doubly sure to treat this one with kid gloves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used this, I used the comb that came installed.</li>
            <li> I will always contact the manufacturer in the future to make sure the battery can be replaced, and if it can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll buy another brand.</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever owned (owned 4 in the past different brands).</li>
            <li> This My First trimmer</li>
            <li> (which is probably why they included it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> but not least a REALLY cool feature of this trimmer is it&#x27;s travel worthiness becuase</li>
            <li> It worked better when I only had a goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Works great until the door that holds in hair slowly chips away.</li>
            <li> The trap for the hairs really works and has saved a lot of cleaning time on the bathroom counter!</li>
            <li> Every time I use this trimmer it leaves a lot of hairs without being cut no matter how many times you retread at different angles.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco had the head attached with a hinge, which made it easy to clean but also completely removable if needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, considering how happy I had been with the performance of the T980, and my intended use of the trimmer for achieving stubble, I dismissed the negative reviews about trimming longer hair and purchased the trimmer anyway.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to clean, and tells you how much charge is left.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FIRST USE OF A BEARD TRIMMER .I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still very please with my purchase and would say it&#x27;s worth the $52.40 I paid on amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to maintain a longer length and not be contained to shorter lengths only for my beard.  </li>
            <li> My T980 has finally bit the dust after many years of reliable servers -</li>
            <li> the motor is louder and higher pitched.</li>
            <li> after just two months of moderate use the battery would not hold charge any more.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be unsatisfactory in many ways and sent it back for a refund after a couple of trials.</li>
            <li> After many different purchases that were not satisfactory, this razor hits the spot.</li>
            <li> First it was the LED number system</li>
            <li> Most outlets in China have the universal adapter face built-in already.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought that the contour trimming comb works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;Not able to do closer trimming and in smaller areas.</li>
            <li> The door for chamber seems more substantial than prior model.</li>
            <li> First time, Philips replaced it for me, no problems asked (hence 4 star review).</li>
            <li> this product is recommended to me and it performs exactly is it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> The adjustable head on this beard trimmer was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Not bad , but expected more.</li>
            <li> in all a good clipper, will see how it holds up over a few years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a fairly good capacity, and shaves well, although it may take a few passes if your hair doesn&#x27;t grow all in one direction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for a few months now and it is a good product even though learning curve wasn&#x27;t easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These trimmers are great they charge super quick and last for a considerable amount of time on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly, doesn&#x27;t leave a mess, feels very well made, is adjustable to a very precise degree, charges quickly, and</li>
            <li> Now I have little in the sink and most is in the trimmer for easy disposal in the trashcan.</li>
            <li> This shaver does an excellent job of trimming beards down to a wide range of lengths.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, only four starts because I was hoping for a bit more from the vacuum function--it gets about 80% of the hair, which is certainly better than nothing--</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my nephew who seemed to really like all the great features on it, especially the vacuum!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great - adjust in 1 mm increments, holds a charge a long time and the integrated vacuum feature is a hit with my wife.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased it, I was more interested in the trimming aspect; I had no interest in the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum works pretty well, catches most hair; probably about 80 to 90%.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works ok, better when the cut settings are low because it allows more hair to fall into the vacuum opening.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, adjusts to the height of the cut well and the vacuum is super!</li>
            <li> love this trimmer, gives me the look of that afternoon stubble all week long without any real maintenance...just a 1 min quick buzz in the morning.</li>
            <li> So all in all its probably the best and maybe the only vacuum trimmer on the market, norelco also makes another vacuum trimmer</li>
            <li> This replaces a Remington vacuum trimmer that died after many years.  </li>
            <li> But, the Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, sure does come close.</li>
            <li> vacuum mostly works -</li>
            <li> It does the job and the vacuum system works to a degree (better than nothing).  </li>
            <li> I have read before that beard groomers which feature a vacuum are nothing more than a gimmick.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works much better on this shaver than the 980.</li>
            <li> Love the vacuum, although it (of course) doesn&#x27;t catch everything.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a vacuum to catch the hair.</li>
            <li> I like the fact I&#x27;m able to change the heights of beard trimming &amp; vacuum system intake assemblage.</li>
            <li> The door to the vacuum storage is ok</li>
            <li> I received my QT4070 vacuum beard and was extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the vacuum system would be able to handle it.</li>
            <li> vacuum feature is more of a novelty than anything.</li>
            <li> I guess I have thicker beard hair than most, so the vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has a built-in vacuum to hold 99% of the hair.</li>
            <li> The vacuum does work, but mostly on shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Philips should work more on the vacuum part.</li>
            <li> The Vacuum is ok, as even with a day to day cut</li>
            <li> i love the length settings, tons of them, sets and holds well, holds a charge well, and the vacuum does suck up some of the hairs.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature worked better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Vacuum mostly works.</li>
            <li> Vacuum catches most the hairs.</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum it has on it</li>
            <li> In this model I would say 90% of the hair gets picked up from the vacuum and the turbo boost gives a much better trim.</li>
            <li> The vacuum makes up for it, but I need to use it on Turbo to collect most of the clippings.</li>
            <li> the vacuum is okay</li>
            <li> Bumping this up to four stars, with the fifth reserved with the hopes of one day having a better vacuum.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature collects about 75% of the hair, which is more than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The vacuum function could work a bit better.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works, and I&#x27;m glad to have it,</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature catches most of the clippings.  </li>
            <li> I love it with the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum on this product takes care of most of the whiskers you chop off.  </li>
            <li> and I love the vacuum</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is what convinced me to go for this one over the one with titanium blades (or whatever), and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> The vacuum does an okay job but some facial/body hair will still escape and have to be cleaned up.</li>
            <li> not terrible, and like the size thing, could be overlooked if the vacuum worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a life saver. :)</li>
            <li> Vacuum works ok.</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum.</li>
            <li> Love the vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t get all of the trimmings, but it gets most of them.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is more than just a gimmick.</li>
            <li> Vacuum collected most (not all) of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new Norelco since my old one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t suck up any where near as much as it should the guard at the top bends too easily when pressure is applied and it catches on my beard.</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice, even trim, blending different length cuts smoothly and precisely, and avoids the mess of whiskers falling all over the sink.</li>
            <li> and I love the vacuum!</li>
            <li> Love the vacuum!</li>
            <li> My main concern was that everyone said the trimmer cut their lip, but further comments said that the second (more traditional) guard was now supplied and so it was great.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, it works well, and seems powerful enough.</li>
            <li> It simply plowed through the beard like it was butter; super smooth, no nicks,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the super turbo mode (I guess if you have a REALLY burly beard?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mostly works OK, but cannot trim moustache near the nose, have to use other means.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brand in earlier grooming products and the current model is far superior!  </li>
            <li> Norelco even but in a second more powerful setting, but the standard power level works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> a full charge and brand new, you might get about 10 - 20</li>
            <li> This trimmer really doesn&#x27;t work at all if you try to use it without the guard, the angle just isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to speed up the general trim.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I see how it could easily snap off if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> As a man who&#x27;s been trimming his own beard/hair for the past decade (ladies, if you see a balding man at the hairstylist that man is quote obviously RICH given today&#x27;s prices for a trim)</li>
            <li> This has been problematic since I would often get lazy and let my scruff grow out and then trying to shave would not be a pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> Overall it seems like a very good design (I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a month)</li>
            <li> In general it&#x27;s great because before I had to deal with cleaning up a lot of hair in the sink and now the cleaning is very minimal.</li>
            <li> feel not as good as older model, vacuum less powerful or as easy to empty , but love quick charge and turbo feature.</li>
            <li> This particular one looks much sturdier and I really liked the fact it has a vacuum to it.  </li>
            <li> Norelco Beard Trimmer provides men the ability to maintain clean facial hair whether it&#x27;s a stubble, goatee, or full beard.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer now comes with the newer trim attachment which is apparently much better designed than the former large toothed attachment.</li>
            <li> Generally it&#x27;s working nice, but for me there some major problems:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Nice even cut and better than average short beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The longer setting is nice for other body hair as well.</li>
            <li> There the trimmer lies flat, waiting for a more dignified home.</li>
            <li> You make ask yourself why I don&#x27;t just use hair clippers but the other nice feature on this is the vaccum.</li>
            <li> days after I originally purchased the trimmer (10 days after the guarantee ended), I got an automated email from Philips asking me to complete a survey and product review.</li>
            <li> Bought this one because of all the listed features, the other reviews made it seem like a nice trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other thing I will say is while the vacuumm feature is nice</li>
            <li> It has a flat top which is a separate piece that pivots on a spring-loaded hinge.  </li>
            <li> the the vibration was of this trimmer, given how powerful and effective this little trimmer is.</li>
            <li> But I clean it over the trashcan now, instead of sending all the hair down the sink, so that&#x27;s better for the plumbing.</li>
            <li> It fits in the hand nicely and hardly makes any sound when turned on.</li>
            <li> The neat part about the vacuum is that it pulls the hair away from your skin, which actually makes it easier to get a good shave on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As some have mentioned, the standard comb for this trimmer isn&#x27;t great, but as mentioned in some other more recent reviews, mine in fact came with both.  </li>
            <li> They added a big bright digital display.  </li>
            <li> Which is great, but be careful of the door that you open when dumping the hair.</li>
            <li> Well, to everyone&#x27;s Great surprise, I left the bathroom looking like a drowned, mangy, disease ridden mutt.</li>
            <li> It is easy to empty and clean.  </li>
            <li> It charges very quickly and holds its charge for sometime, enough for multiple uses over more than a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously though, I&#x27;ve used other trimmers that are no longer available which had better vacuum suction, but since those are no longer available, just buy this one and wipe the sink.</li>
            <li> When I used my old trimmer (4 setting), a lot would come off and my beard would look clean and even.</li>
            <li> i take it off completely as i like a clean shave, so its a nonissue.</li>
            <li> trim length dial was convenient and easy to use, and having the digital length value was a plus, but this was only mildly better than the manual adjustment I have on my existing trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loud has hell ( wife hates it)&lt;br /&gt;- not washable which i think is a deal breaker as it is tricky to clean after use.</li>
            <li> buut razor usually takes 2&#x27;3 passes over a given area to get good consistent trimming.</li>
            <li> While I love this product, I found that it was missing something important.</li>
            <li> You used to also be able to get a much closer shave with that attachment, and I would use that for my final pass.  </li>
            <li> I found this one to hold it&#x27;s setting better and really like the digital battery readout.</li>
            <li> Only real difference is the turbo mode and it&#x27;s sexy look.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer works very well, love the ability to adjust the height to all the different lengths.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to purchase the current product for fear it would not be any better.  </li>
            <li> have a beard trimmer from braun that lasted for longer than I can remember, but the battery is dead and I was looking for more precise trimming settings, so  </li>
            <li> To clean it out I take it outside and give it a quick blow with the leaf blower.</li>
            <li> The QT4070 does come with the contour following comb, which is truly the best of the two comb options for me at least.  </li>
            <li> But it really fell short in many ways which is why i had to return this product.</li>
            <li> Some guys in here really know their stuff about these, so read their reviews for more technical details.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a beard trimmer from braun that lasted for longer than I can remember, but the battery is dead and I was looking for more precise trimming settings, so I thought it&#x27;s time for a change.</li>
            <li> The trimmer with length guide is better than the combs and will help the overall performance of the unit as a whole.</li>
            <li> Not too loud but then again with that kind of power you want it to be silent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal stiffer and doesn&#x27;t seem to flex enough to get down to the level it&#x27;s supposed to to let the blade cut right.</li>
            <li> The older unit had a little basket that pulled out, which also had screens on the side of the basket, keeping the airflow going, so it would vaccuum effectively until full.  </li>
            <li> And it does collect shavings very nicely, very easy to empty.</li>
            <li> this is very easy to use, a well made product for the money spent.  </li>
            <li> More power, better vacuum feature, ability to use it plugged in if battery is low (older model didn&#x27;t allow that).</li>
            <li> Maybe this is typical of all such trimmers, or maybe I have to practice more, but I can&#x27;t recommend it as a stand alone option to good old scissors!</li>
            <li> At best, it might be a 50% reduction in mess, but more likely it is somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 - 30% less hair falling to the sink/floor</li>
            <li> The thing that amazed me about this model is how much lighter it is, but with more suction on the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum suction isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> The vacuum mechanism worked reasonably well and sucked up most of the hair cuttings (about 80%).  </li>
            <li> The battery life is good, lasting me multiple shaves (I haven&#x27;t counted exactly, but I really only trim once a week, so I imagine I could easily go over a month without charging).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I really did love the QT4070 as a trimmer and for its vacuum function.</li>
            <li> Suction is okay, you still have mess to clean.</li>
            <li> So overall the product seems to be of reasonable quality and does exactly what it says it does, trims all kinds of hair safely and without too much hair dropping on the floor.</li>
            <li> I liked the old T980 little better, but for me the new Qt4070 is functionally equivalent.</li>
            <li> The vacuum option was a great idea, but it is make shaving more difficult specially if you remove the cap.</li>
            <li> this will be great but there are many other trimmers that will do just as good for half the price and have better cutting accessories.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works good but remember you are buying a trimmer with a vacuum not a Hoover with a trimmer.</li>
            <li> The bay is easily accessed, if not slightly difficult to open without fingernails.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of listening to the positive reviews on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The depth control locks positively through a wider range of adjustment than I think I will ever need.  </li>
            <li> have nothing but positive things to say about this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I know there is a lot of positive feedback (it fooled me</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was a positive experience since they made a no-hassle warranty replacement of the unit.</li>
            <li> It vacuums up the hair as I use it with no mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li> No mess or clean up when you are finished shaving.  </li>
            <li> I still shave standing in the shower so that there&#x27;s absolutely no mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> The vacume catches about every hair and there is no mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> No mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> I always had to clean up a little hair afterwards and a bit more</li>
            <li> Every time I use it I have to either grab a scissors or an older trimmer that did come with the right attachment to finish up the job.</li>
            <li> My first pass left a fair bit of hair in the sink, but this is partially because I filled up the vacuum chamber quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I always use the higher level as I don&#x27;t see any reason not to and it really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cutting action is excellent and precise.    </li>
            <li> This works pretty well for trimming your beard, but doesn&#x27;t work very well for edging or on your head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> it is pretty much just what I needed.</li>
            <li> So sure, the battery died during a long period of non use and no charge.</li>
            <li> i would say it&#x27;s my first one, but Nevertheless - i&#x27;m very Satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The end result looks pretty much like I used a cheese grater</li>
            <li> Charge-up time is pretty fast</li>
            <li> I have bought it for gifts for other people because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> Pretty much as advertised.</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because it does exactly what it is described to do, and does it very well.</li>
            <li> first when I started using it, I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> Other than a smaller chamber for hair that requires emptying far more frequently, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> It is a pretty reasonable trimmer i found.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t just that it&#x27;ll trim while it charges, but it&#x27;ll run on any voltage just like pretty much all cell phone and laptop power supplies.  </li>
            <li> The charging cycle is so long (use &#x3D; 2-3 x per week), that I don’t know how many MONTHS it goes between charges.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I do not know if it is just a fluke that it was included with mine, so be ready to take a gamble on it if you need it.</li>
            <li> When I first got this it worked very well for about 3 months</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good stubble shaver, so as usual I go to amazon to get opinions.</li>
            <li> had good luck with Philips Norelco in the past.</li>
            <li> The vacuum actually works really well in it, and it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> With the adjustable length attachment on it, it&#x27;s nearly possible to get the right angle to get it to even cut any hairs at all!!</li>
            <li> the vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch all hairs, but most, which is more than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> The best part is the vacuum feature where I have not had to clean up a single mess.</li>
            <li> This was as advertised and when used was sharp and the vacuum worked great.  </li>
            <li> At best, there is SLIGHTLY less hair in the sink compared to a typical beard trimmer or hair clipper.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one I have owned, the first one worked fine, however, the  plastic clip where the beard hair is caught, broke, necessitating the replacement.</li>
            <li> My husband says he&#x27;s never used a better trimmer and is thankful to be rid of an older model he&#x27;s held on to for the last decade!</li>
            <li> It shaves down to a nice &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; length.</li>
            <li> My last Norelco trimmer died and I purchased the QT4070 and it is better than the older model I had.</li>
            <li> After more than 10 years using a Braun Exact 6 Universal, I was in the need of a new beard trimmer because Braun discontinued the supply of spare parts(battery and blades) for this model.</li>
            <li> It gets it down to a fine stubble, but for a smooth neck you&#x27;ll need an additional razor.</li>
            <li> I consider that to be a positive thing though, as an easy open hatch would be prone to opening by mistake.</li>
            <li> While they may not have a vacuum to clean up the trimmings, they wont leave you wishing that the vacuum they did have was doing more then just blowing hot air!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> many different sizes 1-10 that lights up in a nice big red LED</li>
            <li> While there is no mention of this practice in the accompanying literature, nor does Philips Norelco endorse or mention such use of this trimmer for that anywhere on their website that I can find, it is still a very capable tool that I have found fit for the job.    </li>
            <li> I bought it after reading a number of reviews on a number of different sites and came to the conclusion that it was one of the most highly recommended products in it price range.  </li>
            <li> I think they figured that the vacuum being better was the main thing and on paper,</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers I was replacing an older model Norelcom vacuum trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I was especially interested about its integrated vacuum system, one of the main reason for choosing this model.</li>
            <li> the vacuum chaimber saves the need for laborious clean up while the option for plug-in electrical or battery powered operation offer a choice of powerful operation modes.</li>
            <li> Pretty hard getting a good stubble with this.</li>
            <li> The width of the blade area is more than sufficient for face and other areas (more on that later).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a stubble trimmer, and I was reluctant to buy this one after reading all of the reviews, but there really wasn&#x27;t any other great option, so I finally just bit the bullet and ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> Its a really good trimmer, but like many other wrote the door to the vaccum chamber broke after a few months so that feature is gone.</li>
            <li> I mean, it gets a majority of the hair, which is nice, but you still have to clean the sink.</li>
            <li> If you use it correctly and know the right length to trim everything down to then this trimmer can be very accurate at giving you an even shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer, replaces my old Norelco, but many more features.&lt;br /&gt;Large digital height indicator prevents stupid mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Cuts perfectly even and the vacuum function actually works (my old one had a vacuum also</li>
            <li> The vacuum is an excellent feature that completely eliminates the mess I had to deal with while trimming my beard and mustache with an older trimmer.</li>
            <li> The battery power is also very decent with option of plugging in and using as well.</li>
            <li> This also means that I cannot easily trim my upper lip, since my nose blocks the front edge of the guide.    </li>
            <li> It opens easy with just a finger nail to open the door.</li>
            <li> It took a lot of arguing about it before he agreed, so beware, its not so easy as \\&quot;an extra step\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> cleaning is easy and the fact that it has no door is nitpicking in my opinion,  I open it, shake it and brush it</li>
            <li> doesnt get everything but enough to make cleanup really easy.</li>
            <li> It has a very decent battery and lasts quite awhile without a charge.  </li>
            <li> Easy to open and</li>
            <li> Smaller cutter teeth don&#x27;t pinch and cut skin as easy (not recommended for your privates without the guard).  </li>
            <li> This is a nice upgrade to my previous Philips Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> First girl could not tell me anything but try to give me a coupon to get me to buy it from them, finally got a supervisor who confirmed the contour comb for beards is NOT included.  </li>
            <li> Works really well with several improvements over the older version that I&#x27;ve had for many years.  </li>
            <li> easy to use though with the mm specific dial,</li>
            <li> Makes getting various lengths easy</li>
            <li> when i trim the long part of my beard it works quiete well,  if the battery did not start dying so fast,  the vaccume probably gets95% or more of the hair.</li>
            <li> I had a previous model of this trimmer and really liked it.</li>
            <li> The compartment is easily removable and placed back with ease.</li>
            <li> and * definitely* found that the normal guard was better for me.  </li>
            <li> like that the collection part is now hinged so easy to open.</li>
            <li> The Phillips website says \\&quot;Contour following comb for a precise and even trim\\&quot; as the first line of the highlights for the QT4070.</li>
            <li> The digital display is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This definitely does the trick &amp; easy for him to use.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to return this and get my money back, but neither Amazon nor Philips make it easy to return this for a refund.</li>
            <li> I own the two previous models.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of nice adjustable trimmers out there for half this price.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product, better than any other vacuum clipper on the market.</li>
            <li> Digital length indicator makes it easy to set and verify length, even without my reading glasses</li>
            <li> The motor is strong enough to cut even the thickest hair in one pass.</li>
            <li> And the vacuum function really does capture a good deal of the clippings, making a lot of a mess to clean up in the sync.</li>
            <li> Battery charge is long enough and over all the unit is of good quality</li>
            <li> Battery seems to last a good long time.</li>
            <li> This new one improves on every single element of that one, which is rare for most products, so I had to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> The vacuum definitely catches some trimmed hairs but there are many that are not caught and you still have to clean the sink after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> It is large and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this item purely based on the feedbacks.</li>
            <li> This one certainly isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> Kinda large for trimming a mustache</li>
            <li> After seeing the product in person, that is pure fiction.  </li>
            <li> It helps, certainly, but does not have the strength to catch everything</li>
            <li> Making this user-replaceable would have been smart.</li>
            <li> It certainly does what it is made to do.</li>
            <li> As others have stated there is a large gap between the blades and the housing of the trimmer</li>
            <li> but I think they may have changed that since my one certainly did; i.e. I received both trimmer guides in the box.  </li>
            <li> The noise level is certainly acceptable.</li>
            <li> The size is somewhat large for a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It has a large gap in the combs across the front of the trimmer blades, which just looks like a disaster waiting to happen.  </li>
            <li> I would buy this again and certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Like others said, if you angle the Stock trimmer head a certain direction it can jab you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It has certainly helped.</li>
            <li> so it stabs you and allows certain areas to trim too closely.  </li>
            <li> Two separate heads - one for getting close to the skin for a stubble appearance and the other to extend outward to trim your beard &amp; stache - even gives a clean smooth haircut.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it now comes with two heads, the sharper of which is not bad and the other is just fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The included double-ended cleaning brush seems suited for the task of brushing out the screen in the vacuum debris chamber, but also looks as though it will be easy to lose.  </li>
            <li> The beard remains uneven no matter how many times you go over it but wait!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vacuum is ok if you are using it for stubble or short beard, but it you are using full beard expect hair to be present in your sink</li>
            <li> it captures all the trimmings in a nice compartment and avoids the mess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars because it does a nice job of minimizing the mess; but it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum option makes  for easy beard and hair disposal................</li>
            <li> The vacuum stopped working very quickly.</li>
            <li> trims beard and mustache easily and the vacuum works.</li>
            <li> apparently wasn&#x27;t included in original release)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And to have the vacuum built in so that all the hairs are easy to dispose of when you are done shaving and trimming.</li>
            <li> The vacuum suction is strong, although when I use it on &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; some bits of hair do flick out of the comb.</li>
            <li> stars only because of the stiffness of the beard guide, but even that is something I can live with, and I hope it gets more flexible with use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, my wife bought me a new one for Christmas last year, and in my opinion, it is better in every way but one than the 980.  </li>
            <li> But compared to my previous trimmer which left stubble all over my sink and surrounding areas, it works great.</li>
            <li> all that i thought it would be but still worth the price since it easily adjusts to a wide variety of lenghts of trim</li>
            <li> I was so loyal to Norelco for the success of the T980 that I bought this product in an instant without thinking about it - what a mistake!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold in the hand, narrow and light and maneuverable.  </li>
            <li> So you have a date, and you need to trim that wild mountain man beard down to something that looks more civilized?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really strong and fast, and doesn&#x27;t jam like smaller trimmers do.</li>
            <li> This is by far superior then the previous model.  </li>
            <li> It easily trims to a variety of lengths, and the battery last much longer than you&#x27;ll probably need it to.  </li>
            <li> The unit charges quickly and has a useful digital battery indicator.</li>
            <li> The trimmer helps my beard trimmed tight and nice.  </li>
            <li> First off having a nice solid plastic body will be a plus, as there aren&#x27;t the metal grates anymore to get bent and rub against the vacuum motor blades.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected good quality ear trimmer with the  vacuum</li>
            <li> this trimmer is great if you like 5 different options to get the same exact length beard: really short stubble.</li>
            <li> Just great, except that the vacuum feature is far from adequate to avoid a mess on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> : it provides a decent, consistent trim, charge lasts a long time, it charges quickly, good adjustment function/display, vacuum function works reasonably well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this Norelco trimmer sooner as it functions slightly better than the Panasonic with its vacuum and because the guard locks in place with the turn of the dial (the Panasonic&#x27;s guard would get bumped out of place sometimes, although I think they also have a new model with a dial to fix that).  </li>
            <li> I would say it is even better than the old Norelco, as I sometimes would get a nick on setting one with the old trimmer, and I&#x27;ve not nicked anything on any setting with the new trimmer.    </li>
            <li> The new one is &#x27;space aged&#x27; compared to the 2005 model and clearly retains the attributes of a good product.</li>
            <li> The convenient read out when adjusting the comb head makes trimming different parts of my beard (that might require slightly different lengths) easy and accurate.</li>
            <li> It will charge, trim and travel just fine though you may spend some extra time cleaning it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may work just fine for people with a 3/4\\&quot; beard or longer, but do not attempt to achieve an even, short look with this model.  </li>
            <li> I have successfully replaced batteries on their shavers, but their other products are essentially impossible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regular mode, you&#x27;re probably fine, but I always use Turbo for my beard.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Vacuum needs slightly longer beards, but was great for trimming when I grew me beard out while camping.</li>
            <li> However, I feel that the trim is much more consistent than other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> I think the standard comb works fine for 3mm stubble trim.</li>
            <li> That may not seem like a big difference, and that&#x27;s probably why the product pre-testing made Norelco think this trimmer was fine...</li>
            <li> Does a fine job overall.</li>
            <li> It usually barely doesn&#x27;t get charged all the way from the time it takes me to trim, then clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li> As for myself, I don&#x27;t necessarily need that fine of an adjustment</li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears from many, many previous reviews that this trimmer had arrived with only  \\&quot;Stubble\\&quot; trimmer\\&quot;, and not the \\&quot;Contour\\&quot; trimmer.  </li>
            <li> you only plan to use this for a year, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Once you pop off the comb, you just can&#x27;t get close enough to do that fine tuning you would expect from a trimmer.</li>
            <li> 4 years ago I bought an older version of this as my first amazon prime purchase.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does...give a nice stubble, but there is no clean line trimmer on it</li>
            <li> this is a very high quality beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> For me this was not a problem it is a very high quality product</li>
            <li> Since she couldn&#x27;t get me the part, she&#x27;s now shipping me a full new trimmer, brand new, in the box.  </li>
            <li> if tight trims aren&#x27;t important to you this is otherwise a fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li> It holds it&#x27;s charge for a veryyyy long time, it feels sturdy and well made in your hand, the LED light is bright and clear, showing you which trim setting you are using, and the vacuum traps nearly all of the hair you have trimmed.</li>
            <li> Adjust to different size is also easy and the digital display is pretty cool to look at.</li>
            <li> To get a good and even result, it is best to trim the same areas from at least 3 or 4 different directions, as the comb is not very fine and doesn&#x27;t catch all the hair.</li>
            <li> The position displayed on the little screen is a nice plus.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer, but the little latch that holds the trimmings broke after a month.</li>
            <li> The adjustable length option is nice but a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> I do love the vacuum feature that provides adequate suction to get the massive majority of the hair.  </li>
            <li> A nice little beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I encourage you to give it a try and experiment a little to find your own technique to deliver the results you want.</li>
            <li> I have this trimmer since last summer, it works fine and does it&#x27;s job very well, reason I give it 2 stars is battery life, which lasts 10 minutes maximum, with turbo on 5 minutes</li>
            <li> but it might be fine for someone who just wants to keep a very short stubble.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do in an efficient, quiet and clean manner.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s always so worried about making a mess in the bathroom, so I thought this vacuum shaver would be a great idea.</li>
            <li> and the vacuum works great at keeping mess to a minimum.</li>
            <li> also very good buy cant go wrong with this</li>
            <li> It greatly reduces the mess thanks to the vacuum, but does not get 100% of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> vacuum, finely adjustable increments, cordless --</li>
            <li> The trimmers head is good for trimming but if you want to get a clost buzz, you have to work hard to get the angle of the trimmers blade to your face.</li>
            <li> The large plastic guard does make it challenging to trim directly under your nose and line up my sideburns, but it is doable by using the unit and specific angles.</li>
            <li> The adjustable height is nice for trimming facial hair to a uniform height and the vacuum is effective at capturing the majority of the hair and not leaving a mess in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> (I have been using a Philips shaver for many years and never had a problem with it - this one seems a little bit more fragile because of the LED display, but still looks solid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer, but the vacuum function does leave a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t apply pressure, the trimmer just glides on top of my beard, not cutting anything; if I do apply pressure, the tines warp and I get an uneven trim.    </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great trimmer but on the lower levels it can leave my beard looking somewhat uneven.  </li>
            <li> The QT4070 is a huge improvement:  Congrats to Norelco for finally employing rechargeable battery technology that isnn&#x27;t obsolete by the time the trimmer leaves the factory.  </li>
            <li> accept that it vacuums up the hair which is really not that amazing of a feature because of how loud it is because of the suction.</li>
            <li> The battery and length display are a huge plus, and take the guesswork out of how much battery is left or if it is locked into the correct setting.</li>
            <li> Recommend 1) pulling off the cutters and tapping out the hair after every trim and 2) more thorough cleaning of the motorized parts (with a rag or something) and adding fresh lithium grease every few months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cost that much.  </li>
            <li> You were very helpful and spot on.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the feedback.</li>
            <li> I really like the features</li>
            <li> He said it does not cut or hurt him and it also goes over dimples and curve lines gently.</li>
            <li> not so much mustaches...</li>
            <li> works really well</li>
            <li> This makes the teeth be uncovered on one side and cuts the beard to a much shorter trim.</li>
            <li> and it cut really close.    </li>
            <li> you need to look around the web when ordering - really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Will cover whole head on 1 charge or whole body ymmv.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-no real 0 setting, have to use a razor to trim non-hair zones</li>
            <li> Nothing is going to get 100% of the hairs, but this one does really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really see the point of \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode, but having it there doesn&#x27;t hurt anything.</li>
            <li> From now on I&#x27;ll be more careful.</li>
            <li> This provides a precise cut to those who require such precision (not me).  </li>
            <li> Excellent cutting blade, as you would expect</li>
            <li> I like how it puffs out my beard as a real beard.</li>
            <li> Very well implemented.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased the QT4070 this evening and after using it I&#x27;m absolutely dismayed at the design of the guard.</li>
            <li> I did not have to speak to a supervisor as some others have had to do, and the whole process took about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Probably would opt for a lower-end device if I were to repurchase as there really isn&#x27;t much difference.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacume door is ready to break very disapointing  </li>
            <li> I save so much time now with pro results.  </li>
            <li> It has more length settings and cuts very well and the MM length display is much more useful then a dial with meaningless numbers on it.</li>
            <li> The problem is basically a gap on the front side of the trimmer that doesn&#x27;t keep the blade away from your face like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the comb has very plasticy, flimsy feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> In my opinion, a precision trimmer isn&#x27;t too much to ask for considering the price and the issue with the contour comb</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t demand much from a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Thanks to reviewers here</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand.  </li>
            <li> Why they don&#x27;t automatically provide this comb to anyone who wants it is beyond me.</li>
            <li> Given that without part #422203617711, this is a faulty product that puts the customer in danger of hurting himself, a responsible company should have taken this product off the market.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather just trim in the shower where I don&#x27;t have to worry about it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist I expected a bit more.</li>
            <li> Within an hour the trimmer was fully charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Worked 3 times, now I get a yellow flashing light when I attempt to turn it on.</li>
            <li> If I wasn&#x27;t paying attention, the guide would drop two lengths and I&#x27;d end up with a much shorter cut than I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about the guide, and haven&#x27;t really had any issues.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, get about 85% of the hair.</li>
            <li> Straight up no BS review.  </li>
            <li> The charger works well and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;They took some steps forward with this design but the gap in the comb(s) is a real issue for me.  </li>
            <li> : Minus one more star - This design is terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the package it looks like a real quallity product..</li>
            <li> The blades on this one, for some reason, really aggravate my skin.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is being precise, which is what you want with a beard trimmer goes out the window.  </li>
            <li> The recipient said it worked very well</li>
            <li> However, after years of use it no longer held a charge for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Not so much.     </li>
            <li> It does make the shaving experience much cleaner n</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t have the turbo feature or the \\&quot;best trimmer on the market\\&quot;, but you will not run the risk of stabbing yourself as one reviewer has said.</li>
            <li> Is that really too much to ask?  </li>
            <li> It works but you can&#x27;t really always achieve the length you select.  </li>
            <li> Once it was ready to go</li>
            <li> I disconnected the charging cord, followed the instructions, put on the Trimming Comb, set the length I wanted to try, and was ready to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Really vacuums all the hair, leaves no dirt</li>
            <li> The charge has held very well and the product still works just like out of the box.  </li>
            <li> my choice would have been much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So the straight razor came out...</li>
            <li> but she also wants to ravage me every time she enters the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I like the variance in the settings and the fast recharge time.</li>
            <li> The comb it comes with was absolute junk and messed up my beard.  </li>
            <li> The LED screen battery indicator is very usfeull.</li>
            <li> Really, what else can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Despite the name, the QT4070 really isn&#x27;t a mustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately Amazon&#x27;s return policy allows me to send it back</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do much).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues using the blade guard for trimming body hair- works very well.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d estimate 1.5mm is the absolute minimum.  </li>
            <li> Charges fast.</li>
            <li> As someone who wears his hair at a stubble look, this is very welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stock non-floating guide that comes with this unit does indeed appear like you should be more careful</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the features, but I wish it had interchangeable heads.  </li>
            <li> So for me this product works really well.</li>
            <li> a trimmer it works very well, but you will be using rubber bands and duct tape to hold it together.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not shaving well.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to many shaving rounds and then use another machine to achieve the expected result.</li>
            <li> Knowing now what I do, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with a stubble capable trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It charges reasonably</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it really does not do a &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t even really suck in hair to help trim</li>
            <li> (though helps a bit)&lt;br /&gt;  attachment comb is to coarse\wide so don&#x27;t really separate hairs well</li>
            <li> What I really needed was a beard and mustache trimmer</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Panasonic ER224S.  </li>
            <li> What would it have taken to design the bottom of the unit so it stands up straight?</li>
            <li> thanks alot, Norelco.    4)</li>
            <li> I got a lot of quality mileage out of it and was very please.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even shave very close.  </li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t say much about the travel lock</li>
            <li> I also found that it didn&#x27;t make much difference how I held the unit against my skin.</li>
            <li> The AC unit is very compact too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vacuuming doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I really like this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> However the lid for the compartment that collects the hair is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> The hair catcher doesn&#x27;t work very well, so I end up cleaning up the hairs after every shave anyways, and the lengths are very inconsistent.</li>
            <li> I want it to be uniform, the blade guard is supposed to protect you from trimming to much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the swinging door design as much as I like the \\&quot;hair cup\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It does pick up about 80% of your hair, but you&#x27;ll still be cleaning up the remaining 20%, so it really doesn&#x27;t save you much</li>
            <li> Not anymore, thanks to this Lege&#x27;.</li>
            <li> and it can go from a very close stubble to much longer.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with cheaper trimmers for years and never got a quality trim without really working at it....  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their stubble.</li>
            <li> the suction on the vacumn really works.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the digital display showed shorter than the actual setting so if this is some kind of &amp;#34;computer glitch&amp;#34; you will not cut your beard to short.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Latch on the shaving compartment is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Now I have a rubber band to hold the door shut - a poor solution for what was supposed to be a great razor.</li>
            <li> My son loves the Beard trimmer so much, I&#x27;ll be ordering one for my husband.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I bought a Phillips trimmer with a cheap Remington one in between.</li>
            <li> I do not use this very often now.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It feels cheap, especially compared to the Wahl Lithium Pro Mini I tried at my salon (although that cost 4x as much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Unit shows flashing yellow light pushing power on button.&lt;br /&gt;Unit</li>
            <li> I wish the blades could have been designed to be pushed up, so that the blades can get in really close, but no dice.</li>
            <li> This shaver absolutely rocks.  </li>
            <li> This unit was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> but it really works.</li>
            <li> get a very even cut with this</li>
            <li> That would have been the humane response, and would have made me a much happier consumer of this product.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t trim very well, really.  </li>
            <li> Now the battery is much weaker and lasts 1 maybe 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> The number of depth settings makes it very versatile.</li>
            <li> The position and length stay very well.</li>
            <li> If a longer beard was my look, I would really like this device.</li>
            <li> if their job was really even intended to be helpful to customers and he said his job was really just to deflect complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will shape up every beard  and will do it fast.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a groomer at a reasonable price point with some added features, go ahead and buy this thing.</li>
            <li> battery lasts well and the power cord and connection is very well</li>
            <li> Lesson learned I empty it more often</li>
            <li> The display is very helpful, showing you charge status as well as length settings.  </li>
            <li> very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was really a bonus feature for me.</li>
            <li> That is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> you want a very closely trimmed bear</li>
            <li> I really like it, but the numbers started getting offset.</li>
            <li> Does the job but very noisy while running.  </li>
            <li> I was very please by the changes that were made.  </li>
            <li> The whole item is plastic except the blade and motor.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This seems like a very solidly-made trimmer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much hyped expectations either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charge life is very lengthy and I didn&#x27;t find myself bringing the charger onto trips with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After almost six months using it twice a week, the charge light turned yellow today, so I plugged it in to recharge.  </li>
            <li> I like the adjustability of the shaver and it has both of the snap on guides, so earlier criticism is no longer justified.  </li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly and has numerous features.</li>
            <li> I tried to use some trimmer oil on it and that was a mistake, as it created more drag on the blades.  </li>
            <li> Philips/Norelco customer service was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> they say this part is back ordered and have no estimate when the part will be available.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to remember 10 than &#x27;was it up one notch or two?&#x27;</li>
            <li> This Beard Trimmer is absolute junk.</li>
            <li> I have never had any problems with the unit, and it has functioned very well.</li>
            <li> I charged it again until the light went out and it that charged lasted through three ten minute trimmings and still had two bars.</li>
            <li> Bottom-line is this product is not market ready, nor does it perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and although i broke the plastic part that holds the door close it still keeps the door close haha</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> really disapointed..</li>
            <li> The material is very light-weight.  </li>
            <li> It worked as expected for me, and in fact, I have never used a better trimmer ever.</li>
            <li> Tank-solid product, very functional features....</li>
            <li> shipped very rapidly so it truly helped take it overseas for my cousin.</li>
            <li> But you don&#x27;t really need that feature anyway.  </li>
            <li> my wife really likes this model because it doesn&#x27;t drop my hair trimmings all over the bathroom counter</li>
            <li> Works very well for me..</li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> I did reduce the hair spillage, just not as much as I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise as nice as the shaver seemed folks were really giving it awful reviews while their were slightly more good ones.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li> This thing works fantastic, as advertised (actually does .5mm trim) to give you the permament 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use Turbo much now.  </li>
            <li> bag would have been appreciated.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I would not expect much styling with this.</li>
            <li> It cuts fast without ant &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t cut the hair, very well.</li>
            <li> the company wants, I can send a picture of my face, after shaving.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li> and I was ready to attack my Geico caveman lookalike face.</li>
            <li> Along the way, whole clumps of hair would stick to the shaver blades</li>
            <li> i just think you have to be gentle while doing it that sort</li>
            <li> I have almost spent $50 on this but trust me even a $10 trimmer can do a better job than this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Actually better then expected.</li>
            <li> i bought Phillips norelco qt4070 for  my boyfriend and he really loves it.he keeps his  beard</li>
            <li> Went very short and was smooth leaving no hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> Even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts MUCH longer than the T980.</li>
            <li> So that makes the whole job quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> I would buy this again and would recommend it for anyone who wants stubble.</li>
            <li> thanks to person who commented and helped me correct my error.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;u need to think that will not collect 100%, maybe 95%, and it is very dependent of the trimming direction,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> since they have done away with the one he really likes.</li>
            <li> The spacing between the guard and the clippers makes it very ahrd to do some areas.</li>
            <li> Having this separate blade really makes a difference trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li> He let me see if the guide he had [#422203617711] fit my qt4070 and low and behold it did.</li>
            <li> So much for the 1st customer service guy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> The whole built-in-vacuum thing just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping time...</li>
            <li> Looks cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> This razor not only has the best ergonomic shape for holding behind your head, but it is lightweight and the integrated vacuuming really keeps trimmings from flying all over the place while you buzz.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> fast ship and as described</li>
            <li> you have a trimmer you like to use or like to use a razor or straight edge to line your beard or goatee</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer because I prefer to have short stubble vs. a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this thing</li>
            <li> I really like this thing.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Philips replaced it for me free of charge but now the second one wont hold a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> It does what it is advertised to do, and  it does it very well.</li>
            <li> The window for the hair container was no longer able to be kept closed after about 3 months.</li>
            <li> Really Norelco</li>
            <li> It is also a real pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> really like it</li>
            <li> Speed control is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very well constructed.</li>
            <li> Cuts very evenly with one or two passes.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight trimmer.</li>
            <li> The combs are very flexible, so if you press it against your face, the teeth will flex</li>
            <li> and you will end up with a much shorter beard that you had intended.</li>
            <li> very dissapoointed from this purchase</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very usefull.</li>
            <li> DOES ITS INTENDED USE VERY WELL...</li>
            <li> but it is also very noisy</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really use it much.</li>
            <li> This combined with the D-Finer Precision Trimmer, and I effectively spent $50 more than planned, but feel like a pro. Trade-offs...</li>
            <li> have help up very well.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t charge quite as fast as it spends battery power.  </li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am saying thanks to Amazon ...</li>
            <li> Very uniform.</li>
            <li> Really like this product-</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is that it indicated free shipping, but when I used the $5 discount coupon I got charged $6.95 for shipping.</li>
            <li> there was still way too much stubble all over the sink.</li>
            <li> The cutter works very well,.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it regularly and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> and I get a very even trim.  </li>
            <li> Makes the task of shaving much easier then getting out the cream and the Gillette.</li>
            <li> so I like to trim it without paying too much attention to detail.</li>
            <li> It is, however, a nightmare for those who are looking for a product capable of doing intricate beard designs and so on.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves his trimmer and really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> The trimming compartment fills up with one shave, so some people may need to empty the compartment more than once in a shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> Norelco Beard Trimmer retails at 49.99 and provides an efficient and fast trim.  </li>
            <li> it is much easier to use and keep charged.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Really like this product would recommend</li>
            <li> From the reviews I expected more.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does all that the ad said and it is done much easier than the ad leaves us to believe.  </li>
            <li> He looks very well groomed now and on Christmas Eve he was looking at another one at a store we were at</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> This leads to cleaning the chamber very often.</li>
            <li> The one I have cannot, and the whole thing had to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Battery recharges fast</li>
            <li> I really like the trimmer-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine turning on turbo it in real life use.&lt;br /&gt;Update of 4/23/13&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They appear to have cost reduced the feature to the point where it no longer really works.  </li>
            <li> Too much hassle to return.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable trim length is very functional and works very well.</li>
            <li> and i really didnt think it would, but it saves me a lot of mess.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> Considering he is very opinionated on everything I buy, this is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> REALLY?  </li>
            <li> get real people...</li>
            <li> Thanks Phillips and thanks Amazon for allowing me to purchase one.</li>
            <li> The actual device feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> and it cut much closer.</li>
            <li> Shame really.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The QT4070 looks very sleek.</li>
            <li> It does work very well.</li>
            <li> BUT THE REAL TEST WAS HOW IT WORKED .IT</li>
            <li> I found when I tried to go fast over longer areas</li>
            <li> so much I bought another</li>
            <li> The block shape keeps it from rolling around so much as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Turbo mode doesn&#x27;t help much either.</li>
            <li> If you put it in Turbo mode, then it&#x27;s a bit noisy but not so much.</li>
            <li> what it&#x27;s worth, I replaced this product with the Norelco Multigroom 3100, which I have found to be completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> But the real kicker was when the battery died.</li>
            <li> So much for cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HE loves it as much as I do.....</li>
            <li> REALLY?</li>
            <li> very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before this problem I was ready to purchase one for a friend.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this thing.</li>
            <li> than that the trimmer works well, and I highly recommend for travel!</li>
            <li> trimming guide is marked in inches and mm with nearly 20 different positions so you&#x27;ll be able to maintain your beard at whatever length you prefer.</li>
            <li> I own another trimmer manufactured by this same company, and it simply doesn&#x27;t perform as well.</li>
            <li> The two stars are for nice cutting, quieter operation, and nice display of length and battery charge.</li>
            <li> Good cutting power, especially on Turbo, good battery</li>
            <li> The adjustable length is quite nice as well, especially with the digital display.</li>
            <li> For the same price go with more professional (what they use in salons) models.</li>
            <li> It sucks up plenty of hair but a fair amount still gets around the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Now that he has such a nice trimmer he actually enjoys maintaining his beard.</li>
            <li> One nice feature though is that when the batter IS dead, you can plug in and use.  </li>
            <li> For the additional cost, the QT4070 will provide a smoother and more even cut, with a much cleaner sink and counter, keeping its charge well, and providing a clear digital readout.</li>
            <li> iT IS FAR BETTER THAN THE LAST RAZERS I HAVE USED.</li>
            <li> I have been a bearded man for most of my adult life and have used trimmers for the last 20+ years.</li>
            <li> But even after shaving my entire head, the battery indicator is still full or near full</li>
            <li> I have had a beard my entire adult life and have had many trimmers.  </li>
            <li> , I am sure this trimmer is going to last for years with proper use and storage, the only downside is that some times this trimmer left some untrimmed hairs on my beard, nothing that some good scissors can&#x27;t fix anyway.</li>
            <li> This is a kind of messy look / on the go product.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the old model, looks nicer, and has the lighted digital reading of what length you have it set at.</li>
            <li> which while lacking the vacuum feature I have found more adept at getting to these hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved it, the problem with my old one was that it didn&#x27;t hold a charge after a few months of usage, and now it doesn&#x27;t even work well if its plugged in.  </li>
            <li> He has a thick beard but the trimmer does a good job.</li>
            <li> Very smart idea incorporating the vacuum as it greatly reduces the amount of stubble mess I used to have with my old beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> On high suction it works much better (not perfectly) but reduces the run time much more quickly.</li>
            <li> I very rarely write reviews; but the Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silver is certainly a PRO which needed reviewing.    </li>
            <li> I will not be buying another Philips shaving product in the future - I already ordered a Remington vacuum unit for haircuts that I had formerly been pleased with many years ago.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is better in all ways except that the vacuum doesn&#x27;t quite work as well and there are more hairs trapped in the removable comb.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve got more and more eyebrow hairs that just decide &amp;#34;welp!</li>
            <li> The vacuum was useful when I was testing it, but it got in the way more often than it helped on the low trim settings.</li>
            <li> The adjustments are very precise and doesn&#x27;t move like other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Finally, the vacuum works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum option is great and doesn&#x27;t leave a messy sink.</li>
            <li> The vacuum provides terrific ease of use and keeps everything neat and tidy.  </li>
            <li> The tines on the trimmer head didn&#x27;t bother me one bit and the vacuum aspect is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> (apparently they removed it on the original change from the older model, but they now give you both heads in the packaging)</li>
            <li> the vacuum cup is nice and works well, but the door does open causing some frustrations...</li>
            <li> I do love this beard trimmer, but I will note that the vacuum does not work nearly as well as I had hoped which is why I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro, it is a bit loud</li>
            <li> This one does far better and the vacuum feature is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if it wasn&#x27;t for the vacuum (which only picks up 50-70%) I would return this.  </li>
            <li> about you dump the gimmicks, such as the LED display, Vacuum, and Turbo Button and just make a nice shaver that works?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very elegant design, battery life lasts very long, very easy to use, sucks the trimmed hair right</li>
            <li> This trimmer is certainly not one of the more inexpensive ones so why not have this included?</li>
            <li> The new one has a stationary comb that requires a steady hand or you will take a chunk right out of your beard.  </li>
            <li> The attached vacuum is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> The vacuum while not getting everything that is cut, it is a huge help and limits the amount of cleanup in the sink.</li>
            <li> the vacuum is not 100% accurate but like 95% .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum cleaning door does not close as securely as I would like it to close.</li>
            <li> In the absence of an appropriate and timely action by Norelco, I think that the US regulatory agencies need to intervene and ban this company from selling their products in the US.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well, but the latch to the door to the cuttings chamber broke, so I have to secure it with rubber bands to ensure the vacuum functions well and that the door stays closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having always held the bathroom garbage can under my chin to catch the hairs, I thought this vacuum feature would be fantastic.</li>
            <li> i am very please no mess with the vacuum and really does the job Better than the Wahl</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> the hair trimming is quite smooth, the vacuum works wonders !</li>
            <li> He does love how it doesn&#x27;t slide down to a different length easily</li>
            <li> Overall, this does exactly what I was hoping for, quickly and well.  </li>
            <li> A quick call to Philips cleared the issue up though, the rep knew exactly what I was talking about and he simply took my address and placed the order.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time, has an accurate and easy to adjust length guard and the vacuum function is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :  Excellent razor, close shave, very little mess</li>
            <li> Far more powerful than other trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li> But that is exactly what the new QT4070/41 does.    </li>
            <li> and if it ever goes out, I will get me an exact new one</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4 stars, is the head of the trimmer is too fat to get right under my nose without taking the guard off completely.</li>
            <li> One note: If you don&#x27;t clean the blades or comb regularly and are traveling, make sure to pack it in ziplock as loose hair particles will spill all over!</li>
            <li> My husband has liked it so far, and I am so grateful that I don&#x27;t have to clean up after every shave (I mean, he tries, but not to my standards:)</li>
            <li> Philips could easily remedy this, but they probably consider it too minor of an issue to spend money on.</li>
            <li> Very quick to charge, and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and long battery life.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is good - I only have to charge this every couple of weeks using it every other day.</li>
            <li> So many setting options and the battery hasn&#x27;t needed a recharge since the original charge at least six weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Getting most of hairs takes many passes from various angles and the bulkiness of the head makes trimming mustache awkward and only moderately successful.</li>
            <li> had hoped Norelco would have sent the contoured comb for free and apologized for the trouble the original comb caused me.  </li>
            <li> As other users have said, it doesnt really catch most of the hair.</li>
            <li> the build in vacuum is very useful.</li>
            <li> Also the design is nice but the plastic feels a little cheap (minor gripe).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the razor is super easy, just open vacuum compartment door and empty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Touted as a Vacuum trimmer, it does a pretty good job overall with some room for improvement as it may not vacuum all hair although that may depend on the length of hair being cut.</li>
            <li> I have only ever used a cheap Whal trimmer, thought I would buy a decent one.  </li>
            <li> other than that, the vacuum does a good job of sucking in trimmings and</li>
            <li> its vacuum not suck 100% hair but other all things are good.</li>
            <li> thought I would have to do the same with this one to keep from trying to clean up a bazillion little hairs in my bathroom sink, but the vacuum works very well and cleanup is very easy and quick at my sink, as it gets most of the hairs, but not every single one,  </li>
            <li> As most other posts say, this comes with the correct guide to make it work</li>
            <li> I was able to get an extremely close to the skin stubble with this at its closest setting.    </li>
            <li> other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li> I have had to snake the drain more than once due to beard hair in the drain.</li>
            <li> I have owned many other brands.</li>
            <li> Yeah, sure, that&#x27;s what I need to drag across my face all bleery-eyed in the morning - pointed sticks!  </li>
            <li> There is a gap on top as other reviewers have said that allows a closer trim around your jaw and chin when angled incorrectly.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> There at just too many sharp spots on this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and there are other better trimmers out there.</li>
            <li> For the most part, he wasn&#x27;t even paying attention to me as I can hear people laughing on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> on a full charge and than the red light comes on showing that the battery is low.  </li>
            <li> but it does suck up 90% of them which is 90% more than any other machine</li>
            <li> But, it does collect the stubble, and you can&#x27;t say that about most other brands.  </li>
            <li> Was getting this for travel and was expecting it to be a tad smaller but am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on the Qt4070 and other beard/mustache trimmers, I took the plunge and ordered the QT4070.</li>
            <li> still working great after a few months the battery charges fast and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This has a kool blue digital light which tells you what mm the trimmer is on at the moment and also how full the battery is and when t charge it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands costing much more</li>
            <li> As is the case with several more recent reviews, my trimmer was thankfully packaged with both (in fact, this was the first thing that</li>
            <li> I originally had purchased the 4050 version of this razor, but it did not cut close enough for me due to the flexible guard design (I know that most people prefer this).</li>
            <li> However, other electric trimmers are better based on my experience.</li>
            <li> The other is spring loaded and works contours of your face better.</li>
            <li> If you share this opinion, you may want to look more closely at your other options.  </li>
            <li> -in-all I would highly recommend this unit for keeping a beard smartly trimmed.</li>
            <li> I consider myself lucky that the good come was in the box as I&#x27;m not very hopeful that the Contour Following Comb I ordered through Phillips customer service will ever actually arrive.</li>
            <li> It has a vacuum to help clean up, and a whole lot of settings.  </li>
            <li> I like the vacuum feature as I don&#x27;t have as much hair to clean up out of the sink after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to read, it&#x27;s consistent, and it doesn&#x27;t move (unlike other trimmers and trimmer attachments I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> the vacuum makes clean up so much easier.</li>
            <li> vacuum didn&#x27;t catch everything, so a sink cleaning is still needed, although I must admit the clean up is much easier than I&#x27;m used</li>
            <li> It is as sharp as it was when I bought it, and the contour comb is easy to set and gives a consistent cut.</li>
            <li> When my trusty and much beloved Philips T980 recently gave up the ghost, I was a bit worried about replacing it with the new QT4070 due in large part to some of the adverse reviews I&#x27;d seen on Amazon.</li>
            <li> So there is a top comb which digs right into your skin like little knives as you use the device!</li>
            <li> If you want a clean, reliable stubble trimmer, look no further.</li>
            <li> There is no such thing as perfection though, so you&#x27;ll still have to clean some clippings off the rocks by the majestic mountain river</li>
            <li> As far as accuracy goes, the Norelco QT4070 is unbeatable and gives my face the look I want, pretty much everytime.</li>
            <li> so I only have to thoroughly clean it every couple months.</li>
            <li> Bought this Norelco to replace an old one that was pretty much falling apart.  </li>
            <li> In summary, I am very pleased that I spent the extra money for this model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less effective and causes more messy cleanup.</li>
            <li> so you have to actually clean out two things now, the trimmer and the left overs in the sink..  </li>
            <li> I pretty much have to insert earplugs to protect my hearing when trimming near my ears.  </li>
            <li> but it appears that besides emptying trimmings from the obvious compartment, you need to periodically clean the cutter head.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I was looking for a trimmer that was powerful enough to cut my coarse facial hair and that would be easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> You have to open the blade encasing and expose the rotary thing and clean out the hair, otherwise it will put strain on the motor.</li>
            <li> It is also neater to use, the hair is caught in a area that is very is to open and clean out.  </li>
            <li> door: the door clips shut with a tiny stub of plastic so packing the trimmer in a suitcase or quickly closing the door can snap off the plastic leaving it free to open while in use or storage.</li>
            <li> The main concern with this is that without the guard, it doesn&#x27;t cut very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it would have the ability to give a clean shave too, rather than just a close trim leaving stubble.</li>
            <li> Both the comb and the guard teeth seem much flimsier than the older T980, allowing the distance between the skin and the razors to vary depending on the pressure applied.</li>
            <li> Plus, the product comes with a tiny brush to clean up the hair.</li>
            <li> For those of you that can grow a dense, full beard before you finish breakfast and have a dark beard, 1mm may show a cool movie look.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have a thick full beard and my favorite shave gel (Zirh)</li>
            <li> Also, I found that a significant amount of hair never ended up sucked up by the vacuum and would just end up on a counter anyway.    </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, sucks the hair right in without having to worry about hair falling all over us.</li>
            <li> To finish up, without the comb, I trimmed a clear beard borderline down to my neck in reverse position, without once feeling any pulling or discomfort of any kind.    </li>
            <li> good at trimming beard down to a specific lenght--vacuum of hair a</li>
            <li> The vacuum makes the clean-up easy, although some cuttings do stay on the unit head and a few more tumble out.</li>
            <li> I figured out that either there is a short or a loose connection triggered by disassembling the blade head to brush clean and or very mildly tapping to remove clippings.</li>
            <li> I liked the previous model, and this newer model is better than the previous model even when it was new.</li>
            <li> The unit charges very fast, and the LED display clearly indicates the charge level.</li>
            <li> The digital display is a nice touch and clearly tells you what setting it&#x27;s on and how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li> Battery life is holding and the vacuum does help clean up.</li>
            <li> Now imagine that after emptying the puffy mass, that you would now have to take the vacuum cleaner apart and clean every moving part within it because parts of that puffy mass had coated everything inside.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works well to keep things clean.</li>
            <li> : The vacuum collects some hair, but leaves a lot in the sink (even if you clean out the chamber between trimmings).</li>
            <li> The Vacuum feature on this razor saves a ton of hassle with clean up.  </li>
            <li> its vacuum chamber helps a lot during clean up..</li>
            <li> The teeth are sharp and cut with no pulling or tugging, and the vacuum feature works pretty nicely, although after a week or so of trimming the sink does need to cleaned.</li>
            <li> It was a hard switch for me, but I am very glad I chose this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Both of us like the vacuum feature, no hair to clean up.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works perfectly; so it&#x27;s absolutely clean.</li>
            <li> These trimmers/clippers  have a built in vacuum to save me from having to clean up the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> thing on the vacuum feature though, you have to clean it out after every use or else</li>
            <li> There are still clippings that escape the vacuum, but it does help with the clean up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> and then I have to clean out the vacuum too.</li>
            <li> Vacuum also does not work well - I should still clean surrounding area.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t vacuum everything up, so you will still need to clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li> but overall it is hassle free, and it hasn&#x27;t pinched me yet, which is why I got a new shaving device; my Panasonic I just got pinches my hair, so does the Norelco, but Philips, it seems they did this one</li>
            <li> It becomes obvious after using so many of these that their product line gets better-engineered above a certain price point.</li>
            <li> The vacuum system is nice giving me less to clean up than my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Previous models were better insulated and motor much quieter.</li>
            <li> Overall a very rugged and well thought out device, worthy of anyones grooming arsenal.</li>
            <li> The previous models have been good shavers and didn&#x27;t have technical problems before the battery failed&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend you do not waste money on such a faulty product.</li>
            <li> The box I got with the comb clearly advertised it on the back, so this is an easy way to see if the comb&#x27;s included without opening the box.  </li>
            <li> Latch that keeps the door on the hair compartment closed is very flimsy and broke very quickly.</li>
            <li> It should be the same trimmer, but the new one seems much better - like the normal mode on this one is like Turbo on the old one -</li>
            <li> The vacuum works great letting very few whiskers fall into the sink.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and has a long battery life before it needs to be recharged.  </li>
            <li> The most common complaint from two years ago was that the guiding comb was not included, but I&#x27;m happy to report that it now is included with the product.</li>
            <li> After the first go around, I took off the removable &#x27;trimming comb&#x27;, then got what was left of the beard to a sort of rough stubble, ready to attack once more with my trusty razor (although I could have skipped that step and gone straight to razor, but I wanted to see if this trimmer could be a razor replacement.  </li>
            <li> Since this happened to both of the units, it seems pretty clear that it&#x27;s a design flaw.</li>
            <li> The first trimmer died completely after a couple months.</li>
            <li> A full charge now only lasts a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> It is sleek, maneuverable and the lighted digital display is cool.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that I bought this trimmer in the hopes that it would replace an old battery operated Wahl product that I use to shave my head.  </li>
            <li> Looks cool and is very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There were also a couple of nice additions since my last one which was several years old.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews related to the Philips Norelco, the Braun, the Panasonic and the Wahl products, and my final choice was between the Philips Norelco and the Wahl for good solid results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for basic trimming of your entire beard, however if you want to so some shaping on the edges, for instance to maintain your moustache or create a goatee, it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I had my beard professionally trimmed at the comfort of my house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Boost is a nice quirk that I usually turn on as a norm -- why would I otherwise wish to prolong my shaves?</li>
            <li> The only problem was because I had a full beard (grew it for a couple of months)</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I had my beard professionally trimmed at the comfort of my house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a keep it short and sweet</li>
            <li> charged it once I received it to full battery and haven&#x27;t charged it since and have been using it almost on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Still it is very cleaner than a normal razor.</li>
            <li> Not sure how people got hurt using this thing to be honest.</li>
            <li> The suction is much better and really helps with the mess of trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> It still leaves a few whiskers in the sink &amp; on my shirt, but not bad as compared the my original unit.</li>
            <li> I liked the digital adjustment of this trimmer, It doesn&#x27;t change on me or become loose and adjust itself like some reviewers claim.  </li>
            <li> vacuum and the digital display are interesting, but I don&#x27;t feel like they add much to the beard trimming.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy to find a model that had a vacuum to help curb the mess on the sink that other razors leave.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is ok, I have black hair which did get on the sink, which meant that there was still clean up to do (nothing like the Philips video btw, which made it look</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vacuum sucks up most of the stray hairs from shaving, which is my favorite feature of this model.</li>
            <li> Digital trim length indicator is fine although length is also marked on the sides of the guard/slide.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  Ok this is going down to two stars.  </li>
            <li> and it will wear down and will not stay close any more.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a good trimmer with the vacuum option to minimize the mess when trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is useless, it doesn&#x27;t collect more than but a fraction of hair and is just one more thing to clean out.</li>
            <li> He likes the vacumn feature so there is no mess in the sink!!!</li>
            <li> The vacuum gets about 75% of the clippings, but I&#x27;d much rather have more juice going to the clippers - whats the point in a vacuum if the clippers suck?&lt;br /&gt;[Note</li>
            <li> The vacuum is superior to the vacuum on the earlier models.  </li>
            <li> Oh that sweet vacuum feature.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> The vacuum is cool and works..  </li>
            <li> but there is still a fair amount of clean-up of little whiskers required after trimming a short beard.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works quite well (until its hopper is full)</li>
            <li> Trimming takes a little practice but it does an overall good job.</li>
            <li> good all my hairs even, except in the mustache area which it left them a little longer, but withing acceptable and understandable limits.</li>
            <li> This is an obvious design flaw with this supposedly top model product - the next model down, that comes with the other comb, gets completely great reviews.</li>
            <li> it has a ton of cutting lengths and captures most the clippings keeping the sink relatively clean works great and the battery last a long time.. and mine was packaged with both heads</li>
            <li> So far, the vacuum function has not quite been up to snuff, but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> They have other models which are far better, and much cheaper.      </li>
            <li> My older one would turn on while being in the travel case and being pressed lightly requiring me to come up with a way to securely cover the power button with something hard.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re keeping a simple mid-length beard, it isn&#x27;t an all-around trimmer as advertised and you&#x27;ll still need other tools to keep tidy.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time I am relatively new to a beard but this has made life so much easier.</li>
            <li> I wish the product designers/engineers would live with their &amp;#34;achievements&amp;#34; before vomiting them so readily onto the marketplace.</li>
            <li> After reading through many reviews, some good and some bad, I decided to try the Norelco.</li>
            <li> There were good reviews on it, but a lot of bad ones also, so I wasn&#x27;t sure in that buy at all.</li>
            <li> thus it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;mistake-proof&amp;#34; than previous trimmers he has owned.</li>
            <li> The compartment is easy to empty.  </li>
            <li> Most of the hair ended up in the bin with about 80% less trimmings in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those who previously used the T980 will surely recognize the design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually threw it out and still use my old Norelco brush because it&#x27;s much easier to clean with that one.</li>
            <li> The setting wheel is SO MUCH BETTER than previous setting ring design.</li>
            <li> Much much better than the previous generation.</li>
            <li> had the previous model which was better.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is really pretty nice at reducing the mess.</li>
            <li> I had the previous version of this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> Lower price, less fancy products are way more practical.</li>
            <li> I had never had a legitimate trimmer before, I had my hesitations that this was going to be any better than the previous pieces of garbage I had ordered.</li>
            <li> The container on the previous version was a much better option.</li>
            <li> Seems to have more suction than previous models.</li>
            <li> sure if I would get the same one again, with how this is my second and now have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also does not contour very well around my jaw and leaves areas that are much more uneven than others.</li>
            <li> Had to replace an older model that would not hold a charge any longer.  </li>
            <li> Simply throw a few paper towels in the sink and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> Decent battery life</li>
            <li> this has more than met my expectations and i will not be without this or a similar product in the future.</li>
            <li> It also cuts super short on its lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> Works decent for the price.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the battery, which seems to last a week or better even with the turbo on, just drops to zero all of a sudden.  </li>
            <li> Also, I really love the digital display on it...showing all the different lengths or measurements (and battery power...e.t.c.) ...</li>
            <li> Had an older version of this product which I&#x27;ve had for years.  </li>
            <li> The whole operation lasted a maximum of ten minutes and was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> After my older Philips Norelco died permanently (the NiCad batter would not charge any longer), I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> and i couldn&#x27;t find anything else that did that that was in the up to $80 range nor didn&#x27;t want to cough up $200+ for an actual good all round trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer one week, but see below I&#x27;ve been using an older Norelco with the preferred comb for years</li>
            <li> used an older model before</li>
            <li> I am seeking out the older version.</li>
            <li> Also, any basic, corded trimmer will most likely outperform this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say much about the battery life but the turbo option is nice for someone with a thick beard.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for people like me who have thick beards and like to let them grow out then trim them back.</li>
            <li> Overall, I cannot recommend this trimmer based on several design flaws I believe will be problematic for most users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just super glued the tab back on and works again.</li>
            <li> For me, it was helpful for quick touch-ups on my sideburns and, with my wife&#x27;s help, for cleaning up my neck in the back and around my ears.</li>
            <li> This product is not meant to last, they&#x27;ve focused on gimmicky details rather than a good, reliable product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It comes with a contour flowing comb, which I&#x27;ve read older models advertised but did not contain in the box</li>
            <li> There is, however, the need to be more careful in the use of the QT4070 than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> If you do, it&#x27;s simple to hold the tines near the tips for support and use a jeweler&#x27;s file to smooth.  </li>
            <li> No, seriously, it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair at all.</li>
            <li> If you want to get a closer trim/shave (like the older model) then forget it.</li>
            <li> I still get a decent amount of beard hair all over the place.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly, and if if dies in the middle of a trim, you can always plug it in.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement to an older Norelco Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li> i only wish it were a bit more quiet.  </li>
            <li> The lack of decent head shave and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cutting - The shearing of the clipper even on regular speed is quite adequate for my beard.</li>
            <li> The standard comb, which many people complain about, and the guided comb, which suppose to solve the problems associated with the standard</li>
            <li> I wish a case was included in the package to keep everything (charger, extra comb, cleaning brush) together, but it is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging took more than an hour.</li>
            <li> This replace and older one I had.  </li>
            <li> Lighter weight than my older one.</li>
            <li> The design is composed of a plastic door, on a plastic hinge, with a 1mm plastic lip that clicks onto the main housing.</li>
            <li> The only aesthetic flaw is a white strip winding through most of the unit.</li>
            <li> Decent shaver.</li>
            <li> Yet it was difficult to think much real improvement could be made on that great product.</li>
            <li> my main issue with this one is that you have to keep cleaning out the filter where the hair is vacuumed into.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super simple to use.</li>
            <li> Mainly because of its integrated vaccum system... I do fully recommend it...</li>
            <li> Decent product.  </li>
            <li> her.&lt;br /&gt;It is still a decent razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rechargeable, super simple to use and never pulls or snags on my beard.</li>
            <li> Replaced older Norelco when I needed sharper blades and the catcher cup broke.</li>
            <li> i had an older version of this about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> older reviews say that you get one trimmer guard that pokes and causes un-even trimming, but rest assured, that is not the case any longer.</li>
            <li> Replaced my older model.</li>
            <li> The point is to recommend you see if any earlier Norelco blades you may have on an old razor will fit on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Update of 11/11/13&lt;br</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s super short stubble that you&#x27;re after...</li>
            <li> The biggest issue, is that this model only has a screen at the bottom of the compartment, so it quickly clogs of beard trimmings, and no longer vacuums them.  </li>
            <li> I was initially put off by the fact that it does not come with a charging stand, but I quickly found out that it does not need one.</li>
            <li> My older trimmer was wrapped in rubber and felt heavier.</li>
            <li> : Love the big internal dial that adjusts the length of the trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pay attention to more recent reviews, the unit now comes with two different guides.  </li>
            <li> I had one of the older styles of Norelco trimmers that I wore out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Secondly, the design of the blades and the large vacuum port is such that when you&#x27;re trying to trim the line of your mustache, beard, or sideburns, you cannot SEE where the blades are touching your face/beard, so you can&#x27;t tell where to trim!</li>
            <li> Its too new to know how good the batteries are and whether the trimmers will stay sharp for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The original is poorly designed; the contoured version is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> or so i look and see if i can find an actual good trimmer to replace it that won&#x27;t cost me an other pretty penny only to be dissatisfied again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My older clipper that was of similar design without the vacuum was much better.</li>
            <li> First, the razor is good enough that you don&#x27;t have to press hard at all to cut</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp and cut welll, but don&#x27;t use for fine detail or very close shaves.</li>
            <li> I can see the potential for breakage with some of the plastic pieces but the trimmer works well and the vacuum does pick up most of the trimmings for an easier sink cleanup.</li>
            <li> The vacuum catches the vast majority of trimmings, but be sure to rinse your face well afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve gotten with the vacuum, and it really DOES work!</li>
            <li> The vacuum works as advertised, but only manages to pick up 60-70% of the clippings (I mostly use this as a scruff trimmer).  </li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, the vacuum feature isn&#x27;t a shop vac so don&#x27;t expect it to catch everything if you are doing anything more than a daily trim.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works ok but unless you&#x27;re just trimming short stubble it tends to clog just under the blades.</li>
            <li> What made me choose this item over others was its vacuum feature which had a plastic &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; where you could see the &amp;#34;trimmings&amp;#34; as well as being able to open this window to dispose of the trimmings.</li>
            <li> guess this is a pro, as the few times that I have used it I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge improvement in the speed and efficiency of shaving seeing as the regular mode does the job just fine in a timely manor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it because my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t make a mess with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you might need to choose a different trimming length than with the normal comb, especially if you hold your trimmer in a more angled way like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still a mess on the sink counter top when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> you might need to choose a different trimming length than with the normal comb, especially if you hold your trimmer in a more angled way like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li> Keeps most of the mess contained, but not all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the super vacuum that is built in to collect the cuttings</li>
            <li> found that the measured guide for trimming was extremely effective and provided an even trim all around - I have trusted few trimmers in the past, but I was able to put my faith in this one, the guide just worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is really super.</li>
            <li> Hair gets stuck in the super teensy weensy vacuum hole.  </li>
            <li> Good battery power last long enough to shave all my body, and</li>
            <li> only problem for me is that for trimming my long beard I have to use an extra comb, but to be fair a 5 inch beard is a challenge for any trimmer and this one make it just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> It gets fairly close when you take the blade guard right off, but it&#x27;s difficult to shave stubble evenly.</li>
            <li> fast charge and super long life.</li>
            <li> The power cord plug easily slips out of the bottom (and could drop in sink of water if you&#x27;re not careful) as the plug doesn&#x27;t seat itself solidly into the body of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t vacuum EVERYTHING, but much better than not having a vacuum at all.</li>
            <li> The only minor issue us that the vacuum didn&#x27;t work quite as good as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> i guess I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for self-shavers and others alike.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> 11/2014***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the unit for over a year now, and the quality isn&#x27;t a high as I&#x27;d like.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> I have trimmed my beard and moustaches with high quality barber scissors since about 1977.  </li>
            <li> Still, after you trim your beard to your desired stubble, even the minimum length setting is too high for mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this unit, but in the end I&#x27;m just returning it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> really liked it, unfortunately after having it for only 7 months the battery is only good for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Many seemed dated a little older, and aimed specifically around the stubble comb attachment (newer reviews mention the dual combs now included and no problems).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> vacuum works much better than the old Wahl model this replaced, which is a relief since there are so few vacuum-equipped models available.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great but the compartment for storing the trimming is very small and needs to be emptied multiple times.</li>
            <li> its very noisy, my wife couldn&#x27;t bear sound its making even from other rooms when I am using it in bathroom.</li>
            <li> had about a 5 inch long beard and this trimmer could barley cut 20 strands of hair at a time with out me having to clean the blades.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a nice trimmer and holds charge for about 2 weeks when I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Fun in that there is no mess to clean up in and around the sink, other than emptying the stubble compartment when finished trimming.  </li>
            <li> The functioning of the QT4070 is as described, but it is far too large to maneuver as a mustache trimmer unless you have a gigantic face.  </li>
            <li> do really like the digital settings to be able to trim to the exactness of a single millimeter.</li>
            <li> It works great, and for less than half the price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A little battery-powered machine isn&#x27;t going to be able to suck up all the clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, charges fast, the vacuum feature actually works!</li>
            <li> I used to trim my beard with a little $5 set of clippers and these work MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> The display can&#x27;t keep track of the height of the attachment, every time you click up to a higher setting from 0, the display will flash the next size from the number on the display, then go back to the original size.</li>
            <li> It could probably go a little longer without the charge, but I like to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> little bulky like most.</li>
            <li> in all, I love this little razor, use it at home or on the road.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is nice and keeps down on the mess, but other than that there was nothing great about it.</li>
            <li> At first i was disappointed by the vacuum, but after I started emptying it more frequently during the shave, I became decently impressed by how much it actually keeps off of the counter...  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works good, although it&#x27;s not like a professional one that&#x27;s actually hooked up to a real vacuum.  </li>
            <li> I am exceptionally frusturated with the trimmers inability to lift the beard to make accurate cutting.</li>
            <li> The brush is a joke most likely will drop on toilet or lose it.</li>
            <li> I have bought many other electric razors and have spent much more on similar products</li>
            <li> -Only extra pieces are the other head it came with, a cleaning brush, and the A/C adaptor which is great compared to my old multipiece trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric beard trimmer, and certainly the last I will ever need.</li>
            <li> So as you shave, it easily stabs your face, or any other part of your body you may choose to shave.  </li>
            <li> In all, they are rugged, easy to maintain, and are built with quality not found in other brands.</li>
            <li> it is kind of hard to shape with because of the positioning of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I use it to keep at 2/3 mm and use the 1mm setting under the nose because it&#x27;s hard for the blades to work effectively.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of bulky as well and hard to get under the nose.</li>
            <li> Then I found another clip (black with a clear plastic movable part) in the box and removed the default clip (the all black one with the open end that caused the shaving issues); and it worked perfectly lol!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re letting your goatee/beard grow out and trim down a decent amount then expect to make many trips to clear out the hair trap and unclog the hole.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A beard trimmer should be easy to use to produce an even cut, even over the concave surfaces and especially the flat and convex surfaces.</li>
            <li> I would not have bought this product if I wanted to use the adjustable comb because of the almost universal hatred displayed by previous reviewers, but I take it off and get a good, close, mess free trim.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works very well- far, far fewer hairs to clean up post-shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I had an older model for years and thought it was time for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In about a year the battery seems to discharge completely if it is jostled too much.  </li>
            <li> smooth adjust with a wide array of settings  *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months now, and so far it&#x27;s worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Works well and is much neater to use than old trimmer.</li>
            <li> With the way it is designed, you can&#x27;t get the piece of plastic completely out of the way to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips offers a generous 24 month warranty and replaced the whole unit under warranty.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, first of all, let&#x27;s establish a general scope of what 1mm means to a beard.  </li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t much matter if you&#x27;re stroking against the natural growth direction or not,</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who still wants some hair on their face but not for a complete shave.  </li>
            <li> If you buy straight from Norelco, it now ships directly with the contouring head that everyone is raving about in the comments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of beard trimmers and (so far) have found this one to be very reliable.</li>
            <li> I tried using directly &amp; it took so much time to trim.</li>
            <li> I think the product has been improved because the old reviews don&#x27;t really reflect the product anymore.  </li>
            <li> I really like that I can use it while its plugged in, I couldn&#x27;t do that with my old one.  </li>
            <li> I really like it so far, use it for trimming my beards, or sometime trimming my body hair.</li>
            <li> This is a much lighter trimmer than my old one</li>
            <li> Sad to see Norelco hasn&#x27;t changed the design, otherwise it&#x27;s a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Does not trim soft hair very well.</li>
            <li> The vacume feature is great and the blades cut well,even on thick beard,as long as you dont let the hair catcher get overfilled.</li>
            <li> It actually does what it says, which is rare these days it seems.    </li>
            <li> It seems that the battery is not holding the charge anymore, which kind of sucks since it doesn´t have two months.</li>
            <li> Simple and highly useful.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal since the setting is clearly marked on the side and the digital display is more just for fanciness.  </li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m not going to rehash all the talk about this model vs others that are similar.  </li>
            <li> The picture shows a nice dark blue.</li>
            <li> While others have mentioned its minor imperfections, and some of them are true, to my knowledge</li>
            <li> The suction system is not perfect but is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra $15 bucks over the cheaper models in my opinion.</li>
            <li> their medical devices are as good as phillips&#x27; consumer devices, then I&#x27;m even more afraid of hospitals than I was before.</li>
            <li> I have not used the Norelco to trim a full grown beard 2 or 3 inches long</li>
            <li> few more notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when you take the beard combs off it wont shave close enough to even touch a weeks worth of stubble.  </li>
            <li> I quit using a normal razor because my neck seems to get reall iritated</li>
            <li> had it many year&#x27;s This one has a few improvements</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a better photo of the clear plastic compartment cover but as you can see it is just cheap plastic and that tab will break off sooner or later.ng and the notorious plastic clippings compartment, small plastic tab simply fatigued and broke off (should have been a metal clip)  </li>
            <li> Too bulky to be useful, cannot do actual detail trimming.</li>
            <li> The battery seems, to me, to have a normal lifespan between charges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that is good enough to please a lot of people.</li>
            <li> I had it on pretty much all the time as I tried to trim as much as possible.    </li>
            <li> why the normal mode exists)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Having purchased this a few months ago, I&#x27;m satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth ($35).  </li>
            <li> He has a long, full beard (think Amish).</li>
            <li> The Turbo feature is well worth the extra $10.00.</li>
            <li> I figure 2 years of service was worth a 2nd purchase.  </li>
            <li> Only the contour attachment is worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a year, the catch on the door of the compartment that collects the clippings broke off in normal use.</li>
            <li> Norelco products have managed to last me a long a while and sure have been reliable.</li>
            <li> Ok Razor, door catch broke in a few days.</li>
            <li> and my husband has not complained.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not enough to make it worth the money though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Now the battery lasts only for one use pretty much.</li>
            <li> 2 is too short and 3 is too long they should make it more adjustable.</li>
            <li> However, you still need to clean up the sink as: 1) the chamber is small and fills up quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is my fourth Norelco beard trimmer (can&#x27;t replace the batteries economically in Norelco trimmers)</li>
            <li> I may have a defective unit and will update after a few more months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It broke after about 4 months of normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, worth it despite shortcomings.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a good size doesn&#x27;t feel too small or big</li>
            <li> The touted &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; of shaven hair might be mildly useful, if it actually worked.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Vacuum is good but not great.  </li>
            <li> I liked the old one so much that I went ahead and bought this newer model despite all the reviews that had something negative to say about</li>
            <li> I think I got three solid full beard trims on full turbo the whole time before it was down below 1/2 battery.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite loud, so it would be better without the vacuum.</li>
            <li> Because really, and I mean REALLY, this trimmer was pretty much a huge letdown.</li>
            <li> While the vacuum does get much of hair, doesn&#x27;t get it all, even when set to higher speed.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the whole vacuum thing would be just a gimmick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and the vacuum gets a lot of the hair (though definitely not most of it).  </li>
            <li> trimmer has no problem with my long beard, altough the vacuum could be better</li>
            <li> The plastic door that holds all the loose hair broke the first week I had it, so now all the hair falls all over the place, defeating the whole purpose of the vacuum keeping everything clean.  </li>
            <li> The internal vacuum is great because it means less beard trimmings on my sink!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: This trimmer does a fine job for the price, but when it fully breaks I&#x27;ll be looking for other options.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer, so far it functions as expected - most of the other reviews on here covered pretty well the pros and cons of</li>
            <li> Other than that, the trimmer seems to work fine</li>
            <li> Vacuum function is really useful.</li>
            <li> so my experience may not be as useful as full-faced beard users but for me the trimmer works well and the vacuum features works</li>
            <li> The vacuum just isn&#x27;t that powerful.  </li>
            <li> what it&#x27;s worth the majority of hair is still picked up by the vacuum</li>
            <li> Vacuum is powerful but some hair pieces still go around</li>
            <li> The vacuum design for this model makes it fun to shave.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is also worth having, I thought it would just be a gimmick, but it helps.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think the vacuum part is as useful as made out.</li>
            <li> For what its worth, try another trimmer and dont go for vacuum marketing</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time (through multiple uses) and catches most of the hair inside.  </li>
            <li> But then you have to clean the compartment anyway, so the trimmings still end up getting loose anyway.  </li>
            <li> ever try to dry shave a months worth of beard on a straight razor?</li>
            <li> I added their battery-powered detailing shaver/trimmer to my arsenal last year, as I maintain a close trimmed van dyke (goatee plus mustache).&lt;br /&gt;Hardly any trimmings left in the sink, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The trim is even and uniform across my entire face, and the LED readout which indicates the length of the hairs makes it easy to taper the length from facial hair to sideburns in increments from 1mm up to whatever length you like.  </li>
            <li> It also keeps drains clear since the vac makes it easy to empty as well.</li>
            <li> The product still works adequately, however I probably would not have spent as much money if I hadn&#x27;t thought i&#x27;d get both blades.  </li>
            <li> I keep my beard short, nearly stubble, and this trimmer works quick and with no pull.</li>
            <li> My shaver went strong for the next two weeks of daily use!</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is as you have it recharging it like to roll around, would be nice to have a flat surface on the back</li>
            <li> That said, and based on reading hundreds of reviews on other brands of similar trimmers - this may be the best beard trimmer (at least for some beards) on the market today.</li>
            <li> I do wonder if most of the users rate it after a single use and never look back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible but takes a bit of work to get the blades close right under the nose.</li>
            <li> right outside of the warranty period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer a week and the digital display doesn&#x27;t work right already.</li>
            <li> this is the only one that get&#x27;s my beard to the right length.</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse beard and it cruises right through it</li>
            <li> but my scruff looks like garbage right now, and the length is so low I cant fade it or anything.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s time they improved the things that really need improvement instead of the things that don&#x27;t (the turbo, for me, is completely unnecessary and the lithium battery is nice, but not a big deal): e.g., a hard case for travel (this machine is very fragile and easily breaks in travel - i need to come up with my own ways to protect it), and a charger-dock (its shape makes it volatile on slippery surfaces, like, say, a sink edge).</li>
            <li> Other than the new digital display it works just as the original - - EXCEPT the old charger is not compatible with the new model, AND it does not come with the case as did the original.  </li>
            <li> - Holds charge for a very long time - Looks cool</li>
            <li> I read the negative ones more than I did the positive ones.</li>
            <li> I used the trimmer for less than 5 minutes over the course of the first week and the trimmer required another full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this trimmer for a new one thinking this was an anomaly.</li>
            <li> The battery charges quickly and holds the charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum function is effective, avoiding the mess almost totally.</li>
            <li> The battery charges quickly and lasts long.</li>
            <li> works well, charge lasts quite long and re-charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Not quite close enough for a young professional who needs to look clean cut every day.</li>
            <li> The quick charge is a Dog-send, and the battery life is pleasantly long.</li>
            <li> It would not stay closed at all which is pretty important given that the vacuum is one of the main differentiators of this product.</li>
            <li> charger works quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I even use this to give me a quick buzz if I feel like my hair is getting too long</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time, charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Taking the clipper apart to clean the cutting mechanism is also very easy to do (not so with many other under $100 clippers!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the combination of features it offers; it has a very wide adjustable range and a hair catching vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> The channel it uses to vaccumm the hair gets clogged too easily and is very hard to clean (because you aren&#x27;t supposed to use water on this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vacuum might not suck up every single hair, but gets most of them.</li>
            <li> The old Norelco (without vacuum) had clippings all over the sink and counter--the QT4070 vacuum captures around 97%, which leaves the sink and counter pretty clean.  </li>
            <li> I would go back to my old philips in the future as it was simple and works effectively.</li>
            <li> the sharp plastic tines cause the most painful trim I&#x27;ve ever experienced  3) on 2 separate occasions, after setting the trimmer to level \\&quot;7\\&quot;, the guard has moved right in the middle of trimming- causing a large bald strip in my beard.  </li>
            <li> The last time I used this trimmer, I actually left off the heads for a closer trim and it was fine.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that it is relatively quiet, in comparison to an older trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised, it trims your beard without the mess in the sink or on the floor via the handy vacuum.  </li>
            <li> The hair guard is pretty decent, and gives you loads of options, so big plus there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very user friendly.</li>
            <li> First, the comb head is cheaply made from soft, pliable plastic that bends, causing the trim to be uneven.   </li>
            <li> Looks classy in every way, but it&#x27;s really the EXACT same thing as the QT4050, literally .  </li>
            <li> guide is SHARP and doesn&#x27;t move smoothly over your face.  </li>
            <li> The customer rep was fantastic and sent one out to me with no hassle or questions other than to confirm the order.  </li>
            <li> the Qt4070 leaves a little more stubble than the old model, about 1 or 1 and 1/2 day&#x27;s growth, which is acceptable to me.</li>
            <li> You can quickly select the length you want, and the vacuum works as claimed, with almost no mess in my sink.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this, but it is the first and only one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> : Jim, we have reported this issue and the new QT4070</li>
            <li> : The contour comb is now included with the new QT4070 package.&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> Every time I use it I get a new ingrown hair that gets infected.  </li>
            <li> but it when need a new one.</li>
            <li> After receiving the new QT4070</li>
            <li> Concluded it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> So now they are sending me a new 4070</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use this anymore and have ordered a new rechargable Wahl trim n vac which should be in soon.  </li>
            <li> After fully charging the new QT4070.</li>
            <li> I called Norelco about this and they shipped me a new one.  </li>
            <li> so I have had to buy a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> His shaver died and he needed a new one.</li>
            <li> I got this new model as a gift.  </li>
            <li> The new one arrived today, I charged it up and tried it.  </li>
            <li> I am new to electric shaving, so I was looking forward to some advice and tips.</li>
            <li> so I had to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> the display on it, and the suction is alright nothing I couldn&#x27;t live without, but makes things easier for cleanup.</li>
            <li> By chance, I today read the answers on this site to questions others had posed about this trimmer and learned Norelco added a new contoured comb to this trimmer after complaints from purchasers.  </li>
            <li> I called Norelco (866-779-0279) to purchase the new contoured comb.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new one in 2012.</li>
            <li> great--like new</li>
            <li> Look out new and improve me.</li>
            <li> downgrading a star for this, so - 4 star is my new grade.</li>
            <li> i bought this product about a year ago and its still like new.</li>
            <li> So I soaked just the blade in water-downed dish soap (Dawn), scrubbed it with a toothbrush and now the trimmer works like new.  </li>
            <li> And now I have this new one and have used it maybe three or four times and, already</li>
            <li> I dealt with it for a month or two, just holding the door shut... and debated on taping it shut or buying a new one.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no guarantee that the new one will have the comb, but we&#x27;re rolling the dice.  </li>
            <li> This one was also brand new, in the box and DID have the contour comb.  </li>
            <li> but i live alone so wouldn&#x27;t disturb someone sleeping.  </li>
            <li> The wifey loves the new cleaner-messy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking to buy my husband something to keep his newly grown beard</li>
            <li> His new toy I guess.  </li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;First off the one and two star reviews that mention the lack of the contour comb attachment are now invalid - it now includes it AND the new stubble</li>
            <li> Needed to find a new trimmer that could produce a stubble beard.</li>
            <li> The new one doesn&#x27;t cut evenly.</li>
            <li> so I had to get a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Philips and they immediately expedited a new one to me.  </li>
            <li> with this new one.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco sent a new one, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> I will be looking for a new trimmer to replace this one soon and this one will be going to the thrift store.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this new model.</li>
            <li> new model arrived.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s new</li>
            <li> May be hard to get at the mustache; otherwise, I really like it and am sure you will too.</li>
            <li> After I got familiar with the settings, it was much easier to use than the Remington that I owned previously.</li>
            <li> I bought this reluctantly after pieces broke on my last Philips trimmer, and its battery didn&#x27;t last long enough to give me a good trim, nor was it powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips Norelco for over 30 years, I wish I could add some old features into this new design and make one heck of a trimmer!</li>
            <li> Really liked the vacuum feature which kept the little hairs off my shirt.</li>
            <li> The parts listing in the instructions on the replacement clearly showed two combs, rather than the single \\&quot;trimming comb\\&quot; listed in the instructions for the original.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for 2 years now and the battery that started out strong (would last forever on a charge) just went down hill very fast.  </li>
            <li> Only time will tell if it holds up, but really it&#x27;s cheap enough that one could buy a new one every five or six months if need be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that the battery holds a charge much longer than the old one, even when the old one was new.</li>
            <li> It is harder to clean the cut hair out of it than a pull drawer, which I had with my previous&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t care less, so I wanted a fool-proof easy solution.</li>
            <li> This one is harder to clean too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> This had to be done for a reason, because if this unit was properly tested before it was released to consumers, this design flaw would instantly come to light.  </li>
            <li> Now it just kind of stays almost closed until I empty it.</li>
            <li> As far as this particular product is concerned:</li>
            <li> I originally had an older model (blue with a pull out vacuum hopper) and switched to this one a year or two ago.  </li>
            <li> The shaver holds a charge for a few weeks and has a really nice blue indicator for the power and length of cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> over all this is a 3 star product, it cuts (though misses a good amount of hair) and saves some time and guess work, yet you need a secondary smaller trimmer to finish the job.</li>
            <li> Trims like professional instrument producing effortless uniformity, and without the &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; mentioned in older reviews.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, it does what I intended it to do; trim my beard evenly with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> Still does an excellent job of cutting at various heights and it stays for weeks between charges.</li>
            <li> Never really been able to give myself that look with my myriad of different trimmers - until now.  </li>
            <li> the fit and finish is what you would expect with a low to mid level consumer device.  </li>
            <li> The QT4070 has a gap between the top guard and the side guard, which leaves the cutting surface more exposed.  </li>
            <li> Once it is off, open the hair filled chamber, tap opposite side and into trash can.</li>
            <li> The shave, even with the comb removed (thus the closest shave possible) is really not 5 o&#x27;clock shadow level - it&#x27;s more like 24-hours</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve spent over an hour on the phone trying to get the desired contour following comb and my time is precious like yours.</li>
            <li> Have used/still use multiple, various razors and trimmers, primarily Norelco and Braun.  </li>
            <li> &gt;* Found out that the best and fastest way to give me that stubble look is to remove the guide head entirely (0 mm) and use the cutting blades in a downward motion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, but be prepared to replace it near a year in.</li>
            <li> recently tried to see if the two \\&quot;blade heads\\&quot; on my last Norelco fit this razor and they did.  </li>
            <li> least it looks more streamlined, and functions more or less identically.</li>
            <li> I can still use the old one by using masking tape to replace the latch, but this makes cleanup a lot more trouble (beard trimmings stick to the tape too).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with poorly designed trimmers, the norelco is your best choice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it, does exactly what I expected, especially the short cut down to 1 mm.</li>
            <li> Has many useful features and the hair clipping vacuum function actually works, especially when trimming using short setting.</li>
            <li> It is, again, not a very precise product, but this method works fine for</li>
            <li> I only use it every other day and it is rare that I go a full week without having to plug it in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this trimmer get off the fence, build a new fence, climb on top and get off it again just to show the Philiips Norelco QT4070 how much you mean it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vacuum does work in normal use, but be aware it is not going to work on a bird&#x27;s nest beard -</li>
            <li> Vacuum system works very well and a real sink-cleaning time saver.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> While it does catch a lot of hair, there is still a good amount that falls in the sink, and the way the head is designed, the hair keeps getting caught where the vacuum sucks the hair in.</li>
            <li> For those who have complained about the vacuum not working well I would imagine you had a fairly good beard when you did this.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum works even better than expected.</li>
            <li> vacuum works better than expected</li>
            <li> Vacuum works better than expected.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works way better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> The vacuum concept works better than expected.</li>
            <li> This trimmer performs well at all settings, the battery maintains charge well, and the vacuum feature works way better than expected.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said the guard wasn&#x27;t right, but as stated earlier, all are shipping with the new and old guard, so you can change them as you</li>
            <li> Yes, the instructions are very clear this unit is not waterproof, but I tried it anyway.</li>
            <li> The latter point seems to be a huge design flaw, leaving the razors entirely exposed and ultimately shearing skin twice in the first use before I resigned to using the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; head.</li>
            <li> It has a digital display that is very useful and tells you when the battery needs recharging/partially charged and fully charged by use of different colours.</li>
            <li> it is also very loud.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to guys who want to keep their beard in shape or who want to maintain  that 3 day old scuzz look.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last very much if using the turbo function.</li>
            <li> (the small trimmer was available for the older model and works very</li>
            <li> after I received my new CONTOUR FOLLOWING COMB, the QT4070 is a FIVE-star trimmer--it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> after I received my new CONTOUR FOLLOWING COMB, the QT4070 is a FIVE-star trimmer--it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the new razor delivered:  A close shave, ease of use and most importantly no more stubble in the sink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Where they would naturally meet and form a right angle, someone (who obviously has never used a beard trimmer on themselves) decided those two parts did NOT need to connect.</li>
            <li> My old version of this died and this picked right up where it left off.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a razor for a shorter stubble beard, but since I am light BLOND, it needs to be a little longer to give the same effect many guys with darker hair can have with even a single day&#x27;s shadow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the mustache hair closest to my nose, but other than that, works great.</li>
            <li> we have first in appearance is a very modern, sleek looking accessory that has a blue digital readout.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, and maybe that is just my not being used to it, is that the trimmer is too wide to do a very good job in trimming the mustache.</li>
            <li> New trimmers now include two different guards, so it was unnecessary for me to contact Norelco to obtain a more comfortable guard.</li>
            <li> It takes about 10mins to do, is noisy but makes very little mess in the bathroom, and has really great results.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is great, Cuts uneven, hard to get straight edges....</li>
            <li> The only other con is the cumbersome shape of the cutter itself makes it less than great for side burn trimming.</li>
            <li> The vacuum component makes trimming care free without the need to clean up hairs which usually fall all over the sink and vanity top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design makes it very easy to maintain a beard and keep it neat while the vacuum feature prevents a mess all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> in all, this is keeping my old grey beard in good shape with very little effort.</li>
            <li> good product overall , the little vacuum cleaner is a bonus and works for me</li>
            <li> Too bad then I am forced to continue using the most awesome beard trimmer I have had in 15 years of beard trimming.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one back in 2007</li>
            <li> - Adjustable length with digital display make to find and maintain a consistent trim&lt;br</li>
            <li> It picks up virtually all the cut hair, and the tiny amounts it doesn&#x27;t get is pretty trivial.</li>
            <li> This is the first public review of a product I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
            <li> Like Conair and many others that were small hair trimmers with an attachment to cut the beard to length.</li>
            <li> Batteries and overall performance are stellar.</li>
            <li> My current model was purchased in 2013 and I was interested in upgrading to the 2015 version.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty quiet clipper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty darn big.    </li>
            <li> I keep my beard pretty short (4-5mm)</li>
            <li> Having to use a different product first then follow with this is a joke</li>
            <li> It has the exact same comb as the t980</li>
            <li> They recommend starting with a higher setting and descending until you reach the desired length.  </li>
            <li> So it was with some nervousness that I approached actually using the product for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it actually seems to allow a much better control of actual \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; length than was possible for me before with the floating guide on the T980...</li>
            <li> This is most likely due to cutter lubrication getting in there</li>
            <li> First, I thought that once I set trimmer for proper length, for me 5 mm.</li>
            <li> He wore the first one out and specifically asked for the same brand again.  </li>
            <li> I have a short beard and have tried many other brands before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two (first one last 5 years).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OLD time!</li>
            <li> Overall exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> cant say how disappointed i am that they discontinued the best trimmer ever made...</li>
            <li> One thing to be aware of is that, if you intend to use this product outside of the US, you will need an adaptor for your country of residance.</li>
            <li> The compartment that holds the hair needs to be cleaned out pretty regularly.  </li>
            <li> I use it probably 2-3 times per week to keep my beard in check, and with that the battery usually lasts a month or more.</li>
            <li> It works great, assuming you move slowly and work the same area several times.</li>
            <li> i left the first one at a hotel.</li>
            <li> For the price I would expect it to do a much better job than the $20 Target pickup from years past.</li>
            <li> Fans of the late lamented Norelco T980 vacuum beard trimmer will find a worthy replacement in the QT 4070, which does everything the T980 did and offers a better battery and illuminated display in the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Use your considerable influence, Amazon!  </li>
            <li> Also, unlike other people who purchased this trimmer, mine came with appropriate contour comb so no call to Philips was necessary (ordered in March of 2012).</li>
            <li> Gives me the exact same size of stubble throughout my beard and charges with no problems.</li>
            <li> Bought it after the battery in my old Norelco trimmer (which never lasted for more than a few trims) died completely.  </li>
            <li> I keep pretty short hair on my head and during work travels</li>
            <li> No small pieces, no moving parts, no chance of failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you only need the first 3 for a stubble</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of other trimmers and never been satisfied, but finally the QT4070 has come along.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 2-3 weeks into using this trimmer, and it is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> for the overall shave, it&#x27;s pretty inconsistent.</li>
            <li> I do not have a full   beard, just a partial, so your charging cycles will vary.</li>
            <li> So, I am still using the old one and counting the days until my new part shows up for the new model.  </li>
            <li> The positive attributes are the comb, which directs the hair in a particular way if you wish to have a longer length; and the adjustable hair lengths is the other positive attribute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my upper lip more than once using this thing, and I&#x27;m a very careful user.  </li>
            <li> What i found was that the second guard worked fine, but really didnt cut the stubble short enough.  </li>
            <li> Hair does not shake out as easily as with a removable trap, but the little tool brush helps sweep it out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s designed that way so that the little built-in vaccuum cleaner can easily suck up the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that you need to exercise a little caution with trimming your mustache on lower settings to avoid nicking your lip, but this is easily resolved by adjusting the angle of your cut.  </li>
            <li> easily, catches shavings an leaves little excess hair outof the unit.  </li>
            <li> WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE, EVE A CLUTZ LIKE I AM CAN DO WONDERS WITH THIS EASY TO USE DEVICE.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is better than the earlier one especially with the &amp;#34;Turbo-boost&amp;#34; switch.</li>
            <li> The regular speed and vacuum power is really more than enough, so I am wondering why they gave it a \\&quot;turbo boost\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> I like to get a nice clean line at the edge of my lip and the bulky trimmer prevents me from seeing where I&#x27;m cutting.  </li>
            <li> I have had other vacuum trimmers and one will be at the top in ranking.</li>
            <li> In order to keep the sink relatively clean I have to empty it 3 times to complete a bi-weekly trim.  </li>
            <li> This model is more difficult to clean out.  </li>
            <li> The Vacuum is weak but what a nice tool!</li>
            <li> This trimmer seemed to be the best reviewed - with the least serious complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I suppose the vacuum would have to be ten times stronger to meet my original expectations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time to shave my thick beard and it worked fine, just as expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I felt I had to write this review because the ones written so far seemed to be giving it a bad rap, and if there had been more positive reviews (I can only speak from my experience with my own medium length beard)</li>
            <li> the new positive reviews from the last 6 montys</li>
            <li> The included brush suffices to clean miscellaneous hairs stuck to the blades (which conveniently require no oiling or other maintenance).</li>
            <li> charging time.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shave as clean as some other trimmers - leaves about 1-1.5 mm.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is an excellent feature, but the blade head is too big and impossible to use for precise trimming (upper lip, sideburns, ect).  </li>
            <li> so i purchased this product because  the concept of Vacuum Beard interested me.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the vacuum feature works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I bought one of Norelco&#x27;s first vacuum beard trimmers some years ago.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum hair collector is a real plus!</li>
            <li> I miss the pop-up mustache trimmer that my first Norelco trimmer had, but the vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t leave room for one.</li>
            <li> The vacuum function does not work at all, after first use</li>
            <li> The one major complaint I have about this is that it kept catching and pulling on hairs which stung.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is neat and works pretty well.</li>
            <li> travel lock is great, it works well except hard to get in near the nose/mustache part of the beard due to</li>
            <li> I also used the trimmer on setting 6 or so to trim my mustache, something I&#x27;ve never really done before with any precision; the 4070 did a super efficient job, and for the first time ever my mustache actually looked neat and I felt I could rejoin society.  </li>
            <li> This product, with no attachment, WILL work to trim your beard down to a level where a once-over with normal razor will leave you with a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another issue is that due to the design of the blade guard, you cannot really trim right up under the nose.  </li>
            <li> I tried this on numerous occasions and it consitently missed hairs or left whole areas much longer or much shorter than everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually purchase this product from Amazon, I actually rushed by a local retail outlet even though I had to pay $10 more, since I had a professional engagement and needed grooming in a hurry.</li>
            <li> So in summary, I really have no clue why this product has such a high user rating.</li>
            <li> My problem with this trimmer, as many people have mentioned, is that it leaves a very uneven shave.</li>
            <li> There just flat out aren&#x27;t any good cordless trimmers that are strong enough/long lasting enough to get a beard trimmed up without it taking over 30 minutes and having to re-trim the same area over and over to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not very good for trimming mustache/under the nose, too bulky to get an even trim.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well it catches hair and reduces the mess in the sink for easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer vacuum collects a majority of the trimmed hairs and clean up is a breeze would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I am coming from a T970 which I enjoyed using for a couple years now, and one of the features I was sad to be losing was that the t970 came with a special detail trimming head if you remove the guide.  </li>
            <li> I love the LCD display, the life on the battery is long, the vacum really helps to reduce the mess.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the battery lasts forever and the built-in vacuum works great as long as the hair isn&#x27;t too long and isn&#x27;t wet.  </li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t shave everyday, the hairs start getting too heavy to be vacuumed properly, causing the vacuum feature to not be as awesome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vacuum on this model appears to be more powerful, picking up all my shorter hairs, and only having a bit of trouble with longer hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this beard trimmer because I have sensitive skin and live in the NE.  </li>
            <li> The new model uses a lithium ion battery versus the old NiCad -</li>
            <li> Are you going to spend nearly $30 for a new cutter head when you paid $45 for the unit?  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco T765 stopped charging, so I bought this new model.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Norelco T980 that I had used for 7 years with this new model Norelco QT4070.</li>
            <li> The month before the spring mechanism of the contour-following comb broke and that made the comb less comfortable.</li>
            <li> The QT4050 says the exact same thing, but the picture online for that product clearly shows the pivoting contour comb.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, it does shave closer, albeit slightly less comfortably.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer has the power to easy handle my goatee without pulling or missing</li>
            <li> I like how it trims everything easily and isn&#x27;t too messy.</li>
            <li> First the display started showing inaccurate information (ie battery level) and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn off until it died completely and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on at all.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the settings slipping, no problem with the suction which worked as well as anyone could expect and my beard trimmed evenly, quickly and perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Now I have a full set of facial hair that within several days grow quite out of control.</li>
            <li> something that would keep my beard short enough that I might still have a goatee as opposed to a full beard; yet, something that would preclude nicks and cuts that might cause breakouts.      </li>
            <li> Only reason i keep it is that it does a fair, not good job, of doing an even trim even for longer curly bread heard</li>
            <li> the only way to make it work again is to put it back on the charger for a full charging period.  </li>
            <li> However I am on my second and the first wasn&#x27;t even a year old.  </li>
            <li> my other clippers cut stubble nice and short,  they just don&#x27;t have a vacuum,  </li>
            <li> Im super careful when doing my lip because of all the warnings people had,</li>
            <li> so i was careful but still quite quick with it.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve had several occasions when a full battery is immediately drained, simply by pushing the power button.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid so far.</li>
            <li> I have to clean up far more after even a casual trim.</li>
            <li> It already came with the special guide mentioned by some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> He loves the product, he never gets nicks, the settings are very convenient and the little vacuum keeps the counter clean!</li>
            <li> , I would have preferred a washable trimmer instead of a vacuum system one, I spend more time cleaning the trimmer that cutting my beard, and the vacuum system isn&#x27;t perfect, it make some mess frequently.</li>
            <li> Be sure to open on the other side, I can see that a good pull on the wrong side could break the door.</li>
            <li> First off, my original prime order, was not marked as delivered until the third day, in which it never actually arrived.</li>
            <li> However after about one year&#x27;s use, one day all of sudden the battery just broke down and couldn&#x27;t hold any charge any more.</li>
            <li> I use it to keep a pretty consistent stubble and to shave down my sideburns.</li>
            <li> To some extent it really pulls the hair into vacuum chamber while trimming but not as much I expected, I still have to clean up the fallen hair.</li>
            <li> This new design trims just as well, and work a lot better in the tight spaces around my upper lip/nose.  </li>
            <li> First off the old one I have had a spring loaded slide where the vacuum would suck the whiskers.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t a competing product with built-in vacuum from any other manufacture, so I decided to go with the Qt4070 despite mixed reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not perfect, the battery is very good, one month of use with a single charge...</li>
            <li> Was very loud and the trim guard makes it hard to get the space between your top lip and your nose.</li>
            <li> If it lasts at least as long as my last one did (15 years), it truly will be a great investment.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s essentially mess free.</li>
            <li> trims very well, but the item i received is not the design of the one in the first picture, it is however the same as the pic further in the album.</li>
            <li> As one who is generally disappointed by nearly every gadget I buy in one way or another, I am surprised to say that this is indeed the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Overall, Good product with cool features but somehow has troubles cutting all my hairs.</li>
            <li> The little notches that keep it closed are cheap plastic and because it fills with hair so quickly, you have to use the door all the time.</li>
            <li> The Remington model is about half the price and ten times better at trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> But its impossible to have a perfect shave with only this machine.</li>
            <li> They are basically they same, although I got more with my T980 which I also paid less</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a definite step up from my older Norelco, which essentially had only the most basic feature of a trimmer:  </li>
            <li> Replaced the slightly older model as I forgot the older one when traveling back to the USA for an extended period.</li>
            <li> I like this unit due to the fact that the guard setting can simply be rotated in, a very cool feature.  </li>
            <li> I have down graded my original review to two stars and that is generous.</li>
            <li> I went with this one because the [[ASIN:B002C741MM Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer]] is selling for 4x the original cost due to demand!</li>
            <li> no mess!</li>
            <li> My old trimmer made a huge mess in the sink every time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different trimmers and have been less than happy.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item on the basis of reviews which said the device is fine, the problem is that they omitted the contour comb, but you can obtain the missing part by calling the company.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and so far I&#x27;ve used it for about 30-40 minutes in total and haven&#x27;t charged it since the initial charge.</li>
            <li> The previous version of this vacuum trimmer seemed to work better for me.  </li>
            <li> While better than my previous, the vacuum catches about 85% of the trimmings (even on the turbo setting)</li>
            <li> Quieter and this vacuum works better than the previous model I owned.</li>
            <li> I like a very little amount of stubble, so with this Norelco model I can trim my beard without a comb and just get a very close shave, without it being clean.</li>
            <li> Less trim blades than the previous model, importantly, and the reason for return, the new super battery does not hold a charge...</li>
            <li> To change the cut depth, you rotate a thumb-friendly control that both physically raises and lowers the removable guard, and also lights up a large and easy-to-see LED readout that gives the depth in millimeters.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know it is mine only like this or others also have same problem, but I am very dissapointed with battery life, I thought first that after few charges it will improve but it is same battery meter lines just drops and have to recharge it again, so I have to use it plugged most of the time.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am wrong on that, but one thing I am right on is this is not near as good as the old model I had at TRIMMING YOUR BEARD.  </li>
            <li> Large range of length settings, starting from 1mm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the new type \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot; is as good as the one on the old T980, but with a bit of attention it works well enough for me to do the job with only a little poking and snagging on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the chamber big enough, but even the vacuum \\&quot;tunnel\\&quot; (between blades and chamber) remains pretty free as well.</li>
            <li> Overall its a good product, but its difficult to judge if it is better than a trimmer at half</li>
            <li> Such a tremendous waste of resources and poor design on an otherwise great device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trimmer is less than 30 days old now and the vacuum chamber won&#x27;t close any more.</li>
            <li> The blades on this thing are cheap, which I tried to overlook, but my little Wahl Lithium ION has way nicer blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A helpless feeling came over me because as it grew, I knew the mess my trimmer would create became larger, and drowning in my own fear and facial hair</li>
            <li> There will still be some hairs left in the sink, but the vast majority of them are sucked up by the vacuum for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> Very different from the previous vacuum model, but I liked it.  </li>
            <li> And trimming directly with the metallic head works, but is not very pleasant - and the result could be better.  </li>
            <li> It trimmed so smoothly and with so little mess that I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working---until I checked my beard and the vacuum chamber and saw how well it was doing.</li>
            <li> Lastly, while the unit claimed to be able to hold an extra-long charge, in the two instances that I used it, the charge was completely gone after single and relatively brief beard trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Still long enough to clean up my beard...</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery and gone are the days where I have to clean up the sink when I&#x27;m done shaving/trimming.  </li>
            <li> I cannot more highly recommend a personal grooming item short of toilet paper, if it can be counted as such.</li>
            <li> Can run a little warm but that&#x27;s to be expected with any sheering mechanism as the friction builds up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I examined closely and the cheap little plastic tab on the door had basically worn out/bent in too far.</li>
            <li> It worked a little better in protecting my face because the space between the sides of the comb, in which the razor sits, was smaller</li>
            <li> The suction could be a little better, but it definitely helps keep things cleaner.</li>
            <li> it is hard to find a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> Hard to trim mustache area, and most importantly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a world where you have limited time to shave your face thicket and even less to clean the sink below you there comes the mighty Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li> My only complaint which existed on the T980 is that I have a hard time trimming right under my nose, I have to remove the guard and carefully trim my moustache area right under my nose, but I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at</li>
            <li> The vacuum does pick up most of the hair trimmings, however it does miss some and there still is a slight mess to clean up in the sink when finished.</li>
            <li> Works great on my husbands very thick roughage.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the vacuum container, but it certainly was not sufficient when i took off 2 months of beard growth.</li>
            <li> I only use it every other day during the work week but even using it every day you can easily get a week out of one charge.  </li>
            <li> The charge seems to last long, so you could get to those special places.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my first with the built in vacuum which does a fairly decent job of preventing larger cleanup efforts.  </li>
            <li> This cheaper design has a fixed head that has flexible, pointy tines that approach the blades from either side but leave a large gap over the blades themselves and the vacuum entrance.  </li>
            <li> No other trimmer had vacuum, and it really works well!</li>
            <li> Well, the vacuum part of it does seem to work, so the whiskers mostly end up in the little compartment.  </li>
            <li> Every day is just more than my husband is going to do, so I wish the vacuum was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Subjectively, the vacuum catches a little more hair than my old one, though still not all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No, it doesn&#x27;t get every whisker but it was so much better than no vacuum and worked at least as well as is reasonable to expect.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum is a little effective with pulling in next to 70-80% hair in the trimmer</li>
            <li> and it just seems like a huge waste of resources.</li>
            <li> On this unit, the Norelco engineers clearly decided to add an element of danger to the trimming process by modifying the design of the plastic guard, and thus leaving the blade virtually exposed on the shortest settings.  </li>
            <li> It is several upgrades form my last one especially with the lithium battery that makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> When you hold it, one can clearly see the length of the trim in millimeters and the remaining charge.</li>
            <li> Conversely, Philips did produce a \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; beard trimmer that was woefully under-performing and cumbersome, so this line of trimmers is clearly an improvement.</li>
            <li> I almost steered clear of this product based upon some of the reviews I read below.  </li>
            <li> , i always have to be careful where i trim (especially for the 0.5 stubble) because it makes a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;door hinge/lock&amp;#34; broke almost immediately</li>
            <li> The agent also mentioned that I can rinse the head under water, but the manual clearly says not to.</li>
            <li> The guard height is a backlit digital number - much easier to see than the old one.</li>
            <li> I made it extremely clear</li>
            <li> Its has a clear number display that lights up showing the head length.</li>
            <li> This is clearly a feature that Phillips either took out oradded at some point in the production.  </li>
            <li> The unit that I received did NOT have the guard with the spring actuating clear guard that follows the contours of your face.  </li>
            <li> They have made several improvements in this model over the old trimmer that I definitely appreciated.</li>
            <li> Much stronger than my old Norelco, which held on by a tiny clip&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Previously, the sliding piece would adjust to the angle of my skin and allow for a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Wife agreed to pay half to keep the sink clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve run the 2 units side by side, both fully charged, and suction difference of the vacuums can be clearly heard.  </li>
            <li> Catches about half what it cuts, so you still have to clean up.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a T980 Philips Norelco beard trimmer that was about 6 or 7 years old.</li>
            <li> It works and is okay, but it is not nearly as effective as the T980.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original Entry:&lt;br /&gt;Having read so much about the contour comb issue, I chatted with Philips-Norelco and got the following information.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have it near anything to accidently trigger it and drain it.</li>
            <li> &quot; his old beard and mustache trimmer</li>
            <li> I found that for very short whisker lengths this worked very well</li>
            <li> Just like my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s intended to do as far as trimming.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t even use it for a long time because it scratches your skin, and the metal teeth get so hot that burns you.</li>
            <li> They should of kept making the old T- 980</li>
            <li> So concerned that I contacted Norelco directly.  </li>
            <li> They fixed the spring loaded comb problem.</li>
            <li> I thought I would just need to be more delicate when shaving with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer to replace my old Norelco</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li> Then I waited with the unopened box for a week until I decided to risk opening it, and here the contour following comb was inside the box the whole time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably bump it up to 4 if I really like it, but not 5 for having to order an extra part.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten used to using on old Wahl Trim N Vac with the guard removed.  </li>
            <li> However I also have a goatee and trim it weekly with an old Norelco that was rechargeable but losing the ability to hold the charge.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use my old trimmer until Philips can install lithium batteries that can hold their charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow I believed this until I tried it.</li>
            <li> The trimmings have to go somewhere, and seeing where they go, at least, might be better than not seeing.</li>
            <li> ..I&#x27;ve noticed so far...</li>
            <li> They have fixed that issue here.  </li>
            <li> They direct hair into the row of blades for trimming, and the length at which they are set by the user should provide for an even trim.  </li>
            <li> You have too hold the trimmer nearly perpendicular to your face to get any trimming done.</li>
            <li> It trims and collects all the hair quite well, charges rapidly, and doesn&#x27;t nick my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used it once and returned it since trying to trim it was a hit/miss situation where in some part it completely removed my beard and in some part it cut to what I set it to.</li>
            <li> The beard length settings are way too far apart.  </li>
            <li> And as the cutter is near the corner of the shaver, it will go as close to a curved surface as you let it--no guide to help out.</li>
            <li> You can also shave very close with this trimmer (no guide on the corner), for those that want such a thing.</li>
            <li> For those like me with sensitive skin, not a plus.    </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine them coming up with this prototype and having guys try it who have used early models.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> And, although not the most convenient solution, there at least seemed to be a solution to the comb issue... call and ask for the contour comb.</li>
            <li> and I really like all the different sizes it has and the way it presents them.</li>
            <li> I had been using painter&#x27;s tape to keep my old trimmer from doing that.  </li>
            <li> I can re-use an old one but</li>
            <li> And of course the product has to be held at an angle to be used, the blades are set back from the leading edge, and no hair ever grows straight</li>
            <li> I asked my wife if it looks professional (and she thinks 24-36 hrs of beard on me does), and she said &amp;#34;no, that just looks like you haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple/few days.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Norelco T980 when it gave up after a couple of years.</li>
            <li> is complete each time.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, mind you, and not once has the trimmer nicked or cut it.  </li>
            <li> It cuts very well and I like that it has the digital readout for the blade length and battery strength.</li>
            <li> have a professional Wahl clippers that I will continue to use instead.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it worked</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t a big deal really.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does catch some, but it is by far &amp;#34;mess-free&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> And the LED display is a real plus especially for knowing when you need to charge it.</li>
            <li> Besides that fiasco, I was expecting some type of travel pouch to come with the trimmer, since on the Amazon product page, it clearly has pouch check marked as one of the features that comes with the 4070.</li>
            <li> Arrived early, and I have used the product for over a month without charging it.  </li>
            <li> It significantly reduces the mess that you would otherwise have if it didn&#x27;t collect any trimmings.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer stopped holding a charge and became a corded trimmer.</li>
            <li> It was not comfortable to use for precise trimming around the mouth and nose because it scratched/poked my lips and nostrils.  </li>
            <li> not cut even close to the claimed 1mm stubble setting, even with the guide completely removed</li>
            <li> so I am unable to write a detailed review, however he likes it and says it better than the last one he had.</li>
            <li> The blades are inset too far to work as a mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably one of the laziest people alive when it comes to beard grooming.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, isn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li> I prefer a medium to shorter length beard and found it either would not trim this length well, or would only trim for me at the stubble settings, much shorter than I preferred.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; setting is a bit ineffective and found it easier to remove the guard all together and take to the face directly.</li>
            <li> Ive used so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades seem absolutely identical to the T780, and that looks like the only component that is interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The blades seem absolutely identical to the T780, and that looks like the only component that is interchangeable.</li>
            <li> You need to hold the trimmer almost completely perpendicular to your skin to get the blades to touch the edges of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:October 2014</li>
            <li> but then you have to be near an outlet.</li>
            <li> At this point you might as well buy a $40 T-edger trimmer that will last you much longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i imagine i just got a defective unit as far as the battery goes,  </li>
            <li> Went straight back to this baby.</li>
            <li> i read most of the negative reviews</li>
            <li> This product really surprised me.</li>
            <li> this unit, the plastic is so soft on the blade guard that rather than causing the hair to stand up, the guard just bends.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nearly 2 years ago to the day.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned the trimmings out of the cutter unit and fixed the jam.  </li>
            <li> so Phillips have fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, however.  </li>
            <li> The QT4070 digital readout ensures I have it set to the correct length, and lets me know how much battery power remains.    </li>
            <li> I can diversify my professional look to a tailored beard or stubble</li>
            <li> After 3 years of ownership it died and the old model was replaced by this</li>
            <li> Problems started early on.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST , TRIMS A LOT MORE  </li>
            <li> Regardless, the trimmer came with one of the old style guides as well, so it looks like they&#x27;ve learned their lesson on that one.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a hurry or just don&#x27;t have the time for a complete shave then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco completely met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my old Philips trimmer that this one updated.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very well made trimmer.</li>
            <li> I used it on both the 1mm and 0mm (removing the guard completely) settings.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer is loud.</li>
            <li> My old one held a charge for years before giving up the ghost.  </li>
            <li> The bigger one included can still shave very close</li>
            <li> Removing the guard gives access to the clippers directly.  </li>
            <li> No problem trimming near nose area.</li>
            <li> I still cannot get the desired length I once had with my old trimmer....</li>
            <li> As a result, the trimmer either trims to a very close stubble length, or does not trim enough, depending on how you angle the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Oh also my old one use to flash orange when it needed to be charged</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco trimmer for years, but the old one had an irreparable fault.</li>
            <li> but when I tried to use it at my destination I found it completely</li>
            <li> Caught nearly all of the beard.</li>
            <li> Does not trim as closely as my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> It indeed has the spring-loaded comb as well as a fixed one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the fixed comb yet but having it means that if the spring loaded one gets damaged you can still use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This Norelco can&#x27;t do it nearly as close.  </li>
            <li> the \\&quot;old technology\\</li>
            <li> It has now died completely after 2 years and 3 months post-purchase.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m really surprised this isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li> If you use this on your head, you must not tilt the trimmer at all or your hair will be exposed directly to the blades.  </li>
            <li> The Qt4070 is the updated version of my old Philips Norelco Turbo beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After three months Fox Industries contacted me directly to take care of the back-ordered part issue.  </li>
            <li> It felt like it was pulling them out completely rather than trimming them.</li>
            <li> The two comb guards that provide height adjustment don&#x27;t completely cover the clippers.  </li>
            <li> Overall very satisfy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> However, you can fully retract the length guide and expose the cutters so that you can have complete</li>
            <li> the turbo is a joke, just loud.</li>
            <li> (that finally completely wore out).&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Mine came with both covers so the company must have got the feedback and fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> If my old one had a corded mode I would probably still be using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmings door broke early on.</li>
            <li> It is much faster and easier to do the two-phase approach (trimmer, then blade shave) than to try to make a five-blade razor chop through 1/4 to 1/2 inch facial hair.</li>
            <li> So far it has fulfilled its purpose.  </li>
            <li> Vacuums up about 80% of trimmings; all problems that the device might once have had seem completely resolved.</li>
            <li> Definitely a dual-use device that performs very well.</li>
            <li> Overall, really dig it.</li>
            <li> The unit is much bulkier than my last one.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon Shopper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be clear, for the vast majority of you, this trimmer is not likely to be worth $50.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cordless, which is convenient, but I&#x27;m rarely far from the sink, so I can&#x27;t comment on battery life.  </li>
            <li> So far he hasn&#x27;t had any problems, but he worries a bit that the door that holds the hairs might break eventually.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I remove the comb completely and just trim away.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t use the combs, I cut directly to the lowest hair length.</li>
            <li> Also the comb adjustment is stiffer and the comb doesn&#x27;t accidentally change position during use like the old Norelco used to sometimes.</li>
            <li> and god forbid you get near the beard</li>
            <li> so I decided they would have fixed the issue.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this newer model and found out that I mis-calculated - they do not seem to have fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li> QT 4070 does as advertised but it&#x27;s loud ...</li>
            <li> Replaced my old Norelco and it is improved over that one.</li>
            <li> He had another Norelco shaver, but it wasn&#x27;t quite as loud.</li>
            <li> My early bday gift to self was quite a treat.  </li>
            <li> Husband loves it as now does my 17 year old son.</li>
            <li> So far this trimmer does as advertised.</li>
            <li> had to have it replaced 3 times as the trap door busted twice and the sucking action stopped.</li>
            <li> A replacement for my 5 year old version.  </li>
            <li> no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Depending on your beard size and how much you trim, you may have to do multiple empties of the hair trap.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> You would literally have to be &amp;#34;duck facing&amp;#34; while placing the trimmer vertically directly onto your lip.</li>
            <li> So far, it does well, but I do hope this trimmer lasts even a fraction of the 10 years my Wahl Trim-n-Vac lasted.</li>
            <li> The charge holds for a pretty long time and when it eventually withers connect it to the outlet and finish what you started.</li>
            <li> However, the trimmer motor is somewhat loud so Norelco should do something about this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a modest beard going on, and this trimmer (with the adjustable guard) fits the bill.</li>
            <li> When I searched online and saw the relatively low price, I was ready to purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall the trimmer is constructed really well and feels efficient to use.  </li>
            <li> Amazon replaced it in a timely fashion, and second one works very well.  </li>
            <li> Does everything the description says it will do, neat features so far no complaints.  </li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an old Remington unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, the shave has been closer.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power and no problems so far.</li>
            <li> This unit could not hold a charge (while off) overnight which is a far cry from 50 minutes of run time Norelco advertised.</li>
            <li> but this trimmer is too loud to notice that.</li>
            <li> My only real problem with it is that the door broke after about two weeks and now will not stay shut.</li>
            <li> This is the old one for reference:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have for years old model Norelco beard trimmer</li>
            <li> Another observation is that my moustache is harder to trim than my beard even though it is not thicker than the latter, perhaps it is related to the nature of my own anatomy than to this product in order to give the benefit of the doubt to the latter.</li>
            <li> Maybe cause I work out and lift weights frequently, I like heavier things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Norelco trimmer died after years of service.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the whole point of a beard trimmer is to get all of your hair trimmed neatly to the same length.  </li>
            <li> I received both head attachments and neither one works well for me; even the nicer spring loaded one tends to catch my lip while I attempt to trim up close near my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not have this problem with my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li> This one is working well so far.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised at what the device turned out to be...</li>
            <li> Initial impressions were very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels much ligher than the T980 while offering a seemingly larger hair chamber and the LCD display, which deserves its obligatory mention.</li>
            <li> also really like the adjustable length guide and the digital display.</li>
            <li> Also unlike my old razor, this Phillips does not require oil.</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace my old T-970.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to person&#x27;s looking for a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t break the bank and offers a quality shave.</li>
            <li> one &amp; ONLY gripe: this thing REALLY needs a</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s 6 months old.</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> Pros - holds a charge and charges fast, neat display, vac actually works, you can use it plugged in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my old Panasonic did.</li>
            <li> I prefer the fixed head because I find it easier to manipulate but not by much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old trimmer did it will as the settings were without comb&lt;br</li>
            <li> but also the alternate floating guide that so many have lamented is missing.  </li>
            <li> I used some heavy duty Wahl clippers for a while, and it worked okay, but they are big and bulky.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go any further if don&#x27;t mind to spend few bucks more.</li>
            <li> be worth getting the &amp;#34;downgraded&amp;#34; model and the extra money does not gain extra quality.</li>
            <li> love my old one, but it is missing a tine on its contour following comb.  </li>
            <li> They tried to make it more compact but the bristles are too short and firm.</li>
            <li> but it was ok, just like a standard shave cut -- healed in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will likely rate better once I receive and can use the missing the piece.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;d like to cut straight to the small things that have stuck out to me rather than do a full review  Pros -Charged</li>
            <li> I am surprised that a product with such good reviews can perform so poorly.    </li>
            <li> The charge holds for a few hours, and it stays within the machine for a few weeks without loosing charge, so that&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li> works well, good trimming, with adjustable length of cut,but vacumn effect ois mediocre</li>
            <li> Good razor, but over-priced and useless features.</li>
            <li> It seems difficult to find a good beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the guide is made using flexible prongs which bend a good 3-4mm.</li>
            <li> I was unable to get as good a trim on my face, where I keep my beard at 4 mm, as with the old 980--it</li>
            <li> They have been good about reembursing me for those items but it gets tiresome dealing with them and the paper</li>
            <li> Looks like a good and well designed product, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging time and power was good (one hour for full charge).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I keep my stubble shorter than this shaver was really good for.</li>
            <li> The vacuuming is good but not perfect - there will still be some hair on and around the sink.</li>
            <li> Turbo is outstanding for thick stuble.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is not great but works as good as my old one did.    </li>
            <li> hint bring back the old one!!!</li>
            <li> While this does a great job as a shaver the implementation of the vacuum is flawed.</li>
            <li> Vacuum doesn&#x27;t suck up everything but to be expected and still a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Once you have used a vacuum beard trimmer, you won&#x27;t want to go back to a trimmer without this useful</li>
            <li> The vacuum is surprisingly useful, the length selector feels sturdy and the device feels well made overall.</li>
            <li> - The vacuum feature of this trimmer picks up about 70% of the hair that would normally get all over the sink when using a normal razor/trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I love the vacuum feature on this trimmer, however the door that holds the waste bin doesn&#x27;t stay secured.  </li>
            <li> but then I realized the vacuum function from this is actually quite useful if you plan on trimming hair on your head which otherwise can get quite</li>
            <li> I doubted the vacuum would be of much worth, but it actually caught about 90% of the hair.</li>
            <li> Tried all angles and hair stills falls and makes a lot of mess that have to clean, with and without turbo funcion</li>
            <li> The vacuum function really eliminates the mess and clean up.  </li>
            <li> it reduces the mess I had to clean up before.</li>
            <li> Turn the vacuum on and be amazed at how it collects so much of the trimmed ends.</li>
            <li> that said it&#x27;s still much cleaner than without the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum thing works very well, but don&#x27;t expect it to work with out emptying the cut hairs.</li>
            <li> the vacuum function... doesn&#x27;t get it all, but really prevents a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite some reviews that disagreed on the vacuum effectiveness, I do feel it works very well.</li>
            <li> The built-in vacuum make for a much cleaner and neater bathroom sink surface.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think the vacuum system really ever worked</li>
            <li> whole vacuum thing is a joke.  </li>
            <li> Well it can trim a beard, but the vacuum gimmick is really just that</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature makes it very neat to use.</li>
            <li> The vacuum cleaner of the Norelco really works well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is very helpful, as it can be used anywhere.</li>
            <li> The vacuum function works well except if you trim too much at once</li>
            <li> A trimmer without the vacuum feature like I&#x27;ve used for years is much easier to use for this purpose.</li>
            <li> The vacuum also works very well, capturing 95% of the clippings I&#x27;d estimate.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum does not make it really &amp;#34;mess-free&amp;#34; but it just makes it produce &amp;#34;less mess&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Vacuum system doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> and I really like the vacuum.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works a little better than the earlier model, but is a&lt;br /&gt;little more difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> I thought the vacuum was not going to work very</li>
            <li> It does vacuum much of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum really works trapping hairs.</li>
            <li> I end up with just as much hair in the sink when I shave as I do in the vacuum container.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the vacuum doesn&#x27;t really work that</li>
            <li> I really like how it trims my beard, the vacuum feature, and its ability to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> The vacuum didnt pick up a whole lot either.</li>
            <li> so i use the &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; less pointy head which is better suited to the long lengths as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my previous model I was always trying to remember how long it had been and guess how many trims I had left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the battery life isn&#x27;t so long, I had a previous model, which had a much better battery&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> If you have long facial hair or move too quickly the trimmer won&#x27;t collect it all</li>
            <li> One is pointy and inaccurate and the other ones shortest length starts at around 2.5mm length... making it hard to get a good clean-ish scruff look.  </li>
            <li> If four or five hairs in a sink bothers you then the trimmer isn&#x27;t the issue if you know what I mean :)  </li>
            <li> My husband has a beard longer than the maximum trim length of this shaver, but, since he does cut his sideburns and shave his neck (or, rather, lets me do so), and since his 20-year old Norelco is getting very tired, I figured this was a good tool to try out for the job.    </li>
            <li> and I generally get a new trimmer every 3 years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s essentially the old T980 in a new shape with an upgraded Li-ion battery and some fancy new display technology.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a big gap in the guard that you could easily stick your chin all the way down into.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Strong trimmer (doesn&#x27;t bog down through my thicker facial</li>
            <li> The receptacle that the vacuum feed to is tiny and once it fills up the hair will cease to be vacuumed and head right for the sink.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is very clean and sleek - it fits comfortably in the hand, has a cord that attaches to its bottom, not someplace inconvenient like a side (you can use it plugged in or not), and the controls are intuitive.</li>
            <li> I was almost detered due to the ones about \\&quot;huge gap between the guard\\&quot; and \\&quot;mawwing your upper lip\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Although it picked up about 90% of the hair, enough hair was left on the bottom of the sink, to require further clean up.  </li>
            <li> I know that the comb head can be removed, and I&#x27;ve done precisely that, but the blade does not feel sharp enough to do precision marking.</li>
            <li> In the past it was easy to start trimming at a setting</li>
            <li> It is not so easy to get into small spaces like under your nose.  </li>
            <li> also use it to trim my hair and it gets pretty much all of it, really mess</li>
            <li> The door that houses the cut hairs is opened slightly now, but it is not bad....</li>
            <li> Clipped hairs are vacuumed into a small but efficient little holding area under the blade, and it&#x27;s easy to dump out the hair and clean the hopper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as how effective the vacuum is, it&#x27;s no better or worse than a Remington I used for many years.</li>
            <li> They have reduced the overall size of the unit from past systems and it is now a very comfortable size.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the trimmer due to the 20+ positive reviews and the lack of a decent alternative.   </li>
            <li> The trimmer comes with a little brush to clean it up with when you are finished using it, and for those who travel, there is a travel-lock that prevents the unit from accidently being bumped on during travel.</li>
            <li> Works really well and sucks up 80% of all the hairs that are trimmed and saves the clean up time by a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older version of this same trimmer because the old one wasn&#x27;t holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent replacement for my old Norelco trimmer (which broke when I dropped it in the sink.</li>
            <li> The built in guard quickly slides up and down to adjust the length</li>
            <li> Worked fine last spring, but took it out to trim my new winter beard, and DEAD.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always been happy with the design however the QT4070 is a production FAIL!</li>
            <li> i forgot to say no mess</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> No mess anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The text on the box says it \\&quot;captures hair for no mess in the sink.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> cleaner is &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;  option, as there is no mess after trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought both this and the other &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; based shaver from Remington to test them side by side, and the Phillips wins by a mile.  </li>
            <li> The attachment does come completely off to expose the base blade but it still doesn&#x27;t seem to cut very close, my older cheaper one cuts closer somehow, for more special places.</li>
            <li> Better than my previous Norelco which lasted 15 years!!!</li>
            <li> : It is tough to determine exactly where the cut will stop, so if precision is important this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a very modern, sleek looking device with a digital readout of the guide height in millimeters (and analog scales on opposite sides of the guide that indicate guide height in both mm and</li>
            <li> This replaced a less expensive Wahl and I must say it is far superior and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> other than that, it is easy to use and keeps it charge for a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost unusable on my melon, because when I turn it upside down to do the top of my head, the suction is barely enough to keep any stubble in the catch compartment and it clogs almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> -The vacuum does not work anywhere near as well as it did with the older T980.  </li>
            <li> The blade is wide, I wish it came with additional smaller sizes that you could put on, for those special places.</li>
            <li> Cons: It heats up pretty fast, when I turn on the vacuum it stops after about 10 sec.</li>
            <li> The vacuum part works pretty much as well as can be expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, without the vacuum working better, it was just not worth keeping and had to go back.</li>
            <li> But the little plastic \\&quot;door\\&quot; which houses the captured hair is very cheap and it&#x27;ll become loose</li>
            <li> No bulbous weird shapes like some other brands, and now the inclusion of a more modern, light-weight and compact switching power supply that accepts 100V-240V means the kit is lighter overall and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is not 100%, but it gets most so that a simple wipe down on the sink gets rid of all the remaining hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Norelco elctric razors since the early 80&#x27;s, so I had high hopes for the Philips Norelco Qt4070/41 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I&#x27;d rather clean up whiskers from the sink than have my goatee look uneven and not straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he cut his mole with it, which I can understand happens, but I find the length not low enough for a sexy shadow, slightly scruffy but not lumberjack level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is the case with this trimmer as it seems to shave stubble fine on the cheeks and chin yet</li>
            <li> I think the battery is better, but its not fair to compare it against an old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As many other reviewers, I found this unit to be uncomfy to use in that  the guide blade is too sharp and catches your skin.   </li>
            <li> but the fine trim head should be included, especially for those that did not have the previous model.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my older, smaller Norelco I trimmer I had for years.</li>
            <li> Battery charged quickly, and it comes with two different trimmer guides, and the last model only had one.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I use the trimmer mainly for beard stubble</li>
            <li> This trimmer does the job decently well, but several gripes lower the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the comb head is much more solid yet flexible, although the trimmer is pretty weak, which is why I bought this other trimmer in the first place.</li>
            <li> In particular, I also appreciate how short you can trim your beard using the comb.  </li>
            <li> The first one I owned after a couple of months it would not shut properly, so it would open up while shaving and hair would fall all over the place.</li>
            <li> cannot use the turbo charger anymore, an &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; is displayed on the screen and the trimmer stops working completely; sometimes the same happens during normal use!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had an older version of the Norelco beard trimmer which I used regularly until the hair collection cup fell apart.</li>
            <li> I had an older model that finally died.</li>
            <li> but this is second best, just because i dont want to risk being disappointed by anyone else.  </li>
            <li> All functions are exactly the same as listed on the box and the shaver is the same one.</li>
            <li> Have recently acquired my first ever &amp;#34;Trial Run&amp;#34; of facial growth - and am</li>
            <li> Norelco is always releasing better and newer models, which makes your efforts pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> The only way to get a decent trim out of this thing is to use NO ATTACHMENT AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> Then, I had to do two separate requests for the paperwork to send this back because the first time their customer service team totally forgot.</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer several times and it does a decent god trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li> i opened it for the first time and found it doesn&#x27;t work just after i flew back to China last month.</li>
            <li> My older similar model lasted about 8 years.  </li>
            <li> So immediately bought this model as it looks similar to my older model, with the exception of the display.</li>
            <li> Decent enough trimmer, but</li>
            <li> I had a older model of the same trimmer and this replaces it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> The different length settings up to 18mm, was the main factor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace the older version of the same product.</li>
            <li> Storage chamber for the hair is very small, other thatn that it is good to use and compact to store for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> Not bad as long as the hair is not too long.</li>
            <li> The door to remove the accumulated hair is a little fragile (could easily break).</li>
            <li> I would rather the vacuum feature work less effectively in order to have the trimmer work as expected - if a trade-off is required.</li>
            <li> Meaning, it will have to be plugged in for a little longer than it takes you to shave to stay at full battery.  </li>
            <li> Second, the vacuum feature did not work to pull the trimmed hairs into the device; instead, it seemed to scatter the hairs all over the sink and the surrounding area to a much greater extent than my previous trimmer</li>
            <li> It actually takes longer to clean with the vacuum because I have to detail the vacuum chamber with a small brush on top of just swishing some water around in the sink and using a piece of toilet paper to mop up any hairs around the sink.</li>
            <li> Ive owned several vacuum shavers and all worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Vacuum Beard Trimmer and this operates smoother than the first.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum actually does work well and the settings a pretty precise.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> The vacuum actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li> : the cutter can&#x27;t get the right angle tp trim mustache edge due to part of the housing being in the way.</li>
            <li> Also, the other reviews say you have to call and order the right trimming head, although they since have updated it</li>
            <li> This trimmer was really sharp right after I had purchased it.</li>
            <li> you have been chosen to deliver the opening speech at a last-minute high society affair - no problem, it operates while plugged into any 5-star establishment&#x27;s standard AC outlet, so you can use it</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, here are the high and low points of the trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you need somethign to keep that beard/goatee trimmed on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This one seems to have the same high quality.  </li>
            <li> He highly recommends it and it last for years.  </li>
            <li> I thought to myself, I don&#x27;t want to waste $20-30 dollars on a cheaper trimmer and find out that I don&#x27;t really like it, because I was too cheap to buy a more expensive trimmer with features I wanted.</li>
            <li> - it took off the hairs cleanly and quickly, with just a couple of strokes (I had to play with the orientation a bit - you need to stroke with the closed part of the guard forward, not the open side, or you&#x27;ll get choppy results).</li>
            <li> the vacuum is not the end all be all of keeping the sink clean, there is plenty that it doesn&#x27;t pick up, but generally it works well enough and the vacuum does help to keep things cleaner.</li>
            <li> not saying it gets all of the hair, but easily 80% of the hair is sucked up into the little vacuum compartment.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Perhaps a consistent cut on a flat surface however my face and chest are not flat.</li>
            <li> The vacuum section makes it a little clunky and not that easy to get an even trim across the face.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for business trips (to avoid carrying the power cord) and the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> The clever vacuum system keeps the hairs from ending up all over the place</li>
            <li> bought this to replace my older turbo vacuum model....</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace an older Norelco Vacuum Beard unit I used for YEARS.  </li>
            <li> ..the main feature for me was the vacuum feature: it does not work as advertised plenty of hair is going</li>
            <li> the battery holds a decent charge and the vacuum function somewhat works (not the problem).</li>
            <li> I have a plug in of a similar shaver/beard trimmer that has a vacuum that is much better at maintaining the mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Philips Norelco&#x27;s older vacuum model, which could not do a stubble beard.  </li>
            <li> The main reasons for my purchase was the vacuum system that captures hair inside the trimmer handle as you cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update my review in a few months down the road, with a better overall opinion compared to this first impression of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I called Philips Norelco about having it fixed to keep hair from spilling out all over my counter, and they told me my only option was to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco Qt4050 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer, Black]], which seems to be a good combination between the other two Norelco Vacuum beard trimmers,</li>
            <li> Big improvement over my past trimmer - strong motor that does  great job trimming, has a long lasting battery and even a power boost for tough beards.  </li>
            <li> The levels are fairly satisfying as well, you can keep a decently long beard tame with this thing, so</li>
            <li> : Doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate waste, Reservoir fills up quickly</li>
            <li> There is still a small mess to clean at the sink, but it may take about 15 seconds to clean up.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this also leads to a better cut from what I&#x27;ve seen so far, as previous razors would discard trimmings onto the head while shaving leading to a &#x27;rough&#x27; hairline profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> My only gripe with it is that it is very loud, when trimming your face near your ears.</li>
            <li> Requires frequent cleanups even during a single use as the vacuume does not work very well.  </li>
            <li> I keep my facial hair trimmed to 4 mm (setting # 4, pretty short) and the vacuum clipping storage compartment is large enough to not need emptying until after trimming</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for its vacuum.</li>
            <li> The vacuum scoop is right up against the blade and is just as long</li>
            <li> I really like the gauge that gives the length, and it seems plenty powerful to quickly take down relatively thick hair.</li>
            <li> One of them did a too short trimming than I set it to, but on the second cone it was decent, but it didn&#x27;t feel like it was cutting right with this cone, maybe because of the vaccuum, which by the way, does a nice job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 80% of the standard hair mess is not on my counter due to this amazing trimmer.  </li>
            <li> There were a few reviews that commented on the guard being terrible, but Philips is now shipping this clipper with the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; guard as well as the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; one, and the good one is great.  </li>
            <li> product stays charged for a long time, the display works really well and is responsive.</li>
            <li> Like the instructions say, start long and progress shorter to get a feel for how it cuts, you get the hang of it fast.</li>
            <li> I like the vacuum, but too much plastic around the trimming edge makes it hard to get a close precise trimming.</li>
            <li> Clearly this was a well used personal groomer complete with stubble residue!</li>
            <li> There is a small plastic piece that snaps into the housing of the trimmer to secure the door and that piece broke off.</li>
            <li> Light weight, small size compared to a lot of wired trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems so far to work fine, but hard to get the beard uniform in length.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time and charges fast.  </li>
            <li> For the 50 bucks people pay for this thing, one might think Norelco could throw a small moustache comb into the box (fortunately, I retained the one that did come with the Wahl Trim-n-Vac).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast so it never gets tangled even on long hair.</li>
            <li> Light and small for travel.</li>
            <li> I use it daily instead of normal combing and forego the 1 to 2 week haircut I would otherwise need.</li>
            <li> I used to trim every two or three days, since cleanup with a normal trimmer is such a chore.  </li>
            <li> Simple enough and quite fun actually.</li>
            <li> Call Phillips, who now seem to be aware of the problem, and they will send you the closed comb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vacuum door opens too easily so can make a mess if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li> It broke of within the first couple of month requiring scotch to keep door closed.  </li>
            <li> I had to return the first one because the LCD got destroyed after shaving a wet beard.</li>
            <li> maybe about the same amount a the qt4050, and motor is louder at normal than it</li>
            <li> After a few months the battery shows full charge.</li>
            <li> negative I have is that the plastic door on the front that holds the vaccumed hair will come open and doesnt have a good latch on it to stay closed.</li>
            <li> ;  It&#x27;s true, you don&#x27;t have clippings flying all over the counter, nor is it without a few.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it for a few minutes in the morning, plug it in to charge it, and it reports full charge.</li>
            <li> It seems with this trimmer that being afraid to make some minor mistake is not the way to go if you expect to have a nice even shave, and no you do not have to apply pressure, just let it trim the full length of hair up to your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever use turbo because I just don&#x27;t consider my facial hair to be thick enough to be worthy of it, but I may try using it more in the future for the vacuum</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one little problem and that&#x27;s the difficulty of getting the little bit of mustache hair right below the nostril, not so easy to pull my lip out that far.</li>
            <li> (but what isn&#x27;t nowadays), but unit and parts are tight when assembled gently and work very well for an under $50 clipper.</li>
            <li> the vacuum doesn&#x27;t capture every hair but far less to clean than before.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that the trimmer takes a minimum of an hour to charge for full use and they (Philips Norelco) experimented with a vacuum to catch the hair in a compartment which could work as an advantage (for users with short beards) or disadvantage (for users with long beards).</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of clean up to do, but it is way easier to clean up the little hair that is missed than when I had no vacuum.</li>
            <li> This maintenance free trimmer includes a vacuum system that captures cut hair, keeping the mess off the bathroom counter and in the sink.</li>
            <li> Would really recommend someone who wants not a clean, but close, shave give this a go.</li>
            <li> shortcoming, at least for me, is the blade doesnt prtrude long enough to easily trim/edge without the attachment afixed.&lt;br /&gt;Suppose for that I would need one of the professional models, whihc wasnt exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Lastly, anyone looking for a vacuum beard trimmer will be hard-pressed for other options, as there just aren&#x27;t that many vacuum trimmers out there.  </li>
            <li> Also the length guide seems to get in the way of getting close with the trimmer to certain areas such as my upper lip close to my nose.  </li>
            <li> If you use the trimmer with the turbo function, you get a decent suction and also a decent cut as long as you use the contour following comb.</li>
            <li> after 6 weeks of ownership, it no longer holds a charge.&lt;br /&gt;After fully charging the unit, it&#x27;s good for no more than 3 trims - that&#x27;s less than 10 minutes of actual usage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its REALLY hard to find a strong performing beard trimmer now days</li>
            <li> /&gt;Knowing of the many stories of the little hair-compartment door breaking, I&#x27;m being very careful when opening and closing that, and so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean up has now been reduced to simply washing the missed trimmings down the sink, and dumping the trimming compartment&lt;</li>
            <li> The reviews here go back to 2010 with complaints that the contour head was not supplied as advertised, and yet, nearly 2 years later, mine arrived in exactly the same condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much a long affair in the shower with my current trimmer, as my stubble just goes everywhere and normally covers the entire bathroom.</li>
            <li> It looks cool, and there are fancy digital displays to remind you just which setting you are on, but the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; leaves my beard scraggily and uneven, with hairs that refuse to be cut no matter how slowly, how many times, or in which direction I run the appliance.  </li>
            <li> I have seen so many other units its for so much less money, but I have no idea if they would perform like this one.</li>
            <li> and are not the same as the arbitrary units used by many other trimmers, so use a not-very-close setting to start with until you get a feeling for the settings or you may end up with a shorter beard than you planned.</li>
            <li> Head of the trimmer is too wide and flat to fit a human face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only other missing element is the travel pouch which was nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> Just be certain not to put a loose fold of skin into the cutters, it CAN cut the skin if you do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First one I got did not work, Amazon took it back and sent me a new one.  </li>
            <li> : Do you think a new amazon order will include it, or would they have inventory dating back before it was included?&lt;br /&gt;Mack</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like about this new model is it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel pouch.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is life-changing and no man who wears stubble daily should have to live without this.  </li>
            <li> They added a  new Li-iion battery, a new TINY auto-switching power adapter ( I travel a lot with it) and a digital read-out of the trim setting.</li>
            <li> The new comb is a solid piece of plastic that does the job and has no parts that can break.</li>
            <li> There are only a couple things about this trimmer that I didn&#x27;t like but that I can live with.</li>
            <li> That said, I fear this new unit will be plagued with the same issues.</li>
            <li> Bought a new one to replace a lost one of same type.</li>
            <li> $30.00 total they wanted to get a new part sent.</li>
            <li> this beard trimmer was meant to replace the existing basic beard trimmer I already have, I&#x27;ll compare this new model to it.</li>
            <li> new trimmer is about 1&amp;#34; longer than my existing unit, and definitely thicker.</li>
            <li> I received my new trimmer last week and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try</li>
            <li> The trimmer finally started to wear out, so it was time to shop for a new one.</li>
            <li> I had used cheap trimmers and some of those interchangeable numbers (does anybody ever really use the nose trimmer adapter?) and wanted to step up my game a bit.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable feature is great for cutting the beard and mustache and different lengths.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected: simple, clean, adjustable, european plug adaptor without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> significantly reduces the mess around your sink.&lt;br /&gt;-Duel AC and battery operation protect you from the rechargeable battery dying mid trim.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesnt get all hair or give a very even neat trim without SEVERAL passes, who knows maybe my face fur is coarse</li>
            <li> The offset on the head also makes it less useful for trimming the hair around my ears, etc.</li>
            <li> (This is readily evidenced by pulling up hair at different spots in your beard and seeing completely different hair lengths).  </li>
            <li> I really hope the Philips Norelco engineers \\&quot;run\\&quot; back to the drawing board, and ensure the next generation of this trimmer re-focuses on quality and effectiveness of its core features.</li>
            <li> I really hope the Philips Norelco engineers \\&quot;run\\&quot; back to the drawing board, and ensure the next generation of this trimmer re-focuses on quality and effectiveness of its core features.</li>
            <li> big thing for me since i constantly forget to charge it is that you cannot really use it while charging, the cable doesn&#x27;t stay in place at all</li>
            <li> understand why so many negative reviews, am I not enough of a razor expert in order to critique it further?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was worth the upgrade from the previous</li>
            <li> - I have use for only the contour-following comb.&lt;br /&gt;The unit works well under all the same conditions I used the T780.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco has always done some things on all their rechargeable products that are customer-hostile and have really irked me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I use it for total hair cuts (my hair is very short) and it works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The digital guides make it much easier to know what length you&#x27;re about to trim to and keeps you from having to keep up with multiple beard guides (which I always lose)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since this is my second one, I have been very cautious with it, yet the result is the same.</li>
            <li> Really, the guide fingers are like cats claws, and too thin to file smooth.)   </li>
            <li> only thing I miss is a timer of how much battery I have left, in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is the wide trimming blades, which measure at least 1-1/4 inches.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of my husband old trimmer that didn&#x27;t really give him a clean look to his beard.</li>
            <li> I have a 12+ year old norelco shaver (from my pre-beard years) that I still use occasionally and a 5+ year old norelco beard trimmer that&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;as</li>
            <li> works well on African american hair too, very close shave.</li>
            <li> Already, it&#x27;s developed the same problems as my old one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the old model, it was completely removable, except the fastening tabs were so fragile they broke within weeks.</li>
            <li> The door latch only seems to last about 5-6 months no matter how gentle you treat it.</li>
            <li> In fact, this is so annoying I almost took two stars off, but I still think it&#x27;s the best trimmer out there for the basic task.</li>
            <li> The old version was 10x better, this one is worse in every way.</li>
            <li> but I just think they&#x27;re either misusing the product or are just being super harsh.</li>
            <li> This is an adequate product, but I find that the design of the clips tends to make the trimming uneven.  </li>
            <li> This is because of the hair vacuum vent on the top creates distance between the trimmer head and face which makes it hard to get a close trim.</li>
            <li> Digital height read out is nice but unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> This is not a double trimmer, it only works (barely) when you have the comb on and want to trim your beard with a certain number.</li>
            <li> only use the &amp;#34; &amp;#34;contour following comb&amp;#34;&amp;#34;, as the other one is pretty much useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still when i want an actual good trim i have go back with my other small trimmer to adjust what this trimmer missed.</li>
            <li> It does an outstanding job cutting and the vacuum catches all hair so my sink stays clean.  </li>
            <li> They have also improved the vacuum system on the new models.    </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is new to me</li>
            <li> vacuum is new to me.</li>
            <li> The vacuum system actually works very well.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;vacuum&#x27; deal is a mixed bag of tricks - it doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li> but the suction on the vacuum is far, FAR inferior.  </li>
            <li> It even has a vacuum that sucks up most of the hair.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Qt4070/41 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro, first of all ... has a really long name.</li>
            <li> Vacuum function not perfect but catches a good deal of hair.</li>
            <li> Vacuum will not capture all hair but significantly reduces mess.</li>
            <li> This shaver is nice but not great if you were looking to have a shaver that has a quality vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> It really does catch 90% of the hairs which is way better than other vacuum trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> The major flaw is with the plastic guard that is supposed to cover the blade.  </li>
            <li> Three problems, two of them major.    </li>
            <li> Major:</li>
            <li> Personally I never get that involved with exact measurements when sculpting facial hair, but for the facial enthusiasts your need for preciseness will be satiated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this was my first trimmer, I think having bought other ones makes me somewhat viable as a reviewer.      </li>
            <li> The edges are not sharp at all now.</li>
            <li> Seeing as I need to shave a little more often than once every two weeks I had to resort to other buying options.</li>
            <li> Majorly reduces beard hair all over the vanity/sink.</li>
            <li> Major pain.</li>
            <li> This is a major part of that.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried the first comb, the one provided on the machine (there is another, alternate comb in the box), but it works well enough.</li>
            <li> (A major turn off to a GF or wife).</li>
            <li> dumb idea, why not put it on the bottom like remington USED to make instead of the top front.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Few things I found that could be better are, the flap which holds the collected hair is weak.</li>
            <li> The more number of times I opened, the latch got weak.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a major pro for me.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has two major faults.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the smaller models even without the comb attached and the size makes it harder to get the edges and corners right without hitting their surroundings.</li>
            <li> The battery did not last very long at all on the first charge, but that seems to have been a fluke.</li>
            <li> The brush for cleaning the collected hairs and such is small and easy to lose.</li>
            <li> Even if you are trying hard to keep the flat top of the guide comb flush against your face, you eventually have to turn a corner, like at your jaw line.</li>
            <li> this is for beard, you can always use sink to catch the waste though if you&#x27;re not careful, sink can get clogged quickly.  </li>
            <li> It was very noisy, used antiquated NiCad battery technology, the vacuum rubbed the case and strained if you held it the wrong way, the comb clogged easily, the length adjustment changed too easily by accident, was difficult to re-attach to the trimmer, and I was forever dropping the filter screen when tapping the hair compartment clean.  </li>
            <li> so i didnt have to use a second machine for sideburns but the vacuum feature is the sole reason I bought this in the first place</li>
            <li> The hair vacuum is cool, it can be a bit tricky fully cleaning out the hair canister especially if the hair is wet,</li>
            <li> As many others noted, the guards are very hard on the face and you have to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, if you have too much length to easily shave with a blade (say, after a long, casual vacation), this trimmer can reduce the length down to something easily manageable with a blade.</li>
            <li> The digital display that indicated the length to which it is cutting is nice - but what is astonishingly bad is the discomfort - no - pain experienced while using it!</li>
            <li> The digital cutting length is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li> I hope the system becomes better in future versions - as is, it is definitely not the dream machine being advertised, at least as far as that feature is concerned.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is a nice size to trim and neaten bearded areas other than the face, for those who are so inclined, without worry of clipper heads pinching any skin, they are well designed and simply do their job without risking any minor blood loss from the dreaded clipper bite other trimmers can give.</li>
            <li> I must have been satisfied initially with its operation, because I bought another a few months later for a second home.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the kind of person that needs trimming daily, I&#x27;d expect you could still get a month or at least a few weeks out of each charge, and the charging is fast when it is needed.</li>
            <li> far as the actual trimming, while it does an overall good job, I found it difficult to get to the moustache hairs under my nose and the beard hairs close to my ears.</li>
            <li> Long battery life is the only positive.</li>
            <li> I decided that, other than the negative reviews regarding the comb, it seemed to be the most highly reviewed.</li>
            <li> So why bother having to clean out a small hair collection chamber that doesn&#x27;t work anyhow?  </li>
            <li> of the negative gripes were about the stubble comb, but I have used both the stubble and the curving comb, and both work fine, though I prefer the stubble comb with my shorter beard.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great in allowing me to grow a standard beard/mustache that will go well with my nazi youth haircut and black V neck sweater accented by a plaid collared checkered shirt as I sip on and pretend to know all there is to know about coffee and/or craft beer while discussing the unfairness imposed on poor people.</li>
            <li> The QT4070/41 comes with two guards, one has an opening that&#x27;s kinda sharp, and one that&#x27;s closed and smooth.</li>
            <li> After extensive search of all brands and models available, I wanted to buy the previous discontinued model because it was smaller.</li>
            <li> sounds harsh and it is harsh if you use the other one lightly you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the twenty dollars extra over their other models?  </li>
            <li> I had to use a burly nail file to round of the sharp points to mostly alleviate this design</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco beard trimmers from this particular line for a long time and have gone through three of them.</li>
            <li> I got this one to replace the older version that I had for a long time.</li>
            <li> Norelco appears to have spent so much time firming up the housing of the trimmer and adding a little LCD display (totally unnecessary), but they dropped the ball on the most important part of a VACUUM trimmer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum strength is much greater than I expected and the blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> good that they now include the guiding comb, but hard to use the blade only portion to trim upper lip etc due to shape even when you take comb off</li>
            <li> You still want to do it over the sink or trash basket, but there&#x27;s a whole lot less mess to clean up, which is about where my expectations were.  </li>
            <li> The result was arguably the best trim I&#x27;ve ever had, owing to the innovative cutting design (flat head versus slanted, as with other trimmers), the consistency of the cutting, and the efficient motor, providing the torque needed to trim through a wiry undergrowth of facial hair (the turbo button is useful here).</li>
            <li> Better collection box design (hinged), and it&#x27;s less bulky and slightly shorter than the T980.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine, the only problem was the small door</li>
            <li> all the way in the other direction to make it slip the other way, and then it was fine.</li>
            <li> I had an older Norelco trimmer that was basically the same thing, and I used it for probably 5-6 years, but it was starting to die and pieces were breaking, so I had to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I use a different setting for my main beard and for my mustache above my lip and on the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li> After less than a year, the battery only lasts a couple minutes if lucky.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t have the smaller mustache trimmer that older models had.</li>
            <li> I am embarrassed actually because, prior to it arriving and having read the reviews (particularly the one telling customers to contact Phillips), I visited the Phillips website, opened a customer services chat and requested a contour trimmer guide.  </li>
            <li> Searched far and wide and this particular trimmer appeared to garner recommendations towards that end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is you might have to clean it out in the middle of the shave, depending on how much hair you are trimming; but all it takes to clean it is popping it open and giving a few hard blows into the chamber.</li>
            <li> Based on the large number of negative reviews on here, I called Philips to see if they would be willing to send me the comb that \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t\\&quot; cut or jab you.  </li>
            <li> The best one I have found, out of the handful I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: removing one star, as this is one of the few beard trimmers at this price point that does not include a fine trimmer attachment - very annoying.</li>
            <li> Seriously dont know why all the good reviews, this thing is so unbelievably loud and is no better than the 15.00 Wahl buzzer Ive had for ages</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well used it 2 times so far, and the vacuum system works makes for very little clean up.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but this trimmer only delivered moderate results.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write back if I have any issues later on, but I have high hopes that nothing will happen.</li>
            <li> The unit felt a little &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; which surprised me because most of Phillips&#x27;s razors are heavy.</li>
            <li> not as much mess and easy to empty and  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s also hard to line up to do a direct trim at the neckline because the guards block your view a bit - never had a problem with a full trimmer that had detachable guards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might be a little bit more expensive than a normal one you can get, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks real cool though european styling on the trimmer, although nothing was as easy to use as the old remington mb 70 or mb 400 That stood up on its base.</li>
            <li> Turbo mode is very useful when the beard gets a little too long.</li>
            <li> So, I have to judge the unit unacceptable now, which is too bad as it is a great beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for beard trimming but bad for edging and neck shaving.</li>
            <li> With the (fairly lame) comb removed it works with amazing speed.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for 3 months, but recently the clasp that keeps the vacuumed hair trapped in the bay has broken.  </li>
            <li> and I generally like it.</li>
            <li> always use it in &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; fan mode and the vaccum sucks up about 90% of the hairs which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Also having a clear digital readout is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This unit will stay charged no matter how long you leave it in the drawer thanks to Li-ion batteries, FINALLY.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco CLEARLY markets the 4070 as using their \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> That did not present much of a problem because the cord is quite long.  </li>
            <li> I took the clear molded plastic packing shell out of the box and put it on my bathroom shelf above the sink.</li>
            <li> digital display is superfluous, there are clear mm and inch marks on the combs that serve the purpose without consuming battery power.</li>
            <li> First impressions: feels cheap and uncomfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Ladies if your guy cleans up after himself, it takes a lot of time and is frustrating as we are extremely lazy, this saves it, this is a great gift.</li>
            <li> The only issue I ran into was that the removal of the attachments is not explained clearly in the instructions.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to buy this because everyone said it doesn&#x27;t come with the comb, so I ordered the extra part from Phillips Norelco before buying the product and it turned out the trimmer came with the contour following comb and the regular comb</li>
            <li> My only objection to its form-factor is that the thing is LOUD.</li>
            <li> Barely cuts.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> I threw this away and back to my old Norelco T1000.    </li>
            <li> I then bought the QT4070 knowing, (after reading the reviews), that I would have to have the same spring loaded comb as my old T970 and the QT4050.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I had the old version for about 6 years until the battery finally died.</li>
            <li> A big improvement over the old models removable receptacle.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how short it will trim compared to my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Took double the time from my old trimmer to trim my face.</li>
            <li> Old Norelco trimmers used to last a lifetime until Phillips took over the company.</li>
            <li> Fast charging, and because you can use it from cord and battery, make this not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Overall, the QT4050 is far inferior to the QT4070</li>
            <li> And once you do, the blades just barely cut anything at all.    </li>
            <li> The height is displayed digitally in millimeters on the front near the adjustment dial, but you can see it in both millimeters and inches when you view it from the side.  </li>
            <li> I had lost my old trimmer on a recent trip, so I replaced it with the QT4070.</li>
            <li> It does not cut nearly close enough.  </li>
            <li> and it barely made a dent in the beard growth.  </li>
            <li> I like to use the bare blades on my neck just below the jaw line.</li>
            <li> This is the second Norelco product, used the old model until the battery would not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought this to replace an old Remington that finally gave up.</li>
            <li> Worked for a month and now will barely cut a hair on my face.  </li>
            <li> I charged the battery up completely when I got back, used it once</li>
            <li> I tried the first guard, and not only are the points on it sharper making it more uncomfortable, but there&#x27;s a big opening in it</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned it for roughly 6 months now and am very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my old trimmer, this was no big deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a solid build and bulkier than any machine I have had and slightly loud, but</li>
            <li> but so far have not cut my lip at all, and have goten a way closer shave than with the second head everyone was asking for.  </li>
            <li> but the beard barely comes</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here, I was hesitant to buy the 4070, and continued using my old one with a cord for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my old Norelco selectable height trimmer (which lasted me for ten years).</li>
            <li> After setting it to &amp;#34;3&amp;#34;, it trimmed by mustache short, and nearly obliterated my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old T980, which was starting to fall apart.  </li>
            <li> One thing I had to get used to was the size of the trimmer head is not as wide as the head of the whole body</li>
            <li> but it is not alarming at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it broke after only 9 months of use after I had the old model for years.</li>
            <li> The charge level is readily apparent on the front display.  </li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;ll be doing so in the near future.</li>
            <li> It lost a star because its larger size and loud noise.</li>
            <li> Works well, is not too big but is a bit loud -my</li>
            <li> With no attachment, you can actually trim your facial hair to a reasonable level and finish it off with a standard razor.  </li>
            <li> It does trim my mustache (unlike some reviewers who said their nose gets in the way) but it just barely works.</li>
            <li> Holds enough charge to complete a beard trim.  </li>
            <li> After the order the one I received developed the same issue - after two or three months not holding charge.  </li>
            <li> No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Same as old trimmer I have been using.</li>
            <li> but it barely works.  </li>
            <li> use this frequently, so have short trimmings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty much everything else works as expected.</li>
            <li> I had one of the early models of this type of razor and this one is definitely smaller and sleeker.</li>
            <li> I tested it out of curiosity and my ears actually hurt when I shaved near them.  </li>
            <li> My old remington beard trimmer finally stopped charging a couple of months ago</li>
            <li> but I have to get used to the height adjustment apparently.  </li>
            <li> Norelco also changed the design of the cutter head such that the head itself must be completely removed for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> trimmer arrived with both of the described heads - a fixed \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; head, and a spring-loaded \\&quot;comb\\&quot; similar to the T980.</li>
            <li> 2 DAYS EARLY ON STANDARD SHIPPING .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once so far and taken it on a 3 day business trip.</li>
            <li> only problem so far is the brush</li>
            <li> the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold charge, and even running plugged in would barely crank the motor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a beard trimmer for several years to replace my old Norelco and this is it.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to replace it when it was about 5 years old, because it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the fixed guide, since I trim my beard</li>
            <li> Tried a similar charger from his old one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have enough time to shave regularly with a razor and shaving cream</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m quite careful with all of my appliances and this is the first thing that&#x27;s ever actually \\&quot;died\\&quot; on me without any cause.      </li>
            <li> I had used it maybe 4-5 times at that point and hadn&#x27;t dropped or in any way been rough with it, so it&#x27;s pretty inexcusable for it to break in that short of a period of time.</li>
            <li> only thing that i have to say is that the battery runs out if u dont use it.i used it for 10 minutes the first time and after 2 weeks the battery was empty.</li>
            <li> This maybe the most poorly though out and inadequately tested product that Norelco has ever released.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money simply because it looks futuristic and cool</li>
            <li> Might be a really good trimmer but was too afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> Powerful and non messy.</li>
            <li> okay, but not great.</li>
            <li> There were comments on the trimmer&#x27;s head being a bit difficult to use, catching on your skin et al.</li>
            <li> The concept is ok but the fabrication is poor.</li>
            <li> (so it says something that a broken trimmer does a better job than this one).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but not great.</li>
            <li> I would love to give the product more stars, but without a contour following comb it is worthless.</li>
            <li> build quality (broken door)&lt;br /&gt;-Vacuum feature is more of a gimmick.</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with the guard.</li>
            <li> and i use it in turbo mode) and falsely advertised to do  &amp;#34;mess-free trimming&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s more mess-over-half-left trimming (why 2 not 3 stars, for lying).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Opening the door in the front of the trimmer allows a puffy little hairball to fall right out, without spreading trimmings all over the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Set for #3 blade, press against the right temple, apply a little pressure to get the hairs to stand up, and run it across the brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though the price seems reasonable, other classic trimmer brands such as Wahl and Remington and Andis have offerings in the same range.</li>
            <li> The vacuum system is also much improved with the hinged door eliminating the need to remove the entire \\&quot;basket\\&quot; system as on the prior model which broke on me after about 20 uses.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 1 star was because the vacuum works very well and with very short shaves</li>
            <li> vacuum, and this sadly is a big one, as it was really the only reason I wanted to replace my existing working unit.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is my favorite feature I can shave in my big mirror in my bedroom even in my car when I am late for work.</li>
            <li> Likewise, the door is also a part of the storage volume, so when you open it up, shavings are likely to fall out and create a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital blue cutting depth and charging indicators look very nice; however, the rotary length selector lacks grip and is not smooth to turn, i.e. it feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Well this new model has a huge vacuum that is not spring loaded that makes it hard to get the actual razor close to your face.  </li>
            <li> Having bought other ones which don&#x27;t nearly aggravate my skin like this one, I now think that it&#x27;s a design flaw on this particular model.    </li>
            <li> First off--like other critical reviewers you&#x27;ll find here, I also had major problems with the comb.</li>
            <li> Charges very fast, less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is not really useful, most of the hair falls down, so why bother.</li>
            <li> It is certainly not designed for hair that is much over  an inch or two</li>
            <li> The vacuum chamber holds about 10 hairs, so it needs to be emptied frequently.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum sticks out too far from the blades and the blades won&#x27;t even make contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> There is an opening near the teeth of the device for the vacuum to operate.</li>
            <li> 4) while the vacuum in this trimmer does function, it frequently gets full/clogged.  </li>
            <li> What surprised me was how well the vacuum works in containing the beard clippings.</li>
            <li> Misleading product marketing  Philips sells a nearly identical model (the [[ASIN:B003U8K6M6 Philips Norelco Qt4050 Vacuum Beard Trimmer]])</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vacuum has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> But still, you can feel the soft air being blown from the vacuum</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I wouldn&#x27;t replace it for as long as it still does what it&#x27;s mean for, trimming hair.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well the vacuum works in the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to receive both as I read a number of reviews before purchasing and many people complained that their unit only came with the fixed head and had to separately contact Philips to get the other head.</li>
            <li> The vacuum isn&#x27;t loud.</li>
            <li> But vacuum does not work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> Had to replace my Phillips Norelco Vacuum trimmer that was about four plus years old, and falling apart.  </li>
            <li> The trim head is wide enough that trims do not take a super long time</li>
            <li> I did find a recent review that said the new packages came with a contour head and a regular head.  </li>
            <li> Very nice cutting length readouts, 1 digital in millimeters next to a charge indicator and a pre-set display in inches along the side where the trimming heads seat.</li>
            <li> Sleeping wives will appreciate that the vacuum is MUCH quiter and then sound is less harsh.  </li>
            <li> It gets a bit tricky to use around the lips due to the large opening for the cutter.</li>
            <li> coz you still need to clean 20% of the dirty sink, might as well clean 100%.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, BUT has one flaw, the \\&quot;hair drawer\\&quot; in the old unit really collected the clippings, this unit is inferior in that category as around half the clippings fall on the sink not</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not in love with this model compared to previous versions for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> vacuum option is very nice, although there is still some leftovers in the sink, it leaves much less mess than regular trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;Charging takes less than an hour.</li>
            <li> 2 power setting, multiple shave levels and no mess.  </li>
            <li> a sharp, professional look.&lt;br /&gt;It was able to pick up at least 80% of the hair trimmings that it cut -- not</li>
            <li> be getting a different beard trimmer in the very near future.</li>
            <li> a few said they got the right one.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s messy and requires a shower right after.</li>
            <li> The original vacuum trimmer was much better - too bad they keep changing.</li>
            <li> Looks a bit ridiculous, but it still works fine, so I deducted a star.</li>
            <li> it wasnt much, and it seemed like the hair did not fall far from the sink so the mess was diminished.  </li>
            <li> A solid value, easy to empty hair trimmings cups, with oh so much less hair falling into the sink than before.</li>
            <li> - I would have paid less in the first place...</li>
            <li> After playing with it for a little while more I noticed the guard does bend a little bit when you put pressure on it too.</li>
            <li> and I find the non pivoting head better unlike other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;Great that it works while plugged in and the vacuum works well aside from a few hairs on the sink.</li>
            <li> I could not get it to click down to say &amp;#34;1MM&amp;#34; After playing with it for 10 minutes I moved the guard out as far as it could go (to the 18MM or whatever mark) and all the way back down, and sure enough I was back at 1 frickin MM on the display.</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum feature, the turbo setting cut my tough beard with gusto, and the length adjustment was generally adequate (though the settings were a bit wide apart, so 3 was too long and 2 was too short).    </li>
            <li> but, the rest falls into the sink....which isn&#x27;t very much at all, and it&#x27;s not a big enough deal or a big enough mess of hair to really point out, or even mention to me, so...  </li>
            <li> Sadly, mine was dark brown, but after 50 years, it is best to keep mine a little longer</li>
            <li> have a full time beard that I like to keep fairly short, a little longer than 5 o&#x27;clock shadow short.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not very good.</li>
            <li> Also, if you decide to trim a really long beard into a fairly short beard, same problem, the vacuum isn&#x27;t powerful enough to contain that volume and length of hairs.  </li>
            <li> The guard is larger and can&#x27;t trim right under my nose in the mustache area as well as previous</li>
            <li> I had the older model Philips Norelco vacuum trimmer that finally died after 5 years of regular use</li>
            <li> The vacuum ensures no mess.  </li>
            <li> no mess with the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> As with all shavers, the blades just became too dull for my application, so I got this new one which is the same as the first!</li>
            <li> The only model that has this power and features and the contour comb is the QT4090, a special release unit that only a few stores have - neither Amazon or even Norelco had it to sell to me.  </li>
            <li> This is my first cordless trimmer, so I am downgrading the size and power of the vacuum (my other one died after 10 years, but was a beast that could cut my beard and shave my head).  </li>
            <li> Battery does not last long, and where the older version cut in one swipe, this takes two or three.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of trimming hair short as long as you cut against the lay of the hair.</li>
            <li> As my older Norelco T980 finally started to show its wear after its remarkably long life, I decided to upgrade to its replacement top-of-the-line trimmer.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I highly recommend the trimmer!</li>
            <li> Charges fast and also holds charges longer than other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will trim your beard, or other areas very close without hurting.  </li>
            <li> I was on the phone for 20 minutes with customer service ( at least the lady was friendly) trying to figure out why I needed a replacement, and mixing up the part number.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cuts very well and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> he doesn&#x27;t really have anything to compare to other than a razor blade and cream</li>
            <li> hard to clean also.</li>
            <li> I went straight with the contour comb, so I can&#x27;t say how the other one works, but it works like a charm with the contour comb and there is no nicking anything even on setting one.</li>
            <li> Works very well compared to our other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Bought this when my last Philips Norelco trimmer bit the dust after 15-20 years of use and I expect this one will last just as long, Norelco products are build very well and I will stick to this brand.</li>
            <li> Now i have to shave my whole face because one side has a .5 mm trim and the other a 2mm trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay since I can use it both on my head and beard, and not leave a mess.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of time to get use to the length of the guard since you don&#x27;t immediately see how much you are trimming due to the&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Can&#x27;t really use it for trimming your head hair due to the design of it.</li>
            <li> The door has not broken off as other people claim in their reviews.</li>
            <li> The latch that holds the door closed is a tiny piece of plastic that does not seem to be durable at all, and after being used consistently, seems inevitable to break.</li>
            <li> It has a few more trim levels and a little change in style.</li>
            <li> However, the vast vast majority of the hairs get sucked in...which means no mess!</li>
            <li> So, if you have a nice thick beard you&#x27;re trimming, suddenly you go around your jaw line and shave it down to a stubble.</li>
            <li> Ive used this for about 2 month now, thats about 10 shaves, and have not a single problem.</li>
            <li> Does not have the detailed small trimmer that is very useful for cut hair behind the ear and close to the nose</li>
            <li> I was a hair concerned ordering this with the complaints about the comb, but when I received it I found that the box contained both the new comb everyone seems to hate, as well as the good trusty old contour comb.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the look of using this without the guard on the majority of my facial hair (which is fine with me - no razor burn), so I use this every other day to cut everything down and then with the guard to manage my goatee and sideburns.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that this blade does not come standard with the QT4070, but if you have one, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> have taken EXTREMELY delicate care with this since day one and clean it with the brush after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very dissatisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Like anyone presented with the option, I went straight for turbo mode and never looked back, and so far haven&#x27;t seen any diminution of indicated battery power after half a dozen uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The T765 was much better at cutting and it was much easier to pop the guard off.</li>
            <li> It seems to be on infinite back order and recently looks like it was removed from Phillips&#x27; website completely.</li>
            <li> Some old reviews were critical of an earlier version but this one seems to have all the problems resolved as of January 2014.</li>
            <li> My beard trimming now consist of ten minutes of mowing the beard with the trimmer from every conceivable direction - and then another 10 minutes using my comb and scissors to cut all of the beard to the same length.</li>
            <li> I have only had it a short time, but so far it performs well.</li>
            <li> I sent back under warranty and received another, which developed the same problem after a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a downside in that it takes an hour to get a full charge and also charge does not last long, less than the 50 min it claims.  </li>
            <li> recently, did a patch job on the old T980 catch compartment (duct tape and a big rubber band) door and have resigned myself to charging every time before use.  </li>
            <li> Unless your mustache grows nowhere near your nose, you&#x27;re going to have a difficult time getting the trimming blades to the top of your mustache.</li>
            <li> Not only does my woman think I&#x27;m immaculately groomed and rediculously sexy with my fierce beard game</li>
            <li> top of that their 45 day risk free warrantee is worthless since they can&#x27;t seem to email, snail mail, or fax a form to return</li>
            <li> Most tend to suffer from poor design, and when my last razor broke (battery kept getting weaker and weaker), I started hunting for the oh-so-familiar Norelco cordless.  </li>
            <li> I have professional hair clippers that I used to use, and I feel that they did a better job, but that is an unfair comparison&lt;</li>
            <li> It is the same with the pointed guard (the guard is not sharp as a needle - I was just giving an example).</li>
            <li> You will then find hairs all under and over the little mechanism that causes the blades to work in the first place (not the razors themselves--the part that moves them).</li>
            <li> Little bit on higher cost</li>
            <li> Does this mean that they are shipping this unit with both because of the calls to replace the original one that was jabbing users?</li>
            <li> first unit broke when the latch to the little door broke off.</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum bit, makes trimming significantly less messy.</li>
            <li> I know of no other such device that will vacuum the stubble, which is a definite plus as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> The built in vacuum keeps the blades clear of whiskers from clumping up like my last one.</li>
            <li> Since it was the model with the turbo boost for the vacuum I assumed it would have the handy-dandy contour following comb that was with the old one.  </li>
            <li> I definitely like the vacuum feature as well as my &amp;#34;wife&amp;#34; who now doesn&#x27;t get nearly as upset when I trim my beard.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is ideal for the lady friend because girls hate hair in the sink.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works poorly and any one who buys a trimmer would be better off with a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> Then again, this is true of every single trimmer I have tried, and is not unique to this model.</li>
            <li> Only con is that the storage space for the hairs is pretty small and you have to empty it pretty often.</li>
            <li> The plastic is a little cheap and flimsy, and it is sharp on the underneath side, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me.  </li>
            <li> The door that the hair gets sucked into also feels weak and can probably easily be snapped off,</li>
            <li> They become totally blocked and jammed with shaven whiskers VERY quickly because the vacuum is not powerful enough to remove them.  </li>
            <li> For weeks I struggled using a tiny trimmer with a cheap comb and eventually I quit because the mess of hair left in the sink hardly made it worth shaving my face; as a result, I watched as daily my beard grew incrementally, looking ever closer in appearance to the heckled fur on a chihuahua&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature actually works pretty well and now it comes with the curved guard, so I started with that one and never tried the other one.</li>
            <li> Ok well that is not so bad, right?</li>
            <li> the naked trimmer (i.e. without either of the guides) is not prominent enough (what I&#x27;ve been used to in the past) to get a good trim for definition making it kind of awkward to use for that.  </li>
            <li> First charge showed fully charged but when I took it off charger it shows Orange (7 minutes or less time left).</li>
            <li> the head height has a flexible plastic brush that when pressed against your face bends and makes the height adjustment pointless because it shaves you super short...</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that I find the vacuum to be sort of pointless since you have to clean up anyway.  </li>
            <li> A few facial hairs still hit the sink, but this razor captures ~95% of regular trims, and the facial hair container is an adequate size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The screen does make it a bit harder to clean up once it is dumped but you figure out little tricks as you go .</li>
            <li> Only other thing I&#x27;d note is that if you use it for trimming chest hair, the compartment fills up pretty quickly and you&#x27;ll need to empty a few times.</li>
            <li> I was a little wary of the vacuum as I thought it might be a gimmick, but in the end I&#x27;ve been really happy with my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> your time the first few times you use it to understand what direction and angle to get what you want.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it on my eyebrows I started with a very high Millimeter setting and turned it down a bit and repeated until I got the length I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I can generally trim an area with only a couple of passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the cheap door on the raiser keeps popping open.</li>
            <li> i keep a 3-4 mm beard in general with occasional 2mm cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The edges are sharp and it&#x27;s not a smooth, comfortable experience at all.</li>
            <li> I remove the guide to trim my mustache, which I like natural length, just trimmed above my mouth, unlike Wolf, who looks like he runs the trimmer flat over his mustache.  </li>
            <li> Seems to hold a charge for a long period, so far no cons.</li>
            <li> Both left shaved divots on my face, barely trimming the rest.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;setting&#x27; is likely when the trim measuring guard is removed, and you use the bare trimmer on your face.</li>
            <li> The old one did for a long time, but then two of the plastic attachments cracked.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I put up with my old piece of junk trimmer for this long.</li>
            <li> There is a bigger gap at the sides of the bare guard.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it was worth the money I paid for it...</li>
            <li> The system cut pretty well with few split beard hairs.     </li>
            <li> I have to make sure to hold the door shut while I&#x27;m using the trimmer which is not ideal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery - The first charge for three hours and until the lights went out as instructed - had a run time of about five minutes before it was dead.</li>
            <li> clogs with hair in the first few seconds of use.</li>
            <li> It cuts pretty evenly with few strokes.</li>
            <li> The first one I had a few years ago, and it became faulty within around 2 months of usage.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the small increase in price.</li>
            <li> I have moderately thick hair and it takes me a full charge to do a trim because I have to go over and over my beard.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it was easier to clean.</li>
            <li> While it cuts the hair, it digs in and is less comfortable than my previous razor.</li>
            <li> That leaves the need to clean the sink and brush all the hair from the collection chamber which seems to have a static charge to make this task as annoying as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to have to wash some of the trimmings down the sink anyway, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s 1/2 of them or all of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was expecting a larger and less tight space for the hair, so it&#x27;s easily removed.</li>
            <li> Ever since I got it for him he has been sporting at least a little bit of a beard, and trying out different lengths, no more clean shaven hubby for me :-)</li>
            <li> the vacuum works just not as well as I had hoped but in the end it is less of a clean up then usual and most of the other comments about the turbo setting having to be used is mostly right but depends on if you can waste a little extra time not to use it.</li>
            <li> It now has a vacuum attached, which is great if you need a really small vacuum but not so great if you want to trim facial hair as this places the cutting head further back meaning that you can no longer use it to trim either closely, trim an edge or follow contours as the cutting edge being so far away from the front precludes</li>
            <li> Since you cannot use water you need to use this very small brush to clean it every time.</li>
            <li> The latter is exactly like previous models going back</li>
            <li> The vacuum barely worked  on the lower model</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box the first thing I noticed is that the product itself is actually just black and white but the image makes it seem like it has a teal tint, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li> This comb feels very comfortable on your face and it is the only one you&#x27;ll ever need (the other one is garbage), but you&#x27;ll need to remove it later on if you want to get to those hard to reach places, like under your nose.</li>
            <li> the second blade, that moves, is set back far enough that this likely affects the length as well, but I assume this is a safety measure so that I don&#x27;t slice the skin off my face.  </li>
            <li> Battery charge life is long, and charge time is relatively short, around an hour from a dead battery to full charge, and numerous trimmings between charges.</li>
            <li> Also, I generally clean the bathroom and the vacuum that the shaver has sucks up a lot of the trimmed hair which helps me out tremendously😉</li>
            <li> Gussied up a bit with &amp;#34;digital&amp;#34; readout, instead of small printed numbers in a window,  but other than that pretty much</li>
            <li> , the vacuum (no other trimmer has one yet), the ease of adjustments, and low maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I had the G380 several years and the Ni-Cd batteries weren&#x27;t lasting very long, so a new trimmer was a must.</li>
            <li> The stubble head differs from the comb in two main ways: it has no spring-loaded tail; instead resembling a single, flat, solid unit atop the trimmer; and it has the \\&quot;guard\\&quot; teeth in front of the razors removed.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to other buyers.</li>
            <li> So eliminates a mess making a mess free trim?</li>
            <li> I wish there was a half star because I really would have given it 4.5 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a year and a half, I noticed the door on the front of the unit wasn&#x27;t holding shut very well and as a result the suction power was suffering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The attachments aren&#x27;t very helpful for trimming less than 6 mm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to it, but my previous trimmer was much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first, I thought the two buttons controlled the trimmer and the vacuum features, respectively, but upon closer inspection of the manual, it appears that one is a power button (activating both trimmer and vacuum), and the other is a \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button, increasing the power to both the trimmer and the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> I was also surprised at how quiet and relatively minor</li>
            <li> You will either get a very short cut near your lip and a long cut under the nose.    </li>
            <li> Lastly, does not allow for detailed sculpting without removing the guard completely, which is still hard to use due to the unhandy size.</li>
            <li> Vacuum keeps the mess to a minimum, and the ergamomics are better than my past trimmers.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a super thick beard</li>
            <li> so instead of taking a solid minute to clean up after yourself on a non-vacuum model, you take a solid minute to empty the little basket that they give you.  </li>
            <li> The problem is, that part broke rather quickly, and now i have the little door held closed with a rubber band.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews are people with thin beards who were smitten with the product during the first week - I&#x27;m certain they regret the purchase a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> It is just that the rechargeable battery, which came fully charged, worked very well until the initial charge went down.  </li>
            <li> Preferably start with long length for the first use and go down step by step - they tell you to do so in the user manual</li>
            <li> Preferably start with long length for the first use and go down step by step - they tell you to do so in the user manual</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a mess to clean up afterwards due to its vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> It has a big open space right where the trimmer is at, if you trim at a little bit of a strange angle be prepared for a very short or bare</li>
            <li> What i had seen on one post was a guy saying that he had read the other reviews and despite that was having no problems with the main guard and that actually it gave him a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I would buy this model again, and in general I would certainly pay a little extra for the vacuum feature again as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main draw for this product is the vacuum system that captures hairs for \\&quot;mess free trimming.\\&quot; In truth, it&#x27;s a highly deceptive product that leaves a giant mess in the sink, cuts very unevenly and has an almost unusable mustache</li>
            <li> but it is just a little large for travelling.</li>
            <li> Really does reduce the mess, but don&#x27;t expect perfection.</li>
            <li> It really helps with the mess of the cut hair.  </li>
            <li> The only detractor is the missing trim head for fine detail work that the previous trimmer had.</li>
            <li> There are no flat surfaces anywhere on this trimmer, so you can&#x27;t rest it on either end.</li>
            <li> How are we as consumers supposed to keep waste out of landfills if lazy companies sell us products that never last more than a couple years and can&#x27;t be repaired?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new trimmer after I used this one once because I don&#x27;t want to have to worry about having a bald spot in my beard if I wasn&#x27;t careful enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new model, only comes with the wide blade, no narrower detailing blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upgrading over a 10 year old model that had a loose door and tended to turn on inside my luggage.</li>
            <li> This means that if you change the orientation of the razor with your face, then you can accidentally lean it forward to where the razor blades are directly on your skin and loose the height guide you&#x27;ve specified.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t care much about those things then you&#x27;ll get the same shave from the T-980 for much less money.    </li>
            <li> I much prefer the guard on my previous model (and that is on the current Philips Norelco Qt4050 model).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Since everybody wants to see the cons - the capacity of the clippings container only lasts half a trim before it spits hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> I thought my previous Remington trimmer had more consistent trimming and the vacuum worked a tad better, but the battery life was horrible and it ultimately couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> but I have to say that I&#x27;m cleaning less hairs than normal!</li>
            <li> It is good, but not as expected, I mean it does not give me the option to do different bird styles, all what I can do is normal shaving, which sometimes sucks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vacuum certainly helps reduce mess, but it won&#x27;t eliminate it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a very large amount of adjustability, which is fine as long as you aren&#x27;t trying to do anything crazy with your facial hair.</li>
            <li> The current depth setting is also indicated by two small rulers on the sides of the guard - right side metric, left side inches.</li>
            <li> I can plug it in, and use it right away after it is dead, but if the battery is failing now, how long can it last?</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing, if you&#x27;re like me and were tired of cleaning up the mess after a trim, say hello to this gem.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get everything but definitely eliminates the mess and trims very well.</li>
            <li> it could maybe use a slightly stronger vacuum, but that may increase bulk of the trimmer and decrease battery life, so I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li> Vac really helps out on preventing such a mess and keeping hair from trapping in your beard.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only 30 days to return it, which for me was not long enough to discover the battery problem.</li>
            <li> The cut is fine, but now the broken door clip has made me go look for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re trimming over a sink, you&#x27;ll still see some hair trimmings in the bowl, but far, far less than if you use a trimmer without a vacuum.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; feature is really neat, and I&#x27;ve fount it helpful when I&#x27;ve let my beard grow a little longer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need the little LED lights in the handle</li>
            <li> I did my homework on the new model norelco, but had concerns over some reviews I read concerning the&lt;br /&gt;adjustable blade guard being sharp edged and nicking users.</li>
            <li> Smooth, close and reaches that tough spot under your nose.</li>
            <li> , the drawer for the trimmed hair fills up quick, it&#x27;s not a very even trim, and it&#x27;s not a strong trimmer.</li>
            <li> - NO vacuum trimmer out there will!  </li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable con paired to others I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Even though few trimmings are not collected into the vacuum chamber, they are few enough that they are easily wiped out &amp; drained into the sink.</li>
            <li> like the battery indicator, so I can easily see if I have enough batter for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;After a 20+ minute marathon trimming where I slowly stepped down the length setting, the battery indicator barely seemed to go down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> vacuum feature contains the mess at least 90% better than our going everywhere and clogging up the drain.  </li>
            <li> And if you lengthen the setting to recess the blades, those flexible pointy little daggers become the problem that more than one reviewer complained about.</li>
            <li> But if you are trimming a longer length off it does not vacuum as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can steadily grow my facial hair without looking homeless, but I can also mow it down whenever I start looking like I belong in a Geico commercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from not being able to pull the hair receptacle out to dump those little suckers in the trash like the 980 let me do (this one&#x27;s hinged), which I prefer, this is a terrific trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud with the turbo mode on...louder than a regular pair of Wahl or Conair hair clippers, but not obnoxiously loud.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy to be missing such an important feature.  </li>
            <li> On the plus(?) side it uses lithium batteries so it goes full power until it stops unlike Nicad batteries which warn you by slowing down a little one or two shaves before stopping.  </li>
            <li> I also quickly found that due to the flexibility of the guide using a low setting results in a really uneven cut.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum feature leaves very little mess and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> but you still will have a little mess to clean up</li>
            <li> Yet if you have a fierce man beard this will cut it, it just won&#x27;t catch much of it in the little vacuum deal it&#x27;s got.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to aiming for straight edges because of the extra space that the vacuum area encompasses, but you will figure it out.  </li>
            <li> As some other reviews that have one star ( only one star because 0 stars is not an option), the plastic cover that covers where the hair is trapped breaks easily and good luck getting the online rep to understand anything about the broken part, they will keep asking you to look at a web page with accessory parts that do not include anything remotely similar to what you are saying is broken.</li>
            <li> Battery life new was flaky, the head is too bulky (due to the vacuum feature) and can&#x27;t trim evenly under the nose and around the ears.</li>
            <li> It is frustrating that many are receiving the product with both blades as I&#x27;ve seen photos on boxes and how I expected mine to come.  </li>
            <li> If your beard grows at an average pace or you have a light colored beard or grey or less dense, don&#x27;t expect 1mm to show anything!  </li>
            <li> With a little practice it&#x27;s still possible to get a clean even shave under the nose, but it takes a little time that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always use the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; setting, and the vacuum catches about 80% to 90% of the trimmings, similar to the old T980, which is all I expected.  </li>
            <li> Last week, the door to the vacuum chamber suddenly fell open while I was shaving.</li>
            <li> Maybe next time they can just eliminate the vacuum compartment...since not all of the hair will get caught...and use the space for a bigger lithium-ion battery so that would add to customer advantage of longer batter life (just a personal suggestion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum is silly, but it gets most of the hair.</li>
            <li> I going to keep the Conair for the heavy duty work and clean up mess.</li>
            <li> While a great idea, the vacuum system on this trimmer makes it almost worthless.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is completely useless as most of the hair still falls to whatever surface is below your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought the vacuum part might be a bit gimmicky but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature adds thickness to the area near the trimmer blades and thus makes it harder to get a close cut.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works well during a traditional position, but when using it to keep a close cut on your head - the intake obviously gets clogged.</li>
            <li> Gave it four stars because the door to the vacuum catch stopped closing properly on my device shortly after I got it.  </li>
            <li> I only trust Norelco Vacuum trimmers, this is my third.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would want in a future model is a stronger vacuum.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times, and the vacuum feature makes it</li>
            <li> big selling point of this trimmer is obviously the vacuum.</li>
            <li> Not even 20 uses and now the battery does not stay charged and the vacuum window stays open with hair flowing out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li> All of that would be enough to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature though.</li>
            <li> only feature I can complain about is the vacuum.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco vacuum trimmer.</li>
            <li> Turbo vacuum is the reason I use this model instead of a traditional body hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I finished up by sticking a vacuum cleaner hose in there to get all the hair out in a second.    </li>
            <li> The vacuum captures only 70% of my trimmings.  </li>
            <li> The tines on the front of the comb are short in order to leave an opening for the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trimming a lot of hair the vacuum port tends to clog up, which isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> That is not all, the vacuum system is uneffective even if you have  a short beard.</li>
            <li> (The efficacy of the vacuum system may be different for individuals who maintain beards longer than 1mm.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for over 35 years, and recently graduated to the Phiips Norelco Turbo Vacuum Pro Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> vacuum is quiet.</li>
            <li> The latter is directed towards those men who use manual means (beard scissors), or an electric trimmer without a vacuum.</li>
            <li> It was enough to leave me thinking that the vacuum did indeed miss a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was the only problem I would concede to the vacuum and agree that it does improve the shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Vacuum terrific, trim reliable.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the vacuum does not work as well with the contour following comb.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t work properly and hair falls all over the place.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give 4 stars is its vacuum quality.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the vacuum function, which shortens clean-up time - and I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints about hair around the sink.</li>
            <li> The vacuum function is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided not to try this one a third time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer replaces an earlier version of the Norelco vacuum model.  </li>
            <li> It act so fragile with your skin and the vacuum</li>
            <li> I especially like the vacuum on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Definitely a leap ahead of a trimmer without a vacuum.</li>
            <li> Going back to Remington though it does not have a vacuum</li>
            <li> i wish vacuum chamber was bigger</li>
            <li> The vacuum was about the same....</li>
            <li> As this is the only model I&#x27;ve found with a vacuum feature, I&#x27;ll take it.  </li>
            <li> I went back to get him one because his didn&#x27;t have the vacuum and his hair was falling off on the counter and wasn&#x27;t  cleaning up to my standards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps the next generation of Norelco vacuum beard trimmers will trim closer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is quite efficient for limiting the amount of hair stubble that ends up on the bathroom counter, especially with the turbo boost on.  </li>
            <li> No tugging or pulling of the hairs and the vacuum actually does work!</li>
            <li> , the vacuum is a plus and the battery last for days.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the vacuum collection system is not as dependable as I would like.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature did help with cleanup, but the trimmer didn&#x27;t cut close, and took quite a while to actually do the job.</li>
            <li> My last one (which was a Remington vacuum) gave out on me</li>
            <li> The only reason not getting 5 stars is you can&#x27;t turn off the vacuum operation to trim hair around ears.</li>
            <li> When a friend told me that he has a vacuum trimmer that actually works, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature bulks up the overall size of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> but the vacuum only captures about 75% of the trimmings on turbo mode.</li>
            <li> It is designed such that the vacuum&#x27;s &amp;#34;scoop&amp;#34; prevents seeing the cutter when you are using it without the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> But, when it came to a vacuum beard trimmer, the QT4070 is just about the only bar in town</li>
            <li> I always use &#x27;turbo mode&#x27; because regular just doesn&#x27;t have the speed and vacuum power that is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades were on the same height as the vacuum entrance.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature makes a big difference in terms of cleaning up the sink and counter after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this newer model because the beard trimmings door latch broke.</li>
            <li> It is not nearly as good as the previous Norelco that I had for many years</li>
            <li> (No more I&#x27;m super careful now)  </li>
            <li> It works way better than expected, no more mess all over the sink, probably 80%+ of the hair is sucked into the vaccum.</li>
            <li> And I suppose this must be much worse for those with extremely dense facial hair who will need to use that &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; button most of the time.</li>
            <li> great now  1st one was replaced due to a bad battery  - no hassle.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a safety razor because it irritates my skin too much, but I was also tired of using draino every few months to clean up after the clippers.</li>
            <li> well  made product and slightly quieter than a normal trimmer.</li>
            <li> Also, this can sometimes be fixed by just scrolling the settings wheel to one extreme end of the spectrum and back</li>
            <li> This replaced a seven year old Philips Norelco beard trimmer which simply died due to the battery.</li>
            <li> The vacuum picks up about half the hair on normal, and maybe 80 percent on turbo mode.</li>
            <li> Vacuum catches all the hair.</li>
            <li> Vacuum feature is a gimmick - do not buy for that feature alone.</li>
            <li> , it allows me to keep my beard neat and trimmed, and the vacuum works well.</li>
            <li> The latch on the vacuum chamber door broke within 4 months.  </li>
            <li> (Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer).</li>
            <li> What I would like is a vacuum trimmer that can leave me with an EVEN  1/8\\&quot; beard...........</li>
            <li> The vacuum function on this unit could also use some improvement.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works well to keep a hefty majority of the hair out of the sink.</li>
            <li> vacuum gets close to 90% of the trimmings.</li>
            <li> in mind:&lt;br /&gt;-cant go from 10cm to 2mm in one go, have to trim in 2mm drops to keep vacuum from clogging</li>
            <li> There are two levels of vacuum</li>
            <li> &gt; - Vacuum gets in the way and doesn&#x27;t help much&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no way to turn off the vacuum</li>
            <li> and he loves the vacuum feature on this unit.</li>

            <li> vacuum doesn&#x27;t get all the hair (I&#x27;d estimate 50%) but</li>
            <li> This one will do 0.5mm and it will vacuum up the bits that would otherwise litter my sink/bathroom.</li>
            <li> the vacuum works</li>
            <li> The vacuum does work.</li>
            <li> Vacuum catches a lot of hair, though not all.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature helps some, but there is still some stubble in the sink.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum system?</li>
            <li> but the vacuum is bad-ass.  </li>
            <li> Sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture a bagless vacuum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is the experience with this vacuum groomer.</li>
            <li> Compare this to my non vacuum beard trimmer that leaves tons of hairs all over the sink.</li>

            <li> Ive used a philips norelco vacuum beard trimmer for about 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> I came on amazon today in hopes of finding another type of vacuum beard trimmer and figured id leave a review for this.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum helps keep hair out of your blades creating easier upkeep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco vacuum (maverick) trimmers for years.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum works well, though.</li>
            <li> The vacuum system is gimmickry.</li>
            <li> It had a vacuum.</li>
            <li> Also, although I didn&#x27;t think I would, I missed the vacuum from the T980.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum...</li>
            <li> Additionally the vacuum suck works but not 100%</li>
            <li> The vacuum works well.</li>
            <li> Chose this model for vacuum and turbo.</li>
            <li> The neatest (pun intended) thing about this trimmer is that it comes with a vacuum Hair Collection Chamber.  </li>
            <li> Well the vacuum door fell off after 18 months and it wasn&#x27;t abused.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum does not work well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver in March 2013, as I was drawn in by the vacuum functionality.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Vacuum doesnt catch 100% of the hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right away, I will say that the vacuum feature is a gimmick, and it doesn&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum catches about 90% of trim, rest ends up in the sink or on the countertop.</li>
            <li> The vacuum seems to work.  </li>
            <li> As for the vacuum part, it don&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s claim</li>
            <li> vacuum don&#x27;t work as advertised</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s battery died (don&#x27;t remember the model but also norelco vacuum</li>
            <li> There is still some sink cleanup after shaving but the vacuum did collect probably 95% of the trimmings</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature does not work as well as hoped.  </li>
            <li> Bought a trimmer with vacuum for my husband years ago and had been looking for another one when I found this one.  </li>

            <li> was out the vacuum</li>
            <li> I was replacing another vacuum trimmer that TSA removed from my luggage and broke.</li>
            <li> Understand the vacuum will not get all of the hair.</li>
            <li> The vacuum kinda works but don&#x27;t get all the hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t catch all the hairs with the vacuum, but I&#x27;d say it catches about 85-90% which still helps dramatically with cleanup.</li>
            <li> others have said the build in vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch all the hair</li>

            <li> I think that&#x27;s just because of the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> vacuum function is a neat idea but still needs some perfection.  </li>

            <li> Vacuum saves a lot of cleanup, but not all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the vacuum to catch all of your trimmings, because it won&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> Vacuum collects 90% plus of hair.</li>

            <li> Vacuum does not work well..</li>
            <li> If you remove the comb for edging your beard or mustache, the vacuum intake blocks your view of the end of the blade (in the mirror)</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature prevents hair from getting everywhere.  </li>
            <li> The trimmings that wind up in my sink are from cleaning them out of the vacuum</li>
            <li> The vacuum design is a joke.</li>
            <li> I like that this has a built in vacuum.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s needed for the vacuum, and could be overlooked if the vacuum worked</li>

            <li> The vacuum still doesn&#x27;t suck in all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum sticks out about 1/4\\&quot;\\&quot; from the blade which gets in the way of trying to trim.</li>
            <li> The problem is with the placement of the vacuum air intake.</li>
            <li> the vacuum attachment is loud.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this one because of vacuum feature but it turns out</li>
            <li> Vacuum prevents hair going everywhere&lt;</li>
            <li> but, it is an inferior model compared to the Philips Norelco® T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature eventually &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I did not use the turbo option; while trimming was not a problem the vacuum did let some hair fall into the sink.</li>
            <li> I almost skipped that one because of the vacuum</li>
            <li> The one downside I found is that after about 4 months of use, the plastic vacuum container door latch broke.</li>
            <li> The vacuum captures about 90% of the hair if you trim every couple days.</li>
            <li> However, the turbo vacuum does not work that well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum does not work and spills hair all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I owned the version without the vacuum</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature didn&#x27;t factor in my decision to buy this trimmer, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it</li>
            <li> would be the vacuum</li>
            <li> Vacuum feature captures about 95% of cut hair, keeping my bathroom counter and sink area cleaning</li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t seem to catch too much--still end up with hairs all over the sink.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works well.</li>
            <li> but vacuum function doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I would just buy the cheaper model without the vacuum part.</li>
            <li> , that did not have a built-in vacuum.</li>
            <li> It does not have a vacuum, but it does not broadcast the hairs during trimming.</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t want the vacuum go with 5100 or 9100.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has a vacuum</li>
            <li> but the thing is it doesn&#x27;t really vacuum</li>
            <li> The vacuum</li>
            <li> Rumor has it the vacuum chamber door breaks after a while too.</li>
            <li> The vacuum puts a gap between the blade and the guard</li>
            <li> The vacuum is good, not great, but results in way less of a mess than just a regular trimmer.</li>
            <li> This saved the day and works painlessly to whisk away those whisker remnants with its clever little vacuum.  </li>
            <li> In my experience with the last Norelco over the past 9 years, it was clean cutting, easy to use, and always kept my beard &#x27;shipshape&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I had the previous model of this trimmer and this new model definitely addressed the deficiencies.</li>
            <li> I had been using the previous model, but the soldered in battery died and the unit was damaged when I attempted to open it to solder in a new battery.  </li>
            <li> My previous razor had finally died and thus I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that is is kind of hard to do detailed lines like the edges of my Goat-T.Its just a little hard to see the blades at the angle the are made.</li>
            <li> :The color that I have received is black and white, I was expecting to get the other color shown on the first picture</li>
            <li> Also, the vacuum works like a dyson!</li>
            <li> I will never buy a razor without a vacuum again!</li>
            <li> The vacuum works well!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s a bit tough to clean...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and hard to mess up.  </li>
            <li> The previous model you were able to remove it completely making cleaning the device far easier; but this one just has a flap that you open to dump out the trimmings, which is a bit inconvenient, that&#x27;s why it got four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is Loud compared to other Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a cool idea and feature, however it only sucks up about 70% of the hair, saving you minimal time in cleanup.  </li>
            <li> This one has the fixed and contour following combs, adjustable heights, speeds, a little vacuum to prevent much of the mess.</li>
            <li> No suction can suck hair that is too long, but trimming at short lengths, the vacuum works as expected and no mess at all which is really only reason that I go to barber shop - to avoid the cleaning.  </li>
            <li> but if you want to trim down a 2 week beard just a bit, you get major areas of unevenness which leads me to have to cut the whole thing down to stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clear door compartment for trimmings/shavings seem to break after a while as other reviewers mentioned causing it to not latch shut anymore resulting in the hair just flying out, rubber band fixes that.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco missed the opportunity to be in the \\&quot;untouchable\\&quot; category as far as other competitors are concerned.</li>
            <li> Indeed they suggested I tried to buy another old model via ebay or any other site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One is fixed and the other follows the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> It shaves evenly although with discomfort mostly near the mouth region due to the blade.  </li>
            <li> However, I ended up keeping my old razor for trimming sharp edges.</li>
            <li> The absence of a precision trimmer with the 4070 is the reason why I gave this product 4/5.</li>
            <li> If you hold the upper face of the guide comb flat against your skin, you get a longer cut than if you allow your skin to span the gap between the two set of tines.</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last plenty long enough for me to trim several times.</li>
            <li> For people like me whose facial hair tends to grown in one direction, the flat blade (as opposed to the circular types) makes it easier to get my hair length to what I want it to be.</li>
            <li> The unit is brand new and the blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather large and it&#x27;s less difficult to be precise, even when working with two hands</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature cuts down on the mess from trimming by about 99%, which is great if you&#x27;re getting tired of cleaning up tiny clippings (or sticking your head down close to the sink</li>
            <li> Not great for cheek line or clean shaving as the vacuum gets in the way.</li>
            <li> But the only dis-advantage is that the charges goes down rapidly, that&#x27;s why generally the general rate is 4 Stars.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The old one simply slowed down, when it needed a recharge, and then it took ten hours to recharge.  </li>
            <li> And the new adjustment ring is much less prone to inadvertent change of trimmer comb head setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned products out of this range for years and had to buy a new one when the charge wouldn&#x27;t hold on my previous model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not rating this a 5 because the plastic attachments of the new one do not appear to be constructed of materials which are stronger than the previous razor.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the battery life which, in comparison to other major Philips products, is surprisingly short.</li>
            <li> The only drawback of this product is that when comes to mustache trimming, it&#x27;s hard to get an even trim throughout, but  by changing the length and being just a little more careful, you can achieve that too.</li>
            <li> Also, on both the old and new unit, the door that held in the waste stubble kept breaking so that it wouldn&#x27;t stay closed.</li>
            <li> CHOSE THIS MODEL AFTER REVIEWING NUMEROUS BEARD TRIMMERS OFFERED THROUGH AMAZON .THE EASE OF A SINGLE, MULTIPLE LENGTH SETTING , WITHOUT HAVING TO ATTACH VARIOUS COMBS , AND THE VACUUM SYSTEM SOLD ME.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does not function when you attempt to use it upside down in an attempt to reach tight spots like the part of your mustache right underneath your nose.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is it isn&#x27;t ideal for trimming the upper lip...almost impossible.</li>
            <li> trimmer is always wide so not good for detailed work</li>
            <li> trimmer is always wide so not good for detailed work</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job on the face and no more messy clean-ups.</li>
            <li> This is capable of cutting your beard with plenty of horsepower left for that mildly troublesome chest hair that threatens to escape through that shirt collar and strangle nearby wildlife.</li>
            <li> Some I&#x27;ve owned in the past require the battery to juice back up before you can use which is really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt; - Holds a charge for a long time and a digital display of battery life has an indicator for low charge&lt;br /&gt; - 1/32 in trim</li>
            <li> Outside of that minor fault, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Before I justed used normal hair clippers to trim my facial hair and my bathroom would look like I killed a yeti in there.</li>
            <li> main missing element is the detail blade.</li>
            <li> However, for anything more than that, it is pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li> As far as the QT&#x27;s being a replacement for my poor departed T980... it was an exact match.  </li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t said much about the collection of trimmings within the shaver, but I appreciate that I am not finding little bits of beard all over the sink in the morning!</li>
            <li> It really does suck up all my facial hair without missing a single whisker.</li>
            <li> I use this in a razor-assisting capacity for when I&#x27;ve gone a little while without shaving and my beard is a bit too long/tough for my normal electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews have complained about the vacuum compartment door breaking off but it seems pretty sturdy, not gorilla proof sturdy, but sturdy.</li>
            <li> Took me a couple days to get it all dried out and the electronics back to working properly, this included a rice bag followed by near total dis-assembly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the only reason why I chose this one and not other similar products (some of them cheaper) is because it has a vacuum system that is supposed to catch facial hair, according to the description, &amp;#34;without leaving a mess in the sink&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t trim other areas very close with the depth guard removed.  </li>
            <li> product is clearly &amp;#34;engineered to fail&amp;#34;, presumably so you&#x27;ll be forced to buy a new one every year or so.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco was slowly dying so purchasing a new beard trimmer became a necessity.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is advertised to eliminate, or at least alleviate, cleaning just enough so that beard trimming can be spotless and trouble free</li>
            <li> The vacuum is advertised to eliminate, or at least alleviate, cleaning just enough so that beard trimming can be spotless and trouble free</li>
            <li> But on the new Qt4070/41, the guide comb has tines that extend along the top and front of the cutting head, and END IN SHARP POINTS.</li>
            <li> my primary complaint however is that w/o the comb it doesn&#x27;t trim as closely as the previous model.</li>
            <li> The guide on this does seem different to previous trimmers I&#x27;ve tried, though I can&#x27;t compare directly now, so maybe this is all in my head, but then again…</li>
            <li> This has nearly tripled the time it takes me to trim (previous to the Norelco, I simply trimmed over the sink- problem solved)  5)</li>
            <li> (1) it seems that you can accidentally trim closer than the setpoint by tipping the trimmer at just the right angle; (2) the battery is starting to get weak, after only 6 months; (3) the door latch on the hair bin broke, so I sort of have to hold it</li>
            <li> The vacuum system works really well, very few whiskers in the sink.</li>
            <li> The real box has red labels instead of the green ones used here, yhe trimmer is completely black (no grey colors), has the words &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; instead of the tornado-looking thing (under the power button), &amp; has a red circular turning thing that changes the height of the trim, not back or grey.</li>
            <li> : Too many parts with flimsy construction; needs a small moustache comb; you are limited by few other similar products&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear my facial hair very long so the vacuum worked quite well</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is much lighter than past E-razors I have used.</li>
            <li> Really Philips/Norelco, this is what you killed the T980 for?!?</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only minor.</li>
            <li> However, for getting my beard trimmed I have to remove the plastic part that tells how long the beard should be, totally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery lasted on a week long trip where I made occasional trims almost every day.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out in regards to how long the built-in and non-changeable battery will last.</li>
            <li> My husband had his last trimmer for a long time.</li>
            <li> They advertise themselves to eliminate those short, or long (depending on your beard), hairs that are the byproduct of any beard maintenance.</li>
            <li> Numerous beard guard adjustment levels from long beard to stubble.</li>
            <li> My earlier one lasted a long time--many years-- before plastic bits started breaking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually tried returning it now, 2 months in, but have missed by 30 day window because I waited too long.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge last a long time.</li>
            <li> About 4 months into using the product I thought it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge from week to week, which is strange because I use it maybe 10 minutes at a time and a charge should last 50 to 75 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> Not nearly that simple.  </li>
            <li> but this is only a minor quibble with the design.  </li>
            <li> Needed something to trim the beard and this one has settings that are long enough for my preferred length.</li>
            <li> Subsequent charges have not lasted as long and now it will not retain a charge for any appreciable length of time.  </li>
            <li> It will cut your bear perfectly as long or as short as you want it.  </li>
            <li> I only have one minor critique, the plastic guards on this have an opening</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last a long time as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either too short or too long.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut long enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> All breakable/light plastic that I know will not last long at all.</li>
            <li> charged its lasting for long time.</li>
            <li> The door of the trimmings chamber has long since lost its latch (though it was repaired numerous times.</li>
            <li> A terrific improvement, and I expect to have it and use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> so I only recommend for maintaining long beards.</li>
            <li> I purchased to replace a similar product that I had a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Also, the lowest level you can cut appears to be around 3mm which while short for a beard is really long for a stubble sort of look.</li>
            <li> If you plan to travel, remember to take the charger with you because Philips does not know what long lasting battery is.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my hubs to replace the one that couldn&#x27;t hold a charge for too long anymore...</li>
            <li> It lasted so long because I replaced the internal NiCad battery 2-3 times.  </li>
            <li> Well to make a long story short the calibration of the LED screen to the plastic guard was thrown off somehow.</li>
            <li> He loves the shaver and I love the mess it doesn&#x27;t leave behind.</li>
            <li> The plastic notch that holds it shut is just too flimsy/fragile and breaks off after a few months of normal use.</li>
            <li> but given that my beard is pretty thick and my trimmings are infrequent the cleanup is understandable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the new unit came with none of this, so was a little</li>
            <li> The product feels very cheap since it is made from plastic and the beard trimmer door feels fragile and I am afraid I will break it someday.</li>
            <li> had a few concerns though with the vacuum design: the vacuum container seems a bit too small (fills up quickly with the trimmed hair).</li>
            <li> but the only thing...that I would point out is:  that the vacuum works very well, and sucks up about 90 to 95 percent of all the hair up &amp; in from your face....</li>
            <li> The motor is pretty weak and has trouble operating at certain angles.  </li>
            <li> It has a good thick cutting blade like the classic cordless trimmers of years past, not some wimpy easy-to-break foil like certain other Philips Norelco products.</li>
            <li> In short-- if you don&#x27;t particularly care for small details</li>
            <li> /&gt;To finish up, without the comb, I trimmed a clear beard borderline down to my neck in reverse position, without once feeling any pulling or discomfort of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had to completely shave my beard down to the minimum 1mm to avoid patchiness.</li>
            <li> The stubble comb works fine, but it is not comfortable for my fairly thick 3/4 to 1\\&quot; beard -although</li>
            <li> battery lasts so long that it&#x27;s hard for me to actually say exactly how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> He used to make such a mess with the clippings when he would trim his beard, but with this trimmer, there is virtually no mess.  </li>
            <li> Long charge, even shaving, vacuum hair collection</li>
            <li> Vacuum works well and the batter lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Length selection w/o swapping guards, vacuum,  long battery life.</li>
            <li> Second of all, it was pure serendipity that this product came up for review for me when it did, because my Wahl beard and mustache trimmer had just started to go bad on me, and I was getting ready to buy a new one, and I was considering an all-in-one unit like this one, anyway.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to hold closed, but should you slip or forget it could mean quite a mess.</li>
            <li> I even took the hair guard off and shaved my entire beard down to bare skin!</li>
            <li> The difference is immense for those coarse, manly hairs - it almost seems like other products may have only been tested on baby peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Last 4 times as long as I thought!</li>
            <li> The vacuum is also not powerful enough to keep clumps of head stubble from falling everywhere, like a tiny stubbleball they will fall upon shoulders or ears and explode into tiny clusters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took him a few shaves to get his goatee even with a new device and all, but</li>
            <li> The battery last a very long time between charges.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a very long time and could even be used plugged in if necessary.</li>
            <li> Item did not last very long and had issues after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> otherwise you will take more hair than you expected, stay away from Philips trimmer its useless .</li>
            <li> I fixed it with some black electrical tape and just tap out the hair in the sink every morning when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> Finally, the versatility of the trimmer, allowing up to 18mm of cutting length, puts it miles ahead of most brands on the market at department stores and pharmacies (Wahl, Conair, Braun, etc.).</li>
            <li> Although it does seem odd that Phillips Norelco seem to be ignoring the feedback here completely.</li>
            <li> Love the digital display for cutting length.</li>
            <li> only negative I can report is that the 4070 really shouldn&#x27;t be called a stubble trimmer, as the closest trim using the contour comb is 1 mm.</li>
            <li> As for the hair-catching feature being somehow difficult, all I have to say is \\&quot;stop whining\\&quot; and enjoy the purpose of this device which is to crop facial hair.</li>
            <li> The latch that holds the cover closed is a cheap thin plastic extrusion on the cover.  </li>
            <li> Considering I&#x27;d already spent about $300 in unreliable razor over the years, I decided to take the leap and try a more expensive (&gt;$40) model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I have shaved 8 times so far, and it still has over half of a charge&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope this never stops dead when I am running late for an important appointment.  </li>
            <li> The gap is wide enough that you WILL maul your upper lip when attempting to trip your mustache!</li>
            <li> The pictures are tiny; the instructions are minimal and linked to the tiny pics.</li>
            <li> I had purchases this before a few years ago, and I needed to buy another one as the old ones batteries finally gave out.</li>
            <li> recently, four months after purchase, the plastic latch that keeps the hair chamber closed broke, meaning it is at risk of swinging open and spilling shavings at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still comes with open, face-stabbing combs not with the proper closed ones.</li>
            <li> The default comb however does work however a bit more difficult than the contour version on harder surfaces - like my head.</li>
            <li> Not much else comes in the box aside from the standard brush and instruction manual in 28 different languages showing how to plug it in and how you shouldn&#x27;t shave underwater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until Norelco changes the design back to the tray they used in previous models, or at least alters this to make it more durable, I won&#x27;t waste my money on another one of their trimmers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes a little uneven, so I go over it every which direction to get it right.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Wahl as a back up in case the Phillips did not live up to my expectations.     </li>
            <li> It still makes a little bit of mess when he shaves, but not NEARLY as bad, and not NEARLY as much hair is in my sink!  </li>
            <li> I finally had to retire my old Norelco vacuum beard trimmer recently, as the metal grates over the vacuum intakes had gotten bent from knocking whiskers out of it, and the motor blades were grinding hard against the grates and making all kinds of noise.</li>
            <li> Use to trim my beard and sometimes trim down hair to shave completely if i&#x27;ve let it grow to long for my electric shave to cut.</li>
            <li> Some trimmers I&#x27;ve had made it too easy to start cutting with an incorrect setting, which could really make a mess.  </li>
            <li> Given my previous experience, I have been very gentle with this unit and especially careful every time that I opened the door.</li>
            <li> Up until about week ago, a single charge would last for two to three weeks with me trimming stubble every 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> A single battery charge will last me a couple of months using it twice a week.  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend it, have not found a single fault.</li>
            <li> And he really likes that it sucks the hair in like a vacuum</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud on Turbo with the vacuum, but not too loud and not much louder than any other trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Generally, I use a Wahl without a guard, which is extremely close.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have near the mess I do with the Remington MB4040.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is helpful and catches almost all the clippings, but I still stand in my dry shower and use it before I turn on the water</li>
            <li> i mean really cheapo norelco unit i picked up at big lots...</li>
            <li> At first hated this product because if I didn&#x27;t shave at a proper angle, it would cut most of my beard off.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer&#x27;s vacuum does loose a couple of hairs, but a lot less than my old Remington that it</li>
            <li> but I often find myself going back to my broken Wahl to finish the job right</li>
            <li> Going all the way down and then back up re-syncs the digital display with the actual setting.  </li>
            <li> Also while the digital display shows the length (in mm) that you have it set for, I&#x27;ve had one instance of the battery running down and the actual length setting and that displayed were incorrect when plugged back in.</li>
            <li> so I tend to trim them both down to different sizes, so switching easily to different lengths was a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hole where the vaccum sucks in the air is somewhat small and can get clogged easily.</li>
            <li> Like so many others mentioned, the vacuum door is a little difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I found no problem as long as you are careful with the vacuum door and try not to force it open.</li>
            <li> It was still usable, but the hair collector door had broken with normal use, the vacuum was completely gone, and it would keep jamming up no matter</li>
            <li> The vacuum function, although not all bad, is kind of useless, and that is really what this particular model is known for.  </li>
            <li> And I find that if you use it often enough, the hairs are small enough to be caught by the vaccum and make no mess which means you can use it anywhere.</li>
            <li> There are smaller, less expensive trimmers that are better for the mustache.</li>
            <li> But the fine trimming of lines is a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> It has sharp plastic fins that are only supported on the back side of the head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the comb, only the contour following piece, so I can&#x27;t comment on the sharp edges or anything.</li>
            <li> Though I do have to get out my other smaller trimmer once a week to get the spots that require a smaller blade.  </li>
            <li> when shaving, hair does not stay inside plastic container nor does it vaccum it like it says it does..got a color white with black and not blue and white</li>
            <li> The only thing this does better is leaving behind less mess because of the built-in vacuum.</li>
            <li> The replacement unit had the same problem as the original, the latch failed after 20 or so uses.</li>
            <li> It does a good job vacuuming cut hair in, and making it less messy, but it fails to do an even cut on the jawline.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m left with the impression that the QT4070 is trying really, really hard to distinguish itself from the older T980.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make any mess all thanks to its&#x27; built in vacuum system which watched the hair in a little chamber.</li>
            <li> while the vacuum on this new trimmer works, in both turbo and non-turbo mode, as someone else mentioned in their review it only really sucks up about 50% of the hair.</li>
            <li> After the vacuum door on my old norelco vacuum trimmer finally wore out and cracked off (you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d put in a pin hinge at least), I decided to give them another try.</li>
            <li> attachments are flimsy - very thin plastic that bends and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> owned a previous model that lasted 3 or 4yrs    update: and now i&#x27;ve managed to break the clip on the lil clear door, so you have to hold it closed for the vacuum to work</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little loud (and louder with turbo) but not a deal breaker for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud, but it trims well.</li>
            <li> I only hope it last as long as my other.</li>
            <li> I have had experience of expensive Philips products failing the quality test too many times, from active speakers through to shavers.</li>
            <li> My main complaint and reason for docking a star is actually for edging with the guard off.  </li>
            <li> It is a decent shaver/trimmer of average to below average quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cut as short as some other Philips I had, but is OK.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum works as is described.</li>
            <li> I recomend it only if you can&#x27;t find any other type with vacuum</li>
            <li> My only complaint about it is that it is very loud, but I think this is a side effect of it having plenty of power and a built-in vacuum.</li>
            <li> meant that the size of the compartment holding the hair it vacuumed is small, and the compartment has too many small tight spaces for hair to get stuck.</li>
            <li> The vacuum protrudes slightly which makes it hard to get a clean sharp line on the edges.</li>
            <li> Looks slick and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Even when I very carefully try to hold the trimmer in a consistent manner across my beard, I end up with a very uneven trim.  </li>
            <li> The latest iteration which has a part number QT4070/41 comes with both head attachments... the one which people originally complained about as beling sharp our pointy is not very good at the longer trim lengths because it could be pokey... and because it&#x27;s too flexible</li>
            <li> To bad remington stopped making the vacuum trimmers , why&#x27;d they do that I have no idea, this norelco is one of the only vacuum trimmers left on the market but the blade is angled at a weird direction and the vacuum is right on top of the blade</li>
            <li> I have a pretty tough beard and the vacuum</li>
            <li> It has a turbo button which make both the cutting and the suction more vigorous, without compromising the quality of the cut.</li>
            <li> it looks kind of ugly</li>
            <li> so I can look for a device that is slimmer at the cutting end and better suited to mustaches.</li>
            <li> According to Norelco, the turbo button creates \\&quot;greater suction power and increased cutting speed\\&quot;, so shouldn&#x27;t it just be turbo all the time?</li>
            <li> So they became useless when the batteries were dead, or if they lost their charge in the middle of a trimming - most annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, using primitive NiCad batteries just sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few beard trimmers and so far this is the most disappointing.</li>
            <li> I still use it to do minor trimming.  </li>
            <li> Minor Update - 7/5/2015:</li>
            <li> Also, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the alarming reviews cautioning about the potential to get cut with this product.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> Now, it takes me under a minute and nowhere close to how messy my old system was.</li>
            <li> telling you the length, long battery life, travel lock, &amp;c.</li>
            <li> The only downside I have come across is the door to empty shavings</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it does in the long run, but for now you got my stars...</li>
            <li> (The lithium battery battery will last for about an hour in the event that your bathroom is devoid of outlets?)</li>
            <li> The trimmer ran for maybe 3 seconds before telling me it was empty again, then going back to showing the battery as fully charged.  </li>
            <li> Only because i carefully reviewed my email did i realize it was still out of stock.</li>
            <li> Trimming door latch is fragile, I have to wrap a rubber band around it now to keep it closed.</li>
            <li> I read the reveiws and I can not see what any complaints are about except perhaps people with long beards.  </li>
            <li> How did I ever manage to survive my wandering days in a whisker wilderness for so long?  </li>
            <li> Battery life is long so it does not have to be charged often.</li>
            <li> But if you are careful should last longer.</li>
            <li> On the shortest setting it is simply to long</li>
            <li> Minor:</li>
            <li> This is no old fashioned trimmer.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long, for about 8 shaves without recharging.</li>
            <li> Overall works as expected.  </li>
            <li> are my complaints and they are minor, but they are the reason for 4 stars instead:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather get calf implants in a third world country (not really).</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time, and works well for a stubble look.</li>
            <li> This will require you to turn off the trimmer and empty the hair trap numerous times during each trim.  </li>
            <li> It lasted about as long as I could expect, seeing as I trim my beard one to two times a week.</li>
            <li> When re-attaching the beard comb one needs to carefully align the comb with the groves in the trimmer to get it to go on properly</li>
            <li> After a long wait (weeks)</li>
            <li> that slide out of my last model that I could tap in the trashcan or the sink to empty.  </li>
            <li> so would not recommend it for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> and i have to hold it closed during the entire trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something I probably should have done a long time ago, but I wanted to get my $50 out of this product.</li>
            <li> Can some one explain why this is taking this long.........</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for a long time and it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag on any hair.</li>
            <li> now have to carefully contort my hand to keep the door from popping open, while trimming my face...&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Turbo is complete waste just makes lot of noice.</li>
            <li> Charge keeps for a long time.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the product reps take care of 2+ customers at a time (they admitted this to me when I confronted them about all the long pauses on hold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall wish I had one of these long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a long charge.&lt;br /&gt;Precise trimming and edging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long if you use it 1-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> about 13-14 mm long.</li>
            <li> The trimmer definitely works as I expected.  </li>
            <li> It broke after moderate and careful use.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning it doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Product met my expectations and I intend to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It holds the charge a long time.</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS I HAVE IT</li>
            <li> I find myself spending about 3 times as long doing cleanup with the 7300 compared to the T980.</li>
            <li> plus is that the battery lasts extremely long.  </li>
            <li> , it was rough on my face, didn&#x27;t go very short, and missed a lot of hairs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I will occasionally see the LED number jump around or get stuck on a number I just have to be ultra careful</li>
            <li> minor glitch</li>
            <li> The mechanism by which the hair compartment opens and closes is poorly constructed with my device at first being loosely closed and now open if I do not physically hold it</li>
            <li> Long Battery Life&lt;br</li>
            <li> i went to use the shaver last night for the third time ever and it was already dead, i had to charge it after 15 min total use.</li>
            <li> The middle bends which cut lower than expected.</li>
            <li> I want this one for a long time.now,I owend it.</li>
            <li> cord is quite long so works for</li>
            <li> The trick is to keep trimming now and then because when hair is longer it gets much harder and messier to trim as it was for me last night.  </li>
            <li> I think the majority of the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; reviews came from people trying the OT4070 with the grey attachment.</li>
            <li> Does not trim as short as I expected.</li>
            <li> Its bulkier than my last trimmer  I still have to use another trimmer for the strai9ght lines as this trimmer is really wide.  </li>
            <li> You think that trap was going to catch shavings over a quarter of an inch long?  </li>
            <li> I played around with the different settings and adjusted the length multiple times only to see that there were still a few rogue strands sticking out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Battery lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Not too long, but not looking like stubble.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact you can use it battery operated, which lasts a long time, or if you forget to charge it just plug it in.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do; it did arrive with the second (\\&quot;Contour\\&quot;) trim head; the trimming blades are wide</li>
            <li> It has just caused me to be careful not to allow the door to open up when in use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it catches all but 5%-10% of the hair, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s wanted an adjustable trimmer for a long time.</li>
            <li> Who keeps receipts and UPC cutouts for stuff like this for that long?</li>
            <li> it holds a charge for a l long time.</li>
            <li> How long has Norelco been in business?</li>
            <li> After only 3 months of use twice per week, the plastic lip broke off and thus the door does not stay closed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for a long time</li>
            <li> I had put off replacing the old one for a few years as I read reviews that gave problems.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I LIKE TO BYU ONCE FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t cut as long.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see a need to rehash all that information.  </li>
            <li> I can see why some people have had problems with the shavings door, but as long as you&#x27;re mindful of that when opening it you shouldn&#x27;t break it.</li>
            <li> I had been through a few of these trying to replace an old Remington.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately for me the return window is long gone</li>
            <li> I usually get 3 trims out of the battery, which is cool, but pointless.</li>
            <li> The second was worse than the first.</li>
            <li> The multi-year long-life battery this thing uses is pretty worthless when the clip that keeps the door of the hair trap shut is made of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned to using my old hair clippers (meant for the hair on the top of your head) for this task. :(</li>
            <li> To make it worse, parts of your beard will be shorter and parts longer if you don&#x27;t apply exactly the same pressure against your face everywhere.</li>
            <li> Sensitive enough that I tear with even the gentlest of razors, so I&#x27;m forced to rely on trimmers such as this one for day to day shaving.</li>
            <li> However, when switching on the trimmer fresh out of the box, the sensor is already confused.</li>
            <li> Seems to have a much stronger motor to cut thru a thick beard.</li>
            <li> In terms of those who originally thought the new attachment was terrible, it looks like the product now ships with the old attachment and the new attachment.</li>
            <li> Third, after the trimmer was out of the Amazon return period, the sharp tined comb that was sent grabbed a loose piece of my skin and the blade bit my face a tiny bit, drawing blood.  </li>
            <li> I have to remove the entire head and blade assembly, move the selector dial up and down several times and eventually it will reset.  </li>
            <li> downfall is that, the blades do not protrude enough which means holding the machine upside down and creating an outline for your beard or sideburns is not possible.</li>
            <li> Shelf space is a premium in my bathroom, and I never had a space big enough to put it down on its side.</li>
            <li> me, I was just looking for something basic to trim a beard back down to shave it off, or to trim sideburns.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice the vacuum function until I look down, and there is very little hair in the sink.  </li>
            <li> Since the vacuum opening is raised very close to the cutting blades (and is no longer a flexible shutter), it gets in the way of making straight line cuts.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is not perfect at gathering 100% of trimmings but is a big help and worth using.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature actually works on approx 95% of the cuttings; I will ususally find a few hairs on my countertop, but is night and day from my standard shaver.  </li>
            <li> I mainly wanted to comment on the saga of the missing Contour Follow Comb so thoroughly covered in other reviews of this item.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace an older Norelco due to a dead battery.</li>
            <li> Now if you like to cut all this down to bare skin, then this shaver is 4 stars for you.</li>
            <li> It holds it&#x27;s charge for a very long time and sucks up the trimmings pretty well as long as you remember to empty the cuttings chamber every couple of days.</li>
            <li> I also find that the location of the vacuum makes it harder to judge where the blades are when trying to get in close around my goatee and sideburns.  </li>
            <li> I had never had a trimmer with a vacuum - and now having it for a couple of week - I really do not need.</li>
            <li> The vacuum doesnt get all the hairs and as the blade is quite wide i have to buy a separate trimmer for  trimming around my mustache</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t hold it closed manually, hair will go everywhere defeating the purpose of the vacuum.</li>
            <li> He loves the vacuum feature because it contains his whiskers and he can empty it in the trash.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is what got me curious.  </li>
            <li> I just empty the vacuum into the garbage when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I understand that it has a vacuum, but it couldn&#x27;t even handle a wet beard.</li>
            <li> Now I have to hold the door closed with my hand for the vacuum to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to stop and empty and de-clog the vacuum of this trimmer FOUR TIMES during a routine trim.</li>
            <li> the vacuum system, it never really worked well with my T980</li>
            <li> In fact the only down side is that the new trimmer does not come with a narrow mustache blade and it also arrived sans case.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I had to replace an older one (same model) because the latch on the little vacuum chamber door broke, and the trimmer shuts off when it opens.</li>
            <li> The battery last forever, there is an aspiration system that collects all the hairs cut, the cutting length is easily adjustable.</li>
            <li> I saw some back and forth in previous reviews about the guard that comes with it, but some got two, and I got both the floating and regular heads.  </li>
            <li> you have to give a slightly aggressive push and pull on the left side to swing it open.  </li>
            <li> the initial picture shown, the razor is black (like additional photos shown), not greenish blue.  </li>
            <li> So the suction (even on high) doesn&#x27;t cut down on the area of mess, just the amount of mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the vacuum compartment door came loose after a few months and would no longe lock in place, and lets out shavings (not a deal breaker, just empty frequently or use tape to hold on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was not nearly as good and broke down fairly quickly within 6 months.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s just as easy to wipe down a sink with 50 stubbles as one with 500, the vacuum feature was useless for my needs.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t totally prevent the mess, but I don&#x27;t have to shave outside anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been trying to hold a trash can under my chin while trimming with my old trimmer, and it was a mess and a pain!</li>
            <li> One is grey plastic and fixed, the other is black plastic and has a spring on it.</li>
            <li> It renders the entire unit useless because the door is integral and cannot be replaced, nor is it easy or convenient to use it with the door opening while you shave - it makes a mess.</li>
            <li> This really sucks up all the hairs and leave behind much less hair on the counter top then regular shavers I think its a must buy for men with facial hair</li>
            <li> Turbo button makes it work 2-3x as fast and vacuum function sucks harder too to leave minimal hair on your counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the vacuum only catches about half of the hairs.</li>
            <li> My only (minor) complaint is that it showed up in the box with the clearly inferior plastic stubble comb, despite mentioning in the info and on the box that it includes the contour comb.</li>
            <li> so those with long or heavy beards might need to empty it frequently.  </li>
            <li> The other one is the contour following comb.</li>
            <li> so I have to pass over the same area a couple of times due to the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> but it is listed in several other reviews.  </li>
            <li> If you look closely at images of the two units side-by-side, you&#x27;ll see that the comb design on the 4050 is closed--no giant gap and sharp tines with which to cut/stab yourself--and it also has a flexible guide.</li>
            <li> The adjustable guide (or comb) is comprised of an upper part and lower part which are perpendicular to each other.</li>
            <li> After popping open the compartment, there is a wadded little mass of beard hair that simply falls out.</li>
            <li> Other Amazon reviewers seem to feel the same way, AFTER they have Philips Norelco replace the \\&quot;poorly-designed comb\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Their customer service was unable to provide me with the contour comb, or a refund because I wasn&#x27;t the original person to purchase it (it was a Christmas gift).</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, my 4070 came with two combs, the contour following comb and the stubble comb.</li>
            <li> The last one was a Remington something or other that I bought at Walmart and it lasted all of 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> When using it with the guard off, there are two sharp plastic points on the outside bottom edge of the trimming blade.  </li>
            <li> Also the open comb attachment has pointy and rather sharp edges which can hurt.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have mentioned, this did come with the extra contour guard that everyone says is a must.  </li>
            <li> regards to other reviews: the extra comb is now included in case you were wondering.</li>
            <li> I was never aware that there is a second place trimmings accumulate.  </li>
            <li> Yet Amazon and other resellers still have it (currently writing this Feb 08</li>
            <li> Also, while it&#x27;s only cosmetic, the length adjuster knob on my QT4070 is red instead of the blue/black knob.&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;After a little over a year the door that holds the hair clippings busted.</li>
            <li> I knew this would possibly be an issue because of other reviews.</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;it&#x27;s not the same as my other</li>
            <li> Well, a lot of the hair doesn&#x27;t really get trapped in the little compartment specifically for it.</li>
            <li> I felt pretty dumb at that point</li>
            <li> Several years ago while living in Florida my son gave me one of the other beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer from a department about two years ago for trimming my beard about every other day (setting #4) and the occasional man-scaping.  </li>
            <li> and I only need to charge it about every other week.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews mention requesting a different guard.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re talking about shaving here, men, and we&#x27;re the only ones who have to look at this thing every every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I was excited to purchase this for my husband for Christmas - Unfortunately, it was a dissapointment almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I read, on line, of other reports of the same thing</li>
            <li> If you trim without the comb, you might find it a little more difficult as there is about a 3mm gap between razor blade and razor body which requires you to tilt the razor up at an angle to get around your ears or trim a moustache.</li>
            <li> Does not trim as short as my other trimmer</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews, my 4070 came with the contour comb, which is very similar to the one that the T980 used.  </li>
            <li> I used to go outside to trim my beard with the other trimmer I had</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t rip my skin like other similar products.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product but cleaning trimmer was little difficult.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you have, this is further proof that you can&#x27;t go home again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually never owned any other trimmer/shaver before.  </li>
            <li> I can go through an entire week of trimming (ever other day) without having to worry about plugging in the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is why for us it is just a B product: my son has fine hair and it just won&#x27;t cut it well; the vac quickly fills up and I have to empty it which really slows down the process; and last the adjustable clip made for cutting hair is awkward because of the way it is exposed.</li>
            <li> At the very least, it seems to significantly contain the mess.  </li>
            <li> Read other reviews for an adequate description as to why it&#x27;s poor.</li>
            <li> The other main complaint I saw in reviews remarked upon the low quality of the stubble trimmer as well as the harshness of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works well enough to collect the vast majority of clippings (I&#x27;ve yet to find one that gets them all), but it&#x27;s a relatively small container</li>
            <li> This is significantly larger than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned, mostly due to the fancy LCD screen and the vacuum compartment.     </li>
            <li> It is very hard to get a consistent beard trim with this, and it takes forever.</li>
            <li> lasts for a very long time and does the job well.</li>
            <li> This charger does not stay charged for very long AT ALL.</li>
            <li> and/or your beard is very long-</li>
            <li> (I am very careful with these things), the hook was about to break apart from the lid, which it finally did after I touched it.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t take very long though.  </li>
            <li> Now I always keep myself perfectly dry before using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do have one complaint about delivery - UPS left the package in the snow in front of my garage when the front door is twenty feet away and the walk was clear.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Used to judge the quality and amount of beard trim by the sound it makes when cutting the coarse hair...</li>
            <li> This review was almost a ONE-star rating, due to the sharp tines and general design of the comb.</li>
            <li> However, with the latter it only takes some water and a few hand splashes to get them to disappear.</li>
            <li> However, with the latter it only takes some water and a few hand splashes to get them to disappear.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you are a daily trimmer and it only has to snip the end off a few hairs it would be OK, but for a person like me that trims their beard and gets a hair cut once a month it is near worthless.  </li>
            <li> I have been using different types of trimmers for last 8 years, I never shave and trim everyday before work.</li>
            <li> I am usually in a hurry and also press it pretty firmly against my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to trim my beard back to stub at least 15 times and so far I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> (If you don&#x27;t know this, you&#x27;ll be cutting off a lot more than expected).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put it into my bag or a drawer in lock mode; take it out a few days later; and the shaver is entirely discharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A bit of wear later, the door would not stay closed -- so I had to use some tape to keep it closed.</li>
            <li> because the vacuum portion block the blade any other way.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the messy look of a short trimmed beard and the QT4070</li>
            <li> The result is needing to re-trim areas of my face several times in a futile attempt to achieve consistency before ultimately accepting the uneven trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even unguarded (just be slow and steady).</li>
            <li> The shaver also ignored hubby&#x27;s mustache completely, even on turbo, but the hair there is very stiff and lies flat, so it wasn&#x27;t cooperative about being sucked into the guard.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not new to the Norelco line.  </li>
            <li> Delayed by shipper 3 days ago and no new info since.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-- limited functionality, Again, due to the placement of the vacuum intake, you can&#x27;t take off the contour comb and use the trimmer to, er, trim sideburns, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-- ergonomics.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I did find it hard to trim under my nose, but elsewhere it was fine and produced less mess.</li>
            <li> And I love the fact that it vacuums the hair - less mess left behind in the bathroom!  </li>
            <li> Maybe the vacuum works better for shorter sizes, but I assure you it works bad the longer you trim.</li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t capture ALL the hair but it does capture most of it so cleaning up isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> vacuum trimmers are getting harder and harder to find these days.</li>
            <li> Hope they fix the vacuum in next go round.</li>
            <li> EVERY SINGLE TIME.</li>
            <li> I can use this while plugged into the wall whereas the Panasonic was limited to operating after charging on the stand for a while.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll bet a single charge lasts me over a month.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; setting allows me to do a single pass.  </li>
            <li> (a single AA battery was found after I took the unit apart) to be changed by the user.</li>
            <li> battery lasts 10 seconds -- so this is now my limited edition CORDED Philips Norelco QT4070 Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> single charge works over a month for me.</li>
            <li> mustache trimming is limited.</li>
            <li> The adapter digs into the skin while trying to get the beard a single length.  </li>
            <li> Do not expect it to pick up every single hair because it never will.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t catch every single hair so you&#x27;ll still have some hairs in the sink/on the counter</li>
            <li> This model clogs every, single time I use it</li>
            <li> A single charge might keep for a while</li>
            <li> /&gt;The QT4070 hasn&#x27;t pulled a single hair, and gives an even trim even on the shortest (1mm) setting.</li>
            <li> So...there&#x27;s very little protection this device actually offers.</li>
            <li> That said, it works really well and makes no more noise than a typical electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Yes, about half as much if not more is still in the sink.</li>
            <li> The vacum feature actually works as long as you are trimming less then a 1/4 inch.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it last as long as my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> the other a hard plastic guard and both are very inconsistent.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not very consistent due to the tines flexibility, but if you want the shortest possible stubble you need to use that attachment</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t wide enough head and the little vacuum immediately got stopped up.  </li>
            <li> Not good for much else...</li>
            <li> The sink is not perfectly clean - you may have to use one piece of toilet paper to retrieve the minuscule quantity of hair missed by the vacuum.</li>
            <li> I immediate noticed they included two combs, the open comb that allowed some of the nicks and cuts mentioned by other reviewers and the closed comb that resolves this issue.  </li>
            <li> I have also used the stubble trimmer head - seems they may have redesigned this somewhat as it did not poke me while I was using it, but I was also being careful due to the earlier reviews....</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra money for the upgraded version with the LED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I find that the vacuum is not strong enough for my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this beard trimmer when the guard on my old Norelco broke (not sure the model number).</li>
            <li> and I trimmed it last time with a dark tee shirt on.</li>
            <li> Just wish they had included the small detail head that the old version had.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not worth the premium for this trimmer over the basic one I have.</li>
            <li> The reason i ended up on the market for shaver was becuase i blew up my last shaver in europe plugging it into an average 220V socket with a plug adapter.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed quite honestly...</li>
            <li> What is the point of designing the trimmer teeth lower than the cutter when the ones behind it are higher with no support??</li>
            <li> I was very disatisfied to realize that after careful reviews prior to buying this product, I wound up with a poorly designed product anyway.</li>
            <li> and was disappointed with all kind of trimmers  except this.my brother has  T980.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s about and inch long and quarter inch wide.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco trimmers for ages and have loved some and hated some, but I always expected two basic things.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning compartment cover latch broke and head comes loose.</li>
            <li> separate combs to loose, all in one unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plastic cover on the front below the trim adjuster dial around the air vents feels loose.</li>
            <li> When traveling, I don&#x27;t like leaving things like this loose.</li>
            <li> the shape of the trimmer is far less ergonomic than T980, less convenient to hold</li>
            <li> The step down 4050 takes several hours&lt;</li>
            <li> Now that we got that out of the way lets get down to actually using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, going to by this same trimmer when mine will go down.</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer twice a week and just last week it seemed to have slowed down.  </li>
            <li> : at one point when I was fumbling with the length adjustment, the dial slipped and then the trimmer would only go down to five millimeters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would not recommend this at all unless you plan to only use it to go down to stubble.</li>
            <li> The trimmings are always too much to simply wash down the sink.</li>
            <li> back to the tape trick (escaping from that was my main motivation behind ordering this newer model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little hard to open, sometimes, but an improvement over my older Norelco.</li>
            <li> Also the old model had a small door on the vacuum assembly which moved up and down on a spring to catch and hold the hair, this model doesn&#x27;t have that door.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum not perfect but helps clean up the mess.</li>
            <li> So then what happens is my facial hair is so long that my electric razor can&#x27;t get through it, and the little trimmer that comes on the razor sort of works, but</li>
            <li> Whereas the T980 rattled and the length setting felt a little unsure (push a little too hard and it would cave a bit), the T980 had a major advantage over this new model - the vacuum was stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the defectiveness is due to this change, or a new, weaker vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has failed to hold a charge more than a few days at a time; it reads fully charged but the next day it is dead.</li>
            <li> actual trimmer seems to work nicely, not better of worse than other ones, but the unique features of this one don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As stated before,  the vacuum does a decent job, but not a great job at collecting hair.  </li>
            <li> Also the older one had a broken vacuum chamber door.</li>
            <li> It has reliability issues and to answer my previous question about the vacuum function, it is DEFINITELY not worth the extra money, IMHO.  </li>
            <li> However, after just a few shaves, it became obvious that I needed to press harder to lift some of the whiskers that lay flat.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty tough beard and this little guy made short work of it, neat as a pin!    </li>
            <li> This is not so much because of the blades, however, as because of the powerful vacuum that sucks the hair into the cutting blade.    </li>
            <li> The result is very uneven cutting length because the tines flex and curved areas of the face can easily enter the gap and make direct contact with the blades.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with the new model is that it does not have the sliding piece below the razors that the T980 had.  </li>
            <li> The hinge on the vacuum trap also fails quickly; note that I am not one to be manhandling my equipment, especially after learning that others had this same failure, I was determined to not let mine break.  </li>
            <li> For me, the purpose of the vacuum is to avoid having to wipe down my sink after trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> This vacuum will by no means catch everything, and you&#x27;ll still end up wiping down the counter when you&#x27;re done, but it seems to catch the majority of falling whiskers.</li>
            <li> I thought of ordering a part from Norelco, but decided it was a bad design to start with, and that the kind of trim I was getting from that one was not worth the hassle or wait.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The guard gets in the way, and even without the guard, the cutting head is not designed to get in that area easily.   </li>
            <li> It may be my hair type ( I am a black male )</li>
            <li> the 10 year search continues    If you are looking for very short stubble, this product delivers.... if you want anything even slightly longer...</li>
            <li> The specs I saw said it would trim to less than 1mm, while each of the guards provided only go to a 1mm minimum.  </li>
            <li> I could never see the tiny number the previous model had.  </li>
            <li> If, like some previous reviewers, you do not receive the contour following comb, this is an error and you should call Philips Norelco and try to get your comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is all described in implicit black and white prints under the section \\&quot;Cleaning\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The color of the trimmer came black and white.</li>
            <li> And I used it to actually shave my face as I like to have a slightly stubbled look and to trim my goatee.  </li>
            <li> Previous shavers were work to use (multiple runs to get the stubble even) but this one works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> At the shortest setting, I would say that my beard looks like it typically did not at 5 pm, but at 6 am the next morning.  </li>
            <li> Oddly, as one reviewer mentioned,your beard does feel different after trimming it each morning.  </li>
            <li> it only catches maybe half to two thirds of the hair it cuts.</li>
            <li> however you have to remember to intermittently throw out the hair as it is a small pocket that fills up quickly especially for larger beards / hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I only use my trimmer 2-3 times a week, so it took less than 25 uses before it broke.  </li>
            <li> device itself also feels lighter, and has the feeling of less durability compared with earlier models.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t care less about the digital component of this.</li>
            <li> that my previous Norelco left cut halfway, yes...</li>
            <li> Even though, I plug the charger into the wall and the status indicates charging, the next time I try to use it (no more than a week later), the battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typically, I use it about every 4-5 days and it holds a charge through several uses before needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my numerous previous trimmers that the battery dies on (the batteries are not replaceable).  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item with some trepidation because of several of the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> seriously philips, charge me an additional 10$ for a decent quality pouch</li>
            <li> so I can usually get through a complete usage without having to empty it.</li>
            <li> Takes way less time than traditional blade shaving, and you don&#x27;t have to do it every</li>
            <li> The first one I received had a weird issue related to power.  </li>
            <li> seriously philips, charge me an additional 10$ for a decent quality pouch</li>
            <li> After using its previous model for 10 years, I finally upgraded to this one.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this product, and even at the lowest setting it doesn&#x27;t have the same control as the previous trimmer I was using.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve only shaved half your face.</li>
            <li> It has the same tactile rubbery plastic that my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush has, though with a black face for masculinity.</li>
            <li> Previously, Id trim on the short side and let it grow in.</li>
            <li> , the blades are much larger than previous trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> My previous version of this item finally died (not even corded would work...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought 100 things off of amazon and this is the first thing that has actually made me angry</li>
            <li> Its not perfect, some hair does escape and the reservoir fills up quickly.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is for trimming my mustache, I prefer the narrow trimmer attachment that came with the older model (T980?).  </li>
            <li> Super lame.  </li>
            <li> Not impossibly, but difficult.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how little you need to cut for this to work, but the little amount of hair left on my head was too much for this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a lot of people saying the vacuum feature is not good - but I completely disagree.  </li>
            <li> While the trimmer makes several significant steps forward in design; it falters on functionality, offering inferior performance with its vacuum and dangerous or uneven trims with the stubble and comb heads.</li>
            <li> You would need to empty the chamber multiple times if you&#x27;re doing serious trimming duty, as it is pretty small.</li>
            <li> &quot; look, the T-980 and the QT4070 are very similar - in fact the cutting heads are interchangeable between the two models, and I get the exactly the same results from both.    </li>
            <li> If the Norelco brand or vacuum feature appeal to you, at $5 less, Norelco also makes the [[ASIN:B003U8K6M6</li>
            <li> so now he doesn&#x27;t make such a mess</li>
            <li> My estimate that less 50% of my trimmings made it into the trimmings vacuum receiving chamber</li>
            <li> Works, but vacuum is gimicky doesnt catch all the hair, but cleanup amount is less.</li>
            <li> Well, the system does catch some of the facial hair, but it still leaves some mess.</li>
            <li> Still plenty of mess in the sink, but not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> prevents a big mess of hair.  </li>
            <li> but it did capture about a third of the mess.</li>
            <li> other problem, albeit minor, is that it the vaccuum chamber cannot be rinsed per the instructions.</li>
            <li> The vacuum portion has helped keep less hairs in the sink when trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t decide to replace my old (apparently worn out)</li>
            <li> battery doesn&#x27;t last too long, especially compared to my Braun electric shaver; you can hear the battery drain slowly each time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Far too thin to last a long time on a latch stress point like this.  </li>
            <li> My new (expensive) purchase has just been consigned to the bathroom sink closet, and I have retrieved my 5 year old worn out but</li>
            <li> Comparing this to my previous trimmer, a $10 Wahl Beard that lasted me over 5 years, this product is clearly not in it for the long haul.</li>
            <li> The part makes the trimmer very forgiving by making it hard to mess up your beard.  </li>
            <li> Half a week later when I go to use it again, there&#x27;s a 50/50 shot that it says the battery is completely empty.</li>
            <li> Seen other comments suggesting that it cuts an uneven length due to hinged comb-head not following facial contours.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum, one of its main selling-points, works very poorly and only collects about 25% of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I read quite a few of the reviews for this product before purchasing it, both positive and negative.</li>
            <li> to, I can trim every day not and not have to worry because the vacuum function works so well and prevents a mess.</li>
            <li> The vacuum on it keeps from making as much mess</li>
            <li> Does reduce the mess with the vacuum.</li>
            <li> But even with vacuum, the hair is falling and making a mess.</li>
            <li> vacuum removes any possibility of a mess.</li>
            <li> but I knew I wanted a trimmer with a vacuum to decrease the mess.  </li>
            <li> trimmer also has a vacuum which eliminates the mess created from trimming.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum feature helped minimize mess.  </li>
            <li> These vacuum beard trimmers do work somewhat, but in no way eliminate the mess that is made trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> The vacuum does prevent a mess in the sink and surrounding counter.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature reduces the mess, but there are still clippings that escape.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim evenly, the vaccum captures far less of the hair, and the latch on the plastic door that holds the hair compartment closed broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> I almost never clean shave and use this daily.  </li>
            <li> With the 4070 I cannot get at consistent beard length due to the poor comb design.  </li>
            <li> So right away, it&#x27;s actually WORSE than the previous model.</li>
            <li> It also keeps the little hair there is relatively in the sink</li>
            <li> But only for a little while.</li>
            <li> In the past I have not had any problems with other products in regards to the former, but the Qt4070 would not allow me to get anywhere on the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just seems like this unit is going to last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Its a little big for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vacuum only works somewhat&lt;br /&gt;Trimming results a little uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adjustment for my short goatee seems to be a little tricky.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning up a little or a lot if hair is not much different.  </li>
            <li> My model 980 battery died last year after a little over 6 years of use.  </li>
            <li> other cautions I read about the guard possibly cutting you could be true, but they include two different trimmer guards.</li>
            <li> I posted a review on it a little while back.</li>
            <li> I owned this trimmer before and had it for a little over 2 years and the clip that held the cover for the hair trimmings broke and would randomly open and the hair would fall out everywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey (got it as an open box , $42.99) since it&#x27;s not a multi-trimmer and just a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Still a little hair to rinse away, but it catches the vast majority of trimmings.</li>
            <li> You just have to keep emptying the little catcher, and expect to do a tiny bit of clean-up when you have finished.  </li>
            <li> The claim is that the vacuum also prevents hairy sinks, and that&#x27;s just not true either.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, after two months of occasional use, the little plastic tab that keeps the door of the collection bin closed broke off.</li>
            <li> Also the battery lasts for a long time, but once it drops below half the second half goes</li>
            <li> Works very well on shaving your genitals sucks up all those little hairs.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine, no better or worse than your average trimmer.</li>
            <li> The little clip has simply worn off so now I have to hold it closed with a rubber band.  </li>
            <li> For example, the last one had a little sliding \\&quot;basket\\&quot; to catch the vacuumed clippings and thus I could slide it out and tap it on the sink to empty it.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature captures the cut hair so there is no clean up.  </li>
            <li> He hadn&#x27;t realized how dull is old was</li>
            <li> As some others have noted, it is really hard to trim near nose area with the guides on.</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of older designs, this machine didn&#x27;t stall or slow down.</li>
            <li> Also, mines came with the extra black guard unlike what other reviewers mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless it overall leaves less unevenness than other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco trimmer, purchased due to the quality of the previous 2.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a vast improvement over what I&#x27;m used to dealing with; it&#x27;ll be hard to go back to a non-vacuum product after this.</li>
            <li> It is ok ,but hard to trim evenly and difficult to do it.</li>
            <li> (there is also a Standard measurement hard guide painted on the backside you can use to double check)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I simply went dull and I found myself needing to go over the same area repeatedly, and then it seemed to not cut at all.</li>
            <li> I actually had to replace the entire unit at $50, just because the blades were dull.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t have it, and i have to call back, this product is going down to a 1 star!</li>
            <li> Vacuum is of little use  </li>
            <li> I chose this one because it had a vacuum to suck up all of those little hairs</li>
            <li> The vacuum is leaving little trimmed hairs and it is not giving a close shave as the products from Norelco which are cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little vacuum cleaner compartment.  </li>
            <li> Previous reviewers have stated the same in regards to how the beard guard does not really work due to</li>
            <li> I use it probably every other day and it lasts for months on a single charge.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 months of use, the little plastic clip that holds the vacuum door closed snapped off.  </li>
            <li> But this thing was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> No difference except for a cheap plastic adjustable cutting guard.  </li>
            <li> , it worked great except the battery was horrible on it.</li>
            <li> The precision adjustable cutting feature is just that, precise.</li>
            <li> cutting is smooth.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I prefer this much over the alternative products that dump everything into your sink or next to it.</li>
            <li> The negative comments were frequent and it seemed some people had luck procuring the contour guide from Norelco and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this means something is wrong, if I actually just just that much power, or if the gauge is off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to shave a straight line, such as the sideburns.</li>
            <li> I had to report them to the BBB and write a negative review on their site to get them to honor their guarantee, then they censor the reviews of their products - completely unethical.</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking I was afraid to buy this trimmer after reading all the confusing reviews, but then I&#x27;ve decided to go for it and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As per Justin Yentile&#x27;s review, this didn&#x27;t come with the advertised contour-following comb, and as nearly everyone here has observed, the comb that it does come with sucks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not shaped like a slick Cone, but rather as a bulky, long, and massive rectangle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking I was afraid to buy this trimmer after reading all the confusing reviews, but then I&#x27;ve decided to go for it and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is as promised and expected.  </li>
            <li> ok....i spent a lot of time researching a beard trimmer and based on Amazon reviews chose this one.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, it just refuses to turn back on and shows that the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> I charged it fully before going on a trip, and when I got there the thing read empty.  </li>
            <li> When I tap the device to empty the hair from the vaccum chamber, the battery goes to empty as well.  </li>
            <li> It just kept getting harder and harder to use.</li>
            <li> The blades cannot handle the rough bristles.</li>
            <li> I have been put in a jam a couple of times because I was traveling with this and expected it to stay charged.</li>
            <li> it shut with electrical tape and that will be a nuisance to empty the trap.  </li>
            <li> I have bought 2 and both clips that hold the plastic door closed broke within a couple months of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the door opens to empty the vacuumed up hair though</li>
            <li> Now a year later we have tried to recharge it is completely dead.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to use tape to keep the door closed.</li>
            <li> I tend to shave against the grain (which maybe is part of my problem) and I tend to be rough about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a risk, but you always return it unused (just be careful opening the box).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work if you don&#x27;t keep it charged, it doesn&#x27;t work in corded mode as advertised, it just shows an &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; for empty battery when you try to turn it on while plugged in on an empty battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it go in a compartment that you can empty?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never dropped or mistreated this shaver but the plastic tab that holds the catcher door closed</li>
            <li> and It did the job as expected.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a closed comb go buy the qt4050.</li>
            <li> When you empty out the hair from the chamber</li>
            <li> I now hold the door closed with a hair elastic which works</li>
            <li> and then a week later the battery was dead again.  </li>
            <li> Some of the beard trimmings don&#x27;t always make it into the collection bin, and can bind up in the chute to it, just empty with a shake/tap</li>
            <li> The only thing missing was the edging blade.</li>
            <li> Within 3 months (about 12 uses), the catch of the clippings door broke and I needed to keep the door closed with tape.</li>
            <li> I can be forgetful</li>
            <li> Does everything I expected.</li>
            <li> no fast movements.  </li>
            <li> * Absolutely no pulling even when rushing</li>
            <li> If not, be careful.</li>
            <li> After a year, it will NOT function at capacity when unplugged, and further, the turbo button doesn&#x27;t work after a few minutes unplugged.</li>
            <li> I seem to be going over the same spots quite a few times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The latch for the hair collection also broke after a few months of occasional use  </li>
            <li> His facial hair use to be messy and all over.</li>
            <li> making it much harder to get an even trim.  </li>
            <li> The settings can also be read on the side of the adapter so not much chance of screwing things up.</li>
            <li> You have to stop and empty it, but yet there are still hairs all over my sink.</li>
            <li> The blades are located in such a way that it&#x27;s difficult to get my upper lip, near my nostrils.</li>
            <li> If I unplug it, the trimmer will only run a few seconds before turning off.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks of regular use the plastic latch broke and fell off.  </li>
            <li> I got everything I expected.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t even have to be careful to get everything.</li>
            <li> Weekly trimming only takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Now I have to hold it closed when I use it.  </li>
            <li> it does just what it is expected to do.</li>
            <li> you still get rough beard</li>
            <li> Inside it was jammed with beard trimmings.  </li>
            <li> I spent another 45 minutes with a rep</li>
            <li> It is a bit noisy, but should be expected from a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected .</li>
            <li> It took me an hour, as expected, to charge the trimmer fully</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Charge cable doesn&#x27;t stay in charge port, keeps slipping out.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> of these issues came up after the return window closed...</li>
            <li> I have a rubber band on mine now to keep it closed.  </li>
            <li> Time between need for recharge is longer than I had expected.</li>
            <li> And, not really material, but the packaging?</li>
            <li> Junk - broke only after a few months.</li>
            <li> Mine came with both of the comb attachments, so no issues there, and everything else works as expected.</li>
            <li> There are really no surprises with this device.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any regrets, though.</li>
            <li> However, when the trimmer arrived I had absolutely no issues with it.</li>
            <li> but you still need to be careful on the jawbone because it will still scalp the area.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as expected and advertised by manufacturer.</li>
            <li> If you are a careful person, the reviews here shouldn&#x27;t discourage</li>
            <li> I still  use it buy just holding the door on while shave and the empty it.</li>
            <li> A rubber band now holds the door closed.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected.</li>
            <li> I have a moderate to heavy goatee.  </li>
            <li> broke after minimal use</li>
            <li> The design problem with the latter is that its contour-following comb piece retains the blade; so, when the comb hinge cracked, the blade loosened and disabled the unit.</li>
            <li> I finally brought a heavy mug up from the kitchen and use it as a dock.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t, because by the time I picked it up again, the unit reports a completely empty battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did get another one from them and carefully examined how the trim guide was designed.</li>
            <li> From some of the reviews I had expected the hair it missed sucking in to fall downwards , but instead (like just about every trimmer)</li>
            <li> Now I have to hold it closed when I shave.  </li>
            <li> I just needed to be careful with the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> As expected in every way.</li>
            <li> The intake gets jammed and leaves lots of stubble in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The final product is patchy and uneven.  </li>
            <li> but since I was going for military look, it&#x27;s a bit easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For now the military look works for me</li>
            <li> This trimmer performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> If it gets wet, the trimming length displays the incorrect values.  </li>
            <li> Not cleaning the sink everyday is a big bonus.</li>
            <li> Adjustable over a wide range</li>
            <li> The trimmer adjustment is in &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34;clicks now a days for that rough look</li>
            <li> Not much of a discount coupon.</li>
            <li> It has wide trim blades.  </li>
            <li> I bought it last year and did quite a few trimming since then.</li>
            <li> The hair compartment lid broke in the second week of use and now it does now close firmly.</li>
            <li> It has a convenient slot to empty out the trimmed hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After 6 months, I ended up moving to a wired trimmer and haven&#x27;t looked back; in retrospect I find that I didn&#x27;t realize the power I was missing until I had it.</li>
            <li> how carefully I cleaned it.</li>
            <li> I have to keep it closed with my thumb while using the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the catch no longer holds it closed.  </li>
            <li> So, I had to put a rubber band around to keep it closed as per the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The comb head, while much safer, also seems to perform poorly.</li>
            <li> The door that collects the clippings broke after a couple weeks and doesn&#x27;t click closed anymore.</li>
            <li> There were a few mixed reviews on this model</li>
            <li> I am using a rubber band now to keep the hatch closed, as I frankly don&#x27;t have the time to go through the return process again.</li>
            <li> so be careful when opening and closing as well as when tapping the hair out.  </li>
            <li> But after a few weeks i have second thoughts of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I simply do not need turbo mode, though I admit I am not a person with thick or coarse hair growth.</li>
            <li> : It has been brought to my attention that there is a better beard comb being provided to some people that resolves the snagging problem mentioned above, I did not receive this and therefore have to base my review on what I received.</li>
            <li> I kept going, much more slowly but still found it difficult to get an even shave around my jaw</li>
            <li> Well nearly so anyway, it has a broken door, and the spring loaded comb has come apart several</li>
            <li> The size is easy to grip, not too small to feel awkward, and not to large to feel clumsy.</li>
            <li> Yes it is not a great mustache trimmer due to its bulk, Norelco makes one of those for less than $10, that is small, lightweight, and easy to trim the mustache with.  </li>
            <li> When you try to apply the blade directly to the edge you want to trim, the vacuum intake gets in the way, so you have to tilt the razor nearly to horizontal to get the cutting blade to your skin.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum at best caputres 80% of the clippings, and at worst approximately 50%.</li>
            <li> Only frustrating part I encountered actually was the vacuum itself.</li>
            <li> , is that the vacuum is a thick piece in front of the cutting blade and gets in the way of being able to do precision trimming around your nose and lips.  </li>
            <li> I used this trimmer for about a year and a half when the door that held the beard trimmings started to come open suddenly with very little pressure.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the vacuum feature, but it really works, even without using the boost feature.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint has been with the vacuum feature  </li>
            <li> The vacuum chamber, while being useful in gathering clippings, also gets in the way of precision cutting of your mustache.  </li>
            <li> The only  negative is the vacuum.</li>
            <li> And finally, The little plastic door you open to remove the hair from the trap had its clasp wear out after just a few months, so no it just flaps around loosely and spills hair everywhere unless you&#x27;re careful about holding it down.</li>
            <li> trap door on the hair collection compartment is a bit stiff to open but it is getting a bit easier to use over the last few days.</li>
            <li> the description has it going down to a .5mm setting but it actually only goes down to 1mm</li>
            <li> I also never felt that the few stray hairs that the vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up were an issue.</li>
            <li> The vacuum on this shaver sounded kinda gimmicky, like a Flobie for beards, but it has its uses.</li>
            <li> So, for touch ups and beards longer than a few millimeters the Norelco Vacuum works well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum didn&#x27;t work, like at all, and the trimmer gave me a completely uneven trim, RETURNED.</li>
            <li> Opening the vacuum box is a messy business with hair flying all around.</li>
            <li> However, after about 8 or 9 months, the vacuum feature started missing some.</li>
            <li> I returned this product after trying it for a week because the vacuum is kinda gimmicky.</li>
            <li> The vacuum does work, somewhat (you can expect a few pieces to fall off from the trimmer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was worried and disappointed when the battery quickly ran down during my first few uses.  </li>
            <li> (no big transformer hanging off the wall plug or a stiff cord)</li>
            <li> so it makes shaving right under the nose rather difficult.</li>
            <li> chose this because it says it can shave to half a millimeter, where the qt4050 can only go down to 1mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of hair escapes the vacuum and still creates a little mess in the sink, yet still less so than a standard electric timmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the turbo vacuum feature that actually does catch at least 90% of the clippings, I don&#x27;t think any other beard trimmer out there can touch this.</li>
            <li> When I trim the clippings are always less than a quarter inch, so long hairs do not explain why two thirds of the trimmed beard still ended up in the counter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again the trimmer itself works nicely but all other problems are really annoying, i would use my money somewhere else.</li>
            <li> This seems likeanother major design flaw, as it&#x27;s extremely difficult to hold the razor at the same angle, with the same pressure all over the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve choosen this model because of vacuum feature promising to collect cut hair instead of dropping them to sink.&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum is very poor.</li>
            <li> On the older T980, the guide comb completely covered the cutting head.</li>
            <li> Note that with the height display, make sure to always reset down to 1mm each time, it can get confused if it starts mid extension after sitting for a while unused and can display the wrong measurement.  </li>
            <li> you never used the older Philips T series from the late 90&#x27;s, you&#x27;d never know what you&#x27;re missing.</li>
            <li> blades stay sharp and haven&#x27;t clogged or jammed on me</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed that this trimmer did not include a second more narrow trimming head to allow for shaving and shaping areas.</li>
            <li> I find it significantly harder to maneuver this unit than other s</li>
            <li> hopefully ill last as long as my old norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum keeps down the mess.</li>
            <li> Two things that I did find disappointing is it does not come with a storage pouch or a narrow mustache trimmer head, luckily the narrow head from my old Norelco fits this one</li>
            <li> The Philips beard trimmer has a little vacuum that sucks the trimmings into a little internal bay which you just open and tip out into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a sizable gap in between them which could allow you to shave a bald spot into your facial hair if you were to say, press down a little while trimming to ensure even length.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature only catches 1/2 the hair, so I have a dirty sink plus a new bin to empty out.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what the strange guard is even for (pictured here:[...]), since it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very smoothly no matter</li>
            <li> That being said, it is not very useful on the moustache.</li>
            <li> It is a little louder than previous models than inhale used but that was expected with the vacuum.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this trimmer was to avoid the annoying mess of little hairs we all experience after a good beard trim.</li>
            <li> There are 18 secured length settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turbo power boost increases the cutting and fan speed, and it contains a powerful lithium-ion battery, giving it a long life.</li>
            <li> The problem is the primary thing it is designed to do, which is trim beard hair, it does a pretty miserable job of.  </li>
            <li> The flip-open vacuum compartment is not nearly as easy to use as the removable one on the 980, but other than that, ...</li>
            <li> I have a coarse beard that does not grow too thick but can grow long (think Fu Manchu).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am confused with some of the reviews that I have read though, particularly those who state that it does not come with the contour trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d traveled a bit with the older trimmer, so I figured that it must&#x27;ve reacted poorly to packing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The door that keeps in the waste was broken in the first couple of weeks, and the product became unusable thereafter.</li>
            <li> Last week, the little plastic lip on the door (that keeps the beard shavings) broke again!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a little different from the previous model(980 I think),</li>
            <li> What she doesn&#x27;t know is that this little blue and black gift from the Gods does it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Simply hold down the power button for a few seconds to lock and unlock this feature.    </li>
            <li> The compartment to catch the hair is not perfect, but it does get a lot in there making it less of a mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is that if you have thick facial hair still expect the mess from shaving.</li>
            <li> An ugly wide red band across the middle is the adjuster, it&#x27;s RED, not black like in the photo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the small plastic tab that keeps the vacuum chamber door closed broke off.</li>
            <li> Cleaning up the other 30% takes only a little bit less time than cleaning up 100%.    </li>
            <li> The comb attachment that was included has a giant gap in it that makes it very hard to achieve a uniform trim - you run the risk of the blades cutting much more than you were aiming for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cleaner than other trimmers, but it&#x27;s just impossible for a battery-operated, tiny vacuum system to catch all the hairs.</li>
            <li> The built-in vaccuum thing traps the bulk of stubble in the little chamber inside, vastly decreasing the sink-area mess.</li>
            <li> There is very little hair left in the sink/on the vanity at home.</li>
            <li> They fixed every complaint I had with the previous model.</li>
            <li> This does just about everything that i expected it to, and at a price that was less than expected.  </li>
            <li> The other three have all succumb to the issue with the trimmings door others have shared here.</li>
            <li> The price might force you to look the other way</li>
            <li> By any comparison, this product exceeds my expectations and makes other trimmers look like garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Average product, do the job but not with the expected precision, detail trim doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> The biggest problem with this trimmer is the fact that no matter how you hold the trimmer, as you would any other trimmer, it \\&quot;nips\\&quot; your skin every time.  </li>
            <li> Extremely ineffective.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; is extremely inneffective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this trimmer works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> My last three beard trimmers were Philips Norelco&#x27;s in generations past of this model.  </li>
            <li> While it works well in all other aspects, if the door does not close - you lose the benefit.  </li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as other Norelco products I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edge:&lt;br /&gt;The razors are shaped a bit differently than past E-razors.</li>
            <li> Find some other trimmer to do stubble.  </li>
            <li> Pros: does not hurt face or other body parts.</li>
            <li> Trimming blades are sharp and do not pull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a beard for past 40 years and have owned numerous beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> other than that..??  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even tried the other one yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;What sets this apart from the other beard trimmers I have owned is its accuracy.</li>
            <li> As other reviews state, the guide does not cover the cutter.</li>
            <li> other travelers may find themselves using a plastic bag to keep whiskers from floating around in their luggage.  </li>
            <li> As the other reviewer said, this machine stabs you.</li>
            <li> I also noticed it came with two guards for the trimmer once preinstalled and the other in the box.</li>
            <li> was the design flaw alluded to in the other reviews (the gap exposing the tines), and I will be calling up on Monday to get my Qt4050 comb.</li>
            <li> It shaves and trims your beard, other than that it is a piece of garbage</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, plastic components are sub-par (as indicated by some other reviewers).  </li>
            <li> and before you knew it, you were on &#x27;1&#x27; due to the ring turning in your hand.</li>
            <li> Extreme comfort when trimming</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers in the past.  </li>
            <li> The other comb is the one that can achieve the 1mm beard height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other reviews had mentioned the sharp points on the trimmer guard.</li>
            <li> The knock on this unit has been the supposedly sharp head.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> ba-bye, for not i&#x27;ll just have to make due with what i go.</li>
            <li> If you need one of those other tools, buy it separate.  </li>
            <li> The QT4070&#x27;s door no longer latches, I have read other reviews which also cite this as an issue.</li>
            <li> The forward facing &amp;#34;tines&amp;#34; are sharp as hell.</li>
            <li> If you use this product with the guard on, then you will have the \\&quot;gap\\&quot; issue/problem that other reviewers have talked about on this site.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve called Philips Norelco to ask for the comb mentioned in other reviews here.  </li>
            <li> Makes my beard look patchy compared to other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other trimmers and not had this problem</li>
            <li> See other edits below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit:  Today (3/14/12)</li>
            <li> Some of the downsides is that the unit is a little bulky to get all the area on my upper lip (mustache) and that the door for the captured hair opens a little too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other thing I find lacking with this trimmer is the ability to edge.</li>
            <li> The guy seems not at all paying attention and seems pretty in a lousy mood as if they were partying and fluttering at a club.  </li>
            <li> issue described in other posts, using either comb.  </li>
            <li> the setting for cut length does not jump out of position like some other trimmers</li>
            <li> and it makes the beard trimmer pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> extremely well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Picture 2 shows other side of unit with cutter head removed as reference.</li>
            <li> Picture 2 shows other side of unit with cutter head removed as reference.</li>
            <li> - I have other Philips products.</li>
            <li> There are two power settings on here but due to my thickness I just use the turbo all the time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The thing is SHARP however.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Turbo&#x27; mode sounds like a fighter jet, I cannot use it at night when other people in the house are asleep.</li>
            <li> A reviewer said tines were sharp and hurt, but I had no problem.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s multi purpose because you can use it to trim other parts of your body too.</li>
            <li> A few people have complained that the turbo button is useless; to these people I ask, what in life would not be made better with the addition of a turbo button?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say 6-7 hours...or, in other words, I can use the trimmer on my beard once a day for 6-7 days before I need to recharge it.</li>
            <li> I use their newer comb and have had no problems with it as other reviewers have had.  </li>
            <li> It is now past the 45 day money back guarantee, and after speaking to customer service again, I was told that they no longer make this part and cannot give me an estimate of when I can expect to receive it.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve opted for trimmers that used attachments for different lengths with one exception, and that&#x27;s where the bias against the notch trimmers comes from.</li>
            <li> the guard, the trimmer is pretty useless for getting a close balding shave of the head.  </li>
            <li> and its result is also not that sharp.</li>
            <li> I did not face the problems which other reviewers seem to be facing with the comb coming up with it.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure when Philips started shipping the second comb with the trimmer but as you can see by the picture I posted here, the unit I received had both</li>
            <li> On regular power, I find it no better than the Remington.</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind that this vacum is put into such small size</li>
            <li> Worst part is that I paid more than that for it a couple months ago, only to (likely) never use it again.</li>
            <li> These guys could probably bitch about having a wet dream!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After several failed attempts to use it for I wanted (short stubble and now a short beard)</li>
            <li> I bought this to hopefully avoid using scissors to trim the beard however even though it has longer settings them other trimmers it still doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers here, after 3-4 years my Norelco T980 quit holding a charge.</li>
            <li> The latch that keeps the trimmings compartment closed appears to be so delicate that after moderate use, it will no longer remain closed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Trimmer for past 4 months and never had to think twice about trying out different stubble looks.</li>
            <li> no biggie for me personally because I have a small travel trimmer and my razor that I can use for that.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband&#x27;s birthday, along with other stuff.  </li>
            <li> Other downside, where is the stand or travel case?  </li>
            <li> Agree with the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Some areas I find it helpful to approach from two directions, one after the other.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about all the other pieces which we always end up losing.</li>
            <li> The problem cited in other reviews has been resolved.  </li>
            <li> To other reviewers who have said that this product enables them to no longer use a razor, I cannot fathom, logistically, how that could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> No risk of trim height changing accidentally due to rotating ring selector.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> Lasts over 1 week with every other day usage.</li>
            <li> Unlike other beard trimmers, this one feels like a massage for your face.</li>
            <li> I ended up with random divots in my beard after the first use.</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind that this vacum is put into such small size</li>
            <li> /trim my sideburns and other area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this for keeping a short beard or stubble, not sure how it would work for longer beards (which is why it appears people prefer the flexible guard design of the 4050).</li>
            <li> This model replaces its predecessor from 2005 which eventually croaked - dead batteries and sluggish trimming (both attributed to long usage).  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how it works on hair other than facial hair</li>
            <li> There is no hair pulling like some other trimmers that I have used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not had problems with the guides sticking me as other reviewers have reported.</li>
            <li> to the other reviews where they say this scrapes and nicks your skin - it does.</li>
            <li> I can admit that at first I was skeptical about ordering this razor.</li>
            <li> Pushing in on a small  channel indentation on the back releases the comb accessories</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work too well under the nose due to the bulk.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of 20-40$ Wahl and even other Norelco trimmers and they don&#x27;t even come close to this.  </li>
            <li> shaving it gets around 70-80% of the hair like other people said, which is ok.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have charged this thing only a few times since I bought it well over a year ago!</li>
            <li> I have only charged it once in the past month</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bite the lip like some of the other whiners</li>
            <li> but then the others would get jealous and start fighting with each other.  </li>
            <li> I found this one,it was almost like my other one.</li>
            <li> is the most expensive one I&#x27;ve ever purchased; and it is by far the biggest disappointment.  </li>
            <li> As it is, there are quite a few long hairs that it misses.</li>
            <li> NO LUBRICATION/MAINTENANCE WAS THE OTHER SELLING POINT.</li>
            <li> Small recharging plug, not one of those big bricks that suck up two power plug spaces</li>
            <li> extremely dissappojnted</li>
            <li> however*, as other have stated, the latch on the unit to release the cut whiskers does break.</li>
            <li> other bug bear is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel case (unlike a Norelco shaver).</li>
            <li> I regularly apply a small amount of vegetable oil to blades as well, and the trimmer hasn&#x27;t bit me yet,</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a very long time with little need to charge.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to trim your beard on the same setting without it taking chunks of hair right of your face, resulting in the patchiest beard to ever set foot on planet earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum sucks up loose hair EXTREMELY well.  </li>
            <li> As for the stubble trimmer, you do have to be a little careful of the angle, but it&#x27;s not very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> From the reviews I was a little hesitant to put it too close to my face for fear of cuts (something about a missing guard?), but after using it for a while it&#x27;s been solid and hasn&#x27;t cut me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big and heavy but works well</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature means no more beard whiskers in the sink.</li>
            <li> The instruction book does explain if you want the vacuum to work you might have to go in two passes, so the shavings are small</li>
            <li> The little door on the front stopped closing reliably after a single drop.</li>
            <li> But even besides that, the trimmer often stops working with a single letter E on the little LCD screen.</li>
            <li> It kind of works - the vacuum is not impressive, and the cutting overall is acceptable but not very good.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is not strong enough (on a device this small) if you angle or turn it sideways, leaving you with a hairy mess to clean.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful when using it.  </li>
            <li> Two trimmers ago, I had to be very careful about what length it was on.  </li>
            <li> You have to be very careful ...  </li>
            <li> I tried desperately to find the T980, but it is no longer available anywhere, even on Ebay, so don&#x27;t waste your time looking for that, as other reviews suggested.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why these cause the ingrown hair other than they are not powerful enough to keep from pulling and tugging my hair when it cuts it.  </li>
            <li> For my money the base model the exact same design minus the vacuum and turbo speed.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing that I have found is it takes a few minutes to clean the collection chamber.</li>
            <li> I used my old Panasonic trimmer at it&#x27;s shortest setting and so far I&#x27;ve been afraid to go below 3 mm on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and have used it a few times on my head and use it to trim my beard several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As you cut it sucks in the cut whiskers, which you empty as necessary.  </li>
            <li> How could  you possibly be selling such a poor product?</li>
            <li> The blister pack inside the box was already cut open, the plastic guard is bent out of shape, and there are tiny springs and plastic parts broken off.</li>
            <li> Worse than this, I found the same areas of my face have to be gone over, and over before the clipper actually cuts the beard hair.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but after 4 units developed the same problem, I have to think this is not the trimmer for me.  </li>
            <li> Now, eight months later, the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp and the door to the &#x27;hair catcher compartment&#x27; is broken and opens up which messes up the vacuum aspect and gets hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> no longer stays latched on mine (after less than a year of use), but the way I hold it while using the trimmer keeps it closed anyway.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum function makes it so that very few hairs escape during the trimming as well</li>
            <li> Turn the vacuum off when cutting long beards down to size, because the chamber isn&#x27;t big enough for that sort of operation.</li>
            <li> is loud in turbo mode (which max vacuum from almost useless to kinda</li>
            <li> The closure for the hair collection chamber is poorly designed - a small plastic tab holds it closed and mine broke off after about a month of gentle use.</li>
            <li> This was a weak point on the old model.</li>
            <li> Second, I do see how you could cut yourself, as I almost did one day (got a pinch on the lip), but again I was in a rush and wasn&#x27;t paying attention and got my lip right in between the comb and the razor at a bad angle.  </li>
            <li> use the stiff comb, based on the reviews here that people were having trouble with the contour following comb.  </li>
            <li> Well, a few months later and now the second one is broken as well and the door will not stay closed.  </li>
            <li> i know aphaM also recommended this for trimming other areas of the body like down there..</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the product when I first got it due to</li>
            <li> The door is awkward to open, and subject to breaking if you apply too much force.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature catches maybe half of the clippings, the rest need to be cleaned up the usual way.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not perfect, it certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> it go in a little baggy that you can empty?</li>
            <li> little wide</li>
            <li> The little door that holds the vacuumed hair no longer stays closed.</li>
            <li> The door for the debris compartment is a little flimsy, so be careful not to break it.  </li>
            <li> So, you may want to be a little careful around your lips if you don&#x27;t have a comb on it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a little harder to do precision trimming because of the thickness of the end.</li>
            <li> The door that collects the beard shavings is kept closed by a little plastic lip.</li>
            <li> the cutting is fine, it gets to small place.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> Vacuum only sucks in half the trimmings, so that feature is pointless.</li>
            <li> I have very thick whiskers and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Then I tested the 2mm setting and felt a slight scratching of the blade against my skin, but nothing extreme</li>
            <li> other reviewers, I previously owned a Norelco T980 and needed to move \\&quot;up\\&quot; when it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I typically use the trimmer set at 12 mm (so my beard is a bit longer than those in other reviews).</li>
            <li> but it is significantly less than the all the other trimmers that don&#x27;t have this</li>
            <li> As I keep short stubble, it&#x27;s particularly hard.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item in local stores.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I dont like is when you take the guard off it is hard to get the razor close to your face.  </li>
            <li> The brush that it comes with is also very tiny and hard to grip.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get the upper lip area</li>
            <li> Short of affixing a shop vac to your trimmers you will be hard pressed to find a pair that captures every shaved hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Captured a lot of the hair so very little sink cleanup&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little nib that keeps it closed worn down that quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> there is usually only a few hair clippings laying on the counter that i just brush into the trashcan,  so very little mess&lt;</li>
            <li> A clean, even shave is impossible to obtain.  </li>
            <li> Turbo setting seemed stupid and more of gimmick than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am mystified at the many 5 star review this item has received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QT4070 Beard Trimmer has an incredibly stupid design.</li>
            <li> I have owned at least 4 different types, including another Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Definitely be cautious when reading the negative reviews about the trim guide on this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I see elsewhere in here that others note the same complaint.    </li>
            <li> Mine shipped with two guards, neither of which could possibly be the basis for the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Second - When you pay $50 for a trimmer, you should expect at least a flimsy travel bag.</li>
            <li> 2mm seems too small, while 3mm seems too long.  </li>
            <li> The one without the contour following feature has comb prongs that will jab you, and an enormous gap over the cutting blades that will inevitably cause bloodshed.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done i usually have a few hairs left in the sink</li>
            <li> As of  at least Feb 2012, they now ship the unit with the standard comb and a contour comb.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve used it an average of three times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several trimmers over the past few years.</li>
            <li> It does save some time cleaning up cut hair, but to me, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have with this product is that when you take the trim guard off, I wish the blade would get closer to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought it, its definitely not worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-1 star for the average battery life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, not worth the $$ being asked for it, defiantly NOT up to the hype of all the &amp;#34;be all to end all&amp;#34</li>
            <li> After using i realized its  not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> The vaccum is not worth.</li>
            <li> usually keep my beard long</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 weeks back and am not thrilled by its performance.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months now, and not one complaint.  </li>
            <li> require products to last at least 1 year, with an expectation of two years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a negative, he says that because he wears a guard on it, it rubs his face and bunches the facial hair up.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;taper&amp;#34; my beard, so the distance-from-the-face adjustment is not useful to me.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> yeah, the LED charging status and blade level indicator will eventually time out and go dark while the unit remains plugged in, so</li>
            <li> RAZOR.yeah, the LED charging status and blade level indicator will eventually time out and go dark while the unit remains plugged in, so</li>
            <li> *Only sucks up about 50% of the cut hair&lt;</li>
            <li> No idea what happened to it and probably not worth fixing.</li>
            <li> not worth the $50.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not flawless but it makes clean-up much quicker when I trim the beard.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to keep a charge between uses.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the hair trap.</li>
            <li> They are so over priced it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I had was that when I tried it corded the cord dropped out.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t returned because frankly it&#x27;s not worth the hassle for me.</li>
            <li> An even bigger complaint for me,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews on other trimmers and made the decision to buy this trimmer a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> The old one i had was just tired and needed replacing.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t broken the clip.</li>
            <li> Time to grow extremely thick and long!&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ve had to start clippering them regularly.</li>
            <li> , I feel like I need to replace every few years as no real way to sharpen blades.  </li>
            <li> These are OK but for a $30 delta I would recommend the base model.</li>
            <li> The vacuum system makes it hard to use the blades as an edger around your beard and/or sideburns.</li>
            <li> Yes - that big gap that you see on the picture means that the cutting blades can dig into your painstakingly grown beard in a flash, and you are left with the choice to trim it down (meaning a big change in your appearance) or hope nobody notices.    </li>
            <li> It may be possible to replace the battery, but if so, it&#x27;s not going to be simple and certainly not for the faint of skill.</li>
            <li> However it still loses enough that you have to wipe the sink down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very precise</li>
            <li> Yeah, the vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch 100% of the hairs, but at least it&#x27;s like 90% or so.</li>
            <li> to the fact that the vacuum sucks INTO that compartment, it makes it a chore now to keep all the hair particles from showering all over you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Oh, and the new design on the door on the 4070 is lousy too, it quit staying closed the 1st month I owned it, had to put a rubber band on it to keep it closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the SAME design complaint I had on my previous one from 8 years ago.</li>
            <li> The trimmer goes down to basically a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> down sides:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Hands down, I would have paid $90 for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Might want to cut down on grandpa&#x27;s cough syrup til after shave time cheif.</li>
            <li> Gives you a sort of 5&#x27; o clock shadow I guess but it wont be shaving it down to your skin</li>
            <li> i can just wipe down the drain with my hand and then run some water.  </li>
            <li> So unless the spacer guide is non-removable on the QT4050, it should also go down to \\&quot;1/64\\&quot; of an inch.</li>
            <li> knocks down the beard</li>
            <li> It will shave down to a stubble of a quarter inch or so but you can make adjustments to longer lengths.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reducing it from 3 stars down to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I have down rated it because of the battery problem.  </li>
            <li> and I still find myself having to wipe down the sink after -</li>
            <li> Had the model down from this until I dropped it on its head and broke the adjustment.</li>
            <li> clutter down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> the head) which there is no comparison for the ability to mow down the chops in no time.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try for those times I wanted to cut down the goatee, too.</li>
            <li> Why step down to the model without the turbo boost was my rationale.  </li>
            <li> For that, I go all the way down to 1 mm.</li>
            <li> I set it down, and then thought I should test the unlock function.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs down.</li>
            <li> , I have to continually tap the clippings down into the compartment, and clippings still get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> but after once use i looked down at the sink and there was maybe three or four that didn&#x27;t get pulled into the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Now updated down to three star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However there is one little thing that is neglected to be mentioned in the advertising that I was not aware of.</li>
            <li> I was a little freaked out about other people saying this thing cuts your lip and what not.  </li>
            <li> All In One Trimmer]] I have charged it only once since purchasing it, i.e. in the past 12 months!</li>
            <li> , I still have to dust a little but not nearly as much!</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well!  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works quite well, leaving very little in the sink or on my chest as have other trimmers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised but the power cord is stiff wire, not very flexible.</li>
            <li> Before buying this trimmer, I was skeptical about the functionality of the vacuum especially after I read the reviews by other users.</li>
            <li> The stock grey head attachment that came in the original packaging is worthless.</li>
            <li> So my t980 is starting to get a little dull after I have replaced the blade once, so I figured I would upgrade to the newer, \\&quot;better\\&quot; model.</li>
            <li> The vacuum sucks in all the cut hairs so it doesn&#x27;t make a mess all over the sink.</li>
            <li> Whenever I&#x27;m in a rush and looking scruffy, I can pick this up and trim it all down to an acceptable level in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> TRIMMED MY HALF INCH BEARD DOWN TO 1/8TH INCH -</li>
            <li> As for cutting quality, I find that I need to go over the same area several times to avoid leaving stray long hairs and the cut is not the cleanest.</li>
            <li> My beard looks uneven and unkept compared to other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The cut is not smooth giving the sensation that the blade is not as sharp as it should be.</li>
            <li> If you try to use this to trim your pubic region, you will probably cut yourself if you don&#x27;t use the guard because the blades are VERY sharp.</li>
            <li> After reading other review complaining about the gap in the comb and uneven shaving</li>
            <li> The cut is really good, and the contour attachment makes cutting under my chin a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed in the vacuum capabilities of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> As you may know, there is a vacuum that sucks up the hair and while it does not get every little hair, it does get the majority of it.</li>
            <li> also difficult to get into nooks and crannies of a face such as between upper lip and note.</li>
            <li> Product was received in less than 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I typically go through a trimmer every year.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bring the cord and ran out of juice half way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the previous model which I would rate 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problem with the adjustable spacer as previous posts have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> The cutting head is much too wide for my average-sized face.    </li>
            <li> Seriously why is everyone complaining that the product doesn&#x27;t come with the contour following comb...</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but since it doesn&#x27;t suck up all of the hair, I feel it could be slightly improved.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s 50% less</li>
            <li> Finally the second rechargable battery failed and even plugging it would not revive it.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not a streamlined as some previous models</li>
            <li> I had owned 2 of the previous version of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> comb attachments protect from the accidental nicks and cuts mentioned by previous reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;-Digital</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had the previous trimmer</li>
            <li> /&gt;And almost half a price than here (Portugal)</li>
            <li> Please ignore previous reviews that explain that you can buy the comb from the 4050 for this product.</li>
            <li> And this rather expensive option has turned out to be the most flawed of the dozen I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have previously been using a Norelco T870</li>
            <li> I previously had the T870 or T970</li>
            <li> item came with half charge so could try immediately.     </li>
            <li> Had previously used it once at a friends house</li>
            <li> I previously had the precursor to this product (T980)</li>
            <li> regards to the previous model:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my previous Philips Norelco trimmer (they don&#x27;t make my previous model anymore).</li>
            <li> This will pay for itself in less than six months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had previous models of this unit and ran them into the ground.  </li>
            <li> We were looking to replace my husband&#x27;s previous trimmer that had quite working and found this one.</li>
            <li> This unit came with two combs, neither of which exhibited the problems described in previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned a Norelco T870 for over 5 years but needed to change when it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So is there less hairs in the sink?</li>
            <li> This trimmer missed half the hairs on my face and it couldn&#x27;t reach the hairs under my nose.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have issues with odd angles.</li>
            <li> Second, by a flaw in the design, far too much hair gets sucked into the removable trimmer head casing causing the trimmer to slow and, therefore, stop cutting hair or cut it poorly, causing split hairs.   </li>
            <li> The QT4070 is slimmer than the T980 and takes less space in the drawer.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after less than a year.  </li>
            <li> I now have an awkward routine of using this trimmer to cut 95% of my beard (it misses a lot even after multiple passes) and then finish it with my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would not even cut my beard except on the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; setting, instructions say this cuts the battery life in half.  </li>
            <li> Previous models had this compartment removable without the need for doors.&lt;br /&gt;For $50 might have included a stand.</li>
            <li> I think it was from a previous revision.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim as evenly as my previous Panasonic trimmer.  </li>
            <li> UPDATE: APRIL 2015, less than a year after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The plastic feels a bit flimsier than my previous Norelco trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement item for a Panasonic ER-GS60-S trimmer that died after less than a year of use.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve with the look you want and the corresponding number.</li>
            <li> I charge it once per month or less.</li>
            <li> The vac feature is not improved over the previous model.  </li>
            <li> I had to crack it in half and cut the power wire for it to stop.</li>
            <li> Battery life, dies every 4 minutes or less when you use the vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The one that we received was black.  </li>
            <li> It is just a cheap poor design destined to fail.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought they must be wrong, after all this is the coolest looking, and most expensive, beard trimmer on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the previous less than \\&quot;Glowing\\&quot; reviews on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> less hairs in the sink when used in the \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; mode).</li>
            <li> /&gt;2)there is no storage bag which had been provided with my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> adjustable guards do not move after setting, a problem I had with previous trimmers.  </li>
            <li> The 980 had a nickel cadmium battery, which cordless appliance owners know is subject to battery memory problems that decrease charge capacity over time.</li>
            <li> Charging is done in less than a hour, and it has a travel loc which prevents it from turning on during transit.  </li>
            <li> My only negative experience was that the catch for the plastic door broke off  a few weeks ago and now I must use a rubber band to keep it shut.  </li>
            <li> I even paid less for the newer model.</li>
            <li> The previous Braun this replaced gave an even trim so this is unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> Includes both trimmer heads which previous customers said isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was slightly less bulky.</li>
            <li> Black and gray would would have been plenty of coloring and made for a classier looking unit -to</li>
            <li> Much less cleanup.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer might work for less hirsute customers.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer I would take the guard off and use it do do the bottom edges of my beard and mustache area around my lips.</li>
            <li> I do have their previous VACCUM model and have to replace because it is not holding charge.</li>
            <li> I have less residual on the sink.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed in the one specific way that it has to be held in order for it to cut and trim my beard!</li>
            <li> They make replacement trimmer blades as well if it seems to trim less efficiently.  </li>
            <li> so there was less of a chance your skin would get nicked.</li>
            <li> i had the slightly newer model delivered to me.</li>
            <li> Began to make an odd humming noise while charging, and stopped functioning after 31 days.</li>
            <li> It is noisier than any of my previous Norelco trimmers too.  </li>
            <li> I want slightly longer stuble</li>
            <li> do like that this model is apparently less prone to turning on unintentionally in travel</li>
            <li> My beard is slightly longer than Wolf Blitzer on CNN.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer was a Wahl Lithium battery unit, which I was quite fond of</li>
            <li> My biggest downside with my previous trimmer was that I had over a dozen attachments to keep track of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer also lacks power compared to my previous one.</li>
            <li> I SET IT TO -IN LESS THAN 3 MINUTES.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Better power than my previous Philips Norelco and battery life is as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is still &amp;#34;spillage&amp;#34; of hair in the sink but much less than using scissors.</li>
            <li> , there will always be one patch in a random area that I need to go over a couple extra times to get the same length as the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I would then have to buy another trimmer, after losing money on a trimmer with less functionality.</li>
            <li> (no dropping shutter on the trimmer), and cleaning it out is less convenient</li>
            <li> and this is solely gauging from my previous PN product and based on this</li>
            <li> The door broke after less than 2-months... hair all over the place.</li>
            <li> The ergonomics of the comb and the hand holding result in a relatively uncomfortable feeling that ends with unequal beard lengths particularly the lower parts.</li>
            <li> I keep my stache and goat a little shorter that the average bearded dude so maybe that&#x27;s the issue...</li>
            <li> Several years ago, it would be impossible to get a charging (with high charge), adjusting height, affordable beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum that sucks up the cut hair may be a bit gimmicky, but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is useless and it&#x27;s the only reason i bought this one.</li>
            <li> Also, recently, the plastic door over the vacuum compartment has failed.  </li>
            <li> Despite being rechargeable, the trimmer is very powerful, easily cutting through thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for hardly 5 times, now its completely not turned off.</li>
            <li> , the trimmings are captured in a reservoir, so there is much less mess.</li>
            <li> This little compartment keeps the clippings from dropping down my neck.</li>
            <li> it charges quickly and lasts a long time, and it trims the crap out of my beard.</li>
            <li> I screwed up cutting my beard the first time with this.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to stop to empty the trimmer</li>
            <li> on the \\&quot;without leaving a mess in the sink\\&quot; line.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not actually true for what&#x27;s \\&quot;in</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Mess free\\&quot; ?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, it does collect 30 to 50% of my hairs inside it, but I still have a mess in my sink.</li>
            <li> It collects all the shavings so your not getting a mess on the floor or sink.  </li>
            <li> I found this out by cutting my lip twice in the first minute of use.</li>
            <li> &gt; - KEEPS THE MESS</li>
            <li> The cutting width is too wide for trimming the length above my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the reviews before buying, so I knew what I was getting.  </li>
            <li> &gt;  still leaves a mess</li>
            <li> &gt;  still leaves a mess</li>
            <li> but is still makes a little-bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> it got rid of all the mess when I am trimming my beard</li>
            <li> (def not good enough for the office).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make a mess</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get his mess of hair all over the sink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It still makes a mess but</li>
            <li> I chose this model because the one thing that always bothered me was the mess of stubble that would collect in and around my sink when shaving/trimming.</li>
            <li> but you have to pay attention to a couple things in order to not accidentally mess up your glorious man beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (yes, I tried it without the garbage can under my chin and made a mess).</li>
            <li> minor complaint:  </li>
            <li> Both the hinge and the small tab which keeps the door closed seem about to break at any moment.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t make a mess all over the sink when I trim.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it with the Plastic Comb Guard that comes with it since I read some reviews of people cutting their lip or whatever; since it&#x27;s my first time using an electric trimmer</li>
            <li> vacuums up the mess as you trim.  </li>
            <li> But take the guard off and try to use the trimmer directly for defining sharp lines and this thing is utterly useless.</li>
            <li> I was slightly wary of some of the other reviews that suggested the trimming action needed some time to get used to, however I put that concern aside and bought the QT4070.  </li>
            <li> A fix for this was to simply go slow when long hairs were concerned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasted about a year and a half, but the little &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; that keeps the &amp;#34;trimmings door&amp;#34; won&#x27;t stay shut on</li>
            <li> It looked quite well and worked as it was expected, but after a few uses I started noticing that the hair compartment lid wasn&#x27;t closing very tight.</li>
            <li> and by just mentioning the model number and the missing attachment, the representative immediately recognized the problem and took down my information to mail me the contour</li>
            <li> I say its official - this trimmer is a piece of crap that fails to fulfill its advertised promises of a measured length trim, maybe catching 50% of the cut beard, and apparently the trimmer is done when the battery is dead since the company provides no easy method of battery</li>
            <li> I just took 1/2\\&quot; of beard down to stubble and somehow managed to do it without crying.  </li>
            <li> Seriously there&#x27;s nothing worse than your razor dying when you&#x27;re getting ready for work</li>
            <li> /&gt;-no way to do tight spots like ear-head joint, use a $15 trimmer there&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t close tightly.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a plastic door with a small hinge, be a little careful</li>
            <li> It trims my beard in a snap with little mess, though don&#x27;t be fooled by claims that it catches everything.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I discovered this new version couldn´t keep up with its ancestor at all.</li>
            <li> Trimming the sideburns with the noise right in your ear is rather unpleasant</li>
            <li> Newer models of this beard trimmer DO include the adjustable guide so you won&#x27;t be stabbing yourself as others have complained (note those reviews are always of older versions prior to 2014).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am unable to comment at this time on how long the battery will last.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding clippers that will do less than 1mm.</li>
            <li> The stationary part of the trimming blade, which sits between your skin and the cutting blade, is nearly a full 1 mm thick.  </li>
            <li> I like the adjustable head, plus much less messy with the suction.</li>
            <li> Like all other reviews say, it&#x27;s missing the Contour Comb top which makes it extremely difficult to get an EVEN shave without stabbing yourself.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that due to the vacuum feature, when there is no guard, for example when your are trimming up the edges of your beard, it is difficult to see.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, all in all, I would say get this product if you are looking for something that will leave you a little stubble and you are not wanting to do a detail trim.  </li>
            <li> Hair collects in a little compartment with a swing door.  </li>
            <li> But, a little tape in the corner helps.    </li>
            <li> My wife no longer yells at me about leaving little whisker stubs everywhere around the sink after trimming my goatee.</li>
            <li> Somehow the little tab holding the trimming popped off, but</li>
            <li> But probably because of how little the shaver cuts off..</li>
            <li> It has a little bump of plastic that holds it close</li>
            <li> Picture the compartment where all the hair and dust goes and forms that little puffy mass.</li>
            <li> You then have to slide up the little razors themselves to find hairs wedged in a not so neat compartment that was not meant to house little hairs.</li>
            <li> Also, you need two hands to change setting as its not exactly accessible with your thumb  </li>
            <li> A little door opens from the trimmer and you have to shake to get the hair to fall out or get the cleaning brush that came with it.</li>
            <li> They no longer include a carrying case and the little mustache trimmer isn&#x27;t included any longer</li>
            <li> but... Doesn&#x27;t come with any stands or holders to put it and accessories into, so it has to just lie flat looking not nearly as good as it could&#x27;ve.</li>
            <li> It also requires a little lighter touch over the skin than I am used to.  </li>
            <li> The little plastic clips that hold the springs in place are no longer functional.</li>
            <li> If you like the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look and also want to go a little longer on your mustache and chin</li>
            <li> A little unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> My model came with two trimming heads, 1 stationary and 1 pivoting, and I would have given it 5-stars if the stationary head slipped on a little easier.</li>
            <li> All the other beard trimmers that we bought in the past had a problem with the attachments breaking.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product a little over six months ago</li>
            <li> I agree that it is a little sharper, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be a problem.</li>
            <li> we are even considering using this device on our little dog.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer, but as had happened to others, the plastic tabs that hold the little door shut for the beard trimmings broke, so the door doesn&#x27;t stay shut.  </li>
            <li> (turbo option reduce their amount a little bit).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;shavers\\&quot; to groom in the past</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s settings are adjustable and there is little chance they&#x27;ll be accidentally changed by routine handling.  </li>
            <li> It may be a little premature of me to give this review now</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little chamber broke.  </li>
            <li> I keep a stubble beard and this keeps it close while also sucking up a lot of those little hairs.  </li>
            <li> Within about a month the little door that holds your beard trimmings broke.</li>
            <li> The little plastic piece that locks the hair collection compartment broke.</li>
            <li> , I like to see exactly where I am cutting, exactly where the blades are on my face and its very difficult  because the suction thingy is in the way.  </li>
            <li> This little jewell can trim your beard and cut the hair on your head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> it flings the little hairs everywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a little over three years ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all the little bits</li>
            <li> a little i could handle, but 50%</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s due to my bristle beard type or what,</li>
            <li> My wife is always getting on to me when I shave and leave little hairs everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Still, every little bit helps.</li>
            <li> It works a little, but after shaving my sink is literally covered in hair.</li>
            <li> A little plastic nub disappeared and now it requires a rubber band around it</li>
            <li> so I have little to compare to.</li>
            <li> comb is a little rought, i remembered people complaining that they cut their lip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve charged it maybe 3 times in a little over 2 months.</li>
            <li> so it is a little awkward/unusable trying to get a close/accurate trim from that direction.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get right under your nose.</li>
            <li> , this will be a change, but I don&#x27;t think it will be as drastic as some reviewers have painted it, as long as you have the right guard, because the alternate guard is horrible.</li>
            <li> Weak vacuum.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is so weak it might as well not be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp blades make it unnecessary to cut again and again to catch long hairs</li>
            <li> I almost did not buy this due to some of the reviews that complained about the stubble comb, but I just happened to wade down to the newest reviews and notice people</li>
            <li> The part that holds/captures the shaved hair broke after a few weeks, so now it&#x27;s a pain to hold while I&#x27;m shaving, and little shavings get all over the place.</li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t have to work very hard.</li>
            <li> And the vacuum does protrude making it very hard to make trim lines..  </li>
            <li> That small door was the part that failed on my older unit.</li>
            <li> It will go down to 1 mm!  </li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m stepping down from a monster clipper that was like a corded roto-tiller, so I&#x27;m paying for convenience of cordless--and the battery lasts forever!  </li>
            <li> Some say that you are left with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, but I have a very thick beard.</li>
            <li> It will trim tiny beards as well as very thick ones.  </li>
            <li> I myself have very thick and course hair (beard only).</li>
            <li> Never let your electronics go completely dead, electronics with cheaper batteries or with battery monitors (like this one) need a little power to charge, if it&#x27;s dead</li>
            <li> Therefore, you MUST remember to be careful and NOT push too hard as you shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Others have been unhappy with the design of the new guide, saying it is too sharp.</li>
            <li> as mentioned earlier, I&#x27;m still a big fan of Norelco, but this one was just a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> No more breakouts from shaving, a lot less mess.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean and impossible to adjust.</li>
            <li> Only negative is its bulky and this makes it cumbersome to trim hard to reach places like my mustache.</li>
            <li> The only thing holding back the fifth star on this review is due to the bulky size of the head makes it nearly impossible to trim mustache under nose.</li>
            <li> The plastic guides are so flimsy, that with very little pressure, they collapse down, or spread from one another, allowing hair to get much closer to the cutting blades than intended.  </li>
            <li> Its actually amazing how awful the product is</li>
            <li> A common complaint regarding the swinging door hair trap wasn&#x27;t a big problem for me.  </li>
            <li> Really like the ability to adjust the cutting length - price through Amazon</li>
            <li> About two weeks ago after fully charging the trimmer, it only last about halfway through trimming before displaying an \\&quot;E\\&quot; symbol and cutting off repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the clear compartment that snaps shut to hold trimmings latches with a flimsy, brittle plastic tab that broke off on mine 1 year ago.  </li>
            <li> Same cutting assembly (interchangeable with the 4050), and same contour comb (interchangeable with the 4050).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s digital gauge started showing the wrong reading after the trimmer got wet.</li>
            <li> Also, when I remove the trimmer shield for a close cut around the ears, the cutting edge does not extend all the way to the very end</li>
            <li> Further  it seems a bit awkward to take them off and reset them properly on the depth scale mechanism.</li>
            <li> remove one of the combs after using it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time/money  </li>
            <li> I will have to edit my review after a few months to see how the charge stands up.</li>
            <li> Trouble is I gave one to our son also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the manual, you can use the trimmer when plugged in, even if the battery is dead, so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge if you&#x27;ve drained the battery</li>
            <li> It pulled and hurt quite a bit and produced uneven results even though the razor settings were adjustable.</li>
            <li> There were always a few stragglers and the cut whiskers were everywhere when you finished.</li>
            <li> All the functions have still been working after a few months, so I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s collecting just few hairs.</li>
            <li> I found the battery would not hold its charge and went dead after 3 days of storage.  </li>
            <li> The plastic door that holds the hair trimmings broke after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> That said,  I have not experienced any issues listed in earlier reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dead within a year.</li>
            <li> Have to restart it again a few times before it works again.</li>
            <li> People need to stop crying if they don&#x27;t recieve the flexible contour head...</li>
            <li> If you cant wait a few days to get this attachment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mind for a few years now and still ever six months</li>
            <li> I use this one, but basically it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Plastic door broke after few months of use</li>
            <li> Split hairs, an uneven trim, eventually stops working.</li>
            <li> and this review is written after using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Some of the reviews here are too harsh.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts for a few weeks of trimming every two days.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> The trimming is uneven as well.</li>
            <li> The vacuumed hair door latch is a tiny plastic tab that has already broken off.  </li>
            <li> I later chatted with support about the broken tab on the vacuumed hair door and they are sending me a replacement trimmer since the door is not customer</li>
            <li> I used to shave everyday before I got it.</li>
            <li> and you end up with a dead battery.</li>
            <li> It either gouges or trims uneven when changing angles.</li>
            <li> I planned to call the day I received the item to have them send me the missing</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve had this trimmer a few years now.</li>
            <li> I got a replacement but that, too, broke within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give an update in a few months.</li>
            <li> I have had it a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Neither comb head seemed to matter, and the one flexible head was useless as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> Its a waste of time and looks funny.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> quite a few trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say around 70% get trapped and</li>
            <li> Went to use it today, dead battery.</li>
            <li> flap broke a few months in.</li>
            <li> Terrible for trimming a beard - all or nothing, doesn&#x27;t really do anything different between the different settings.  </li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s broken and only work when it&#x27;s plugged in to the outlet.</li>
            <li> The impact of this effect is compounded when the trimmer is on uneven surfaces, like a shin.      </li>
            <li> It takes a few passes on my beard to get it even</li>
            <li> I wasted my money, don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> I have a HEAVY beard - I needed a trimmer that \\&quot;gets it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> If they provided the narrow trimmer attachment, I would have given this a five star rating.</li>
            <li> Scalps patches of hair uneven when using it below 5mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer battery is dead and I can&#x27;t find a replacement battery here on Amazon nor does it appear that replacement was a design consideration to start with.</li>
            <li> trimming around uneven surfaces like around the mouth, the guard was insufficient to protect your skin.</li>
            <li> It nipped the edge of my lips a few times..</li>
            <li> -The display frequently gets \\&quot;confused\\&quot; making it useless; you must rely on the length index on the side.  </li>
            <li> Even though I just bought this a few weeks ago...</li>
            <li> but then it fills up after a few uses.</li>
            <li> my bear grows unevenly and some strays get longer than others</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only downside is door to compartment for trimmings appears poorly designed and breakable,  will be extra</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> The few hairs it does catch fill up the receptacle immediately.</li>
            <li> Dead after 10 months of using it about twice a week.</li>
            <li> I picked this model for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> I received the trimmer, however with only the one blade that is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gimmick that just wastes battery charge time.</li>
            <li> I have wasted 50$ on it.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a few months now. .</li>
            <li> and I immediately put it to work on my harsh beard.</li>
            <li> When I got home, I went to shave and the unit said the battery was dead.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money</li>
            <li> so it is difficult to use for this as I did with my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have a messy beard</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that will leave you with that messy 3 o&#x27;clock look, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> There is a firm side and a lessfirm</li>
            <li> while I know how messy they can be, I haven&#x27;t experience it.</li>
            <li> Even the trouble areas of my face where my hair seems to grow in all directions wasn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> A waste of my time and energy.</li>
            <li> My beard is heavy - though not as heavy as some</li>
            <li> Philips G370, which would leave uneven patches if I used it on the shortest setting.</li>
            <li> The one function i thought wouldn&#x27;t work at all and was a sham</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complain that it was missing in theirs.</li>
            <li> So, after some trouble with customer service (they wanted to send me the QT4050 as a replacement - why would I want a cheaper unit?)</li>
            <li> When I broke it out to use it there it was dead...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> This _extremely_ poor comb design caused me to stab my lip several times and also resulted in uneven trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not perfect and the compartment gets dirty real quick.</li>
            <li> whatever trim level you&#x27;re trying to achieve is never accurate.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get down as close as I had thought it would, and you have to press down really hard to get it to trim out lines when trimming to stubble, not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> Missing the other three for disastroopus design, awful vacuum feature that doesn&#x27;t work worth anything, no case, non detachable hair reservoir, and leaving a mess everywhere.     </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that, as others have noted, the vacuum component is relatively mediocre.</li>
            <li> If your a guy that likes to manage your beard and you hate having to clean up the mess afterwards then this is then beard trimmer for you.</li>
            <li> vacuum performs much worse than T980 -</li>
            <li> This shaver is completely useless at this point and shoots little hairs everywhere due to the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for a number of reasons: the construction appears shoddy, it is bulkier than advertised, and the quality control appears to be less than average.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim thick stuble down to slight stuble.</li>
            <li> but it is significantly less than usual.  </li>
            <li> Also the comb is past the guard which can make you shave closer than desired if you slightly tilt it.  </li>
            <li> There is no fine trimming feature.</li>
            <li> Due to the shape of the head when you remove the guide hard to trim around your lip area.</li>
            <li> In addition, they both have become dull rather abruptly.</li>
            <li> It works well without any tugging and very little mess.</li>
            <li> ba-bye, for not i&#x27;ll just have to make due with what i go.h max vacuum from almost useless to kinda</li>
            <li> Guys looking for a real stubble trimmer might consider the Man Groomer Scruff Sculptor, which trims down to a third of a millimeter, but which also suffers from some unfortunate functional and ergonomic deficiencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with the hair container door -- other customers complained about it being flimsy</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product due to some negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Mine came with two attachments, one you might recognize as the one customers complained about rather frequently in other reviews, and one that some people had to order.</li>
            <li> It sucks up maybe 1/2 to 2/3 of the trimmings, the rest falling in to the sink like any other trimmer.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is due to my thick beard growth</li>
            <li> I have not had any issue with the stiff comb</li>
            <li> Plain Deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> just plain gets the job done.</li>
            <li> - the rest was very plainly all over my dark shirt.</li>
            <li> If you own the T980, you will HATE, I repeat, HATE this new model.</li>
            <li> hate to clean up the sink after the trimming</li>
            <li> The settings are spot on My only Con is that the latch on the small clipping catch compartment somehow broke or was shipped broken, so I have to be mindful to keep a finger on it.</li>
            <li> Oh, well - at least it&#x27;s a Lithium Ion battery now, so at least issue #3 has been addressed at long last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No easy battery replacement and none that I could find.  </li>
            <li> plastic guard flexes too easily so no matter what height you have it set to</li>
            <li> This one is just two bulky and is not easy to use imo.</li>
            <li> return process on this product is not easy.</li>
            <li> Clean up is the reason that I hate trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s a flimsy cover for the poorly designed too small collection chamber...not the proper filter suction.</li>
            <li> There is no separate mustache guard which makes it very difficult to use on the mustache area as it is far too wide.  </li>
            <li> I tried a variety of heights and got an even cut all the way down, no pinching or stabbing occurred, even when I completely removed the comb guide.  </li>
            <li> This is not true!</li>
            <li> , I cannot imagine the mess without it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Narelco for my boyfriend for Christmas because he loves to make a mess in the sink!</li>
            <li> It catches all the hair so the sink isn&#x27;t a mess!</li>
            <li> I can shave without having a mess at all!</li>
            <li> and you are never going to be a mess when you use it!</li>
            <li> On all previous Norelco trimmer models the plastic completely covers the blade thus preventing the blade from cutting your face.  </li>
            <li> —others don&#x27;t do this, I don&#x27;t understand it all; having previous trimmers die mid-shave results in some questionable last minute facial-hair style choices/compromises.  :</li>
            <li> It is standard equipment on the less expensive QT 4050.</li>
            <li> After my previous trimmer finally failed, this was the next generation option.  </li>
            <li> In the winter, it gets so cold and dry here that I constantly nick myself, and electric razors cause me to have ingrown whiskers.      </li>
            <li> The design of the trimmer and attachments prevent you from getting to the hair on the upper life unless you take off the attachments, making it impossible to have your mustache/upper lip the same length as the rest of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to do the mustache area, but it can be done with a little maneuvering.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s less painful on sensitive skin than other ones I&#x27;ve used that get a closer shave, so</li>
            <li> This shaver hurts so badly that I had to return it and post this first ever review.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 2 1/2 years before the battery went bad.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as I expected...</li>
            <li> At least, that&#x27;s been the average life of the trimmers  I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never hated a trimmer like I hated that thing.</li>
            <li> While not perfect, it does well enough to keep from making a mess in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> But know about this flaw when I ordered it so was not surprised just annoyed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard the thickness of a lumberjack for the past 15 years or so and have tried(and killed)</li>
            <li> have had two stubble trimmers in the past few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a hard time keeping up with large amounts of hair and cutting it evenly.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works rather well, so that roughly 85% of the hairs were trapped in the receptacle beneath the cutting blades, obviating the need to use a towel or bowl under the sink to prevent drain clogging.</li>
            <li> I started with setting the trimmer at 11 and then slowly kept going down</li>
            <li> This product has some serious design flaws that prevent if from providing an even trim on any setting other than stubble.      </li>
            <li> You seriously should buy this over any other trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, meaning you will still launch little hairs in every which direction, but it does capture the vast majority of your shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you like to keep some beard down there, you&#x27;re in serious trouble with this shaver--</li>
            <li> any chosen length this trimmer is very uneven and produces a patchy messy beard.  </li>
            <li> After my face was rubbed raw from these attempts I gave up and returned it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer over a year ago and have only used it several times and it is so bad</li>
            <li> Turbo feature actually makes it hit a dead stop with the E, so that feature is useless to me.</li>
            <li> Quality is questionable as i have had it only for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but I was stupid to think it&#x27;s the same settings as my old trimmer, so I ended with shorter beard than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I fully expected I was doing something wrong, but after careful discussion with them found I was doing what should have been done.  </li>
            <li> but I was stupid to think it&#x27;s the same settings as my old trimmer, so I ended with shorter beard than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how other guys have been stabbing themselves with this trimmer; I had no such trouble.  </li>
            <li> I mean there will still be hair everywhere scattered about after use, just slightly less of</li>
            <li> one con I have is that it&#x27;s hard to trim the hairs just under my nose because the head of the unit is a little bluky on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and i was really afraid i will get a useless item; especially those they spoke about cutting their lips :)</li>
            <li> Latch on cover for hair clippings compartment is plastic, small and weak and breaks so the cover doesn&#x27;t stay closed.  </li>
            <li> In my beard&#x27;s case I have to go repeatedly in the opposite direction of the beard lay (and a lot of other angles) to get uniform cutting to the gauged</li>
            <li> down there!!</li>
            <li> The trim guard - has too few comb tines that are sharp and poke you in the lip unless you are really careful when trimming your mustache, just feels hard and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Because of some of the negative reviews, I was a little worried about ordering this product, but am quite happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it sucks the hair trimmings into a little compartment instead of having them spray all over the place.</li>
            <li> and when I used it the next time I dialed the LED to the number I usually trim at, and when I went to shave it was on a 2!!!</li>
            <li> You can only use it in the upward motion and it is very hard to line a beard or goatee up since you cant see what your cutting if you can only use it in the upward direction.</li>
            <li> I use it to have close trim for my hard beard and see trimming is not even in few places.</li>
            <li> In the past I have almost exclusively used razors to shave.  </li>
            <li> Because it has been 33 days (3 days past the Amazon 30 day return period), I can&#x27;t return it to Amazon, so now I have to deal with Norelco.</li>
            <li> They have worked well in the past.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to resort to a pair of scissors to get a neat beard.  </li>
            <li> I think a pair of garden shears might give you a better trim than this terrible product.</li>
            <li> Weird thing though is after it is fully charged and only used it once</li>
            <li> The stubble look took at least 5 minutes of work because the cut would be uneven.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s kicking on or if it&#x27;s something else</li>
            <li> so I could change the setting, but no more.</li>
            <li> box arrived from Amazon on time as usual.  </li>
            <li> so im not sure how it would work for keeping a longer beard</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase it again,</li>
            <li> It is a useless device obviously designed by people who don&#x27;t use beard trimmers and I returned mine immediately.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Trimmer Vacs in the past that did not have the power of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have short beard works well to trim though a bit difficult to maneuver around mustache area</li>
            <li> No more Norelco&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it&#x27;s not perfect; there&#x27;s still a tiny mess--emphasis on tiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AN UNEVEN TRIM!    </li>
            <li> A lot better than a wahl, which is shocking</li>
            <li> 2mm usually)</li>
            <li> I usually avoid Philips products like the plague.</li>
            <li> Too small and doesn&#x27;t cut well.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my man needs a regular razor plus this.</li>
            <li> so I overlook these small issues.  </li>
            <li> You will end up with hairs on the counter and in the sink, as per usual.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I am so confident of this Norelco that I bet I could have a Bloody Mary for breakfast before using it and still not hurt myself; I really have no idea how the gentleman who wrote the fearful review is going about using the trimmer.       </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why that is no longer included</li>
            <li> sometimes I like a 1mm close cut, but usually I keep it at 2mm.  </li>
            <li> the small drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> keep my beard and mustache close, never more than a quarter inch out.</li>
            <li> One guide for trimming beards; one guide for haircuts; a small cleaning brush; and the charger.</li>
            <li> You would think that they could make a small change to the design to fix that.</li>
            <li> I end up using scissors there, which does not go with my lazy beard grooming philosophy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Albeit a bit small ...  </li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble with pulling hairs and the cleanup is a breeze!</li>
            <li> consumables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture 1 shows unit with cutter head removed for cleaning and the notorious plastic clippings compartment, small plastic tab</li>
            <li> They basically made  the guarantee useless, especially since it took me 45 minutes to get the customer service representative to fill in my information for a return.</li>
            <li> For this I switch up to a small $10 machine I have lying around just for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the clip that holds the stubble release door has broken, so that I must hold it closed manually, Leaves tons of stubble in the sink even on turbo mode which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> after a shave i usually have a 1 day beard look.  </li>
            <li> Digs into the scalp and the digital setting for the blade is always wrong.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with a case, but that&#x27;s a small detail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you want to keep longer beard, then you have to put on the guide, that&#x27;s where it has a small issue.</li>
            <li> No more hacking with a razor.</li>
            <li> I am unable to get an even trim with this product, because there is an open gap in the front where the blades are fully exposed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I keep receiving emails stating that the comb is on backorder, and the shipping date keeps getting delayed further.  </li>
            <li> It fails at the neckline and moustache areas as you cannot get close enough to the nose to get all of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> Of course that&#x27;s 3 months past the warranty date.  </li>
            <li> Warranty says I have to pay postage to return - not OK.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think</li>
            <li> Small power adapter that works with 100-240 VAC, so can be used abroad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I was using ordinary hair clippers.</li>
            <li> I must now report that I am not satisfied with their durability.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to see if Philips could outperform my past trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need a razor to get rid of the small hairs.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst and most impractical trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> One example is this past weekend (Christmas 2015) and traveling.  </li>
            <li> It woke me up in the middle of the night at the hotel because it started to randomly turn on.</li>
            <li> As you&#x27;ve probably noticed by going through the reviews, the old reviews about the comb stabbing you is no longer an issue because they also provide the contour comb as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant as some of the reviews I read were pretty polarizing, but I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and if your requirements are similar you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> no more hair on bathroom counter from trimming beard/mustache).  </li>
            <li> The worst part of it is that many retailers are dominated by Norelcowhen</li>
            <li> I am not sure how anyone could rate this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The small clip that holds the cover over the vaccuum chamber snapped off.</li>
            <li> Unfortunate design on the stubble compartment has doomed the last two of these trimmers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work no better with this model.</li>
            <li> It usually take 2-3 attempts to get everything aligned so the comb can slide down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in its current incarnation, I must reluctantly retire its use and return to my worn-out T980.</li>
            <li> one of these days cause it just so small.</li>
            <li> No more hairy</li>
            <li> A small detail I know,</li>
            <li> It worked well in terms of the shave but after only having it for a 3 months it started turing itself on randomly.</li>
            <li> No more charging after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew how it was broken, but I&#x27;m not certain.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there are not a lot of products in the vacuum trimmer market.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;- useless vacuum.</li>
            <li> I though the reviews that the vacuum doesn&#x27;t work that well were exaggerated.</li>
            <li> The vacuum chamber gets in the way of the trimmer blades and that makes it difficult to square off the edges of your beard or sideburns.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the vacuum feature</li>
            <li> The clipping compartment door will eventually break off and the vacuum feature become useless.  </li>
            <li> And the vacuum feature, while not perfect, gets almost all the hair.</li>
            <li> sorry to say that the vacuum feature isn&#x27;t working anymore</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose well although the vacuum is not perfect.</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical about the vacuum working</li>
            <li> Mediocre trimmer with a joke of a vacuum.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find a beard trimmer with the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> Because the vacuum surrounds the blades, it&#x27;s difficult to see where you&#x27;re going.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use without the guard as the vacuum part of it gets in the way.</li>
            <li> It leaves your sink dirty, maybe a little less dirty than other normal trimmers.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the ease of use with this trimmer, but the weird battery issues make it impossible to travel without packing the charger.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the point in further replacement as it will just fail again due to the poor design.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Generally, I&#x27;m a bit disapointed, but maybe I&#x27;m just an idiot that doesn&#x27;t know how to use the product right.</li>
            <li> I am little skeptical of what the drunk agent said that being normal.</li>
            <li> Any setting longer than \\&quot;3\\&quot;  will result in a VERY uneven beard.   </li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard</li>
            <li> it jabs my skin and allows very very uneven cuts to happen.</li>
            <li> The stubble comb in comes with creates a very uneven shave.</li>
            <li> I wish it has less than 1mm size too!!.</li>
            <li> Also, as some have mentioned, it&#x27;s not much good as a mustache trimmer, as the cutting head is quite wide, but it works well enough for</li>
            <li> I read some other post that said the poor trimming comb design had been rectified.</li>
            <li> All my previous trimmers failed due to the Nickel based batteries no longer taking a charge.</li>
            <li> BUT, the door to the vacuum chamber is very poorly made and broke within a month of about twice weekly use.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum system work very poor.</li>
            <li> Instead, it turns out there is a huge GAP in the trimmer comb of this \\&quot;updated\\&quot; design, resulting in it CUTTING into your lip or stabbing you when you get to the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> only complaint would be that it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get up under the nose.</li>
            <li> I found the width of the cutting edge a little wide making trimming of the mustache around the lips a little tricky.  </li>
            <li> Avoids the mess, the charge last for a week at least, and the cutting length is fully configurable.</li>
            <li> I do a closer shave (between 4-6) and for me this razor was not very good.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the vacuum chamber cover fails to lock nowadays, (I don&#x27;t have any clue why this is happening as there is no breakage or damage ) and this one single issue makes  the unit almost inoperative</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this bad boy.</li>
            <li> He has had it for about a year and a half now and hasn&#x27;t complained!</li>
            <li> is not strong enough to keep the hair from flying everywhere when cutting my beard.  </li>
            <li> I tried the stock comb and agreed with the reviews that it was a bit dangerous if you were not careful.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t usually have to recharge until after at least 2 shaving cycles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I waited this long to replace my Wahl with this Norelco;  the Wahl now seems like a torture device compared to this Norelco 4070.</li>
            <li> Not great for getting close to edges, not very precise.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is made with poor quality materials that continually break down.</li>
            <li> The main thing missing is a charging base to store it on and keep it charged.  </li>
            <li> so i read all these reviews on the new model and found out some bad ones .</li>
            <li> I have owned this now for about 8 months of casual use and it no longer holds a charge very long.  </li>
            <li> This makes it near impossible to maintain a lower cut height when trimming around any contours - the chin especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s tough to get into tight spaces like under your nose</li>
            <li> I recommend everyone, who like to look little Rough!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Which is not too bad considering that you don&#x27;t need to open the door to remove trimmings, just hold it upside down and shake it</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than running out of juice when your half done with your beard and your late for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, since I&#x27;ve owned 2 previous Norelco beard shavers with vacuum, I decided to ignore the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> Hard to trim mustache.</li>
            <li> Took me two trips to learn this the hard way.</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way once when I went to use it and the battery was drained.  </li>
            <li> And how about this: the charger dock can be built into the hard case.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have an attachment for getting hard to reach areas, like under your nose.</li>
            <li> While like the Panasonic, since it is adjustable without changing combs you don&#x27;t need all the bits and pieces that may be hard to find as time goes by.</li>
            <li> This allows the skin at that point to be pushed closer to the trimmer depending on how hard it is being pushed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, the tines on the comb are too flexible, thus the length of the cut depends on how hard you push the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I try to trim my chest or leg hair and its hard to tell the length of the cut with all the plastic surrounding the blades.  </li>
            <li> it cut even and level and it was kinda hard to get used to how you have to hold it to trim everything</li>
            <li> It hardly worked for one month.</li>
            <li> Now they are dull again, and I still can&#x27;t find replacements.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it he told me that he hardly feels the blades going through his hair</li>
            <li> Eventually it got to the point where it hardly sucked up any hair at all.</li>
            <li> Also it is hard to trim the mustache area because of the inset way the trimmer is set up.</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- cant get hard to reach areas ( under nose etc) or do a precision cut with blade on.</li>
            <li> The trimmer still works, but it&#x27;s a bit annoying to have to hold it a certain way so the trimmings don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> Pure crap.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the nature of the vacuum intake makes the second one impossible.  </li>
            <li> wife is tired of you leaving little beard hairs all over the sink, this helps with that.</li>
            <li> The little cleaning brush they ship with it has also gotten a lot worse.</li>
            <li> It would get 5 stars except for the little compartment holding the beard trimmings has broken so it doesn&#x27;t attach well anymore .</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the weak vacuum in the QT4050, and promptly returned it.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how the stupid little door clasp/hinge could break, but so far mine is holding up.</li>
            <li> The big issue seems to be that the head/combs do not pivot so it is very difficult to get an even trim which is odd since the \\&quot;lower\\&quot; less expensive model has this feature.</li>
            <li> Fancier but also as bad as the old one.</li>
            <li> Bad trimmer just fancy case but does not improve performance in comparison with my 10 yr old norelco...</li>
            <li> This thing sucks.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not for short dirty looks.</li>
            <li> the turbo sucks in almost all the bits and pieces, which i wife truly appreciates.</li>
            <li> My hopes were not given over to disappointment, and I was met with a product that not only met, but exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Not in the least overpriced.  </li>
            <li> I trim my beard 2 times each week and have done so for at least 4-5 weeks.</li>
            <li> You are fighting with the vaccuum opening that sucks in the hair.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps Philips responded to all the negative lithium battery comments.  </li>
            <li> I have been through at least 5-6 trimmers trying to find one that worked correctly.  </li>
            <li> Lately I have been overwhelmed with compliments.  </li>
            <li> and you have to charge it at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> : will not hold a charge, Confusing button layout.</li>
            <li> this is the third norelco phillips trimmer i have owned and by far, the worst of the lot.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Norelco QT4070, to replace a Whal trimmer that was a disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> You have stick it out at a different angle rather awkwardly to where can&#x27;t see all that well and limits the accuracy of your shaving.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews are correct.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too late.  </li>
            <li> Because of all of the negative reviews regarding the comb on the QT4070, I decided to go another direction for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you want a shave over 3mm, it just sucks (if you&#x27;ll pardon the pun)</li>
            <li> Some hair did fall away but the system sucks up maybe 95% of all the hair that gets trimmed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews, complaining about the design of the blade guard.</li>
            <li> at least 4+ years.</li>
            <li> I have owned several beard trimmers over the years and this is by far the worst.  </li>
            <li> Also over time the collection bin door will fail to stay &amp;#34;snapped&amp;#34; closed and you will need to hold it while using.  </li>
            <li> then your beard probably sucks anyway.</li>
            <li> It sucks up a lot of the hair, though not all.  </li>
            <li> the research I&#x27;ve done, and the cutting experience I&#x27;ve actually had</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a turbo boost button for extra cutting power</li>
            <li> Number one complaint was me leaving beard hair everywhere after shaving.</li>
            <li> the Whal will nick my face sometimes but at least it works.</li>
            <li> And I still find it annoying that I have to empty it constantly during trims.</li>
            <li> One fix for the cord is that you could super-glue it into the body of the trimmer since the battery won&#x27;t end up being practical after a year anyway, and then that solves the dangerous problem of the cord plug constantly falling out...</li>
            <li> In the future I&#x27;ll probably just replace the cutting assembly instead of the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes at least 30 minutes to trim a beard because of the design of the shaving blades.  </li>
            <li> period.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed to say the least</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer at least 1 to 2 times per week and have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for at least a year with zero issues.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts for at least 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> purchased this unit close to two years ago, despite what any negative reviews said.</li>
            <li> and I had to have at least two trims before I managed to get all the longer hairs caught and cut</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is the location of the cutting blade.</li>
            <li> I agree to all the negative comments here.</li>
            <li> and I also like the numerous cutting lengths.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use was at least once a month to trim my beard, sometimes twice a month.</li>
            <li> people were saying it was cutting their face, I had no such experience.</li>
            <li> The plastic catch that keeps the door closed for whisker collection inexplicably broke after a few months of use (2-3 trims/week).</li>
            <li> At least allow the battery</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week and can get a least 5 or 6 shaves before a recharge.  </li>
            <li> The woman informed me that it does not come in fact come with that comb; I complained that the product&#x27;s page at their web site says that it does and has a picture of the comb pivoting on a hinge.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, at least it&#x27;s a spare if the one that came with the trimmer was ever to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe Norelco has solved the trimmer issue mentioned in the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> If I had gotten at least a year use out of it</li>
            <li> This has a turbo mode and while I can&#x27;t tell any difference while shaving I do feel that it sucks up the hairs</li>
            <li> I read some of the negative reviews, but you know what?</li>
            <li> So my sink is only marginally dirty when I finish trimming.</li>
            <li> This means that the cutting head is set back from the front of the contour comb with the result that you cannot cut within 3/8-1/2&amp;#34; from any object that restricts the forward motion of the trimmer...like your nose.</li>
            <li> cutting height is controlled by a rotating wheel with a digital readout.  </li>
            <li> and it sucks those hairs up like the government sucks up our tax dollars...  </li>
            <li> In fact the cutting mechanism is essentially identical</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s been my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some negative reviews about the hair bay.</li>
            <li> My beard isn&#x27;t particularly coarse, and doesn&#x27;t grow in a bunch of crazy directions, yet it&#x27;s still a bit of a chore to get an even shave with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just sucks.</li>
            <li> I was hestiant to purchase this product based on some of the negative reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every trick/suggestion in the book, and have used it as slow as molasses, to no avail  -</li>
            <li> But the real trouble was under the chin, where I cut closer.</li>
            <li> And the curve between the jaw and the neck is the real trouble.</li>
            <li> Worse, I got an uneven cut under my chin on a level surface, and I can&#x27;t begin to guess why</li>
            <li> (you will need to keep it lubricated with a drop here and there to avoid overheating and slow cutter head speeds).  </li>
            <li> I suppose the effect will depend upon how thick your beard is, the color, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and this handles it without the pulling and tugging.</li>
            <li> Uneven trim, poor comb design.</li>
            <li> it even has a setting that increases the RPM&#x27;s so that it will cut a lot easier through really thick hair.</li>
            <li> Sort of thick and clunky.</li>
            <li> You have to go really slowly, and over and over and over again to get all the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> so I was forced to buy the QT4070.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m slowly getting used to the idiosynchrocies of this device.  </li>
            <li> Thus I had a really uneven and all around poor quality shave.  </li>
            <li> Would like Norelco to respond but the web site so slow I can&#x27;t get on.</li>
            <li> Just slowly brush it over the area you need trimmed.</li>
            <li> as much as I hate shaving with Philips Norelco everything its much cleaner and easyer to do.  </li>
            <li> T-770 that is dying a slow death.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The really bad part is the vacuum door broke within a few months and</li>
            <li> I now use an elastic band to hold it down, not really ideal</li>
            <li> There is an additional gap/hole between the cutting head and the vacuum collection hole where lots of hair falls through to the grease-coated moving parts.</li>
            <li> As with the other parts I&#x27;ve mentioned, the spring feels very weak and seems prone to break.  </li>
            <li> so if you try to line or use it in any direction other then having the front/display area facing the ceiling you end up having the vacuum scoop against your skin and the cutting blades are unable to cut any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more pulling!</li>
            <li> I mean, who is designing these things?</li>
            <li> and I usually am a fan, but this is the worst and most expensive trimmer I have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so messy!!</li>
            <li> Then I tried to get a neat trim line for my mustache on the upper lip and this was where the trimmer completely failed!</li>
            <li> I mean, come on, I use this a couple of times to trim my beard, which takes maybe all of thirty seconds each time, and it needs to be charged again.</li>
            <li> What do I mean by often?</li>
            <li> It has a sharply angled leading edge which is uncomfortable as you run the trimmer over your face</li>
            <li> I mean it HOLDS a charge.</li>
            <li> Which brings me to this Norelco - it has been a failure for both \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; my head and trimming my goatee.  </li>
            <li> This leads me to think that maybe this will lead to premature failure.</li>
            <li> The G380 was a combo system, meaning it included a nose-hair trimming head (hurts), a big comb to trim hair (never used), a smaller head for sideburn trimming (worthless) and a tiny foil head for &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; (again, worthless).</li>
            <li> While using it I was unable to see where the tip of the blades met my face -- so I was tapping a bit in the dark.</li>
            <li> All the bad ratings may be due to the comb, and I get it, without the contour comb this will be down to 1 or 2 stars at most.&lt;br</li>
            <li> vacuum in this trimmer is totally useless, adds unnecessary bulk, and creates unnecessary noise.</li>
            <li> does* look intimidating when all the way down, I still was unable to cut my lip or cut myself in any way.</li>
            <li> The new guide comb&#x27;s design is woefully stupid for two reasons:    </li>
            <li> BUT  The guard on this trimmer flexes toward the cutting blades with very minor pressure.</li>
            <li> And it ends up looking ridiculous, which means I have to re-trim all over again at a shorter length than I wanted.    </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I gave serious consideration to purchasing a cheaper beard trimmer</li>
            <li> PRO, seriously.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the trimming function on this one is seriously sub-par.  </li>
            <li> far I have not experienced a bad product from Norelco and will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> Replacement parts for this unit are ridiculously priced so don&#x27;t even bother checking.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> It is next to impossible to look at yourself in the mirror and trim with precision.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one also has a cheaply-mounted door, and the non-serviceable battery died in less than a year of once-a-month use.</li>
            <li> This is a ridiculous design flaw, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like ... seriously?  </li>
            <li> But the product ultimately failed due to a seemingly mal-engineered weak spot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless comparing to previous model.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a vast improvement from the horrible battery life of my last trimmer, an Andis.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how quickly my stubble would turn into something shaggy and nasty.  </li>
            <li> That being said don&#x27;t buy this as a stubble trimmer, it&#x27;s horrific for the job, not just because it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough, but because the vacuum gets in the way and makes it a pain in the butt.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid i&#x27;ll loose it</li>
            <li> , the only bad part is its next to impossible to trim around your nose</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical before making my decision to purchase this trimmer.</li>
            <li> drawback for me is that the design of the trimmer makes it a little difficult to get under the nose (mustache).</li>
            <li> feature adds a little plastic channel that pops out under the blades that makes trim/detail work difficult to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly I was a little sad that this happened.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just too hard to use now and for my purposes a poor paperweight.</li>
            <li> people cutting the selfs must be pressing down way to hard on it</li>
            <li> Lastly, for those shady resellers who are trying to gouge the electric razor market on Amazon with stupidly overpriced DISCONTINUED Norelco models, you can get lost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the second bad experience I&#x27;ve had with a Norelco product</li>
            <li> and I can guarantee you I won&#x27;t be having a 3rd bad experience as I&#x27;m never buying Norelco again.</li>
            <li> One of the reason I didn&#x27;t experience bad effects could be that I trim shortly (second from the min)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of gimmicky products, so I was a bit nervous when I bought this.</li>
            <li> Not good for those participating in Movember</li>
            <li> Wide cutting area.</li>
            <li> the trimmer is not smooth and the parts are difficult to take off and on.  </li>
            <li> The spring-loaded clear plastic thing attached to the comb is really a stupid idea.</li>
            <li> Find a different trimmer, this one is atrocious.</li>
            <li> Frustrated, I finally decided I would opt for a beard trimmer:</li>
            <li> They said it&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
            <li> its uneven, uncomfortable, and just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , NOT good a trimming EDGE of moustach or beard.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD FOR ME...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a mess when comes to shaving due to my annoying thick hairy beard..</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone with a thick beard like mine and is tired of picking up 1000&#x27;s of hairs from your sink after you are done.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not overly loud nor is it an annoying noise maker.</li>
            <li> After being fearful of replacing my T980 for some time, I finally broke down and bought this trimmer after one of the comb tines broke on it.  </li>
            <li> It also does away with the spring-loaded vacuum \\&quot;chute\\&quot; that forever frustrated my use of the T980; it replaces it instead with a solid-plastic chute that extends all the way to the clippers.</li>
            <li> The old one had a nasty habit of dying half way through the trim.  </li>
            <li> colors are very bad black vs white vs ...</li>
            <li> This product has trimming settings that go down to less than 5 mm (stubble), but it does a very poor job of evenly cutting hair at this length.  </li>
            <li> Cons --    1) Useless for thick, hard beard hairs:    </li>
            <li> Just be very carefully opening the whisker chamber and removing the cutting guide.</li>
            <li> For some weird reason the designers created an adjustable guard where the cutting blades actually stick out of the guard!   </li>
            <li> problem is the led readout is quite unreliable, it gets confused oftenly and that has caused me a serious issue on one occasion</li>
            <li> The first lady I talked to was awful</li>
            <li> And forget about any close-up work, it is useless for goatees etc without the small shaver that used to come with the 980.    </li>
            <li> Rechargeable trimmers are still just too weak to go through any beard efficiently, unless you&#x27;re going for stubble.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I knew it was the worst decision I could have made.   </li>
            <li> I tried a competing Remington model but was disappointed to find that the Remington&#x27;s comb wouldn&#x27;t trim my beard as short as I&#x27;d like when on the lowest</li>
            <li> stubble collector bin door is a bit sketchy, and looks like the weak component.</li>
            <li> However, the construction on this item feels weak.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience when I shaved myself for the first time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m doing that anyways since the vac on this one is so weak.</li>
            <li> Frustrated, I should have returned it but waited too long.</li>
            <li> After reading all the negative reviews here on Amazon for this Phillips 4070 (cut lip after cut lip!), I was hesitant...?</li>
            <li> and is very hard to trim the moustach neatly.  </li>
            <li> This makes it very hard to be precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> impossible to use it,, there is an empty space that whatever size u set it to,, it will still shave size 0 mm :</li>
            <li> is required for any reliable performance.&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s very difficult to trim mustache due to the head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to use the QT4022 at any length other than the shortest setting.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, trimming up to the bottom of my nose is tough.</li>
            <li> The Blade without the guard is so hidden and horrible for shaping facial hair.</li>
            <li> Beards can be tough to manage.</li>
            <li> However, the directions are very confusing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick beard hair</li>
            <li> Uneven trim !!!</li>
            <li> The cutting edges are rounded so there is little chance you can cut yourself if you use the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> found it a little awkward to use</li>
            <li> Trims well but door that holds trimmings is poor.</li>
            <li> Poor customer service, poor product &#x3D;</li>
            <li> The idea was novel; but the technology was woefully deficient.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it as it is poor quality.</li>
            <li> The longer the setting the worse it got.</li>
            <li> Either the designer never had a beard or the R &amp; D department were without beards because this is a poorly designed, ineffective trimmer.</li>
            <li> The only annoying thing is the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Now after 1 year the hinges email of the door is broken so the door is taped both sides.</li>
            <li> The head design is poor.  </li>
            <li> Comparatively poor battery life  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The device is broken by design.</li>
            <li> I have to say this trimmer is a game changer.</li>
            <li> * Not a great one swipe trimmer</li>
            <li> Leave the second one in the box, it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> The snap has broken, allowing the door to flap around if I don&#x27;t keep my thumb on it.</li>
            <li> I am getting tired of TSA taking things and breaking things in my luggage.</li>
            <li> The hair trap door is broken</li>
            <li> Then I made a warranty claim and the broken one was replaces without any problem.  </li>
            <li> The plastic tab that clips on to body is broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic tab that holds the hair clippings in has broken and now must be held with a rubber band or by hand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great for precision grooming or trimming mustache.</li>
            <li> yes, the comb is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> In the worse cases this snag caused the beard guide to be shoved into a lower setting and giving me a &amp;#34;bald</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s another case of poor design.</li>
            <li> Worse case, I&#x27;ll try it without the contour and see if I like it.  </li>
            <li> it was time to up my game.</li>
            <li> Despite providing a stubble guard this is not a great stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> The the 7th week hit and I went to use it and realized the cover for the hair reservoir had broken where the clip hold it in place.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> The lock on the hair collector part has since broken, but it isn&#x27;t a hassle to hold it since your hand covers it anyways.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with the price .</li>
            <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t understand the idea behind each cone..</li>
            <li> and so they are tired of these calls, but she didn&#x27;t apologize or act like it was any inconvenience to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased worse, however, which is why I decided to splurge on a beard trimmer I felt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the design.</li>
            <li> so it kinda gets frustrating.</li>
            <li> poor comb design.</li>
            <li> This one has a non-removable catch area with a depression behind a \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; door and must be cleaned with a brush each time.  </li>
            <li> After approximately 24 months of use, I have decided to retire it and purchase something else.</li>
            <li> not happy...</li>
            <li> so I began the exhausting task of finding a replacement.</li>
            <li> This means I cannot see what I&#x27;m doing when I trim my sideburns or mustache to length, which is frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I imagine it would be even worse for someone who produces a 5&#x27;oclock shadow.</li>
            <li> HAD TO RETURN WAS IRRITATING MY SKIN....</li>
            <li> The cutting &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; are very difficult to use for trimming: difficult to see in the mirror, first of all, because of the design, and difficult to just use because of how they sit in the housing.  </li>
            <li> If Philips could bring themselves to drop the false advertising, I&#x27;d given it immediately five stars.</li>
            <li> Norelco is knowingly false advertising the included accessories.  </li>
            <li> This is blatantly false.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum feature is worthless.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is completely worthless.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer specifically for the vacuum feature because cleaning the since up every time I trim is annoying.  </li>
            <li> I mean that it randomly turns on (both when its plugged into the wall charging and when it is unpluged)</li>
            <li> Avoid Philips&#x27; online chat service for warranty claims: terrible communication despite my specifically worded messages, didn&#x27;t want to help me at first, didn&#x27;t listen to the issue I had (dull cutting assembly out of the box), and I still have yet to receive my replacement (it&#x27;s been 4 weeks).</li>
            <li> design flaw cited in other reviews makes for un-even trimming and a painful experience.  </li>
            <li> The one plus for the Remington was the flat base used to stand it on a counter.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I trim my hair in front of a mirror IN MY ROOM!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever ordered through Amazon.com, and at a shockingly high price, considering the quality.  </li>
            <li> However, the travel pouch that came with previous trimmers is no longer included, which is too bad.</li>
            <li> The reveiwer who complained about cutting their lips must not know what he&#x27;s doing because I have not experienced anything of the sort.  </li>
            <li> Laying the trimmer on its side causes messy trimmings to fall out, and because of its rounded bottom it is impossible to stand upright.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD, UPS!  </li>
            <li> On the old Norelco it was impossible to bring the cutting surface too close since the guard covered 100% of the cutting surface.  </li>
            <li> This, alone, makes it crazy hard to get an even trim.    </li>
            <li> With the comb removed, the cutting head still cannot provide a close shave, leaving at least 1mm.  </li>
            <li> , I remember when I was looking to order this product that there were some bad reviews because of a missing clip etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I am unable to return it because the 30 day window has ended so now we are stuck with a broken item.</li>
            <li> I shave every 2-3 days and this is by far the worst shaver...</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst trimmer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality from a big vendor.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that when removing the guard that I could use it for a close shave on the detail work, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not very good at that.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick heavy annoying beard that I need to shave every two weeks, this trimmer gets the job done.. and</li>
            <li> This is unfortunate and makes using the trimmer a bit annoying as I always have to hold the door closed.</li>
            <li> This was a motivating factor when I decided to buy this trimmer, so I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I usually would not write a bad review on a product.</li>
            <li> Plus at that point the angle is not good for cutting.  </li>
            <li> it came with a &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34;, hate laying appliances down on the sink.</li>
            <li> Basically Phillips, being the crap company for consumer products that they are (they lost in all consumer markets for a reason) decided to release a half baked product, to insult their customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very weak product.  </li>
            <li> It is also very weak and doesnt cut the well.</li>
            <li> he has very very very thick hair and a lot of it!</li>
            <li> Although, if you&#x27;re expecting the vacuum to capture everything you&#x27;ll be very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t give it negative stars, otherwise I would.</li>
            <li> of useless</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Just slightly annoying as it adds a few minutes to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m guessing the Li-Ion battery just failed).</li>
            <li> wtf?    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this means I cannot use them as a guide while trimming.  </li>
            <li> - she was horribly difficult and said they couldn&#x27;t send one based on \\&quot;one\\&quot; review and just because I asked.  </li>
            <li> the height adjustment is merely a twist, nothing to clip on - nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Plus the lack of springs and hinges on the guide will make this trimmer survive my poor luggage packing as well!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it compromises the results on your face.      </li>
            <li> This trimmer is completely useless.</li>
            <li> You can go from, say, setting 3&#x27;s length to setting 2&#x27;s length with the wrong angle/pressure.</li>
            <li> I purposely bought an expensive trimmer because I wanted to buy quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product failed after 7 months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally useless in any length between 2 and 4mm, which is where I like to keep my beard.</li>
            <li> T-930 that would no longer hold a charge and I have not been sorry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if all of these beard trimmer company&#x27;s just aren&#x27;t testing their products, but I&#x27;m dumbfounded at how difficult it is to find a quality adjustable trimmer.  </li>
            <li> &quot; in the guard seems to be a design fail.  </li>
            <li> Bald guys and close trimmers should be wary of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Really lame considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it sits, this QT4070 is useless for me.</li>
            <li> It while it sounds like a silly gimmick</li>
            <li> Let me just say that it is useless if what you want is to maintain a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> They fail miserably at the second function.  </li>
            <li> Useless and won&#x27;t power with the AC plug alone.</li>
            <li> :  Difficult to trim up close up under nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  </li>
            <li> Wrong.      </li>
            <li> One of the included combs is essentially useless.  </li>
            <li> &quot; but this isn&#x27;t difficult to prevent incorrect usage.  </li>
            <li> Also, the numbers that appear on the screen of my shaver are sometimes wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate</li>
            <li> Needless to say, there is no pouch that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done, sorry.</li>
            <li> Piece ofjunk...and an expensive one at that.  </li>
            <li> But, it fails to suck all the hair</li>
            <li> If you remove the adjustable gauge spacer, It is difficult to use the trimmer for edging.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Little difficult in difficult areas of face, but i m learning..</li>
            <li> and I found them both useless.  </li>
            <li> ill probably have this one replaced or just return it.</li>
            <li> but that was a worse mistake than trimming your bits and pieces without the trimmer guard!</li>
            <li> Its uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The plastic flexible comb attachment is uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews I was a bit skeptical purchasing this trimmer...</li>
            <li> Also the &amp;#34;digital light&amp;#34; displaying the comb numbers often mis-reads and displays the wrong numbers (if it decides to work that day).</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the trimmer is in the box and</li>
            <li> unfortunately i have to agree with a couple of the criticisms in some of the reviews here.</li>
            <li> In addition, the mustache trimming is also uncomfortable since you can&#x60;t see the position of the blade.    </li>
            <li> Hopefully Norelco will redesign this flawed unit soon.</li>
            <li> When it does fail, I would purchase this again.  </li>
            <li> : the led screen show wrong length!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of the width of the head and the plastic bits around the edges of the blade, it&#x27;s difficult to catch the hairs at the edges and on the contoured parts of the neck.</li>
            <li> Without turbo mode turned on the trimmer is useless...</li>
            <li> because the horribly designed comb simply does not function.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading the reviews about this trimmer, but I ordered it anyway.</li>
            <li> Once I pointed that out, the operator agreed that something was weird here.  </li>
            <li> It fails to deliver on everything the description promises.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot cancel the order since it&#x27;s already in transit</li>
            <li> but I really hate how uneven the results</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, I can use it as corded, but then why pay for the expensive lithium ion battery?</li>
            <li> 6 failed at the battery from continued use.</li>
            <li> The Qt4070 comes with 2 combs, and both are difficult to place on the razor&#x27;s rails - just something you have to get used to.</li>
            <li> offering from Norelco is JUST shy of a swing and a miss.  </li>
            <li> Also the travel lock is completely useless, the trimmer drains itself on almost every trip I take.</li>
            <li> Nothing is inherently wrong with the thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not flawless, so</li>
            <li> &gt;* Difficult to trim mustache because trimmer guide hits my nose.</li>
            <li> It is plastic and after continuous use, it has failed and does not stay shut anymore.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with design.</li>
            <li> The one it comes with is uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> This makes it difficult for getting places like just under the nose.  </li>
            <li> I still have weird battery issues with it.  </li>
            <li> This piece of crap was a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, the \\&quot;Contour\\&quot; head has a weird, overly-complicated design.  </li>
            <li> Also, the Money-Back Guarantee from Philips is complicated that requires you to chat or call them and then work through a series of emails.</li>
            <li> This is the worst item I&#x27;ve ever bought in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ordered this Jan 5th.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look like a weird hack job anymore.  </li>
            <li> One turn at the wrong angle and your 3m beard becomes 1m.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;The \\&quot;difficult</li>
            <li> A game changer if you&#x27;re finding beard grooming inconvenient or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This means that its difficult to get close on cheeks and for neck shaving.</li>
            <li> I have started wondering if there&#x27;s something wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m out of the return window with Amazon, so I will have to take with Norelco and try to get the warranty replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it is not perfect.  </li>
            <li> It wont be wrong to say that it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> also&lt;br /&gt;works, just not perfect.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;depth head&amp;#34; is uncomfortable moving across your beard or face.  </li>
            <li> I need something that trims my beard and despite it&#x27;s name, this failed to do that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really frustrated and mad at these amateurs who wasted my money and my time.</li>
            <li> Durability for a Norelco product is very poor.</li>
            <li> The door to the chamber which holds the trimmed hair is very poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> Seems like very poor engineering on this part, or planned obsolescence,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, for those shady resellers who are trying to gouge the electric razor market on Amazon with stupidly overpriced DISCONTINUED Norelco models, you can get lost.</li>
            <li> Oh yea, no more damn whiskers all over the stupid sink.  </li>
            <li> sadly the product is extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> mustache trimmer is ergonomically terrible, cuts unevenly and required me to actually use another trimmer while trying this awful</li>
            <li> Weird they are making a device that is worst than previous one.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed with the life of the charge, but it does trim well!</li>
            <li> This poorly designed piece of garbage gives a completely uneven (and painful) trim because of the horrible comb that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hoping to have a mess-free trim, it doesn&#x27;t quite cut it (sorry, bad pun).  </li>
            <li> However, it suffers quite in a bit in an area where the T980 shined: quality.  </li>
            <li> I now use a hair cutting machine</li>
            <li> I use it for cutting my hair.  </li>
            <li> though-it&#x27;s terrible for areas with a lot of hair, the shave goes a bit uneven.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s cutting.</li>
            <li> this product is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, btw the guy complaining about it \\&quot;stabbing himself in the face\\&quot; while shaving?  </li>
            <li> I used my T908 to shave my beard and head, but that would be quite dangerous with this model.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no way I can use this without the blade cutting me and without making my beard look like it&#x27;s been hacked at by someone with blunt kid scissors.</li>
            <li> So the cutting head sits exposed within a cavity between the ends of the two sets of pointy tines.</li>
            <li> Keeping the shaver level with the surface is irrelevant--the problem is cutting the hair around a concave surface.</li>
            <li> At work no one even noticed that I had gone from a razor to a trimmer, so it is surely cutting closely.     </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the cutting heads, but that can be changed with the length settings</li>
            <li> It fills up immediately and sometimes to the point that hairs are backed up and blocking the trimmer blades from cutting.</li>
            <li> Utterly disappointing response form Philips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally unhappy.. as i was looking forward to using a philips product..</li>
            <li> So hesitantly I remove the comb attachment and decided to try it with just the blade (I was afraid cause of the reviews I read about others cutting themselves even with the comb attachment on).  </li>
            <li> Clearly disappointing.</li>
            <li> Works well at cutting my beard and is adjustable in 1 mm increments.</li>
            <li> He has a &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; that was in desperate need of trimming.</li>
            <li> Extremely unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> : It desperately needs a charging stand of some sort.</li>
            <li> I started noticing that it seems it relies on some sort of contact which if it gets dirty will cause it to go haywire.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about cutting myself as some of the reviewers</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the cutting increments I was expecting.</li>
            <li> disappointing that the latch for the part that catches the hair doesn&#x27;t hold.  </li>
            <li> The angle of cutting is a bit tricky and requires practice.  </li>
            <li> Lots of flexibility in cutting length.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t lost its cutting ability since it came out of the box</li>
            <li> They placed it in front of the cutting head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit unhappy after receiving this model.  </li>
            <li> up until i got this i was using a conair hair cutting kit to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> I guess they read the 1-3 star reviews and found that a majority of them expressed dissatisfaction with the beard guide and the effect of the trimmer blades, which are indeed over exposed on the beard guide, cutting lips or stabbing faces</li>
            <li> my hair instead of cutting it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve been motivated by dissatisfaction!</li>
            <li> They come to a point that, when pressed against your flesh the wrong way - hurts!</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; model has been sitting in the closet of my bathroom for 1 year now, and I am mad as hell at Norelco.</li>
            <li> Lame!  </li>
            <li> Nothing is wrong with this product, at all!</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> i was kinda mad about that</li>
            <li> I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> Needless to say This trimmer is life changing!</li>
            <li> It was an extremely unpleasant experience.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical to purchase this beard trimmer because of the reviews regarding the guide comb.</li>
            <li> All being said, I rate this product very poorly!</li>
            <li> And the trim length comb is very difficult to remove and re-attach.</li>
            <li> I can see that without the contour head that this would be very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had any problems with nicks and cuts, but it does make it very difficult to reach under the nose when trimming your mustache.</li>
            <li> It was very uncomfortable to use and, because of the pulling, did not result in an even trim.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to trim under your nose and 2.</li>
            <li> and with this machine is it impossible  </li>
            <li> trim head is impossible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to trim all of your hairs.</li>
            <li> will say it is virtually impossible to cut yourself with it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had bad luck)</li>
            <li> They are junk compared to this bad boy.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> The QT4070 is badly designed - the blades are exposed and could be in contact with the skin and thus produce cuts.</li>
            <li> The result can be as bad as rows of near-baldness in-between hairs of the intended length.  </li>
            <li> TO MENTION, all the bad reviews for them saying it comes with the contour comb which it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The bad:  Norelco no longer chooses to include a travel pouch.  </li>
            <li> Bad idea.  </li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not bad.</li>
            <li> Bad job....</li>
            <li> Badly designed.</li>
            <li> How bad could it be?</li>
            <li> maybe it was just a bad one,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often but this product I believe got a bad rap.</li>
            <li> The trimmer I received had a bad battery which did not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I often don&#x27;t post reviews, but this was so bad I had to.</li>
            <li> I never would&#x27;ve believe something from a legit company could be so bad.</li>
            <li> all in one trimmer that is also a Philips, so that swayed me in favor of this trimmer and away from the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I put up with it for a couple of years, thinking that maybe I&#x27;d just gotten a bad one or that I had mistreated it somehow</li>
            <li> I saw the bad reviews, and I thought they must be on to something.</li>
            <li> you are hesitant because of the bad reviews, ignore them.</li>
            <li> not too bad.</li>
            <li> bad news:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The reason it is painful is because of the guard prongs that control the height of the shave.</li>
            <li> A PAINFUL TRIM    </li>
            <li> He tried to read them and just got frustrated.</li>
            <li> Its a bit painful</li>
            <li> The result was an ugly shaven.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Ugly Grey-White-Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still shocked by the battery life: 2 months I have been using it, and I still have not put it on charge...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this expensive thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so unhappy with this thing, please AVOID THIS TRIMMER!</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this item.</li>
            <li> :-(    </li>
            <li> I bought this solely to keep a stubble / 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look -- and I was horribly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer fails miserably at everything it was designed to do:      </li>
            <li> However when I got it I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you want your trimmer to be custom made to any and all of your specifications, you&#x27;ll probably always be disappointed in any product.  </li>
            <li> However quite disappointed that when the device arrived, I realised that I needed an adapter for the power cord to charge the device.</li>
            <li> ; you see everyone claim online and on You Tube also. :(</li>
            <li> For the price that I paid for this, I am disappointed in its performance and capability for suction of cut hair.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this trimmer...don&#x27;t be and make the jump you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;what</li>
            <li> So disappointed in you, Norelco.</li>
            <li> :-(    </li>
            <li> I promise that you will no be disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this razor.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product but recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> After searching around I went with the QT4070, but am a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this unit and am disappointed with Philips.</li>
            <li> - it fails in every way miserably.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately now this newer version of the Norelco trimmer is Crap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this shaver</li>
            <li> Bad Bad Bad Bad!!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Without this, I find that I have to hold the trimmer at a very awkward angle to shave</li>
            <li> I found this to be a very disappointing choice for detail work.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need the stupid vaccum-function, which compromises the results on your face.    </li>
            <li> No need to carry those stupid attachments</li>
            <li> I have used this Qt4070/41 about a dozen times now, and each time I have managed to jab myself with those stupid tines somewhere - in the jawline, in the chin, in the lip, etc.</li>
            <li> How stupid is that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask stupid questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just hate parting with my money.</li>
            <li> This thing is the biggest piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I hate close shaves...  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why this was designed this way, but I don&#x27;t think the moron who designed it tested it to see how it works.</li>
            <li> I hate having my trimmer run out mid-shave.</li>
            <li> I have to hold it in place which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing.  </li>
            <li> You can plug the bloody thing in and use</li>
            <li> I hate cleaning the hair that scatter all over the sink when I trim my beard - I was looking for something that could help me avoid that and came thru this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Piece of crap</li>
            <li> The cutter or blade is built into the base, so any damage to the combs will not affect the operation of the unit.</li>
            <li> HATE IT.</li>
            <li> I hate having to shave but not as much as I hate not shaving.</li>
            <li> I wish this had a base</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;stubble comb\\&quot; that comes with the razor is crap.</li>
            <li> It would be a 5 star with a base.</li>
            <li> To start off, I HATE trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> I hate having to travel because a a rotten product</li>
            <li> I could have lived with that since I&#x27;m not an idiot and can figure out which one it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> hated having whiskers all over the vanity when I was done trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li> ive seen complaints about the comb included scratching your chin or being hated, but i do not use the comb</li>
            <li> I still use my Braun popup trimmer for lines which is very badly ergonomically designed, because with this trimmer I have to literally saw at the edge of my beard and still doesn&#x27;t cut even the shortest hairs.</li>
            <li> beard comb provided had a very bad tendency to &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; on curved areas or looser areas of skin, like under the jaw line.</li>
            <li> Very painful shave.</li>
            <li> And since it was the purpose of choosing this model, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was however, very disappointed with the quality of the battery that was included.  </li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll be very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with Phillips and this product.</li>
            <li> We are very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> but this trimmer is horrible.</li>

            <li> But it does a horrible job at trimming.  </li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> With the guard off,it was horrible at trimming beard edges and mustache lines.</li>
            <li> Also keeps sink from getting nasty with cut hairs every where.  </li>
            <li> This fold over manual is one of the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S HORRIBLE and causes irregular trimming.    </li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is the worst design I&#x27;ve every seen in any product.</li>
            <li> Norelco ought to take the 4070 off the market--it is a terrible product and is damaging their reputation.</li>
            <li> Onto the hair catch, it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> Philips is the worst ever..  </li>
            <li> This is a horribly designed product.  </li>

            <li> version, however, is the worst trimmer ever!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t trim evenly because of the comb design, which is terrible.</li>

            <li> this one is horrible at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was horrible and mangled my beard.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> The design is awful!!!</li>
            <li> The worst part is that it won&#x27;t hold a charge..  </li>
            <li> This is the worst razor I have ever used</li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips Customer Service Representatives are truly the worst reps I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> This might be one of the two worst purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon</li>
            <li> The worst part of all is the stubble trimmer doesn&#x27;t even trim.</li>
            <li> The trimming experience and the attachments that came with this product are terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A Great Buy, Thank You.</li>
            <li> okay option for a 5 oclock shadow shaver. like the vaccuum feature... saves a lot of cleanup. battery lasts pretty well. buut razor usually takes 2&#x27;3 passes over a given area to get good consistent trimming. also difficult to get into nooks and crannies of a face such as between upper lip and note.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I would give it five stars without hesitation if the claim that it &amp;#34;does not make a mess while trimming&amp;#34; were true. The reality is that about 80% to 90% get sucked into the trimmer&#x27;s container, which is great, but it also means that the remaining 10% or 20% end up in your sink. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I prefer this much over the alternative products that dump everything into your sink or next to it. If you use the trimmer with the turbo function, you get a decent suction and also a decent cut as long as you use the contour following comb. To get a good and even result, it is best to trim the same areas from at least 3 or 4 different directions, as the comb is not very fine and doesn&#x27;t catch all the hair. I have not had any problems with the hair container door -- other customers complained about it being flimsy but I find it easy to use and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: This is a fantastic product, much better than all the other options. If Philips could bring themselves to drop the false advertising, I&#x27;d given it immediately five stars.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works as it should. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The quality you would expect.</li>
            <li> It is as promised and expected.  I&#x27;m happy.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for business trips (to avoid carrying the power cord) and the vacuum feature. Not even 20 uses and now the battery does not stay charged and the vacuum window stays open with hair flowing out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of useless</li>
            <li> Great razor.  As most other posts say, this comes with the correct guide to make it work wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially liked this because it had one head and the blade positioning adjusts.  This saves me from losing the 15 heads that most razors come with.</li>
            <li> Great product but ones you use it with water no longer works mind went out on me</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Ive owned several vacuum shavers and all worked pretty well. The Norelco seems to be the best of them all. I shave my beard very close to the skin and this shaver does a really good job. The vacuum is great as well and leaves no mess what so ever.</li>
            <li> Works well. Vacuum catches all the hair. No problems with theadjustable  length feature on the shaver.</li>
            <li> Pulls hair on normal speed, works perfectly on turbo (no pulled hairs). Blades are sharp and cut welll, but don&#x27;t use for fine detail or very close shaves. Vacuum feature is a gimmick - do not buy for that feature alone. The compartment fills up quickly and the overflow just sprays about your bathroom like mushroom spores. But I only bother shaving when I look truly overgrown so this may not be an issue for those who trim daily. Think of it more like a good ride-on mower as opposed to a lawn edger.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Efficient seller.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like it. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> ok....i spent a lot of time researching a beard trimmer and based on Amazon reviews chose this one.  This is just a hair trimmer and renamed a beard trimmer.  No difference except for a cheap plastic adjustable cutting guard.  I screwed up cutting my beard the first time with this.  So now I have the woman that cuts my hair trim my beard.  She does a better job and doesn&#x27;t charge much.  btw....she used a $300.00 3 inch trimmer to work on my beard.  You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t cost that much.  I still use it to do minor trimming.  Nice to have it around if i need it....</li>
            <li> The batery gone after one year. No cordless anymore</li>
            <li> This product is great! It does an outstanding job cutting and the vacuum catches all hair so my sink stays clean.  My only complaint is that I wish it was easier to clean. Since you cannot use water you need to use this very small brush to clean it every time. Just slightly annoying as it adds a few minutes to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> As a satisfied owner of a Norelco T980, I was pretty interested in the idea of a replacement trimmer that was quieter, lighter, offered better battery life, and wouldn&#x27;t have any battery memory issues (the T980 used Ni-Cad batteries). The QT4070 delivers in all of those areas. However, it suffers quite in a bit in an area where the T980 shined: quality.  I&#x27;ve had my T980 since 2008/2009 and while the battery isn&#x27;t very good these days, it still works perfectly. I purchased the QT4070 in September 2013 and Norelco is about to send me my FOURTH replacement under warranty. The first trimmer died completely after a couple months. It just wouldn&#x27;t turn on right after shutting it off, I couldn&#x27;t get it to show any signs of life on the charger either (I&#x27;m guessing the Li-Ion battery just failed). The other three have all succumb to the issue with the trimmings door others have shared here. The plastic notch that holds it shut is just too flimsy/fragile and breaks off after a few months of normal use. It&#x27;s a shame, because this is a nice trimmer overall and it just seems like a huge waste of resources. Philips could easily remedy this, but they probably consider it too minor of an issue to spend money on. Though, I do commend them on issuing replacements without any hassle whatsoever.  Minor Update - 7/5/2015: I should also mention, I&#x27;ve had a handful of instances where the battery just kind of &amp;#34;quits&amp;#34; when using the trimmer fresh off the charger. I usually have to stop to empty the trimmer and/or add/remove one of the combs after using it for a few minutes. Sometimes, it just refuses to turn back on and shows that the battery is dead. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> Had a Philips beard trimmer for 6 years and still have no issues with it. Decided to upgrade!</li>
            <li> Hard to trim mustache.</li>
            <li> Amazing, if you have a beard you need one. Best Trimmer on the market</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful, has great battery life and a good length selector. All of that would be enough to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature though. Oh that sweet vacuum feature.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying it gets all of the hair, but easily 80% of the hair is sucked up into the little vacuum compartment.&lt;br /&gt;Your wife is tired of you leaving little beard hairs all over the sink, this helps with that. In a way, you&#x27;re getting this for the health of your marriage.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, this is a great trimmer, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This thing sucks. It is large and cumbersome to use. It does not give an even trim (left me looking like a mangy mutt after trimming my beard!). The &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; attachment misses a lot of hair, so you still get hair everywhere. Lastly, does not allow for detailed sculpting without removing the guard completely, which is still hard to use due to the unhandy size. Eff this thing.. wish I had sent it back instead of hoping I would like it. I liked my $20 Whal much better. :P</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer since Dec 2011. Overall I have liked it. Though, recently the battery has had it. A full charge now only lasts a couple minutes. The upside is that the trimmer still functions while plugged in. Something my last trimmer wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Perfect trimmer. Great battery, great use. The trimmer goes down to basically a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> **Updated Review**&lt;br /&gt;Its now been about two years I guess.  Now in order to use the product I have to have it plugged in to start.  Otherwise Its says error and turns off.  If I plug it in and start using it I can unplug it and it continues to work.  But pretty annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should note, it will not catch 100% of the bear hair as you cut it.  But its gets a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;Note sure if I would get the same one again, with how this is my second and now have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First one I got did not work, Amazon took it back and sent me a new one.  Second worked great and still does. Uses twice a week for months now.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a T980 Philips Norelco beard trimmer that was about 6 or 7 years old. This model is more powerful and has better controls. I think the battery is better, but its not fair to compare it against an old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great news. Mine came with two combs. The one that was on the trimmer in the box is the one most people are complaining about. The other one is the contour following comb. Norelco must be listening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only feature I can complain about is the vacuum. It works and is okay, but it is not nearly as effective as the T980. The T980 had a spring-loaded lip this model doesn&#x27;t have. I am guessing it increased the suction on the T980. I would still buy this unit again, even over a new T980 if it was available. I always had to clean up a little hair afterwards and a bit more won&#x27;t make a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution. The door for the compartment holding cut hair protrudes a bit on the right hand side. At first I figured it opened on that side, but pulling it didn&#x27;t do anything. Be sure to open on the other side, I can see that a good pull on the wrong side could break the door.</li>
            <li> Update 2013-06-17:  Product was received in less than 2 days.  The contour comb was included and so far, impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Entry:&lt;br /&gt;Having read so much about the contour comb issue, I chatted with Philips-Norelco and got the following information.  I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars without even laying eyes on the product.  The chat was brief, to the point and satisfactory.  I will come back and update when I receive the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mack: Hello Jim.&lt;br /&gt;Jim: Mack.. I&#x27;m interested in ordering a QT4070/41, but there is a bunch of complaints as to whether the unit comes with a contour comb. Your site shows one, but the manual doesn&#x27;t mention it. On Amazon, the same page shows that it has it and doesn&#x27;t have it. Make sense what I&#x27;m asking?&lt;br /&gt;Mack: I totally understand your concern and will be glad to help you.&lt;br /&gt;Mack: Jim, we have reported this issue and the new QT4070 now includes the contour comb.&lt;br /&gt;Mack: The contour comb is now included with the new QT4070 package.&lt;br /&gt;Jim: Do you think a new amazon order will include it, or would they have inventory dating back before it was included?&lt;br /&gt;Mack: Unfortunately, we do not have that information.&lt;br /&gt;Mack: Jim, you can purchase the unit. If you do not receive the contour following comb then you can contact us and we will replace it for you.&lt;br /&gt;Jim: Sounds good. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Mack: You&#x27;re welcome, Jim.&lt;br /&gt;Mack: Is there anything else that I can help you with today?&lt;br /&gt;Jim: Nope. You were very helpful and spot on. Thanks for the feedback.</li>
            <li> In the past I have almost exclusively used razors to shave.  This has been problematic since I would often get lazy and let my scruff grow out and then trying to shave would not be a pleasant experience.  I received the QT4070 today with a nice mantle of scruff today.  I took it out of the box, popped on the contour head, plugged it in, and was shaving away in just a couple of minutes.  It cut through my scruff with ease and the contour head did a great job of doing it evenly.  For those who have complained about the vacuum not working well I would imagine you had a fairly good beard when you did this.  My first pass left a fair bit of hair in the sink, but this is partially because I filled up the vacuum chamber quickly.  I emptied it and went for another pass with almost no hair flying around the bathroom.  The turbo setting makes this even handier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I would say get this product if you are looking for something that will leave you a little stubble and you are not wanting to do a detail trim.  Also, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the alarming reviews cautioning about the potential to get cut with this product.  I zoomed it around my face on the 1mm setting without a nick or a scratch.  Just use it the way you are supposed to and you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!  You&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Bought it on March 14th, 2015 and it has failed to hold a charge more than a few days at a time; it reads fully charged but the next day it is dead. Because it has been 33 days (3 days past the Amazon 30 day return period), I can&#x27;t return it to Amazon, so now I have to deal with Norelco. Shame I really like the features, it allows me to keep my beard neat and trimmed, and the vacuum works well. I can plug it in, and use it right away after it is dead, but if the battery is failing now, how long can it last? If Norelco is able to replace it with one that works as advertised, I will update this review  with a more favorable rating. But for now I cannot recommend this product.  Got off the phone with Norelco, and they are sending a replacement within 10 days, so I updated this from a 2 to 3 stars. If the replacement works well I will update this again.</li>
            <li> Trimming per say, i do not have any complaints about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to clean up the sink after the trimming so i purchased this product because  the concept of Vacuum Beard interested me. To some extent it really pulls the hair into vacuum chamber while trimming but not as much I expected, I still have to clean up the fallen hair. i guess I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands bday. He has always wanted to have the &amp;#34;perfect stubble&amp;#34; look.. However he has not wanted to pay the price that some of the advertised trimmers cost loves all the options on the settings. He said he would buy the same one all over again. He was also impressed that it came with a charger. that was one feature he was a must. He has had no complaints....and neither have I!! he looks amazing!! he gets compliments all the time! it has made his mornings so fast! the trimmer actually has softened the roughness of his prickly face. He said it does not cut or hurt him and it also goes over dimples and curve lines gently. I could go on and on about what a great product this is...highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> great product! nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer, replaces my old Norelco, but many more features.&lt;br /&gt;Large digital height indicator prevents stupid mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;Love the way it catches clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is quite short in Turbo Mode&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Not good for much else...but it is by far the best beard trimmer I have ever seen...great for goatee too...not so much mustaches...for for a beard...man it is nice. Get it.</li>
            <li> It may be my hair type ( I am a black male ) but this trimmer is horrible. Every time I use it I get a new ingrown hair that gets infected.  I am about to spend more money on probably some clippers and use them on my beard.  They have worked well in the past.  Not sure why these cause the ingrown hair other than they are not powerful enough to keep from pulling and tugging my hair when it cuts it.  Causing the ingrown hair.  I usually would not write a bad review on a product. i just don&#x27;t want anyone else spending $50 or more just to have your face with bumps and infection.</li>
            <li> Very good product @ reasonable price</li>
            <li> In about a year the battery seems to discharge completely if it is jostled too much.  I charged it fully before going on a trip, and when I got there the thing read empty.  It lasts for weeks sitting in my closet.  When I tap the device to empty the hair from the vaccum chamber, the battery goes to empty as well.  The latch on the vacuum chamber door broke within 4 months.  Still it cuts okay, I don&#x27;t want to buy another though.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s easy to use, and you don&#x27;t have to search for guards!  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco vacuum trimmer. I bought my first one back in 2007 (Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer). The rechargeable battery stopped charging about a 1 1/2 years ago, but I kept using it while it&#x27;s plugged in. It just kept getting harder and harder to use. It was basically falling apart after about 6 years (twice a week) of use. I used it both on my beard and my head. Yes, I shave my head with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with two types of guides also. I&#x27;ve read on the reviews that some only got one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this new model is it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel pouch.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just me, but this machine, while aesthetically competent and ergonomic, cannot seem to properly trim my beard. The blades cannot handle the rough bristles. Also, the built in vacuum doesn&#x27;t do a very good job either, and I still have to trim over the restroom sink. I now use a hair cutting machine that&#x27;s much more powerful</li>
            <li> On lowest setting it still does not remove all hair (yes I know it&#x27;s a trimmer and no shaver, but there are many cheaper trimmers out there which do a better job). When you just want to trim you beard to 2mm or more, it works fine! Vacuum function is really useful.</li>
            <li> Works great but vacuum get in the way when trying to line and trim mustache</li>
            <li> i am very happy with the trimmer. Love it. lasts for a very long time and does the job well. no issues over the last several months.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve finally found a solid beard trimmer.  The vacuum collects about 90% of my beard trimmings (makes my wife happy because they no longer clog the sink).  This trimmer cuts evenly and is very easy to use.  I typically go through a trimmer every year.  Let&#x27;s hope this one can last 2 or 3 years!  Also make sure you clean it out after every use or the vacuum suction will be reduced.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking and easy to use trimmer. It fits in the hand nicely and hardly makes any sound when turned on. It has several depth settings for the best trim and is very easy to change those as well. It trims smoothly and evenly and is easy to clean afterwards. The battery power is also very decent with option of plugging in and using as well. Overall, a very good quality product and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> Replaced this with a Remington after the battery gave out; this is a huge improvement in:    * more precise trim  * vacuum feature is great; captures and stores 90% of the shavings  * smooth adjust with a wide array of settings  * only one attachment, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about looking after a bunch of different heads  * look and feel of the device</li>
            <li> works really well but the door doesn&#x27;t stay shut as well as it should</li>
            <li> This charger does not stay charged for very long AT ALL. Especially if you use the turbo feature. I have been put in a jam a couple of times because I was traveling with this and expected it to stay charged. Specifically MY WEDDING. I didn&#x27;t bring the cord and ran out of juice half way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not contour very well around my jaw and leaves areas that are much more uneven than others. I don&#x27;t use this anymore as a result.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t​ do what it claims to do. waste of money</li>
            <li> The vacum feature actually works as long as you are trimming less then a 1/4 inch.  Longer hair gets stuck.  I use it for cutting my hair.  I just wish the battery lasted longer. Also the design is nice but the plastic feels a little cheap (minor gripe).</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!  The only problem is that you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in if the charge is gone.  But on the plus side, it charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but this trimmer only delivered moderate results.    I have been using it for one month and found:  - The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature must be on 100% for this to adequately vacuum/trim my hair..... and even then...  - Any setting longer than \\&quot;3\\&quot;  will result in a VERY uneven beard.   I have tried every trick/suggestion in the book, and have used it as slow as molasses, to no avail  - The door to the hair collection chamber opens anytime I shift/move the trimmer.....wtf?    Maybe I bought a defective unit?  I am surprised that a product with such good reviews can perform so poorly.    What I would like is a vacuum trimmer that can leave me with an EVEN  1/8\\&quot; beard...........the 10 year search continues    If you are looking for very short stubble, this product delivers.... if you want anything even slightly longer... don&#x27;t waste your time/money  I regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> The QT4070/41 beard trimmer is very nice, I like the flexible head attachment and that the length adjustment is very easy to use. The vacuum function makes it so that very few hairs escape during the trimming as well</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not for short dirty looks. Since part of the teeth of the trimmer are uncovered. This makes the teeth be uncovered on one side and cuts the beard to a much shorter trim. In short, the cover on top of the teeth that can be adjusted, is uncovered on one side and is a hassle when your trimming your beard. Not suited for short beards.</li>
            <li> I use this as a body hair trimmer; so I can&#x27;t address some issues people raise with beard trimming, but it works great for my needs.    Turbo vacuum is the reason I use this model instead of a traditional body hair trimmer.  It vacuums up the hair as I use it with no mess to clean up.  It also trims a lot closer than the body groom model.  I tried the 3mm setting with plastic guide against my skin and it felt fine.  Then I tested the 2mm setting and felt a slight scratching of the blade against my skin, but nothing extreme and it cut really close.    This replaces a Remington vacuum trimmer that died after many years.  The Phillips-Norelco turbo vacuum is noticeably more powerful, it cuts a lot closer, has a lithium battery and can be used with the cord.  So I can still use it after the battery dies years from now.  It is sleek, maneuverable and the lighted digital display is cool.  The Remington would not work without a viable battery.     A common complaint regarding the swinging door hair trap wasn&#x27;t a big problem for me.  However, I see how it could easily snap off if you&#x27;re not careful.  It that happens I&#x27;ll have to tape it shut with electrical tape and that will be a nuisance to empty the trap.  Hair does not shake out as easily as with a removable trap, but the little tool brush helps sweep it out.  If there is a lot of hair you can shake it out.  I finished up by sticking a vacuum cleaner hose in there to get all the hair out in a second.    Unfortunately, there are not a lot of products in the vacuum trimmer market.  More competition would lead to greater innovation, but the Phillips-Norelco turbo vac trimmer does a great job for now.</li>
            <li> Trims well but door that holds trimmings is poor. I have bought 2 and both clips that hold the plastic door closed broke within a couple months of use.</li>
            <li> I had the previous model which I would rate 5 stars.  I don&#x27;t believe that it is made anymore.  This model doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as closely and the unit seems lighter and more cheaply made.  Also the old model had a small door on the vacuum assembly which moved up and down on a spring to catch and hold the hair, this model doesn&#x27;t have that door.  That small door was the part that failed on my older unit.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this trimmer.  I like to keep short stubble and this works perfectly.  I have had no problem with the adjustable spacer as previous posts have mentioned.  It says it will go to .5mm, that is true but only if you remove the spacer attachment.  It will go as low as 1mm with the spacer attached.  I use this to stubble trim and use the norelco arcitec razor to shave necks and cheek area where I dont want stubble. All my grooming appliances are Norelco.  I think they have top notch products.</li>
            <li> This maybe the most poorly though out and inadequately tested product that Norelco has ever released.  The major flaw is with the plastic guard that is supposed to cover the blade.  On all previous Norelco trimmer models the plastic completely covers the blade thus preventing the blade from cutting your face.  On this unit, the Norelco engineers clearly decided to add an element of danger to the trimming process by modifying the design of the plastic guard, and thus leaving the blade virtually exposed on the shortest settings.  This had to be done for a reason, because if this unit was properly tested before it was released to consumers, this design flaw would instantly come to light.  Furthermore, the hair that it cuts varies in length depending on how you held the unit at the time of the trim.  The vacuum function on this unit could also use some improvement.  Although it picked up about 90% of the hair, enough hair was left on the bottom of the sink, to require further clean up.  Don&#x27;t buy this unit.  There are better and cheaper units out there, that will trim your stubble without slicing up your face.</li>
            <li> I had a previous model of this shaver, and loved it. A former College roommate of mine stole it while moving out, and I never got around to replacing it until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it because it lets me keep a short stubble. Shaves well without pulling hairs. The vacuum works well to keep a hefty majority of the hair out of the sink. I do wish that the chamber for the cut hairs was removeable for easy dumping, but whatever. The battery is pretty long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars, as it does what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li> Pros --    1) Compact, lightweight, multi-voltage/frequency travel charger    2) Informative digital display with battery charge and length indicators.      Cons --    1) Useless for thick, hard beard hairs:    a) The tines on top of the comb are too soft.  If I don&#x27;t apply pressure, the trimmer just glides on top of my beard, not cutting anything; if I do apply pressure, the tines warp and I get an uneven trim.    b) The vacuum captures only 70% of my trimmings.  Cleaning up the other 30% takes only a little bit less time than cleaning up 100%.    2) The tines on the front of the comb are short in order to leave an opening for the vacuum.  Unfortunately, this means I cannot use them as a guide while trimming.  This also means that I cannot easily trim my upper lip, since my nose blocks the front edge of the guide.    3) The cutting head is much too wide for my average-sized face.    4) With the comb removed, the cutting head still cannot provide a close shave, leaving at least 1mm.  This means I cannot use the trimmer to clean up around my neck.    5) No flip-up detail/moustache trimmer.  Combined with #2, my moustache goes unkempt.      Verdict --    Will try to return this abomination, either to Amazon or to Norelco.  Sticking with my Remington MB 300, with which I have no complaints but for the lack of a multi-voltage charger.</li>
            <li> Not sure it was worth the money I paid for it... Disappointed quite honestly...</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever ordered through Amazon.com, and at a shockingly high price, considering the quality.  It looks cool, and there are fancy digital displays to remind you just which setting you are on, but the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; leaves my beard scraggily and uneven, with hairs that refuse to be cut no matter how slowly, how many times, or in which direction I run the appliance.  I usually have to resort to a pair of scissors to get a neat beard.  Even at the 0mm setting it leaves scraggily hairs. I think a pair of garden shears might give you a better trim than this terrible product.</li>
            <li> Does all that I need and expect.</li>
            <li> THis trimmer is not what I thought. After reading through many reviews, some good and some bad, I decided to try the Norelco. As many other reviewers, I found this unit to be uncomfy to use in that  the guide blade is too sharp and catches your skin.   I also have come to find out that I CANNOT return this unit to Amazon because it was purchased through another vendor. Poor customer service, poor product &#x3D; I&#x27;ll be shopping elswhere.  The search continues.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for 20 days now without being able to get a straight answer out of Philips or their parts department.  Parts Department Says:   The part has been out of stock all of September, it was supposed to be in on September 21st, but it is now September 22nd and now the part shows that it will be available October 6th.  The last person in the parts department told me that the part is now discontinued, and this will be the last shipment they expect to get on the part.  They can place a back-order for $15, but if I want to free part I have to wait until it&#x27;s in stock.  Customer Service Says:  There is no comb.  We&#x27;ve heard of this before but your package is correct.  That part is discontinued (I thought there was no comb?).  They finally placed an order for me for the out of stock part, but told me they don&#x27;t know if it will ever come in, or if I will ever receive it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice trimmer.. I like the way you can adjust the length. .also the build in vacuum is very useful.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Weird thing though is after it is fully charged and only used it once, I put it away and next week when I go to use it, its out of battery. I didn&#x27;t have it near anything to accidently trigger it and drain it. This has happened twice.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t hold this trimmer at a perfect angle on you face, expect some very short patches in your beard. I had to buy a new trimmer after I used this one once because I don&#x27;t want to have to worry about having a bald spot in my beard if I wasn&#x27;t careful enough.</li>
            <li> I love this beard trimmer! It is several upgrades form my last one especially with the lithium battery that makes a huge difference. The suction is much better and really helps with the mess of trimming my beard. Would definitely recommend to any guy with a shorter beard.</li>
            <li> this is brilliant piece of kit if you cant be  botherd to shave just take it down to a five oclock shadow brill. the philips blades dont need cleaning or oiled they stay sharp all the time it also has a great length guide built in and it tells you on the little led display in mm your cut length it also tells when to charge battery witch takes 1 hour for about 10 good shaves. this is a ultimate buy best i ever done do not miss out best stubble cutter ever ps. i forgot to say no mess it cleans its own hairs up through vacume built in brill</li>
            <li> Works great. Use it also to buzz my head</li>
            <li> Based on the large number of negative reviews on here, I called Philips to see if they would be willing to send me the comb that \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t\\&quot; cut or jab you.  The first lady I talked to was awful - she was horribly difficult and said they couldn&#x27;t send one based on \\&quot;one\\&quot; review and just because I asked.  I called back and spoke to somebody else and they were totally nice and able to take care of it for me.    This is an obvious design flaw with this supposedly top model product - the next model down, that comes with the other comb, gets completely great reviews. It was certainly an oversight on Norelco&#x27;s part, and they should certainly be happy and willing to ship out the replacement comb for customers who ask for it.</li>
            <li> The seller was great. I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and it got here on time, i was very pleased. He loves the product, he never gets nicks, the settings are very convenient and the little vacuum keeps the counter clean! Definitely recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical to purchase this beard trimmer because of the reviews regarding the guide comb. The negative comments were frequent and it seemed some people had luck procuring the contour guide from Norelco and a few said they got the right one. I want to report that I received mine yesterday and it came with BOTH guides. The contour one was great &amp; vacuum gets close to 90% of the trimmings. So if anyone is on the fence like I was b/c of the guide comb, hopefully getting both helps your decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel lock is also great as well as the turbo feature. It also charged very quickly and never lost power in the 20 minutes I needed to trim up the beard.</li>
            <li> Shaves close - no pulling.  Really like the ability to adjust the cutting length - price through Amazon was great- you need to look around the web when ordering - really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Paid for itself 10 times over on weekly hair trimmings. Will cover whole head on 1 charge or whole body ymmv. When done in the shower (water off), makes for ridiculously easy cleanup, bonus points if you can reach the can without getting out. DO NOT ABUSE THE DOOR LATCH, USE JUST ENOUGH PUSH TO RELEASE THE DOOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;-cant go from 10cm to 2mm in one go, have to trim in 2mm drops to keep vacuum from clogging&lt;br /&gt;-no way to do tight spots like ear-head joint, use a $15 trimmer there&lt;br /&gt;-no real 0 setting, have to use a razor to trim non-hair zones</li>
            <li> Seriously why is everyone complaining that the product doesn&#x27;t come with the contour following comb... I was really hesitant to buy this because everyone said it doesn&#x27;t come with the comb, so I ordered the extra part from Phillips Norelco before buying the product and it turned out the trimmer came with the contour following comb and the regular comb so now I have 2 contour following combs.</li>
            <li> Works as stated.The only complaint I have is that is is kind of hard to do detailed lines like the edges of my Goat-T.Its just a little hard to see the blades at the angle the are made.That being said,everything else works well.The vacume feature is great and the blades cut well,even on thick beard,as long as you dont let the hair catcher get overfilled.</li>
            <li> I used my Norelco electric trimmer for 10 years before it finally bit the big one and I decided to look for one that was very similar. Well, this was it and it is incredibly lightweight but sturdy enough! The settings are just right, offering many length options and it is a plus to have a vacuum function so hair doesn&#x27;t go everywhere although, it vacuum doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job sucking in the cut hair. It gathers about 60% of it, which is still nice. I don&#x27;t like the way the door opens to empty the vacuumed up hair though but that&#x27;s only minor. I wish that it was like my old one, where the container popped all the way out, but all in an all, it&#x27;s a great trimmer and especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer for almost a month already and think it&#x27;s great.  The trimmer is easy to use and cuts precisely with its multiple adjustments.  The vacuum feature captures the cut hair so there is no clean up.  I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QT4070 is the greatest trimmer I have ever used.  The clever vacuum system keeps the hairs from ending up all over the place so you can use it wherever you happen to be.  I find it much more comfortable not to shave too close and this is the one for me.  Easy to adjust and very quick charging make this #1 in my book.</li>
            <li> I used a conair before this. The stubble look took at least 5 minutes of work because the cut would be uneven. Now, it takes me under a minute and nowhere close to how messy my old system was. The price might force you to look the other way but I really think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It is indeed a good machine: effective, efficient and quick. The only problem is the battery life which, in comparison to other major Philips products, is surprisingly short. The quality of trimming though is reasonable and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months now, and so far it&#x27;s worked very well for me. Mine came with both combs, so switching from the stubble comb to the contour-following one was not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum works much better than the old Wahl model this replaced, which is a relief since there are so few vacuum-equipped models available. Nothing is going to get 100% of the hairs, but this one does really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing of the many stories of the little hair-compartment door breaking, I&#x27;m being very careful when opening and closing that, and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really see the point of \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode, but having it there doesn&#x27;t hurt anything. Also, as some have mentioned, it&#x27;s not much good as a mustache trimmer, as the cutting head is quite wide, but it works well enough for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last forever on a charge, and then recharges in no time, so nothing to complain about there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is keeping my old grey beard in good shape with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a few months now and it really works well. I was a little wary of the vacuum as I thought it might be a gimmick, but in the end I&#x27;ve been really happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the vacuum works surprisingly well.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it gets the vast majority of the hair (a lot better than my last razor without one that threw hair all over the sink and counter). It also keeps the little hair there is relatively in the sink so it&#x27;s an easy clean up. There are two levels of vacuum and I always use the higher level as I don&#x27;t see any reason not to and it really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people before were complaining about the comb that came with the razor - the stubble comb.  Though after a while people started reporting that it now comes with both the stubble comb and the contour comb. I did in fact get both combs. I use the stubble comb and I find it works very nicely. Some people complain that it bends or that there is a gap where you could cut yourself. First, the razor is good enough that you don&#x27;t have to press hard at all to cut so there is no need to bend the comb. Second, I do see how you could cut yourself, as I almost did one day (got a pinch on the lip), but again I was in a rush and wasn&#x27;t paying attention and got my lip right in between the comb and the razor at a bad angle.  From now on I&#x27;ll be more careful. I have also used the contour comb and it works well but I don&#x27;t use it as much as I keep close stubble and the stubble comb works just fine.  Some people complain that the length of the comb varies on the contour comb but this isn&#x27;t the case as the shortest length of the comb (from the razor to the tips of the comb) is constant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get up under the nose. As I keep short stubble, it&#x27;s particularly hard. It&#x27;s possible but takes a bit of work to get the blades close right under the nose. The rest of the mustache is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the razor. I don&#x27;t have a beard and just keep stubble and I find this razor is perfect for that. There are many nice features - from it telling you the length, long battery life, travel lock, &amp;c. It&#x27;s a really fast razor and easy clean up so shaving can be done while I wait for the shower to heat up.</li>
            <li> Works great. The only downside I have come across is the door to empty shavings didn&#x27;t close tightly. Then shortly after the plastic piece that held it close broke off. Now it just kind of stays almost closed until I empty it. Please, redesign the closing mechanism.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a goatee man and was looking for something to keep it trim while also being able to pull off that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look by putting a close trim across the rest of my face. I had used cheap trimmers and some of those interchangeable numbers (does anybody ever really use the nose trimmer adapter?) and wanted to step up my game a bit.  In this regard, this trimmer has been wonderful.  My only complaint has been with the vacuum feature  It sits above the blades and doesn&#x27;t police all of the trimmings.  If you&#x27;re hoping to have a mess-free trim, it doesn&#x27;t quite cut it (sorry, bad pun).  I also find that the location of the vacuum makes it harder to judge where the blades are when trying to get in close around my goatee and sideburns.  These complaints are minor, though, and I still consider this to be one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Strong trimmer (doesn&#x27;t bog down through my thicker facial hair)&lt;br /&gt; - Adjustable length with digital display make to find and maintain a consistent trim&lt;br /&gt; - Holds a charge for a long time and a digital display of battery life has an indicator for low charge&lt;br /&gt; - 1/32 in trim gives a great 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Vacuum gets in the way and doesn&#x27;t help much&lt;br /&gt; - Tends to discharge while traveling (not sure if it&#x27;s kicking on or if it&#x27;s something else but I&#x27;ve had bad luck)</li>
            <li> Trimmer makes me more handsomer. But only for a little while. Then I use again.</li>
            <li> works very well  GREAT BUY</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is why this was purchased --- and it performs beautifully.</li>
            <li> Works great, easily adjustable, and it is very easy to clean up</li>
            <li> I love it because my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t make a mess with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend complains that it needs emptied multiple times during one shave session (he uses it on setting 10 to trim his beard) but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a big deal.  He does love how it doesn&#x27;t slide down to a different length easily thus it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;mistake-proof&amp;#34; than previous trimmers he has owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the trimmer about five times now.  It does an excellent job.  It&#x27;s very easy to change the length setting.  The battery charges quickly and holds the charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to order the version that contains the contoured guide as well as the original guide.  The original is poorly designed; the contoured version is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer overall.&lt;br /&gt;The down sides:&lt;br /&gt;1. There is no way to turn off the vacuum option.&lt;br /&gt;2. The charging cable doesn&#x27;t hold itself too strongly when connected, so it can very easily get disconnected when charging.</li>
            <li> Okay trimmer for the money. The vacuum is nice and does well with getting most of the hair. My biggest complaint is it isn&#x27;t ideal for trimming the upper lip...almost impossible. Also if you&#x27;re looking to line up your facial hair, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if I were to buy another trimmer again, I&#x27;d keep looking.</li>
            <li> Better than the older model I replaced</li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s beard and stubble trimmer is clean. This maintenance free trimmer includes a vacuum system that captures cut hair, keeping the mess off the bathroom counter and in the sink. For that reason, both my wife, and I, like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the attachments, it cuts from 1/32 inch to 23/32 inch, making it easy to keep your beard trim, or to maintain that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. There are 18 secured length settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turbo power boost increases the cutting and fan speed, and it contains a powerful lithium-ion battery, giving it a long life. It can be used with or without the cord. It also features a travel lock so that it won&#x27;t accidently get turned on when you&#x27;re traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes with a two year warranty. This razor is the perfect indulgence for the man who wants a quick-charging mustache/beard/stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> Compared to any other trimmer on the market, I venture to say this is the most superior.  I have owned at least 4 different types, including another Norelco.  By any comparison, this product exceeds my expectations and makes other trimmers look like garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a pleasure to hold and seems ergonomically designed.  The build quality is very solid- to the point of impressive.  Adjusting the trimmer is accomplished via a rubber coated adjustment wheel that is accessible on both sides of the trimmer.  There are length indicators on the side vertically (a scale in inches) and the adjustment size displays on the LCD screen in millimeters.  This provides a precise cut to those who require such precision (not me).  The width of the blade area is more than sufficient for face and other areas (more on that later). Touted as a Vacuum trimmer, it does a pretty good job overall with some room for improvement as it may not vacuum all hair although that may depend on the length of hair being cut. Hair collects in a little compartment with a swing door.  The trimmer is rechargeable (a stand is not included however- just the charger).  Despite being rechargeable, the trimmer is very powerful, easily cutting through thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Issues&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated before,  the vacuum does a decent job, but not a great job at collecting hair.  The shorter the hair, the better the job.  At the very least, it seems to significantly contain the mess.  Another issue is that due to the design of the blade guard, you cannot really trim right up under the nose.  It gets pretty close, but not quite.  Finally, neither a beard brush, travel case, or recharger stand are included.  I was a little surprised in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unable to comment at this time on how long the battery will last. I will have to edit my review after a few months to see how the charge stands up.</li>
            <li> My husband promptly \\&quot;handed down\\&quot; his old beard and mustache trimmer when I gave him this one.  He says it trims everything better than his old one and he loves the vacuum feature on this unit. The vacuum provides terrific ease of use and keeps everything neat and tidy.  The compartment is easy to empty.  The trimmer is easy to adjust with length measurements listed in both mm and increments of an inch as well as an LED number setting.  The unit charges easily and quickly.  Great product!</li>
            <li> My husband has a beard longer than the maximum trim length of this shaver, but, since he does cut his sideburns and shave his neck (or, rather, lets me do so), and since his 20-year old Norelco is getting very tired, I figured this was a good tool to try out for the job.    The shaver is very clean and sleek - it fits comfortably in the hand, has a cord that attaches to its bottom, not someplace inconvenient like a side (you can use it plugged in or not), and the controls are intuitive. My only objection to its form-factor is that the thing is LOUD. This is not so much because of the blades, however, as because of the powerful vacuum that sucks the hair into the cutting blade.    To change the cut depth, you rotate a thumb-friendly control that both physically raises and lowers the removable guard, and also lights up a large and easy-to-see LED readout that gives the depth in millimeters. (If it&#x27;s possible to change that to inches I never figured out how). The current depth setting is also indicated by two small rulers on the sides of the guard - right side metric, left side inches. For some bizarre reason the setting between 3/8 inch and 5/8 inch is \\&quot;15/32\\&quot;, not 4/8, and the longest depth is 23/32, not 6/8. I assume some engineer translated the millimeters into the closest inch measurement, and didn&#x27;t think about tolerances and usability.    I found that for very short whisker lengths this worked very well - it took off the hairs cleanly and quickly, with just a couple of strokes (I had to play with the orientation a bit - you need to stroke with the closed part of the guard forward, not the open side, or you&#x27;ll get choppy results). For longer lengths (taking sideburns from two inches to 23/32) I had to start off with a scissors and then use the shaver to even things out, which wasn&#x27;t worth it. The shaver also ignored hubby&#x27;s mustache completely, even on turbo, but the hair there is very stiff and lies flat, so it wasn&#x27;t cooperative about being sucked into the guard. I finally took the guard off and used the shaver freehand. I found the shaver to be quite easy to clean, using the included cleaning brush (I wish there was a way to attach this to the powercord, like a chuck key with a drill).    For short neat beards that get shaved regularly this is recommended. For longer ones that get trimmed once a month or so it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but still useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of gimmicky products, so I was a bit nervous when I bought this. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve been impressed. It actually does what it says, which is rare these days it seems.    The accuracy of the different settings is quite good. I was able to get an extremely close to the skin stubble with this at its closest setting.    The vacuum works surprisingly well. It picks up virtually all the cut hair, and the tiny amounts it doesn&#x27;t get is pretty trivial. It&#x27;s a vast improvement over what I&#x27;m used to dealing with; it&#x27;ll be hard to go back to a non-vacuum product after this. The only thing is you might have to clean it out in the middle of the shave, depending on how much hair you are trimming; but all it takes to clean it is popping it open and giving a few hard blows into the chamber. It takes about 5-10 seconds to do.</li>
            <li> Bought this as gift for my husband. He loves it!</li>
            <li> The trimmer seems to be well made, and will probably last quite a while. And I haven´t had to charge it yet, so that side is ok.  However, for getting my beard trimmed I have to remove the plastic part that tells how long the beard should be, totally. And trimming directly with the metallic head works, but is not very pleasant - and the result could be better.  Still looking for a working solution....</li>
            <li> Product as described.Works great!</li>
            <li> the Philips Turbo does it all itself.  the height adjustment is merely a twist, nothing to clip on - nothing to lose. the turbo sucks in almost all the bits and pieces, which i wife truly appreciates. and i think i look great. my wife doesn&#x27;t, but she doesn&#x27;t like beards. when the time comes to cut it off, i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll be using this great shaver to do that job too.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Best feature is lithium battery. Worth the money. Turbo button is great, it actually makes vacuum collection work! Excellent cutting blade, as you would expect but the speed makes big difference. The collection door looks fragile. If you drop it, it will probably brake. It is not an all in one product. If you want stubble, it is perfect. If you want lines and detail work it is not. But for what it is designed for it is the best I ever had. And it does collect shavings very nicely, very easy to empty. I love it.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought I would get this. I use the shortest setting (removed the guide)  After getting the feel for this (2days) I got the hang of it and it actually feels good to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; with it.  Very low setting, like I like it. I don&#x27;t use the super vacuum that is built in to collect the cuttings but I have tried it, and it is noisy! Comfortable, feels good, cuts good. It is what I was expecting and hoping for.  The only downfall, the cost. I have seen so many other units its for so much less money, but I have no idea if they would perform like this one. Overall very satisfied. I just hate parting with my money.</li>
            <li> All around, this is a pretty good trimmer. I&#x27;m not unhappy with it. But it is not quite as advertised:  1) Unless your mustache grows nowhere near your nose, you&#x27;re going to have a difficult time getting the trimming blades to the top of your mustache. The guard gets in the way, and even without the guard, the cutting head is not designed to get in that area easily.   2) This is messy--I call b.s. on the \\&quot;without leaving a mess in the sink\\&quot; line. It&#x27;s much cleaner than other trimmers, but it&#x27;s just impossible for a battery-operated, tiny vacuum system to catch all the hairs. You will still have to clean out your sink afterward.   Other than that, the dial-operated hair-length control is nice; it&#x27;s easy to clean out the hair collection chamber; and it keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works great, love the vac feature, as does my wife who was tired of cleaning out the sink.  Doesn&#x27;t get everything but definitely eliminates the mess and trims very well.</li>
            <li> Had to replace an older model that would not hold a charge any longer.  This new model is very powerful and I like the length calibrations.  A smooth precise trim.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to friends who have beards.</li>
            <li> Average product, do the job but not with the expected precision, detail trim doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Look for something better, worth to pay a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Vacuum chamber a plus.</li>
            <li> Barely cuts. Can&#x27;t see where I&#x27;m shaving because of terrible design.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it holds a good charge and the vacuum works pretty good in it</li>
            <li> Not very user friendly. It does not contour well to your face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this Trimmer!  I have owned Philips Norelco beard trimmers since they first came out and this one does not deserve the name.    The biggest problem with this trimmer is the fact that no matter how you hold the trimmer, as you would any other trimmer, it \\&quot;nips\\&quot; your skin every time.  A clean, even shave is impossible to obtain.  I went back to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head for nearly 18 years and this is one of the best, most reliable, and what I most appreciate, the low maintenance and ease of clean-up.  Simply throw a few paper towels in the sink and you are good to go.  Great battery life, long cord, cuts well.  Nice!!  I would highly recommend this for self-shavers and others alike.</li>
            <li> works great ,cuts nice and battery last a long time</li>
            <li> My husband used it once when he first got.  He didn&#x27;t use it for a year because he wanted a shaggy beard.  Now a year later we have tried to recharge it is completely dead.  Very disappointed in this expensive thing.  Trouble is I gave one to our son also.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve gotten 5 start from me except if doesn&#x27;t come with a travel case.  Otherwise, it is perfect for everyday trimming.</li>
            <li> Works good, could be more powerful</li>
            <li> This trimmer is excellent. The vacuum feature works so well. I can&#x27;t stress that enough. The LED display is just magnificent and the turn-dial works perfect. I love the fact that it tells you what length your going to cut at on the LED display. It&#x27;s quiet and the battery life is awesome. I haven&#x27;t tried turbo mode yet because I have no need for it but it&#x27;s a neat addition.</li>
            <li> Definitely be cautious when reading the negative reviews about the trim guide on this trimmer.  It is different, but if you slide the guide along your face instead of trying to stuff your chin into the blade slot, you will have a much more comfortable experience.    This trimmer is a little different from the previous model(980 I think), which by the way I loved until the day it found it&#x27;s way into my toilet...still ran it just was never the same!  The QT4070 has a strong motor, a more durable cover for the clippings catcher, and the digital display for battery and height is awesome. Plus the lack of springs and hinges on the guide will make this trimmer survive my poor luggage packing as well! Mustn&#x27;t forget the travel lock!  A great addition to keep the trimmer from draining itself en route to your destination.    I have a pretty tough beard and this little guy made short work of it, neat as a pin!    All in all I think if you can adapt your trimming stroke to the new guide you will be very happy with this trimmer...oh and don&#x27;t try to drown it!</li>
            <li> Just got this about a month ago, used it several times...  At first i was disappointed by the vacuum, but after I started emptying it more frequently during the shave, I became decently impressed by how much it actually keeps off of the counter...  The levels are fairly satisfying as well, you can keep a decently long beard tame with this thing, so kudos to PN on this one...  We&#x27;ll see how it does in the long run, but for now you got my stars...</li>
            <li> Hard to find item in local stores.  Been using this item for many years and want to continue to but it when need a new one.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer, I was pesimistic at first as to how effective and well it would work, but wow this thing is great!  Easy to use, the vacuum system gets nearly all the hairs, charge lasts long, the variable beard/stubble length settings work great too.    Highly recommend this, but it is the first and only one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> i bought tht month ago, and im very satisfied with its abilities, its not 100% vacum the cut hair, but its very convient for everything else, and it does a perfect and smooth job with trimming with sizes...</li>
            <li> I very rarely write reviews; but the Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silver is certainly a PRO which needed reviewing.    I bought a Wahl as a back up in case the Phillips did not live up to my expectations.     All I can say is that the Wahl is now being gifted to someone.     The Phillips Norelco turned out to be close to perfect. I can honestly say I have never had a groomer that worked so perfect. Each hair the same length.     Now, there are flaws; but the flaws lay in the directions included with the product (or rather not included). Also, many reviewers before me seem to be selective readers.    1. The product does what it is suppose to do with no flaws. However, you can make it have flaws through usage. This goes with any product.    2. Yes, the guard can poke your lips as the tips are pointed (as posted by a reviewer). But, only if a person decides to use force/pressure. For example; you can have a needle to your skin and not feel it, but put force/pressure and you will. It is the same with the pointed guard (the guard is not sharp as a needle - I was just giving an example). It is designed not for use with force/pressure, instead let the machine glide and do the work.    3. For me the Philips Norelco Qt4070 is designed to do the work, by placing no force/pressure on the machine. I simply glide the Philips Norelco Qt4070 over my beard. The guard comb is flexible. It is designed to adapt to the chin area and curves on a face. Again, if you put force you will (IMO) have problems. Basically, if you choose a hair level and put force, the hair will be shorter than the level chosen. If you place no force, the hair will be the level you choose.    4. For those of us who have facial hair since we could grow it; we know that hair does not grow in one direction. It grows in many directions. So sometimes to get every hair the right length you need to find the angle/s that is/are right for you. For me, I find using themachine with the hair grain as oppose to against the hair grain works amazing. If I go against is is too short (for me).    5. The vacuum cleaning door does not close as securely as I would like it to close. It has open from time to time. But, a little tape in the corner helps.    6. Do not expect to find a product that does all you expect when it comes to facial grooming. No product will meet all your expectations. But, the Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, sure does come close.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this so far. Battery life is holding and the vacuum does help clean up. It is a little louder than previous models than inhale used but that was expected with the vacuum.</li>
            <li> Not bad - but not the best. I had never had a trimmer with a vacuum - and now having it for a couple of week - I really do not need. I was fine with out it and while it does keep the sink clean - I cleaned my sink after each use. I primarily use this for trimming my head - bald head...this is why it get 4 instead of 5 stars. The vacuum works well during a traditional position, but when using it to keep a close cut on your head - the intake obviously gets clogged. No fault of the trimmer, but I should have thought this through before purchasing. I had an old Philips Norelco beard trimmer and it was perfect, being 8 years old, it was time to let it rest. I should have bought an actual head trimmer, something I am likely to do later after my tax return. Again, for traditional beard and mustache - it does work as described!</li>
            <li> I bought this item purely based on the feedbacks. Though there were some negative comments most of them said the product is so good.    I currently have Norelco T1000 and bought this for stubble trimming and mustache trimming. I also heard this is a modified version  of Norleco T1000. If that is so, then this is a best example of how engineers can screw up a great product into an useless on.    I tried this for stubble trimming and mustache trimming. This good for nothing. I threw this away and back to my old Norelco T1000.    Don&#x27;t buy this based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this yet, and once I have more information about it I will but I had to share this first.  I am coming from a T970 which I enjoyed using for a couple years now, and one of the features I was sad to be losing was that the t970 came with a special detail trimming head if you remove the guide.  I&#x27;m overjoyed to tell anyone else that liked this item that the detail head from the t970 fits and works on this the QT4070!!  YES!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update with full review after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> It works great and was priced right. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancé and it was great UNTIL IT DIED on him JUST ONE MONTH into using it. It seemed like a lot of R&amp;D went into making this product innovative and easy to use, but what&#x27;s all of that worth if it&#x27;s just going to stop working so soon?  First the display started showing inaccurate information (ie battery level) and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn off until it died completely and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on at all. Now even when plugged in nothing shows up on the display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I am unable to return it because the 30 day window has ended so now we are stuck with a broken item. It is a pity because he really liked it while it worked.</li>
            <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t work well.      The problem is that this thing doesn&#x27;t trim evenly, and you end up looking like a clown.      Let alone that the prongs on the comb bend easily...the bigger problem is that the comb&#x27;s prongs don&#x27;t actually cover the blades.  It&#x27;s designed that way so that the little built-in vaccuum cleaner can easily suck up the hairs.  Unfortunately, it compromises the results on your face.      Even when I very carefully try to hold the trimmer in a consistent manner across my beard, I end up with a very uneven trim.  And it ends up looking ridiculous, which means I have to re-trim all over again at a shorter length than I wanted.    I bought this trimmer because I liked the fact that it had 18 different length settings.  And it&#x27;s an all-in-one device.  It doesn&#x27;t have a million combs.  You just adjust the length with a nob, and presto.  Just like my old trimmer.  You don&#x27;t lose any pieces, because it&#x27;s just one piece, and it&#x27;s super convenient for traveling.    But it does a horrible job at trimming.  I don&#x27;t need the stupid vaccum-function, which compromises the results on your face.    I regret having bought this.</li>
            <li> Just as I found on the internet reviews, consistent, powerful, accurate.  I like how it puffs out my beard as a real beard.</li>
            <li> Great vacuum works as advertised but cannot use easily to cut around ears or trim sideburns</li>
            <li> If you want the stubble look, this is the razor for you. No complaints, great price.   When mine breaks, I&#x27;ll buy another one. :-)</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer does have some nice features, like the length of cut setting and digital display.  But when it comes to trimming your beard the adjustable cut length comb flexes and actually allows the blade to take gouges out of your beard.  You have to be very careful when using it.  Had I known this, I would have purchased a different model Norelco with a different comb.</li>
            <li> Used all the time.  Trims well.  Recommended</li>
            <li> It helps me trim my facial hair real nice like. Good value.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a nice touch</li>
            <li> I purchased this after I dropped my T980/60 and broke the guide. The QT4070/41 comes with two guards, one has an opening that&#x27;s kinda sharp, and one that&#x27;s closed and smooth. It does what it&#x27;s intended to do as far as trimming. If you&#x27;re trimming a lot of hair the vacuum port tends to clog up, which isn&#x27;t a big deal. My problem with this trimmer is the door latch. It&#x27;s rather flimsy. Mine broke shortly after I got it.  Now I have to use tape to keep the door closed. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to fix or replace the door itself.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a very modern, sleek looking device with a digital readout of the guide height in millimeters (and analog scales on opposite sides of the guide that indicate guide height in both mm and inches).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The removable guide is a very nice feature, as it can be easily removed by pulling straight off of the trimmer from any height setting, and when placed back on the trimmer, is still at the last height you dialed in.  Very well implemented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum mostly works - if you&#x27;re trimming over a sink, you&#x27;ll still see some hair trimmings in the bowl, but far, far less than if you use a trimmer without a vacuum.  Opening the door in the front of the trimmer allows a puffy little hairball to fall right out, without spreading trimmings all over the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought the two buttons controlled the trimmer and the vacuum features, respectively, but upon closer inspection of the manual, it appears that one is a power button (activating both trimmer and vacuum), and the other is a \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button, increasing the power to both the trimmer and the vacuum.  Like anyone presented with the option, I went straight for turbo mode and never looked back, and so far haven&#x27;t seen any diminution of indicated battery power after half a dozen uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the manual, you can use the trimmer when plugged in, even if the battery is dead, so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge if you&#x27;ve drained the battery and you need a trim in a hurry - it will suspend battery charging while you use it off of AC power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included double-ended cleaning brush seems suited for the task of brushing out the screen in the vacuum debris chamber, but also looks as though it will be easy to lose.  It would have been nice if there were some way of integrating it into the trimmer; but there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Norelco elctric razors since the early 80&#x27;s, so I had high hopes for the Philips Norelco Qt4070/41 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro. My hopes were not given over to disappointment, and I was met with a product that not only met, but exceeded my expectations. This trimmer can be used either corded or cordless, and for me, even on it&#x27;s normal setting, it does a fantastic job trimming hair, and keeping any trimmings cleany vacuumed into it unit&#x27;s storage compartment. I simply do not need turbo mode, though I admit I am not a person with thick or coarse hair growth. I can see Turbo mode being a handy feature for the hairier mammals of our species, however.     Battery charge life is long, and charge time is relatively short, around an hour from a dead battery to full charge, and numerous trimmings between charges. The LCD display shows battery level, as well as trim length setting, and there are length index marks along the side of the trimmer as well, a nice feature if the LCD ever goes on the fritz.     The size is easy to grip, not too small to feel awkward, and not to large to feel clumsy. In fact, it is a nice size to trim and neaten bearded areas other than the face, for those who are so inclined, without worry of clipper heads pinching any skin, they are well designed and simply do their job without risking any minor blood loss from the dreaded clipper bite other trimmers can give. While there is no mention of this practice in the accompanying literature, nor does Philips Norelco endorse or mention such use of this trimmer for that anywhere on their website that I can find, it is still a very capable tool that I have found fit for the job.    I was also surprised at how quiet and relatively minor the the vibration was of this trimmer, given how powerful and effective this little trimmer is. The trimmer comes with a little brush to clean it up with when you are finished using it, and for those who travel, there is a travel-lock that prevents the unit from accidently being bumped on during travel. Simply hold down the power button for a few seconds to lock and unlock this feature.    Overall a very rugged and well thought out device, worthy of anyones grooming arsenal.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very good looking, comfortable to hold and holds a charge for a really long time. It even has a vacuum that sucks up most of the hair. I would have given it 5 stars but since it doesn&#x27;t suck up all of the hair, I feel it could be slightly improved. I do like the fact that I use it to trim my beard ( I got with a 2 mm for sexy stubble) twice each week and I only have to charge it about once every 2 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this to a friend who also purchased one and is happy with it. I think for the price, you wont find a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is a God-send. I love how easy it is to adjust the guard, the power is great, the vacuum is great, and I look like Ryan Gosling now. Highly recommended! I&#x27;m even telling all my friends about it!</li>
            <li> I like this beard trimmer because it shaves so close -- 1/32 of an inch. Looks like I have one day&#x27;s growth, which is the way my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> Read one revue stating that the QT4070 does not contain the \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot;. At first I was turned-off by this remark for an item in this price category. This is not true! Maybe the first models that Norelco sold did not contain this comb. Reading another revue the person stated he bought the QT4070 recently and it did indeed contain the \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot;. This review sold me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job on Norelco&#x27;s part to correct this problem. Well done guys for listening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it from Amazon, and as stated, the Norelco QT4070 now has BOTH COMBS! I also value the travel lock, and the built-in-vacuum feature is great. I found no problem as long as you are careful with the vacuum door and try not to force it open. It opens easy with just a finger nail to open the door. I find the QT4070 a luxury, and high-end trimmer, and ideally delivers for the additional price. I receive a smoother and even cut, with a cleaner sink and counter. Charging the battery is quick and keeping its battery charge longer than most is appreciated. Also having a clear digital readout is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first stubble and beard trimmer to obtain that stylist, stubble look that is popular now for us men. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a fantastic stubble and beard trimmer from a well respected name in this category.</li>
            <li> I had the older model Philips Norelco vacuum trimmer that finally died after 5 years of regular use (pieces just started falling apart). This newer model is much better. I haven&#x27;t used it on a beard yet because I keep my facial hair shorter these days, but it gives a perfect length of stubble on the lowest setting. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t have the .5mm setting it said, but it gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase! Charges in an hour! Great results and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess in the sink &#x3D;)  Update: It seems that the battery is not holding the charge anymore, which kind of sucks since it doesn´t have two months. Let me see what happens.</li>
            <li> The product was received on time, as promised.  And I have to say that this razor is awesome!  The battery life is also absolutely remarkable, as I have not recharged it once yet.  No cuts; no nicks; no errors!!</li>
            <li> Everything shipped as promised and a great trimmer</li>
            <li> Have been using a Norelco T970 for the last 8 years.  The battery finally quit so I tried to replace, however, it seems as though there was another problem with the shaver(canned it). I then bought the QT4070 knowing, (after reading the reviews), that I would have to have the same spring loaded comb as my old T970 and the QT4050. After receiving the new QT4070 I tried the stock comb and agreed with the reviews that it was a bit dangerous if you were not careful. The next day I called Philips Norelco, explained what I wanted and she said no problem, it is on it&#x27;s way.  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Every single man should own this product. I&#x27;ve bought two already and will buy more when X-mas rolls around. All recipients of this gift have told me they didn&#x27;t know what they did before having it. The vacuum works great, and creates the perfect 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, which every man should have.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco has hit a homerun with this model! At first I was leery about some of the reviews of this trimmer.    I had the previous model of this trimmer and this new model definitely addressed the deficiencies. This is the best trimmer I have ever had. I use it daily to trim my head hair. I no longer need clippers!    The new comb head on this trimmer is fantastic. I use it daily instead of normal combing and forego the 1 to 2 week haircut I would otherwise need. The device locking mechanism is unique and effective. The larger display is very welcome. And the new adjustment ring is much less prone to inadvertent change of trimmer comb head setting. It has a low noise output (comforting). Battery power lasts between 1 to 2 weeks without needing recharge, even with daily use.    The key to this trimmer is to use it daily. Then the trimmings are more easily picked up by the moderate suction. The suction is adequate if the trimmings are not too large. The cutting action is excellent and precise.    Back in the 1950&#x27;s my dad had a wire comb contraption with razor blades in it. He used it to groom my brother and I. Ouch!!! It pulled and hurt quite a bit and produced uneven results even though the razor settings were adjustable. The idea was novel; but the technology was woefully deficient. Norelco&#x27;s QT4070 has changed all that. The technology has arrived! No more pulling! And it has precision grooming!    However, nothing is perfect. The only detractor is the missing trim head for fine detail work that the previous trimmer had. I use that trim head on the QT4070 also, because it does fit. But, the trimmer shuts off if you try to use this fine trim head in Turbo mode. But, it works fine without being put into Turbo Mode.    Norelco should provide that fine trim head. I see elsewhere in here that others note the same complaint.    I have recouped the cost of this trimmer already by the haircuts I haven&#x27;t needed. By the way, I have removed my beard and mustache. So, Ijust use this for haircuts now. I use Norelco&#x27;s shaver for my face. Never a nick, no razor bumps, nice comfortable and clean shave.    The QT4070 is well worth the purchase but the fine trim head should be included, especially for those that did not have the previous model. And, it would have been perfect if a carry case had been included. I believe that for the price, these two items should have been included. Philips Norelco missed the opportunity to be in the \\&quot;untouchable\\&quot; category as far as other competitors are concerned. However, I still rate them as the best of the best.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the Vacuum Beard Trimmer. I had it&#x27;s predecessor and when I couldn&#x27;t buy the replacement power supply, I took the chance and picked up the updated model.  Lot&#x27;s better!  Does the job very nicely in trimming and capturing the stubble.</li>
            <li> I have this trimmer since last summer, it works fine and does it&#x27;s job very well, reason I give it 2 stars is battery life, which lasts 10 minutes maximum, with turbo on 5 minutes, I don&#x27;t know it is mine only like this or others also have same problem, but I am very dissapointed with battery life, I thought first that after few charges it will improve but it is same battery meter lines just drops and have to recharge it again, so I have to use it plugged most of the time.</li>
            <li> I lost my Norelco T980 a couple of weeks ago and I was dismayed to discover it was out of production. I purchased the QT4070 this evening and after using it I&#x27;m absolutely dismayed at the design of the guard. The gap is wide enough that you WILL maul your upper lip when attempting to trip your mustache! Also the prongs dig into the skin when trimming from the neck toward the cheek. I have a very heavy beard so I have to pass over the same area a couple of times due to the thickness of my hair. It was an extremely unpleasant experience. I&#x27;ve had numerous Norelco Beard Trimmers over the years and I&#x27;ve always been happy with the design however the QT4070 is a production FAIL!</li>
            <li> I actually do love it. Several years ago, it would be impossible to get a charging (with high charge), adjusting height, affordable beard trimmer. Now &#x3D; here it is! No need to carry those stupid attachments, instead it&#x27;s right on this thing! The charge holds for a few hours, and it stays within the machine for a few weeks without loosing charge, so that&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li> works well, good trimming, with adjustable length of cut,but vacumn effect ois mediocre</li>
            <li> I decided to order this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and after reading Justin&#x27;s review I immediately called Norelco to order the Contour Comb from the QT 4050 so I could include it with the gift.  They were very helpful and ordered the part for me with no problems!  I did not have to speak to a supervisor as some others have had to do, and the whole process took about 5 minutes.  The girl said they have had tons of calls for this, so she knew exactly what part I was talking about.  For all info on part numbers and phone numbers, see Justin Tentil&#x27;s review below!</li>
            <li> Good razor, but over-priced and useless features. Probably would opt for a lower-end device if I were to repurchase as there really isn&#x27;t much difference. A trimmer is a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start off with the positive:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Decent battery life&lt;br /&gt;- Even trim/shave&lt;br /&gt;- sleek look (sans hideous red length selector)&lt;br /&gt;- adjustable guard&lt;br /&gt;- includes BOTH guards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- overpriced. Basic functions and results as $20 version&lt;br /&gt;- useless vacuum. Unless held 100% upright the hairs all fall out.&lt;br /&gt;- not waterpr</li>
            <li> Been looking everywhere for one of these with the vacuum attached. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is completely useless. The beard remains uneven no matter how many times you go over it but wait! you can&#x27;t even use it for a long time because it scratches your skin, and the metal teeth get so hot that burns you. That is not all, the vacuum system is uneffective even if you have  a short beard. I&#x27;m so unhappy with this thing, please AVOID THIS TRIMMER!</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is great! Does a fantastic job on the face and no more messy clean-ups. Go get one!</li>
            <li> This thing is the biggest piece of crap. Extremely ineffective. The guard isnt accurate at all. The \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; is extremely inneffective. There is no fine trimming feature. You&#x27;re MUCH better off buying a pair of clippers like a barber uses.</li>
            <li> 3 star rating for the &amp;#34;best one so far&amp;#34;? I know, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works well. I read elsewhere the vacuum function was &amp;#34;a joke&amp;#34; but I think it works great (my model might be newer/revised). The trimmer guide and wheel are well built, and I like the overall sturdiness of the product. I LOVE that it works when plugged in—others don&#x27;t do this, I don&#x27;t understand it all; having previous trimmers die mid-shave results in some questionable last minute facial-hair style choices/compromises.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things I don&#x27;t care for on this though. First: it&#x27;s easy to &amp;#34;override&amp;#34; the guide lengths. You can go from, say, setting 3&#x27;s length to setting 2&#x27;s length with the wrong angle/pressure. The guide on this does seem different to previous trimmers I&#x27;ve tried, though I can&#x27;t compare directly now, so maybe this is all in my head, but then again…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, trimming up to the bottom of my nose is tough. I have angle this thing in every way—we&#x27;re talking X, Y, and Z axis adjustments, here! I don&#x27;t do any hairline or detailed trimming/edging, but I suspect I could not get the John Water&#x27;s stache&#x27; with this device.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said the guard wasn&#x27;t right, but as stated earlier, all are shipping with the new and old guard, so you can change them as you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum doesn&#x27;t get all the hair (I&#x27;d estimate 50%) but that&#x27;s 50% less you have to clean up around the sink.  The neat part about the vacuum is that it pulls the hair away from your skin, which actually makes it easier to get a good shave on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using this trimmer, I would recommend it to anyone looking for something easy to use and effective.  The position displayed on the little screen is a nice plus.</li>
            <li> Just what ti was looking for use it to shave over A month and still half power on the battery best i have had</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a safety razor because it irritates my skin too much, but I was also tired of using draino every few months to clean up after the clippers. This thing is great! I wish the vacuum was a bit more powerful, but I&#x27;m sure that would&#x27;ve pushed the portability and noise levels to the limits of this structure. Overall a very good product!</li>
            <li> You will look forward to shaving with this trimmer.  This trimmer is life-changing and no man who wears stubble daily should have to live without this.  If you can read this - you can afford to look at a computer and therefore can afford this trimmer.  Not in the least overpriced.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> My older Norelco T7500 was a reliable companion for many years.  Simple and highly useful.  Finally the second rechargable battery failed and even plugging it would not revive it.  Concluded it was time for a new one.  I discounted the vacuum feature but the price for this model was attractive so I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed.  I only have a mustache to trim so my experience may not be as useful as full-faced beard users but for me the trimmer works well and the vacuum features works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Philips-Norelco user for well over thirty years and this unit will continue that loyalty.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not up to par. Was bought about a year ago and the batt no longer holds a charge. The vacume door is ready to break very disapointing  They should of kept making the old T- 980 it was much better made. Hope this comment helpful to others</li>
            <li> Best damn electric trimmer I have ever had!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect perfection with a product like this. A little battery-powered machine isn&#x27;t going to be able to suck up all the clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this trimmer works extremely well.  Most of the hair ended up in the bin with about 80% less trimmings in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the measured guide for trimming was extremely effective and provided an even trim all around - I have trusted few trimmers in the past, but I was able to put my faith in this one, the guide just worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasted on a week long trip where I made occasional trims almost every day. (note that you can also use this trimmer plugged in)</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this beard trimmer I read many reviews. I read the negative ones more than I did the positive ones. Those reviews had me quite concerned about buying this product. So concerned that I contacted Norelco directly.  My conversation with them put my mind at ease and I did make the purchase.  I am glad that I did buy this.  I purposely bought an expensive trimmer because I wanted to buy quality. I find this to be high quality.  I trim my beard 2 times each week and have done so for at least 4-5 weeks. The battery still has a good bit of the origingal charge left.  I have found the trimmer to be easy to handle and I have been able to keep my beard looking good.  I heartily recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It will not hold charge</li>
            <li> If you want a close stubble look this product doesn’t do it.  Maintaining a beard or musttash is what this product appears to be best suited for.</li>
            <li> Why didnt I buy this earlier.  I have been using Wahl and others for years. They are junk compared to this bad boy. The motor is strong enough to cut even the thickest hair in one pass. The battery last a very long time between charges. I save so much time now with pro results.  If your looking for THE best beard trimmer, then you have found it.</li>
            <li> This is the first public review of a product I&#x27;ve ever purchased! Unfortunately I&#x27;ve been motivated by dissatisfaction! My Norelco T980 broke (or so I thought) and I bought this as a replacement. What a mistake! The vacuum isn&#x27;t as good as the T980 but it still does an excellent job. The digital display that indicated the length to which it is cutting is nice - but what is astonishingly bad is the discomfort - no - pain experienced while using it! I tend to shave against the grain (which maybe is part of my problem) and I tend to be rough about it. This shaver hurts so badly that I had to return it and post this first ever review. The reason it is painful is because of the guard prongs that control the height of the shave. They come to a point that, when pressed against your flesh the wrong way - hurts! Also, I set it to cut a 5MM and often it actually drew blood while shaving. Now - say what you will about my shaving habits - but I&#x27;ve had two shavers before (a Panasonic and a Norelco T980) and they were both my pleasure compared to this one (and neither ever drew blood). In particular the Norelco T980 was so wonderful that the sharp contrast between it and this product are part of the reason I&#x27;m posting this review. I was so loyal to Norelco for the success of the T980 that I bought this product in an instant without thinking about it - what a mistake! I&#x27;m returning this product and - conveniently I have managed to revive my T980 - hopefully it will last until someone makes a decent vacuum based replacement that doesn&#x27;t do more harm than good.</li>
            <li> My last three beard trimmers were Philips Norelco&#x27;s in generations past of this model.  I&#x27;ve been satisfied with all of them, and all failed simply because they wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore. After extensive search of all brands and models available, I wanted to buy the previous discontinued model because it was smaller. I went with this one because the [[ASIN:B002C741MM Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer]] is selling for 4x the original cost due to demand! Terrible! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this shaver because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1  I travel a lot and this one has a travel lock&lt;br /&gt;2. I need multiple adjustable guard settings and don&#x27;t want to have to carry removable guards while traveling&lt;br /&gt;3. The previous models have been good shavers and didn&#x27;t have technical problems before the battery failed&lt;br /&gt;4. While it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted, there didn&#x27;t seem to be a better option&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not a streamlined as some previous models, this model has several good features including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Charges very fast, less than an hour.  The step down 4050 takes several hours&lt;br /&gt;2.  A travel lock&lt;br /&gt;3.  A clean accurate cut&lt;br /&gt;4.  Holds enough charge for me to use it for weeks at a time without recharging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not in love with this model compared to previous versions for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The guard is larger and can&#x27;t trim right under my nose in the mustache area as well as previous models.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The vacuum feature only catches 1/2 the hair, so I have a dirty sink plus a new bin to empty out. More cleaning work.&lt;br /&gt;3.  This model is larger at the top and takes up more space while traveling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, while this beard trimmer has some challenges, if you are a traveler who wants a shaver that doesn&#x27;t have multiple parts to carry, this one is adequate, and while it has some annoyances it is the best option I could find. It will charge, trim and travel just fine though you may spend some extra time cleaning it.</li>
            <li> User: I like keeping a 0.5 to 1mm beard. For years I have had to time when I shave... not anymore. I now have that &#x27;just shaved yesterday&#x27; look any time I need.     Description: The device itself shows sign of sophistication and forethought. When you hold it, one can clearly see the length of the trim in millimeters and the remaining charge. (The lithium battery battery will last for about an hour in the event that your bathroom is devoid of outlets?) It has a turbo button which make both the cutting and the suction more vigorous, without compromising the quality of the cut. Finally, the vacuum works amazingly well. The sink is not perfectly clean - you may have to use one piece of toilet paper to retrieve the minuscule quantity of hair missed by the vacuum. The overwhelming majority of the clippings will be captured for simple disposal. (The efficacy of the vacuum system may be different for individuals who maintain beards longer than 1mm. I wouldn&#x27;t know.) Some reviewers complain that it does not capture 100% of the clippings... I am amazed by the 99.8% that it does collect.     Conclusion: I had trouble finding clippers that will do less than 1mm. This one will do 0.5mm and it will vacuum up the bits that would otherwise litter my sink/bathroom. (A feature I love.)  It is the most civil way to create that crafted stubble look without shaving in advance. If you want a clean, reliable stubble trimmer, look no further. You will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I had the old version for about 6 years until the battery finally died. Sadly, I discovered this new version couldn´t keep up with its ancestor at all.With the guard off,it was horrible at trimming beard edges and mustache lines. With the guard on it was ok at trimming the rest of my beard. The vacuum is nice, but you´ll still have to clean your sink. Low average at best.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is worth the extra money. I have nothing bad to say about it. The vacuum and whisker collector works flawlessly. My wife no longer yells at me about leaving little whisker stubs everywhere around the sink after trimming my goatee. The trimmer catches ALL of them. Pop the chamber open and brush out the filter and you&#x27;ve got a clean trimmer and a clean sink. The trimmer itself is incredibly easy to use. Just set the length (I use 6-8mm) and run the trimmer down you beard  or mustache and it trims it to that length perfectly. The result is as good as any trim I ever paid for...even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good about this trimmer. I had been using a variety of different models that were all essentially the same for years. Like Conair and many others that were small hair trimmers with an attachment to cut the beard to length. They mostly work but you could never get all the hairs cut. There were always a few stragglers and the cut whiskers were everywhere when you finished. This trimmer has none of those problems. Couple that with good Lithium batteries and this trimmer is just about as close to perfection as you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sceptical too. I recently switched off Norelco for my shaver to Braun after using them for probably 30 years.  So I was apprehensive about paying a premium for another high-end Norelco product. Boy, am I glad I did.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who grew a beard for a Christmas production and he discovered he liked the beard.  He needed a way to keep it neatly trimmed and found this and asked me to please order it.  He loves it.  Keeps the beard and mustache under control and he looks awesome.  Also keeps sink from getting nasty with cut hairs every where.  Glad we found it here on Amazon at a great price.,</li>
            <li> this has more than met my expectations and i will not be without this or a similar product in the future.</li>
            <li> I had to replace this twice....The plastic door is very flimsy and breaks VERY easily.  While it works well in all other aspects, if the door does not close - you lose the benefit.  Do not buy it as it is poor quality.</li>
            <li> [Edit] Product no longer holds a charge.  Up until about week ago, a single charge would last for two to three weeks with me trimming stubble every 2-3 days.  About two weeks ago after fully charging the trimmer, it only last about halfway through trimming before displaying an \\&quot;E\\&quot; symbol and cutting off repeatedly.  I was able to get it to turn back on and finished my shave, and the unit display showed the battery as full except for when it was showing me the \\&quot;E\\&quot; symbol.  Recharged the unit again a couple days later, overnight and fully, attempted to shave in the morning.  The trimmer ran for maybe 3 seconds before telling me it was empty again, then going back to showing the battery as fully charged.  I know how to charge rechargeable batteries to maximize life and did so in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product failed after 7 months.  DO NOT BUY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer seems well designed and catches, as another review says, about 90%-95% of the hair it trims.  Mine shipped with two guards, neither of which could possibly be the basis for the negative reviews.  I tried both of them and did not manage to injure myself or stab my lip.  Either they have changed the guards that are provided with the trimmer, or some people are impressively adept at injuring themselves and will probably die soon from walking down the street, or something similarly hazardous.  Because of some of the negative reviews, I was a little worried about ordering this product, but am quite happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only shortfall in the design is that I feel it doesn&#x27;t trim quite close enough.  The specs I saw said it would trim to less than 1mm, while each of the guards provided only go to a 1mm minimum.  the second blade, that moves, is set back far enough that this likely affects the length as well, but I assume this is a safety measure so that I don&#x27;t slice the skin off my face.  Rather than shave, I simply trim my stubble and prefer it very, very short.  I used to trim every two or three days, since cleanup with a normal trimmer is such a chore.  While this trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut as short as I&#x27;d like it to, I can trim every day not and not have to worry because the vacuum function works so well and prevents a mess.</li>
            <li> I had owned 2 of the previous version of this trimmer.  It had some deficiencies, and I am happy to say that they fixed everything for this new model. They fixed the spring loaded comb problem. Before it was always coming unhinged. Now the hinge is gone. They added a  new Li-iion battery, a new TINY auto-switching power adapter ( I travel a lot with it) and a digital read-out of the trim setting. I could never see the tiny number the previous model had.  I was always grabbing my glasses so I could change the setting, but no more. They added a big bright digital display.  The clippings now collect in a chamber with a hinged door. A big improvement over the old models removable receptacle.  They fixed every complaint I had with the previous model. Bottom line is this one works even better. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a nice feature and greatly reduces cleanup.   BUT  The guard on this trimmer flexes toward the cutting blades with very minor pressure. I thought I would just need to be more delicate when shaving with it. However, after just a few shaves, it became obvious that I needed to press harder to lift some of the whiskers that lay flat. The guard would flex, and it would cut out a chunk of hair very short. So in the two weeks I&#x27;ve had this trimmer, I&#x27;ve had to completely shave my beard down to the minimum 1mm to avoid patchiness. It&#x27;s totally useless in any length between 2 and 4mm, which is where I like to keep my beard. I&#x27;ve returned mine.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grab this dam trimmer because ITS FROM Philips and its top of the range but you have to use it like heart surgery otherwise you will take more hair than you expected, stay away from Philips trimmer its useless .</li>
            <li> This moustage and beard trimmer is so far the best one I ever had. The jury is still out in regards to how long the built-in and non-changeable battery will last. The trimmer does a good job on the moustage and beard and keeps the clippings from clogging the drain.</li>
            <li> I wanted a solid trimmer, and I got one.  From the reviews I was a little hesitant to put it too close to my face for fear of cuts (something about a missing guard?), but after using it for a while it&#x27;s been solid and hasn&#x27;t cut me.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well it catches hair and reduces the mess in the sink for easy cleanup.  All the functions have still been working after a few months, so I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for over 35 years, and recently graduated to the Phiips Norelco Turbo Vacuum Pro Trimmer.  It is easy to use, trims beautifully, and is endless adjustable and sucks up the trimmings perfectly.  If you have a beard, this quality item should be in your personal grooming regimen.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer to replace my old Norelco T-930 that would no longer hold a charge and I have not been sorry. This unit will stay charged no matter how long you leave it in the drawer thanks to Li-ion batteries, FINALLY. It has more length settings and cuts very well and the MM length display is much more useful then a dial with meaningless numbers on it. The vacuum is not great but works as good as my old one did.    Two things that I did find disappointing is it does not come with a storage pouch or a narrow mustache trimmer head, luckily the narrow head from my old Norelco fits this one but most people do not have that option.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if all of these beard trimmer company&#x27;s just aren&#x27;t testing their products, but I&#x27;m dumbfounded at how difficult it is to find a quality adjustable trimmer.  This works fairly well, but has a major design flaw: the guard to adjust length isn&#x27;t continuous, so the blade (at any guard length) can trim significantly shorter than you intended.  If you don&#x27;t keep the trimmer at a perfect angle to your beard, it&#x27;s not hard at all to lop off a lot more than you intended.  Tilting the trimmer up at all allows the blade to basically come in contact with your skin if you really pressed it, since there&#x27;s a huge gap in the guard.  Why the guard doesn&#x27;t fully enclose the blade?  I have no idea... I mean, who is designing these things?</li>
            <li> Norelco puts in a lot of bells and whistles on this one, but don&#x27;t fall for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design flaw cited in other reviews makes for un-even trimming and a painful experience.  The problem is basically a gap on the front side of the trimmer that doesn&#x27;t keep the blade away from your face like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the comb has very plasticy, flimsy feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum and the digital display are interesting, but I don&#x27;t feel like they add much to the beard trimming.  You end up paying a bunch of money for features that are essentially useless.&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying Norelco beard trimmers for about 10 yrs and I usually am a fan, but this is the worst and most expensive trimmer I have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the Remington MB200 instead.  The Remington model is about half the price and ten times better at trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> Great performance and variable settings....works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve choosen this model because of vacuum feature promising to collect cut hair instead of dropping them to sink.&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum is very poor. It&#x27;s collecting just few hairs. Sink is still hairy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went through a couple of different brands like Remington, Panasonic, etc. and this is the only one that has held up.  The battery life is great and the vacuum is awesome, no more sink full of clippings.  I would rate this as the best on the market most definitely.</li>
            <li> I wish it has less than 1mm size too!!. Prompt Delivery, Reciprocity,Restraint seller and Product received In Good Condition. I recommend everyone, who like to look little Rough!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical before making my decision to purchase this trimmer. Initially, I was torn between this trimmer, the 4050, and the Braun Cruzer 6. I even researched the 4090 which is a product only sold in Europe and contemplated having it shipped to me. The reason why I considered the 4090 was because it does all the things the 4070 does PLUS it comes with a precision trimmer and a neat travel bag. The absence of a precision trimmer with the 4070 is the reason why I gave this product 4/5. In my opinion, a precision trimmer isn&#x27;t too much to ask for considering the price and the issue with the contour comb (see Justin Yentile&#x27;s review). Aside from this, it&#x27;s still a great trimmer that gets all the hairs on my beard at a uniform length with barber-like results. I definitely do not regret purchasing the 4070!</li>
            <li> It seems difficult to find a good beard trimmer.  This one certainly isn&#x27;t it.  After just a couple of months of very mild use, the latch on the trimmings collection chamber broke.  Also the length guide seems to get in the way of getting close with the trimmer to certain areas such as my upper lip close to my nose.  A charge seems to last a pretty good amount of time and the ease of adjusting for trimming lengths is nice, but the other shortcomings outweigh these nice features.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  Somehow the little tab holding the trimming popped off, but I sure it&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and hit it on something.  My one gripe with this, and it&#x27;s the same my friend has experienced, if you travel with it, even if you lock it, the battery always seems to die if when I take it on a plane.  Make sure you carry the charger with you until you know if you have the same problem.  Took me two trips to learn this the hard way.</li>
            <li> After much research, I decided to replace my battery operated trimmer with this more robust Philips. My research showed this to be a top model. Here&#x27;s what you need to know.&lt;br /&gt;-Turbo is required for any reliable performance.&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s very difficult to trim mustache due to the head size.&lt;br /&gt;- the vacuum works ok. You&#x27;ll still have hair along the sink.&lt;br /&gt;- After a few months the battery shows full charge. You go to use it the next am and it&#x27;s completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;PS. I love Philips Sonicare oral care products. Batteries and overall performance are stellar. Maybe this was a dude. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product and vacuums very well.  Obviously doesn&#x27;t get it all but gets most of it.  Only thing I dont like is when you take the guard off it is hard to get the razor close to your face.  You are fighting with the vaccuum opening that sucks in the hair.  You have to angle the razor to cut where you want.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t demand much from a trimmer. About once a week for the goatee, so I didn&#x27;t need a professional clipper and don&#x27;t use all that many accessories. This trimmer works just fine for my needs. The vacuum is silly, but it gets most of the hair. Battery life seems to be good. I&#x27;ve used it for three months with my original charge. This is the third Norelco I&#x27;ve owned in my life, and I&#x27;ve had facial hair since 1976. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted to comment on the saga of the missing Contour Follow Comb so thoroughly covered in other reviews of this item.  I bought the item and called Phillips for a replacement before it even arrived. Then I waited with the unopened box for a week until I decided to risk opening it, and here the contour following comb was inside the box the whole time.  I can&#x27;t promise you&#x27;ll get the proper comb in your box, but if you DO, it&#x27;s a really nice shaver. I can&#x27;t believe how short it will trim compared to my old trimmer. I used my old Panasonic trimmer at it&#x27;s shortest setting and so far I&#x27;ve been afraid to go below 3 mm on this trimmer. It will go down to 1 mm!  The vacuum does work. It catches about 80% of the hair. That isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s a whole lot better than no vacuum.  I consider myself lucky that the good come was in the box as I&#x27;m not very hopeful that the Contour Following Comb I ordered through Phillips customer service will ever actually arrive. It seems to be on infinite back order and recently looks like it was removed from Phillips&#x27; website completely. It&#x27;s a risk, but you always return it unused (just be careful opening the box).</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review.  I had to write after all of the helpful comments I received here.  I just ordered the Phillips Norelco QT4070 and received it yesterday.  It did NOT come with the contouring comb, so this seems to be an ongoing issue with this product.  Thanks to reviewers here I had the number to call to get one sent to me.  It was a no hassle phone call and within a couple of minutes I received an email order form and will be receiving it in 7 to 10  business days all free of charge.  I gave it three stars for now because I havent used it yet and I had to go to the hassle of ordering another part.  I&#x27;ll probably bump it up to 4 if I really like it, but not 5 for having to order an extra part.  When I update, I&#x27;ll be sure and list the phone number to call but it is listed in several other reviews.  i love Amazon reviews!  They are so helpful in product selection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Ok this is going down to two stars.  Its been two days and i noticed on my email that it said \\&quot;OUT OF STOCK\\&quot;.  I called them and it is on back order. The woman didn&#x27;t tell me this when I called, so i assumed it was no longer on back order.  Only because i carefully reviewed my email did i realize it was still out of stock. Well, judging from amazon reviewers its been on back order for several months now.  I called them back and even though the woman said \\&quot;7 to 10 days\\&quot;,  they did confirm they had NO idea when it will be coming in from the factory. I had to get a supervisor. I asked them to send me another 4070 and they said there was no guarantee that it would have it.  He initially wouldn&#x27;t do it, and I had to argue since it was mistakenly advertised on their website as having a contour following comb that i should have that and not have to wait.  It took a lot of arguing about it before he agreed, so beware, its not so easy as \\&quot;an extra step\\&quot;.  So now they are sending me a new 4070 and it may or may not have a contour comb.  I\\&quot;m hoping that since another amazon reviewer did the same thing and said there was no guarantee it would have the comb and it did have the comb, that this one will have the comb.  I will update you when i receive it.  If it doesn&#x27;t have it, i&#x27;m going to have to call them again to have them send a contour comb.  Another potential hassle.  If it doesn&#x27;t have it, and i have to call back, this product is going down to a 1 star!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I bought this trimmer in the hopes that it would replace an old battery operated Wahl product that I use to shave my head.  I don&#x27;t normally have enough time to shave regularly with a razor and shaving cream and I&#x27;ve gotten used to using on old Wahl Trim N Vac with the guard removed.  However I also have a goatee and trim it weekly with an old Norelco that was rechargeable but losing the ability to hold the charge. I would have used the Wahl for this as well but I lost the guard and was replacing batteries frequently enough by just using it on my head.  Which brings me to this Norelco - it has been a failure for both \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; my head and trimming my goatee.  It doesn&#x27;t go short enough with the guard off to give a close trim on my head and the \\&quot;gap\\&quot; in the guard seems to be a design fail.  What is the purpose of having this gap??  If you use a low/close setting and you \\&quot;tip\\&quot; the trimmer at all you&#x27;ve gapped your hair with the gap in the guard!! I really don&#x27;t understand.  I guess I should have listened to all the reviews complaining about the gap.  I won&#x27;t use this anymore and have ordered a new rechargable Wahl trim n vac which should be in soon.  Bald guys and close trimmers should be wary of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> While I love this product, I found that it was missing something important. I cannot use the product to mark up or line up or whatever the term is, my mustache and beard in a fine line to clean things up. I know that the comb head can be removed, and I&#x27;ve done precisely that, but the blade does not feel sharp enough to do precision marking. The vacuum intake also prevents a good accurate markup.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer. Wish Norelco sold the contour adjustment separately, as I lost mine on a trip. Only replacement I could find was on eBay for about the same price as the trimmer. Trimming door latch is fragile, I have to wrap a rubber band around it now to keep it closed. Otherwise, works great for trimming and turbo mode is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Five years later, I have just purchased a second Model 7300 - the battery died. The trimmer (some chnges) is still very good at its job. I have several gripes however. This may be nitpicking - The comb system of the trimmer HAS changed. I went to the instructions to find out how it worked. This fold over manual is one of the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen. The pictures are tiny; the instructions are minimal and linked to the tiny pics.Nothing on how to exchange trim combs. Second - When you pay $50 for a trimmer, you should expect at least a flimsy travel bag.This trimmer comes with nothing. I&#x27; m sure they would love to charge extra for the power cord if they could get away with it. CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. In the same vein, they include the tiniest cleaning brush I have ever seen. For $50, they should provide a quality outfit. Luckily, the trimmer does a very good jobontinuing to make the right comb. It is standard equipment on the less expensive QT 4050. Why they don&#x27;t automatically provide this comb to anyone who wants it is beyond me. However, it can be done.</li>
            <li> The QT4070 is badly designed - the blades are exposed and could be in contact with the skin and thus produce cuts. Following Justin Yentile&#x27;s review of this product, I called Customer Service (+1 800.243.3050) and asked for the QT4050&#x27;s comb--model number 422203617711 (this part should solve this problem).  I was told by both the person who answered the phone and by her supervisor that it is on back order.   Given that without part #422203617711, this is a faulty product that puts the customer in danger of hurting himself, a responsible company should have taken this product off the market.  In the absence of an appropriate and timely action by Norelco, I think that the US regulatory agencies need to intervene and ban this company from selling their products in the US.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and he says he loves it! He used to make such a mess with the clippings when he would trim his beard, but with this trimmer, there is virtually no mess.  It also cuts super short on its lowest setting.  Overall, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product with quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Received mine with the contour and regular comb.  My husband used it twice with great results.</li>
            <li> I just received this trimmer yesterday through Amazon.  I wanted to let everyone know that both the contour following guide comb and the stubble comb were in the box.  This matches their product literature on their website.  If, like some previous reviewers, you do not receive the contour following comb, this is an error and you should call Philips Norelco and try to get your comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is great.  It greatly reduces the mess thanks to the vacuum, but does not get 100% of the hairs.  There is a little bit of clean up to do, but it is way easier to clean up the little hair that is missed than when I had no vacuum.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer, but the little latch that holds the trimmings broke after a month. The trimmer still works, but it&#x27;s a bit annoying to have to hold it a certain way so the trimmings don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> After my previous trimmer finally failed, this was the next generation option.  The unit did ship with both guides, so I did not need to call customer support to get the contour following guide.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my dad as a gift and he loves it. He says it trims well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as other Norelco products I&#x27;ve owned.Cleaning compartment cover latch broke and head comes loose.</li>
            <li> I have used this model beard &amp; stubble trimmer for years and been very satisfied with its performance.  My current model was purchased in 2013 and I was interested in upgrading to the 2015 version.  After fully charging the new QT4070. I found the battery would not hold its charge and went dead after 3 days of storage.  Replaced it with a 2nd QT4070, from amazon and found the this model also had a defective battery that would not hold its charge after 3 days of storage (without ever using the trimmer to shave).  This model was also returned.  I will continue to use my old trimmer until Philips can install lithium batteries that can hold their charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2/14/15) I read several recent 5 stars reviews, reporting that the battery was functioning well and holding it charge, since I wrote my review.  Perhaps Philips responded to all the negative lithium battery comments.  I decided to resample the beard trimmer. To my pleasant surprise, the new timmer worked perfectly.  The battery held its charge as specified.  MY RATING HAS CHANGED TO 5 STARS!!</li>
            <li> I have been through at least 5-6 trimmers trying to find one that worked correctly.  The vacuum feature cuts down on the mess from trimming by about 99%, which is great if you&#x27;re getting tired of cleaning up tiny clippings (or sticking your head down close to the sink so they don&#x27;t go everywhere).  The spring actuated guide is very comfortable.  The turbo mode does actually provide improved performance when necessary (e.g. to eliminate multiple passes if you&#x27;re in a hurry.)</li>
            <li> The first one my husband has ever owned and it was easy for him to set it up for his beard and trim it to the length he wants.  Highly rated by Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li> Having tried many (+10) electric beard trimmers in the past, including this model&#x27;s predecessor, I can easily say that this is the best trimmer I have ever owned. The trim length stays in place while applying pressure, unlike the last model that I would start trimming at level 3-4 and then realize the guard moved to 1-2 by the end. The vacuum system is also much improved with the hinged door eliminating the need to remove the entire \\&quot;basket\\&quot; system as on the prior model which broke on me after about 20 uses. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor. I&#x27;ve used a couple before, but this is the first I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light:&lt;br /&gt;It is much lighter than past E-razors I have used. Not too light to use though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edge:&lt;br /&gt;The razors are shaped a bit differently than past E-razors. It looks more like a head shaving E-razor than a face shaver. Gives a clean stubble length shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum:&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum is quiet. I was worried that it may make even more sound than the razor, but its great and seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Display:&lt;br /&gt;The digital display is great. Looks cool and is very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging:&lt;br /&gt;Is very fast and it holds the charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;No stand. I cannot believe there is not a basic and / or a charging cradle. Really lame considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I read the reveiws and I can not see what any complaints are about except perhaps people with long beards.  I would not know.  I have short beard and keep it trimmed,  This thing is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box with a charge I went to trim my scruff.  I had no problems with the settings slipping, no problem with the suction which worked as well as anyone could expect and my beard trimmed evenly, quickly and perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;This was so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning is easy and the fact that it has no door is nitpicking in my opinion,  I open it, shake it and brush it and it cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is you want to trim exactly how you want and this one does.  I really have had none better so this one gets 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> Somehow I&#x27;ve had a beard for over thirty years WITHOUT having this Norelco beard trimmer.  But I never had the control over it that I now have.  How did I ever manage to survive my wandering days in a whisker wilderness for so long?  Lately I have been overwhelmed with compliments.  Someone even said, \\&quot;Dave, you don&#x27;t look as crappy as you used to.\\&quot;  Thanks, Norelco.</li>
            <li> This product is great for trimming the beard. Not good for those participating in Movember though-it&#x27;s terrible for areas with a lot of hair, the shave goes a bit uneven. Good for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut uniformly around the contours of your chin and you have to charge it at least once a week.  I only use it every other day and it is rare that I go a full week without having to plug it in. In addition, the hair catching system doesn&#x27;t work at all and I end up with beard trimmings all over the sink when I trim my beard.  Given the fact that you can&#x27;t rinse it off with water it doesn&#x27;t serve it&#x27;s purpose at all as if it was going to get beard trimmings all over I&#x27;d much rather just trim in the shower where I don&#x27;t have to worry about it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be getting a different beard trimmer in the very near future.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:401107cbb1c5ce51227e305fa2839359]] I bought this to replace my older, smaller Norelco I trimmer I had for years. This one is okay, but it&#x27;s loud and clunky. It does the job and the vacuum system works to a degree (better than nothing).  The reason I chose this model is because of the adjustable length without having to change several guards on the trimmer (I&#x27;m always loosing those). As far as the trimming goes, it seems to work just fine and I didn&#x27;t have any problems out of the box. Please see my video for details.</li>
            <li> Bought this as hopefully a good stubble trimmer, but even without the guard (which is the lowest setting) your left with a lot more than stubble.  The vacuum on the unit works pretty good, and the led screen is a nice touch.  Would be pretty good for sideburns and goatees and the likes.  That being said don&#x27;t buy this as a stubble trimmer, it&#x27;s horrific for the job, not just because it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough, but because the vacuum gets in the way and makes it a pain in the butt.  Find some other trimmer to do stubble.  Unlike what others where saying, I&#x27;ve never been nicked using this trimmer even with the guard all the way off.</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist I expected a bit more. But it gets the job done. Feels light and plastic.</li>
            <li> I own three of these one set for hair &amp; one for my beard. A quality item. The vacuum keeps down the mess. Whenever I like something I always buy a spare knowing they will quit making it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is excellent.  I am very happy with how nice and easy it is to use and how clean it keeps the sink with its vacuum ability.</li>
            <li> I gave serious consideration to purchasing a cheaper beard trimmer but I&#x27;m happy that I decided to spend a few more bucks for the added features of this model.  I have a course goatee which I trim twice a week.  This trimmer has the power to easy handle my goatee without pulling or missing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box arrived from Amazon on time as usual.  When I opened the box I immediate noticed they included two combs, the open comb that allowed some of the nicks and cuts mentioned by other reviewers and the closed comb that resolves this issue.  I plugged in the trimmer and was immediately able to use it with the AC adapter.  This was a great upgrade over the Remmington I replaced, which required me to charge the battery and then use the trimmer under battery power.  Within an hour the trimmer was fully charged and ready to go.  I&#x27;ve used the trimmer 4 times since then and have been very happy with the quality of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Vacuum significantly reduces the mess around your sink.&lt;br /&gt;-Duel AC and battery operation protect you from the rechargeable battery dying mid trim.&lt;br /&gt;-Quick charge feature allows you to quickly charge the trimmer before leaving on a trip.  Helpful for those of us who remember such things at the last minute.&lt;br /&gt;-Dual comb attachments protect from the accidental nicks and cuts mentioned by previous reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;-Digital adjustment readout gives clear and precise trim lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Vacuum is good but not great.  Expect to see stubble around your sink.&lt;br /&gt;-Price is on the high end of most beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good trimmer when trying to get close to the edge of your goatee</li>
            <li> Pros: does not hurt face or other body parts. Wide cutting area. Easy to adjust size. If you get it at the right angle, it shaves well. Catches 70% of hair. Easy to clean. Looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: will not hold a charge, Confusing button layout. Plastic adjustment comb is big. No way to store it standing up.</li>
            <li> Such a good product, works better than i thought it would!</li>
            <li> First trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased and am completely satisfied so far.  Digital readout with charge indicator and closeness setting, corresponding inches on the side. Trims with no feeling or pulling - you don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s cutting. Vacuum catches a lot of hair, though not all. Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Love it. The vacuum on it keeps from making as much mess</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  This product works as advertised and the vacuum feature is great.  The battery lasts for about a week at a time without charging.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this beard trimmer. Gives him the perfect stubble look, and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess, so we&#x27;re both happy.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for 3 months, but recently the clasp that keeps the vacuumed hair trapped in the bay has broken.  As a result, the plastic door won&#x27;t stay shut, and hair flies everywhere!  I have used this product gently, and I really enjoyed it, but now it is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco, please contact me to get a replacement door sent out!  Once you do, this review will get up to 5 stars - where it should be!</li>
            <li> I love that there is a hair collector chamber in this product. It works well and without hair all over the place. I also like the digital settings so I can get the same length every time.</li>
            <li> Worked 3 times, now I get a yellow flashing light when I attempt to turn it on.</li>
            <li> the vacuum is really nice. doesnt get everything but enough to make cleanup really easy. the only thing is the guard is open so im not sure how it would work for keeping a longer beard but i keep my goatee really short so its not an issue.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contour your face properly enough. Took double the time from my old trimmer to trim my face. Also the only way this worked without having to make 3 passes was to use the turbo mode exclusively. The vacuum is not really useful, most of the hair falls down, so why bother. It&#x27;s actually quite loud, so it would be better without the vacuum.</li>
            <li> The plastic door that holds the hair trimmings broke after just a few weeks.  The tines on the face guard are very cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work if you don&#x27;t keep it charged, it doesn&#x27;t work in corded mode as advertised, it just shows an &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; for empty battery when you try to turn it on while plugged in on an empty battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is clearly &amp;#34;engineered to fail&amp;#34;, presumably so you&#x27;ll be forced to buy a new one every year or so.  Old Norelco trimmers used to last a lifetime until Phillips took over the company.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband. Battery life is long so it does not have to be charged often. Trimming blades are sharp and do not pull. After trim hairs are even. Like the adjustable part</li>
            <li> this is the third norelco phillips trimmer i have owned and by far, the worst of the lot.  it did not come with a trimmer blade, or a traveling case.  the trimmer is not smooth and the parts are difficult to take off and on.  this product is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is my third Philips Norelco beard trimmer.  All of them have worked well and I used them daily for years until the batteries started to lose their ability to hold a charge.  As some have mentioned, the standard comb for this trimmer isn&#x27;t great, but as mentioned in some other more recent reviews, mine in fact came with both.  There was no need to call and ask for the second.  The vacuum feature helps some, but there is still some stubble in the sink.  It&#x27;s definitely better than nothing though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were also a couple of nice additions since my last one which was several years old.  The travel lock is helpful.  I used to have to pack a charger when traveling in case the trimmer accidentally turned on in my luggage.  I learned that the hard way once when I went to use it and the battery was drained.  The digital screen showing the setting and more importantly the battery level is also nice.  I don travel a good bit and this lets me know if I need to charge it before leaving.  On my previous model I was always trying to remember how long it had been and guess how many trims I had left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length setting also has a good solid feel to it.  Two trimmers ago, I had to be very careful about what length it was on.  If I wasn&#x27;t paying attention, the guide would drop two lengths and I&#x27;d end up with a much shorter cut than I wanted.  I never had the problem with the one this replaced, but the QT4070 goes one step further and has a nice solid click for your setting providing even more confidence that it isn&#x27;t going to inadvertently slip on me.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had the previous trimmer so he loves this...happy purchase</li>
            <li> Supposedly best rated trimmer but I don&#x27;t agree</li>
            <li> The trimmer is lacking even when the turbo option is on. It doesn&#x27;t work well, the shave is not close at all..  You barley get a shave after the 10th time you go over a spot on your face. The vacuum is cool and works..  But probably because of how little the shaver cuts off.. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t have to work very hard. Returning for a refund.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and after using the Remington Titanium (POS) for the past 10 years let me just say this trimmer is AWESOME. I read most of the differing reviews before making my choice. I was almost detered due to the ones about \\&quot;huge gap between the guard\\&quot; and \\&quot;mawwing your upper lip\\&quot;. My mind was made up after I read the 4 and 5 star reviews that pretty much confirmed that if you \\&quot;know how to glide over your face instead of dragging and digging it into your skin you will love this product\\&quot;.    Hands down, I would have paid $90 for this trimmer. One hour of charge for 7-10 days of use, you can&#x27;t beat that. Add to that the instant click and setting size LCD diplay on the front and all but maybe 20 hairs being collected. This is a GREAT trimmer and I am glad I didn&#x27;t take heed to the negative reviews from people who must have been trying to eat the damn blade, lol.</li>
            <li> Works decent for the price.  The part that holds/captures the shaved hair broke after a few weeks, so now it&#x27;s a pain to hold while I&#x27;m shaving, and little shavings get all over the place.</li>
            <li> Got a good beard trim from this. Does reduce the mess with the vacuum. Recommended for those shaving their heads/beards.</li>
            <li> Over the last 8 months, when I had a full beard, a goatee, or now that trendy 5&#x27;oclock+ stubble this trimmer did the job on all perfectly.  The fine adjustments fit whatever length you want.  I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about the guide, and haven&#x27;t really had any issues.  You just have to hold it at the right angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great fine adjustments for any length.&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum feature leaves very little mess and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;- Very Fast charging.&lt;br /&gt;- Turbo mode will make short work of any kind of grooming.&lt;br /&gt;- Can work from cord or battery should your battery be empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not waterproof.  It would be great if it was wet/dry and/or I could clean/sanitize it under the water.&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes the battery, which seems to last a week or better even with the turbo on, just drops to zero all of a sudden.  Don&#x27;t know if this means something is wrong, if I actually just just that much power, or if the gauge is off.  Fast charging, and because you can use it from cord and battery, make this not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;- Electronic display of length settings sometimes is off from the actual setting, like it gets out of sync by 1 click.  Going all the way down and then back up re-syncs the digital display with the actual setting.  Not a big deal since the setting is clearly marked on the side and the digital display is more just for fanciness.  It&#x27;s also rare to happen, but it does.</li>
            <li> Great idea - no more wiping the hair trimmings from around the sink (well - not entirely true, because it does let some hair fly), but all in all a great idea......until you end up with great big holes in your beard!    For some weird reason the designers created an adjustable guard where the cutting blades actually stick out of the guard!   Yes - that big gap that you see on the picture means that the cutting blades can dig into your painstakingly grown beard in a flash, and you are left with the choice to trim it down (meaning a big change in your appearance) or hope nobody notices.    My new (expensive) purchase has just been consigned to the bathroom sink closet, and I have retrieved my 5 year old worn out but trusty Remington.    Don&#x27;t waste your money simply because it looks futuristic and cool - sometimes the cheaper option is the better option.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard Trimmer is a good product. It does an excellent job at keeping your beard with the perfect stubble look or nicely trimmed appearance. The vacuum does pick up most of the hair trimmings, however it does miss some and there still is a slight mess to clean up in the sink when finished. Despite the fault of the vacuum not being perfect, I would still recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer.  Lots of settings.  I love the travel lock feature so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get turned on and drain the battery during flight.</li>
            <li> the Norelco turbo is a very light, easy-to-use trimmer that does its job well.      The easy-to-adjust (and remove when necessary)  trimming guide is marked in inches and mm with nearly 20 different positions so you&#x27;ll be able to maintain your beard at whatever length you prefer. It&#x27;s easy to hold in the hand, narrow and light and maneuverable.  The vacuum works well enough to collect the vast majority of clippings (I&#x27;ve yet to find one that gets them all), but it&#x27;s a relatively small container so those with long or heavy beards might need to empty it frequently.  The turbo power does seem to boost the power (it does get noisier) but I have no use for it so I can&#x27;t say how effective it would be for those who might need the extra power.  It&#x27;s a pretty quiet clipper. It charges very quickly and holds its charge for sometime, enough for multiple uses over more than a week.  It doesn&#x27;t come with any guiding/molding tools as some trimmers do.  I currently own a Braun that I&#x27;ll probably keep using over this just because it does have the trimmer guides, but I certainly would have been satisfied with this had it been my only one. It&#x27;s noticeably lighter than the braun which might be a plus for those whose trimming takes some time.</li>
            <li> bought this to replace my older turbo vacuum model....what a mistake! The space between the guard and the guide comb doesn&#x27;t work for me at all...it jabs my skin and allows very very uneven cuts to happen. I tried my best to get adjusted but have just called norelco to exercise the 45 day money back offer.</li>
            <li> First off--like other critical reviewers you&#x27;ll find here, I also had major problems with the comb. This review was almost a ONE-star rating, due to the sharp tines and general design of the comb. This _extremely_ poor comb design caused me to stab my lip several times and also resulted in uneven trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, I previously owned a Norelco T980 and needed to move \\&quot;up\\&quot; when it would no longer hold a charge. With the T980 no longer available, it appeared that my options were either the QT4050 or the QT4070. Overall, the QT4050 is far inferior to the QT4070 in that it lacks the travel lock, quick charge, and turbo functions. HOWEVER...the 4050 has one feature that I believe was SUPPOSED TO BE included with the 4070--the \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot;. If you look closely at images of the two units side-by-side, you&#x27;ll see that the comb design on the 4050 is closed--no giant gap and sharp tines with which to cut/stab yourself--and it also has a flexible guide. Those who previously used the T980 will surely recognize the design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my frustration with the 4070&#x27;s comb, I did some research. Philips Norelco CLEARLY markets the 4070 as using their \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot;. That&#x27;s not actually true for what&#x27;s \\&quot;in the box\\&quot;, however. The comb that comes on the shaver is model number 422203617701, which is their \\&quot;plastic stubble comb\\&quot;. As it turns out, the combs for the 4050 and the 4070 are _interchangeable_, and with a phone call to Philips, I was able to get them to provide the 4050&#x27;s comb--model number 422203617711.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you get your shaver, if you&#x27;re experiencing similar issues with the comb, call Philips at 800.243.3050 and ask to speak with a supervisor--first level reps can&#x27;t seem to approve parts orders. Explain the situation, tell them you want the comb for the QT4050 (P/N 422203617711), and they&#x27;ll send it to you, free of charge. Within a week, you&#x27;ll be able to fully enjoy what Philips should have built in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record--after I received my new CONTOUR FOLLOWING COMB, the QT4070 is a FIVE-star trimmer--it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. The one-star ding represents the hassle it took to get this product to be all it should be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record--after I received my new CONTOUR FOLLOWING COMB, the QT4070 is a FIVE-star trimmer--it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. The one-star ding represents the hassle it took to get this product to be all it should be!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Norelco QT4070, to replace a Whal trimmer that was a disappointing purchase. The norelco has been a great and I love it. I have a very coarse, unruly beard that grows in all directions and this trimmer does a great job contouring my beard using the attached guide. Then I remove the guide to trim errant hairs in the beard. The vacuum works great and gets about 90% of hairs.My only issue is that the battery is not replaceable, once the battery is gone the entire trimmer is done That said,  I have not experienced any issues listed in earlier reviews. This trimmer exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a beard for past 40 years and have owned numerous beard trimmers. The Philips Norelco Qt4070 is the best one yet. It allows me to easily keep my beard trimmed and well groomed. The vacuum component makes trimming care free without the need to clean up hairs which usually fall all over the sink and vanity top.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommed this Beard Trimmer !</li>
            <li> Works very well, get about 85% of the hair. Which is great, but be careful of the door that you open when dumping the hair. It has a little bump of plastic that holds it close and it will wear down and will not stay close any more. It take like 25 to 30 times for this to happen. But if you are careful should last longer. And that&#x27;s about a year. Then its a rubber band time.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Say goodbye to hair-covered sinks\\&quot; ? \\&quot;Mess free\\&quot; ? Wow I believed this until I tried it. The vacuum seems indeed a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does collect 30 to 50% of my hairs inside it, but I still have a mess in my sink. And since it was the purpose of choosing this model, I am very disappointed. The overall rate could have been 3 to 4 if I had not felt that mislead by marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case this matters, I trim between 8mm to 12mm. Maybe the vacuum works better for shorter sizes, but I assure you it works bad the longer you trim.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well for trimming your beard, but doesn&#x27;t work very well for edging or on your head. It doesn&#x27;t suck up all the hair, but it does a fairly good job of it. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and have used it a few times on my head and use it to trim my beard several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase it again, but I&#x27;m not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Straight up no BS review.  The bottom line is this:It cannot create a stubble look to save its flipping life. On the shortest setting it is simply to long so you have to take off the entire guard to get anything done.  Vacuum system? PRO, seriously.  When I saved before it looked like I murdered a family of badgers in my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, 3 stars because it does not do what it is supposed to but the vacuum is bad-ass.  This would be great if I had a beard I can tell you that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, btw the guy complaining about it \\&quot;stabbing himself in the face\\&quot; while shaving?  Might want to cut down on grandpa&#x27;s cough syrup til after shave time cheif.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this. My husband had his last trimmer for a long time. This is great because of the vacuum.</li>
            <li> Great. Just as expected: simple, clean, adjustable, european plug adaptor without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And almost half a price than here (Portugal)</li>
            <li> Three problems, two of them major.    Minor: It&#x27;s pretty darn big.    Major: The adjustable guide (or comb) is comprised of an upper part and lower part which are perpendicular to each other. Where they would naturally meet and form a right angle, someone (who obviously has never used a beard trimmer on themselves) decided those two parts did NOT need to connect. So there is a top comb which digs right into your skin like little knives as you use the device! IT&#x27;S HORRIBLE and causes irregular trimming.    Secondly, the design of the blades and the large vacuum port is such that when you&#x27;re trying to trim the line of your mustache, beard, or sideburns, you cannot SEE where the blades are touching your face/beard, so you can&#x27;t tell where to trim! And once you do, the blades just barely cut anything at all.    It is a useless device obviously designed by people who don&#x27;t use beard trimmers and I returned mine immediately. I cannot imagine why anyone would like this.</li>
            <li> I have read before that beard groomers which feature a vacuum are nothing more than a gimmick. They advertise themselves to eliminate those short, or long (depending on your beard), hairs that are the byproduct of any beard maintenance. The latter is directed towards those men who use manual means (beard scissors), or an electric trimmer without a vacuum. As far as this particular product is concerned: Philips Norelco Qt4070, I will be letting you know how it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPEARANCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we have first in appearance is a very modern, sleek looking accessory that has a blue digital readout. This is no old fashioned trimmer. Something that the girlfriend, or wife, would not complain (always a plus) about being in view for all to see. So yes, it looks good. Now that we got that out of the way lets get down to actually using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you begin trimming, the manual notes that in order to perform the best job it is best to comb the beard out. But it does not come with a comb (my Remington did). This trimmer is certainly not one of the more inexpensive ones so why not have this included? Moreover, I can attest that combing the beard out definitely does help with a smoother, even trim. If you buy this product I would suggest buying one if you do not already have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to determine the length that the trimmer will cut your hair, there is a MM and an inch chart on either side that will let you know what setting (i.e. 1 or 2 or 3 etc.) equals what. Personally I never get that involved with exact measurements when sculpting facial hair, but for the facial enthusiasts your need for preciseness will be satiated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I was finished doing the trim I came to two conclusions about this product: 1. It is impossible to trim under your nose and 2. The trimmings have to go somewhere, and seeing where they go, at least, might be better than not seeing. In the past I have not had any problems with other products in regards to the former, but the Qt4070 would not allow me to get anywhere on the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was still some mild shavings that found its way in my sink. It was not a couple, but it was not a lot either. It was enough to leave me thinking that the vacuum did indeed miss a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this was the only problem I would concede to the vacuum and agree that it does improve the shaving experience. However there is one little thing that is neglected to be mentioned in the advertising that I was not aware of. As you may know, there is a vacuum that sucks up the hair and while it does not get every little hair, it does get the majority of it. Where does it go though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it go in a little baggy that you can empty? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it go in a compartment that you can empty? Sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture a bagless vacuum. Picture the compartment where all the hair and dust goes and forms that little puffy mass. Now imagine that after emptying the puffy mass, that you would now have to take the vacuum cleaner apart and clean every moving part within it because parts of that puffy mass had coated everything inside. Sound fun? It isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the experience with this vacuum groomer. After popping open the compartment, there is a wadded little mass of beard hair that simply falls out. Simple enough and quite fun actually. Though now you have to take off the measuring head to brush it and everything underneath. Ok well that is not so bad, right? But wait there&#x27;s more. You then have to slide up the little razors themselves to find hairs wedged in a not so neat compartment that was not meant to house little hairs. You will then find hairs all under and over the little mechanism that causes the blades to work in the first place (not the razors themselves--the part that moves them). Not to mention you cannot get all of the hairs out. This leads me to think that maybe this will lead to premature failure. This is all described in implicit black and white prints under the section \\&quot;Cleaning\\&quot;. Moreover, did I mention that the cleaning section has 17 steps? Yes, 17. And now we have reached why I have given it three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product looks goods, trims good (except for the upper lip), but I spent a good 10 minutes cleaning this after I was finished. Compare this to my non vacuum beard trimmer that leaves tons of hairs all over the sink. However, with the latter it only takes some water and a few hand splashes to get them to disappear. Time taken: 2 minutes and out the door. The vacuum is advertised to eliminate, or at least alleviate, cleaning just enough so that beard trimming can be spotless and trouble free (what else would it be good for?). Ironically, it causes more effort through the extra cleaning. Though the vacuum does work fair enough, it leaves much more to be done on my part which leads me to think it just might be a gimmick after all.cleaning section has 17 steps? Yes, 17.

            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for a few months now and its really great.  I use it on its lowest setting maybe two times a week just to give the stubble look....I hate close shaves...  Anyway, the battery lasts forever and the built-in vacuum works great as long as the hair isn&#x27;t too long and isn&#x27;t wet.  This thing is powerful and effective. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who keeps a shaggy look</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer. Built-in adjustable guard instead of having to change to different guard heights is a great feature.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a beard trimmer, this is a great choice.  The first thing I noticed was that it is relatively quiet, in comparison to an older trimmer.  The height is displayed digitally in millimeters on the front near the adjustment dial, but you can see it in both millimeters and inches when you view it from the side.  It has quite a bit of precision when it comes to height, perfect for those who know just what they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature contains the mess at least 90% better than our going everywhere and clogging up the drain.  The charger works well and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  My husband says he&#x27;s never used a better trimmer and is thankful to be rid of an older model he&#x27;s held on to for the last decade!</li>
            <li> Might be a really good trimmer but was too afraid to use it. The big opening into which my lip could fall trimming my mustache could have been fatal. Returned it.</li>
            <li> This product is a stubble trimmer. Period. I used my T908 to shave my beard and head, but that would be quite dangerous with this model. Please ignore previous reviews that explain that you can buy the comb from the 4050 for this product. That part has been discontinued by Norelco. I have been using their shavers/groomers for over 30 years but this is my last. I would still be using my T980 if it had not fallen apart - an obvious design flaw on the hinges for the door to remove clippings. The same flimsy door is on this QT4070 BTW. Anyway, there is a Euro model QT4090 (the price-conscious US market does not get this) that does indeed include the much-needed Contour Comb attachment. As it sits, this QT4070 is useless for me. If you own the T980, you will HATE, I repeat, HATE this new model.</li>
            <li> I used the Norelco 980 for years, and when I switched to this one I though I was getting an upgrade. Instead, it turns out there is a huge GAP in the trimmer comb of this \\&quot;updated\\&quot; design, resulting in it CUTTING into your lip or stabbing you when you get to the contours of your face. And forget about any close-up work, it is useless for goatees etc without the small shaver that used to come with the 980.    This \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; model has been sitting in the closet of my bathroom for 1 year now, and I am mad as hell at Norelco. I will never again use their products, and will look to Remington now for my 980 replacement as they no longer make it.</li>
            <li> Great quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It advertises as a moustach trimmer.... It really isn&#x27;t..... it doesn&#x27;t have the correct settings etc.  and is very hard to trim the moustach neatly.  other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li> I had lost my old trimmer on a recent trip, so I replaced it with the QT4070. This trimmer has done everything I need. Numerous beard guard adjustment levels from long beard to stubble. The trimmer has an adjustment dial with a digial display of the setting. The vacuum feature works great. I have had to snake the drain more than once due to beard hair in the drain. The batter is rechargeable with a plug-in charger. I have not yet had to recharge after 3 months. The only nitpicky thing I would find needs improving is that it would be nice if it included a stand. It doesn&#x27;t stand on its own, and it takes up counter space when laying flat. If you need a good beard trimmer, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> So you have a date, and you need to trim that wild mountain man beard down to something that looks more civilized? Look no further. This is capable of cutting your beard with plenty of horsepower left for that mildly troublesome chest hair that threatens to escape through that shirt collar and strangle nearby wildlife. It has a good thick cutting blade like the classic cordless trimmers of years past, not some wimpy easy-to-break foil like certain other Philips Norelco products. The difference is immense for those coarse, manly hairs - it almost seems like other products may have only been tested on baby peach fuzz. Turn the vacuum off when cutting long beards down to size, because the chamber isn&#x27;t big enough for that sort of operation. Go forth and impress that date with your neatly groomed appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later, you have another date? Great! Unsurprising, because surely you have a personality to match that marvelous appearance! Time to maintain that beard. Turn the vacuum on and be amazed at how it collects so much of the trimmed ends. There is no such thing as perfection though, so you&#x27;ll still have to clean some clippings off the rocks by the majestic mountain river you undoubtedly bathe in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a couple months later and you&#x27;ve been using it so much that the battery wore out, and (no doubt thanks to your dashing good looks) you have been chosen to deliver the opening speech at a last-minute high society affair - no problem, it operates while plugged into any 5-star establishment&#x27;s standard AC outlet, so you can use it anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly, a life-transforming experience. I would buy two and dual-wield them, if I thought I had the coordination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, I&#x27;ve used other trimmers that are no longer available which had better vacuum suction, but since those are no longer available, just buy this one and wipe the sink.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who started growing a beard. I already owned one. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer! I have bought many other electric razors and have spent much more on similar products but this one is my favorite. Easy to use, charges fast, the vacuum feature actually works! It while it sounds like a silly gimmick but it keep the bathroom clean. Buy one, its great!</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco trimmer.  My earlier one lasted a long time--many years-- before plastic bits started breaking.  This new is comfortable to handle, seems like it might be a bit sturdier, trims very well and adjusts easily. Recommended.</li>
            <li> What is not to like?  I&#x27;ve been trimming this beard for &gt; 40 years.  This the best I&#x27;ve come across.  Vacuum terrific, trim reliable.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this item. Let me just say that it is useless if what you want is to maintain a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  It does not cut nearly close enough.  I tried it twice after I had let my beard grow out for four days and it barely made a dent in the beard growth.  It is quite possible that the trimmer would work well for those who want longer beard lengths.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best trimmer I have ever owned. I have purchased Trimmer Vacs in the past that did not have the power of this trimmer. This trimmer never fails to capture all the hair as I shave. Overall an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent Trimmer, Photos are same as the original, made of high quality material from china (I think it has been assembled only their), It has so many advantages like:&lt;br /&gt;* Light in weight,Trimming Fast, rapid Charge, easy to adjust the comb, 99 % vacuuming the trimmed hair, clear display,accurate, cord and cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* But the only dis-advantage is that the charges goes down rapidly, that&#x27;s why generally the general rate is 4 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;* Also the Pouch is not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Makki</li>
            <li> If, like me, you go for the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; look, the T-980 and the QT4070 are very similar - in fact the cutting heads are interchangeable between the two models, and I get the exactly the same results from both.    The QT4070 has the fancy digital display, the travel lock, and is somewhat more compact than the T-980, but if you don&#x27;t care much about those things then you&#x27;ll get the same shave from the T-980 for much less money.    The two trimmers have slightly different beard combs, but I never use them so I can&#x27;t comment on their differences.    The vaccuum feature works about the same on both trimmers, catching most (but not all) short hairs.  If you are trimming a longer beard, or body hair, be aware that the longer trimmings can get jammed up in a wad at the top of the suction slot and get in the way of the cutters, so you need to keep stopping to clean them out.  In this case you might be better off with a non-vaccuum model.</li>
            <li> Ive used a philips norelco vacuum beard trimmer for about 10 years now.  I originally had an older model (blue with a pull out vacuum hopper) and switched to this one a year or two ago.  It collects all the shavings so your not getting a mess on the floor or sink.  The turbo boost in this model is nice, and I use it on occasion.  Great so you dont have to go over the same spot as many times.  Overall this is a great trimmer but on the lower levels it can leave my beard looking somewhat uneven.  I came on amazon today in hopes of finding another type of vacuum beard trimmer and figured id leave a review for this.  I havent been able to find replacement blades for this, but im guessing they are available.  I started using this to keep a low stubble and its not the greatest for that.  I used to love it when I grew out my goatee, but for a full on beard its not the greatest.  I challenge you to find a better one, and let me know if you do find one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. The internal vacuum is great because it means less beard trimmings on my sink!</li>
            <li> Yes, I haven&#x27;t had this Trimmer but just for a short period of time, and it works very well and great for me!!!  It does everything it says it will and better...than described...but the only thing...that I would point out is:  that the vacuum works very well, and sucks up about 90 to 95 percent of all the hair up &amp; in from your face....but, the rest falls into the sink....which isn&#x27;t very much at all, and it&#x27;s not a big enough deal or a big enough mess of hair to really point out, or even mention to me, so...  But, that&#x27;s the only con, that..I&#x27;ve noticed so far... and like I will say again:  It&#x27;s not a big deal at all, and it&#x27;s hardly enough hair to complain about to start with so....other than that..??  It works really Great for me, and all the features work very well...including the vacuum too!!!  Also, I really love the digital display on it...showing all the different lengths or measurements (and battery power...e.t.c.) ...and, it&#x27;s pretty precise...when it comes to close trimming too ...and, you can&#x27;t beat the price on here at Amazon no where else either,...believe me, I&#x27;ve already checked!!!  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve seen yet, and that, I&#x27;ve used so far...by a mile or more....!!!!  Really, I highly-recommend it for the product and price!!!  You can&#x27;t beat it!!!  It&#x27;s all-around Great!!!  Thanks again, Amazon &amp; Philips-Norelco!!!</li>
            <li> really good trimmer, doesnt snag. the height adjustment control is great. the vacuum helps keep hair out of your blades creating easier upkeep. well  made product and slightly quieter than a normal trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it, does exactly what I expected, especially the short cut down to 1 mm. the vacuum works even better than expected.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great - adjust in 1 mm increments, holds a charge a long time and the integrated vacuum feature is a hit with my wife.  The best I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I try to maintain a short, stubble look, both on my head and my beard.  And this rather expensive option has turned out to be the most flawed of the dozen I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUSES: The design is very handsome.  It&#x27;s easy to hold, the digital readout is nice, and the battery charge is certainly up for a lengthy trim job of hair, beard and body.  I&#x27;ve had models where the trim-length setting slips during use.  They have fixed that issue here.  However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINUS: The plastic guides that run across the scalp, face and body are designed to serve two roles.  They direct hair into the row of blades for trimming, and the length at which they are set by the user should provide for an even trim.  They fail miserably at the second function.  The plastic guides are so flimsy, that with very little pressure, they collapse down, or spread from one another, allowing hair to get much closer to the cutting blades than intended.  The result can be as bad as rows of near-baldness in-between hairs of the intended length.  I have essentially had to shave my hair back to almost bald with no guard just to avoid looking like a freak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may work just fine for people with a 3/4\\&quot; beard or longer, but do not attempt to achieve an even, short look with this model.  It will be a disaster!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but the vacuum on the trimmer is not that good the Vacuum on the Old model was a lot better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco vacuum (maverick) trimmers for years.  My T980 recently broke (I dropped it) so I went with another from the same brand.  I&#x27;ve had the QT4070 for about a month now and I can&#x27;t stand it.  There&#x27;s a space between the 2 combs that expose the blades.  This makes it near impossible to maintain a lower cut height when trimming around any contours - the chin especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They took some steps forward with this design but the gap in the comb(s) is a real issue for me.  Now my only option is the QT4050 which doesn&#x27;t have the turbo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (7 months later): Minus one more star - This design is terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never dropped or mistreated this shaver but the plastic tab that holds the catcher door closed broke off (cheap).  I called Norelco about this and they shipped me a new one.  Well, a few months later and now the second one is broken as well and the door will not stay closed.  Really Philips/Norelco, this is what you killed the T980 for?!?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but it still makes mess</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m not going to rehash all the talk about this model vs others that are similar.  This is my first cordless trimmer, so I am downgrading the size and power of the vacuum (my other one died after 10 years, but was a beast that could cut my beard and shave my head).  This is good for trimming lightly to keep that groomed look.  The vacuum chamber holds about 10 hairs, so it needs to be emptied frequently.  But the battery, even on TURBO mode, is outstanding.  I also like the integrated guard with digital settings by the millimeter--very precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with two guards, unlike some of the reviewers&#x27; comments I read, so I found the one that I like and I&#x27;ve stuck with it.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even tried the other one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me several passes to trim my beard, which I do once a week at most.  It&#x27;s sometimes a little uneven, so I go over it every which direction to get it right.  Again, I&#x27;m stepping down from a monster clipper that was like a corded roto-tiller, so I&#x27;m paying for convenience of cordless--and the battery lasts forever!  I think I got three solid full beard trims on full turbo the whole time before it was down below 1/2 battery.  I&#x27;ve charged it only once ever, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbos - one for my husband and one for my son.  Both have beards and both loved it.  It charges quickly, adjusts to the height of the cut well and the vacuum is super!</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars...it&#x27;s a Christmas gift so hope it is as wonderful as it looks.  In the package it looks like a real quallity product..</li>
            <li> High quality trimmer. The tines on the trimmer head didn&#x27;t bother me one bit and the vacuum aspect is pretty cool. Only frustrating part I encountered actually was the vacuum itself. While its functionality is excellent, it gets in the way of the blades if you want to use just the bare blades. I like to use the bare blades on my neck just below the jaw line. The vacuum sticks out too far from the blades and the blades won&#x27;t even make contact with your skin. You have stick it out at a different angle rather awkwardly to where can&#x27;t see all that well and limits the accuracy of your shaving. I know many of you may not use it for that so it may not even be an issue but for those who do, just beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The color of the trimmer came black and white. The picture shows a nice dark blue. Not pissed about it but wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> works great,  lost a star for  the vacuum which is anything but perfect.  that said it&#x27;s still much cleaner than without the vacuum.  for its primary function of trimming a beard,  it really  works quite well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smooth. I have short beard works well to trim though a bit difficult to maneuver around mustache area</li>
            <li> Works great as a beard trimmer for the length but not so effective to create the lines you need.</li>
            <li> The vacuum thing works very well, but don&#x27;t expect it to work with out emptying the cut hairs. The battery lasts long, for about 8 shaves without recharging.</li>
            <li> The spring-loaded clear plastic thing attached to the comb is really a stupid idea. You have too hold the trimmer nearly perpendicular to your face to get any trimming done. Vacuum works well, though.</li>
            <li> Although sum hair doesn&#x27;t get vacuumed up this thing is great! It doesn&#x27;t click out of place when u press it against ur skin. And it has so many lenth settings, its really a great device to own.</li>
            <li> Bought this and It did the job as expected. But I&#x27;ve had this for 22 months and now battery won&#x27;t charge. Useless and won&#x27;t power with the AC plug alone. You&#x27;d think for $60 dollars it would last longer. In the trash it goes. No more Norelco&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> Had an older version of this product which I&#x27;ve had for years.  The thing that amazed me about this model is how much lighter it is, but with more suction on the vacuum.  Battery charged quickly, and it comes with two different trimmer guides, and the last model only had one.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is hand&#x27;s down the best beard grooming tool. I have owned many other brands. None of them worked as well. Trust me, I&#x27;m a beard guy.</li>
            <li> works great, vacuum catches a good bit of hair, and long battery life</li>
            <li> This is the third beard trimmer I have owned and, by far, it is the best. While others have mentioned its minor imperfections, and some of them are true, to my knowledge this is the best designed, best working beard trimmer--especially if you are interested in the stubble settings; this one has 18 length settings, and the very short ones work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sets this apart from the other beard trimmers I have owned is its accuracy. The trim is uniform. I own another trimmer manufactured by this same company, and it simply doesn&#x27;t perform as well. Not to mention, the vacuum feature works pretty well. As others have mentioned, it&#x27;s not perfect; there&#x27;s still a tiny mess--emphasis on tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have previously been using a Norelco T870 but the battery stopped holding a charge so I have had to buy a new trimmer. Although there were 3 reviews here that mentioned the guide being faulty I decided to try the trimmer due to the 20+ positive reviews and the lack of a decent alternative.   The trimmer arrived this evening so after charging it for an hour I tried it out.   The guide is adjustable to give a varying length of cut. The lowest setting gives a 2mm cut and the highest 18mm. Unfortunately, the guide is made using flexible prongs which bend a good 3-4mm. This means that if you use a low setting the guide prongs will bend fully to the blade. I found this out by cutting my lip twice in the first minute of use. I also quickly found that due to the flexibility of the guide using a low setting results in a really uneven cut.  I keep my beard pretty short (4-5mm) and there&#x27;s no way I can use this without the blade cutting me and without making my beard look like it&#x27;s been hacked at by someone with blunt kid scissors. I think it would be a good product for someone with longer beard hair but for me it is completely unusable.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard, and thus have had beard trimmers, for almost 30 years, so I have some pretty strong ideas about what a trimmer should and should not do. IT SHOULD NOT STAB YOU IN THE FACE! But that is exactly what the new QT4070/41 does.    For years I was wonderfully happy with Norelco&#x27;s previous top-of-the-line model, the T980. I love the vacuum feature, the turbo setting cut my tough beard with gusto, and the length adjustment was generally adequate (though the settings were a bit wide apart, so 3 was too long and 2 was too short).    But the engineers at Norelco have taken a wonderfully designed T980 trimmer and screwed it up royally. The problem is with the guide comb. On the older T980, the guide comb completely covered the cutting head. But on the new Qt4070/41, the guide comb has tines that extend along the top and front of the cutting head, and END IN SHARP POINTS. So the cutting head sits exposed within a cavity between the ends of the two sets of pointy tines. Yeah, sure, that&#x27;s what I need to drag across my face all bleery-eyed in the morning - pointed sticks!  :-(    The new guide comb&#x27;s design is woefully stupid for two reasons:    1) The length to which your hairs are cut will VARY depending on the angle with which you hold the trimmer against your skin. If you hold the upper face of the guide comb flat against your skin, you get a longer cut than if you allow your skin to span the gap between the two set of tines. And frankly, you KNOW you can&#x27;t hold the trimmer at the same angle all over your face! BOTTOM LINE: AN UNEVEN TRIM!    2) Even if you are trying hard to keep the flat top of the guide comb flush against your face, you eventually have to turn a corner, like at your jaw line. I have used this Qt4070/41 about a dozen times now, and each time I have managed to jab myself with those stupid tines somewhere - in the jawline, in the chin, in the lip, etc. I know it&#x27;s just a matter of time before I (a) break a tine, or (b) draw blood. BOTTOM LINE: A PAINFUL TRIM    My advice: QUICK! Buy a T980 before it is discontinued and all bought up! Maybe Norelco will fix the Qt4070/41 by the time you wear out your T980.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, after two months of occasional use, the little plastic tab that keeps the door of the collection bin closed broke off. I have not dropped it or abused it (can this item be abused?). It&#x27;s a shame because this is a good trimmer otherwise.</li>
            <li> Wanted to go the stubble look so I spent hours researching amazon and other sites on the best beard trimmer/shaver. This is the best trimmer in my opinion.  Now I have a full set of facial hair that within several days grow quite out of control. This trimmer has done the job many times over. It trims and collects all the hair quite well, charges rapidly, and doesn&#x27;t nick my sensitive skin. The travel lock is a nice bonus.  One note: If you don&#x27;t clean the blades or comb regularly and are traveling, make sure to pack it in ziplock as loose hair particles will spill all over! I also wish you could use it in the shower. Other than that, I highly recommend the trimmer!</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Trims good.  Vacuums good.  Battery life good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Difficult to trim up close up under nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  Overall works as expected.  Would be higher rating if design allowed for closer trim under nose.</li>
            <li> I had purchases this before a few years ago, and I needed to buy another one as the old ones batteries finally gave out. You can&#x27;t beat this product with anything else on the market. As far as accuracy goes, the Norelco QT4070 is unbeatable and gives my face the look I want, pretty much everytime. A must have in any mans tool chest.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised, alllows me to keep my goatee evenly and neatly trimmed with a minimum of work.</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve used. What is the point of designing the trimmer teeth lower than the cutter when the ones behind it are higher with no support?? This is the worst design I&#x27;ve every seen in any product. I used it once and returned it since trying to trim it was a hit/miss situation where in some part it completely removed my beard and in some part it cut to what I set it to. I returned it and got the QT4050 which is a much better design that has the front teeth above the cutter. I can&#x27;t imagine why this was designed this way, but I don&#x27;t think the moron who designed it tested it to see how it works. QT4050 is much better and cheaper. Too bad I can&#x27;t give it negative stars, otherwise I would.</li>
            <li> The problem is the primary thing it is designed to do, which is trim beard hair, it does a pretty miserable job of.  Maybe if you are a daily trimmer and it only has to snip the end off a few hairs it would be OK, but for a person like me that trims their beard and gets a hair cut once a month it is near worthless.  I tried using this alone and would spend 15 min or more before deciding &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34;, now I start with a Wahl corded trimmer to do 90% of the trimming then finish with the Norelco.  Having to use a different product first then follow with this is a joke, I should have returned it when I still had the chance.</li>
            <li> Although this was my first trimmer, I think having bought other ones makes me somewhat viable as a reviewer.      I was in the market for a \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; shaver.  Basically, something that would help me achieve that shadowy/5 o&#x27;clock look.  At first glance, this shaver seems great.  It has a vacuum to help clean up, and a whole lot of settings.  Great buy, right? Wrong.      The vacuum function, although not all bad, is kind of useless, and that is really what this particular model is known for.  Okay... so instead of taking a solid minute to clean up after yourself on a non-vacuum model, you take a solid minute to empty the little basket that they give you.  Is it worth the twenty dollars extra over their other models?  Keep reading to find out.    The beard length settings are way too far apart.  2mm seems too small, while 3mm seems too long.  However, there&#x27;s nothing in between, forcing you to just deal with it, I guess.      The blades on this one, for some reason, really aggravate my skin.  I&#x27;ve cut my upper lip more than once using this thing, and I&#x27;m a very careful user.  I initially thought this is just the way things worked with these stubble shavers.  Having bought other ones which don&#x27;t nearly aggravate my skin like this one, I now think that it&#x27;s a design flaw on this particular model.    Since I already bought it, and it served it&#x27;s purpose to some extent, I sort of just dealt with it.  Until a month ago, about 5 months after I bought it, it would spontaneously turn on by itself.  Okay, not a big deal, just turn it off. Only happened sporadically anyway.  Then, for some reason beyond my understanding, it turned on one day and wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  The \\&quot;on\\&quot; button wasn&#x27;t responding.  Shortly thereafter, it just died.  Wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.      I used it once a week at most.  There was actually a good three-week period in which I didn&#x27;t use it at all.  But I never dropped it, immersed it in water, over-charged it, or anything of that sort.  In fact, I&#x27;m quite careful with all of my appliances and this is the first thing that&#x27;s ever actually \\&quot;died\\&quot; on me without any cause.      I&#x27;m willing to give Philips the benefit of the doubt and say that this might have been a lemon.  Nevertheless, the trimming function on this one is seriously sub-par.  They have other models which are far better, and much cheaper.      I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  It has reliability issues and to answer my previous question about the vacuum function, it is DEFINITELY not worth the extra money, IMHO.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of listening to the positive reviews on this trimmer. Don&#x27;t believe them. The negative reviews are correct. The guide is defective for all the reasons given in the reviews. I was unable to get as good a trim on my face, where I keep my beard at 4 mm, as with the old 980--it simply didn&#x27;t cut all the hairs no matter how many times I went over it. But the real trouble was under the chin, where I cut closer. As other reviews state, the guide does not cover the cutter. And as the cutter is near the corner of the shaver, it will go as close to a curved surface as you let it--no guide to help out. Luckily, the blades don&#x27;t cut skin, or I&#x27;d be bleeding all over. And the curve between the jaw and the neck is the real trouble. Keeping the shaver level with the surface is irrelevant--the problem is cutting the hair around a concave surface. And if you lengthen the setting to recess the blades, those flexible pointy little daggers become the problem that more than one reviewer complained about. Now if you like to cut all this down to bare skin, then this shaver is 4 stars for you. But if you like to keep some beard down there, you&#x27;re in serious trouble with this shaver--there&#x27;s no getting an even cut on a concave surface. Worse, I got an uneven cut under my chin on a level surface, and I can&#x27;t begin to guess why--I kept that guide nice and level like a couple of reviewers went on to say as if the rest of us don&#x27;t know how to trim a beard.    The vacuum works much better on this shaver than the 980. And the door is better than the previous tray, which broke on me and required fixing with super glue, as another reviewer also experienced. The digital readout is great for old eyes. You can also shave very close with this trimmer (no guide on the corner), for those that want such a thing. For those like me with sensitive skin, not a plus.    Norelco ought to take the 4070 off the market--it is a terrible product and is damaging their reputation. And those folks that write glowing reviews, if they aren&#x27;t company shills, then they ought to stop and think about what they are encouraging people to buy. Listen to them and buy it if you must, like I did, but you&#x27;ve been warned. A beard trimmer should be easy to use to produce an even cut, even over the concave surfaces and especially the flat and convex surfaces. This one is not.    I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard for 35 years. First with scissors, then with a Remington, then Norelcos. The Norelcos have been great, until now. The 980&#x27;s motor died, not the battery.</li>
            <li> Comes with a great charger. Waterproof, works perfectly, great product</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome if you want to keep a scruffy look, no matter what length you keep your facial hair at.  The dial for length works great and the vacuum to suck up most of what you&#x27;re shaving off works wonderfully.  It has a very decent battery and lasts quite awhile without a charge.  I only use it every other day during the work week but even using it every day you can easily get a week out of one charge.  Gave it four stars because the door to the vacuum catch stopped closing properly on my device shortly after I got it.  I fixed it with some black electrical tape and just tap out the hair in the sink every morning when I&#x27;m done so I only have to thoroughly clean it every couple months.</li>
            <li> Before buying this trimmer, I was skeptical about the functionality of the vacuum especially after I read the reviews by other users. My experience, however, was quite different. After my first beard trim, I opened the vacuum compartment and found that it had collected most of the trimmed hair, although my basin almost looked like it was painted in beard hair :-). I would recommend this to anyone looking to &#x27;contain&#x27; trimmed hair flyaround. The trimmer blades are efficient and I like the part about minimum or no blade maintenance save for brushing it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the QT4070 twice now, but I&#x27;m already ready to dub it the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Other Amazon reviewers seem to feel the same way, AFTER they have Philips Norelco replace the \\&quot;poorly-designed comb\\&quot;.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m making that claim about this trimmer while using the comb that came with the it; really don&#x27;t foresee having any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this, I had used two trimmers.  Both of those were good with beard-length hair, but extremely inconsistent with stubble and my sideburns.  I haven&#x27;t put the QT4070 through the sideburns test yet, but it has handled everything else I&#x27;ve thrown at it -- 8mm goatee and 4mm stubble everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum certainly helps reduce mess, but it won&#x27;t eliminate it.  This was a motivating factor when I decided to buy this trimmer, so I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work as advertised.  (The instruction booklet mentions \\&quot;No Mess\\&quot; on several occasions.)  That being said, it does vastly reduce cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feature I bought it for -- the vacuum -- didn&#x27;t meet expectations, but I was so impressed with the trimmer itself that I still think it&#x27;s deserving of 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It works great and the vacuum is good.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Vacuum works great, cuts well at length. Only issue is getting a close cut for trimming before shaving with a blade (trimming around a goatee). I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase though and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard or scruff you like to keep trimmed - this is your tool. I have tried everything and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. &amp;#34;Contour following&amp;#34; comb makes it easy to move the trimmer over your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The vacuum system is gimmickry. It leaves your sink dirty, maybe a little less dirty than other normal trimmers. You will have to spend your time to clean your sink nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;2. This trimmer is not washable. So you will also have to spend time cleaning the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can look for something washable or something cheaper.</li>
            <li> works well, vac works as designed and is easy to clean.  Did not get a brush in the package so I had to improvise.</li>
            <li> Kinda large for trimming a mustache</li>
            <li> Battery is dismal in terms of usefulness per charge. I travel quite a bit and find that if I&#x27;m out any more then 3-4 days that I need to bring the charger with. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good beard trimmer but make sure you keep that charger with you.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer, love the vacuum system in it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this.  I previously had the T870 or T970 as I can&#x27;t tell for sure as the model # wore off.  It had a vacuum. And I used it to actually shave my face as I like to have a slightly stubbled look and to trim my goatee.  That said, I figured this new one would have to be a better design, right?  Well no. First off the old one I have had a spring loaded slide where the vacuum would suck the whiskers. The spring would allow you to get the razor close to your face.  I am not talking about the guide.  I take the guide off to shave and touch up the edges of my goatee.  Well this new model has a huge vacuum that is not spring loaded that makes it hard to get the actual razor close to your face.  This makes it very hard to be precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT TO MENTION, all the bad reviews for them saying it comes with the contour comb which it doesn&#x27;t.  Well you can call and they will send you one.  But guess what, they are always on backorder which I am starting to think that they do that so your 45 day try it or money back guarantee expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine them coming up with this prototype and having guys try it who have used early models. I can&#x27;t believe they wouldn&#x27;t have raised all the issue I just raised as well as the contour comb issue.  I think they figured that the vacuum being better was the main thing and on paper, the way it&#x27;s designed it is.  The only problem is being precise, which is what you want with a beard trimmer goes out the window.  I think they approved the design on paper, then realized after the fact that it didn&#x27;t work so they figured they&#x27;d confuse people by not putting in the contour comb, then when your 45 days expires, you get the contour comb and you realize it still doesn&#x27;t do what you want, but it&#x27;s too late.  Maybe I am wrong on that, but one thing I am right on is this is not near as good as the old model I had at TRIMMING YOUR BEARD.  If having a great vacuum is your main concern then this is your trimmer.  I just can&#x27;tbelieve they could go backwards in design from the T870/T970 to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I&#x27;d rather clean up whiskers from the sink than have my goatee look uneven and not straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These companies that try to improve but go backwards kill me.  I just can&#x27;t see any man who works there designing these not noticing the problem. Maybe they all don&#x27;t have beards or goatees.  Probably a corporate policy!  No beards at the beard trimmer corporation.</li>
            <li> First things first, great shaver, maybe the best WHEN you have all the parts.  Like all other reviews say, it&#x27;s missing the Contour Comb top which makes it extremely difficult to get an EVEN shave without stabbing yourself.  I&#x27;ve been on the phone with Philips Norelco 3 times since 12/26/11 and today they just told me they&#x27;ve discontinued the shaver because of all the calls/complaints they&#x27;ve been getting.  They try to tell you that shaver doesn&#x27;t come with that part and that the part is for the QT4050, but it says right on their box that it&#x27;s included!  They are currently backordered on the part and they&#x27;ve discontinued the product which tells me they&#x27;re probably not going to support them if you buy them now.  I&#x27;d avoid this product, it&#x27;s a hassle.  I&#x27;m still waiting for my part, they say another 2 weeks...we&#x27;ll see, still can&#x27;t use the shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift.  The recipient said it worked very well and he was pleased with it.  Item arrived in good shape and in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Norelco T980 and loved it. However, after years of use it no longer held a charge for a reasonable amount of time. Because of all of the negative reviews regarding the comb on the QT4070, I decided to go another direction for a replacement.  My first replacement for the T980 was the QT4022. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews. It&#x27;s very difficult to use the QT4022 at any length other than the shortest setting. Since the comb doesn&#x27;t wrap completely around the blade, you have to hold the trimmer perfectly level to get an even cut. Since I didn&#x27;t always want my beard quite that short, it just wasn&#x27;t working for me. Also, although I didn&#x27;t think I would, I missed the vacuum from the T980.  So, after more research I decided to give the QT4070 a try. I decided that, other than the negative reviews regarding the comb, it seemed to be the most highly reviewed. And, although not the most convenient solution, there at least seemed to be a solution to the comb issue... call and ask for the contour comb. I placed the order and received the QT4070 yesterday. Much to my surprise (and relief) the contour comb was included in the original packaging. It looks like they may have finally figured out their comb issue.  So I tried it out yesterday and enjoy it (so far) even more than the T980. Definitely the best beard trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> i dont&#x27; know what the heck i was doing before I had this trimmer. Several people compliment on my beard SINCE i got this thing.</li>
            <li> The original vacuum trimmer was much better - too bad they keep changing. The deficiency is mostly, in my view, at the level of accuracy and ease of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s time they improved the things that really need improvement instead of the things that don&#x27;t (the turbo, for me, is completely unnecessary and the lithium battery is nice, but not a big deal): e.g., a hard case for travel (this machine is very fragile and easily breaks in travel - i need to come up with my own ways to protect it), and a charger-dock (its shape makes it volatile on slippery surfaces, like, say, a sink edge). And how about this: the charger dock can be built into the hard case.&lt;br /&gt;Just basics.</li>
            <li> So my t980 is starting to get a little dull after I have replaced the blade once, so I figured I would upgrade to the newer, \\&quot;better\\&quot; model. Not so much.     Packaging:  Easy to open and item came with half charge so could try immediately.     What&#x27;s in the box:  Trimmer, charger cord, and cleaning brush....NO POUCH OR CASE LIKE T980!!!      Using the trimmer:  A setting of 6 is like a 4 setting on the T980. Also, you need two hands to change setting as its not exactly accessible with your thumb  The system itself is much quieter than the older models which is nice. The system cut pretty well with few split beard hairs.     So, I though the reviews that the vacuum doesn&#x27;t work that well were exaggerated. They are not!  I had just as much hair on my hands and on top of the trimmer than in the hair catch. Onto the hair catch, it&#x27;s awful. It doesn&#x27;t pop out separate from the trimmer like the T980 where you can knock out the hair from the side of the sink. A little door opens from the trimmer and you have to shake to get the hair to fall out or get the cleaning brush that came with it. What&#x27;s te point of that?    Overall two stars and a returning products.  The two stars are for nice cutting, quieter operation, and nice display of length and battery charge. Missing the other three for disastroopus design, awful vacuum feature that doesn&#x27;t work worth anything, no case, non detachable hair reservoir, and leaving a mess everywhere.     My advice, don&#x27;t buy until they release another model that addresses the above.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick heavy annoying beard that I need to shave every two weeks, this trimmer gets the job done.. and the vacuum... omg best solution ever.... It does make the shaving experience much cleaner n better... trust me i&#x27;m a mess when comes to shaving due to my annoying thick hairy beard.. so this trimmer is the best shaver ever... considering i had have like 6 to 10 different machines from different brands.. this one is good.. even for body trimmer is excellent..</li>
            <li> Already have one of these and bought another for two different locations.  In my opinion, this is the best stubble shaver on the market and a great product.  Instead of shaving every morning as before for decades, I now shave about once s week with minimum fuss and cleanup.  A tremendous time saver and always looking &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Good cutting power, especially on Turbo, good battery (my last version of this was NiCad, which just stops charging after a short time). Really does reduce the mess, but don&#x27;t expect perfection. On Turbo not too many hairs get away though. I use it to trim my beard and hair all one length so it gets a workout every week, and has been going strong for a month or two now, I think. The best one I have found, out of the handful I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: removing one star, as this is one of the few beard trimmers at this price point that does not include a fine trimmer attachment - very annoying. Every time I use it I have to either grab a scissors or an older trimmer that did come with the right attachment to finish up the job. In fact, this is so annoying I almost took two stars off, but I still think it&#x27;s the best trimmer out there for the basic task.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess free trimmer with best results. It&#x27;s easy to use and trim the stubble nice and soft with no pain.</li>
            <li> I like this thing quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Nice style easy to use.</li>
            <li> impossible to use it,, there is an empty space that whatever size u set it to,, it will still shave size 0 mm :S  i tried to use it 3 times.. and now i want to return it ...  i have used wahl or Remington for 7 years i never had the same problem.. Philips is the worst ever..  note: i have been shaving for myself and my dad since 7 years.. and with this machine is it impossible  please click yes if you find my comment is helpful :)</li>
            <li> The functioning of the QT4070 is as described, but it is far too large to maneuver as a mustache trimmer unless you have a gigantic face.  There are smaller, less expensive trimmers that are better for the mustache.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> There were a few reviews that commented on the guard being terrible, but Philips is now shipping this clipper with the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; guard as well as the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; one, and the good one is great.  Works fantastic to keep my beard looking well kept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice even trip, and easily adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for multiple shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Love the vacuum function... doesn&#x27;t get it all, but really prevents a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I honestly have no complaints.  Perhaps it&#x27;s a bit tough to clean... but thats true for all clippers.</li>
            <li> For owners coming from a t980...the guide comb is not the same as the t980. There is a gap on top as other reviewers have said that allows a closer trim around your jaw and chin when angled incorrectly. If you are looking for a closed comb go buy the qt4050. It has the exact same comb as the t980 and you will not be upset. You won&#x27;t have the turbo feature or the \\&quot;best trimmer on the market\\&quot;, but you will not run the risk of stabbing yourself as one reviewer has said. Philips screwed this one up!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not bad , but expected more. The vacuum doesnt get all the hairs and as the blade is quite wide i have to buy a separate trimmer for  trimming around my mustache</li>
            <li> The product feels very cheap since it is made from plastic and the beard trimmer door feels fragile and I am afraid I will break it someday. That being said I can get an even cut with the trimmer and I really like all the different sizes it has and the way it presents them. Additionally the vacuum suck works but not 100% however I was not expecting it to collect every hair anyways.</li>
            <li> appears to work but not all whiskers end up in the trap window.</li>
            <li> Buy this now! Powerful and non messy. A lot better than a wahl, which is shocking</li>
            <li> Bought this Norelco to replace an old one that was pretty much falling apart.  I went through about 4 different trimmers till I landed with this one.  I like this unit due to the fact that the guard setting can simply be rotated in, a very cool feature.  Battery lasts forever also.</li>
            <li> I bought one of Norelco&#x27;s first vacuum beard trimmers some years ago.  It was very noisy, used antiquated NiCad battery technology, the vacuum rubbed the case and strained if you held it the wrong way, the comb clogged easily, the length adjustment changed too easily by accident, was difficult to re-attach to the trimmer, and I was forever dropping the filter screen when tapping the hair compartment clean.  The QT4070 is a huge improvement:  Congrats to Norelco for finally employing rechargeable battery technology that isnn&#x27;t obsolete by the time the trimmer leaves the factory.  Sleeping wives will appreciate that the vacuum is MUCH quiter and then sound is less harsh.  The depth control locks positively through a wider range of adjustment than I think I will ever need.  The trimmer is easy to hold and control.  No bulbous weird shapes like some other brands, and now the inclusion of a more modern, light-weight and compact switching power supply that accepts 100V-240V means the kit is lighter overall and easy to pack.  A locking feature means it won&#x27;t turn itself on while stuffed into your luggage.  I had been using painter&#x27;s tape to keep my old trimmer from doing that.  The bad:  Norelco no longer chooses to include a travel pouch.  Is that really too much to ask?  I can re-use an old one but other travelers may find themselves using a plastic bag to keep whiskers from floating around in their luggage.  One of the included combs is essentially useless.  The one without the contour following feature has comb prongs that will jab you, and an enormous gap over the cutting blades that will inevitably cause bloodshed.  I don&#x27;t know who would use that or why.  I was hoping for some substantial improvement in the trimmer&#x27;s ability to capture whiskers.  It is a bit better than the old one and the QT4070&#x27;s noisier turbo mode, yet more so.  It&#x27;s great at keeping longer, lighter cut hair from ending up clogging my sink drain but there is still a fair amount of clean-up of little whiskers required after trimming a short beard.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is excellent. I had an older Norelco trimmer that was basically the same thing, and I used it for probably 5-6 years, but it was starting to die and pieces were breaking, so I had to replace it.  This newer version works very well for adjusting beard height, and the contour comb piece is great. It is very easy to clean, and portable. I definitely would recommend this, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my complaints and they are minor, but they are the reason for 4 stars instead:  it doesn&#x27;t have an attachment for getting hard to reach areas, like under your nose. My old razor had one and it was very convenient, and also good for areas around your lips for mustache trimming. The brush that it comes with is also very tiny and hard to grip. I actually threw it out and still use my old Norelco brush because it&#x27;s much easier to clean with that one.</li>
            <li> At last Norelco has re-designed the beard trimmer to solve the problem with the spring pin loaded comb that constantly broke necessitating having to re-buy the entire trimmer. I&#x27;m now on my 4th trimmer in almost as many years. The new comb is a solid piece of plastic that does the job and has no parts that can break. They have also improved the vacuum system on the new models.    Gone though, is the smaller trim blade unit. Oh well, you can&#x27;t have everything,</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well. I like their older model better however that&#x27;s no longer made and this model does the job.</li>
            <li> Having read several extreme negative reviews of this product I was hesitant to buy the shaver but did on the basis of the very good to excellent reviews.  I have been delighted with the product.  It is just what I was looking for in a stubble-look trimmer.  I trim at the 1 setting and have never been stabbed or poked by the tines.  My partner has also ordered one based on how well it worked for me.  This is a great product particularly if you&#x27;re looking for the stubble look.  Previous shavers were work to use (multiple runs to get the stubble even) but this one works like a charm.  My shaving time is cut by 2/3.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works great and so far the trimmer works great as well.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does just what is says it does. This is the second Norelco product, used the old model until the battery would not hold a charge.  I will but the next model when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s been 6 months and the battery is already dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: Never let your electronics go completely dead, electronics with cheaper batteries or with battery monitors (like this one) need a little power to charge, if it&#x27;s dead so is the rest of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a super thick beard but it just missed hair after hair. You gotta go over the same hairs 4-5 times. The longer the setting the worse it got. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 1 star was because the vacuum works very well and with very short shaves it&#x27;s great. Don&#x27;t buy this if you want a shave over 3mm, it just sucks (if you&#x27;ll pardon the pun)</li>
            <li> The vacuum works well. Fits my hand nicely.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his!</li>
            <li> Requires frequent cleanups even during a single use as the vacuume does not work very well.  Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband. Chose this model for vacuum and turbo. No other trimmer had vacuum, and it really works well! Husband said turbo is great too!</li>
            <li> Trims evenly. Retains 50ish percent of hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent device. Great battery power. I like the shave level adjustment. Vacuum works well to keep things clean. Overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I am using this for two months now. It does work OK. The vacuum works OK, the suction  is good.  It really helps with the mess of the cut hair.  The one problem I am facing is that it&#x27;s trimming is not that great. It works but you can&#x27;t really always achieve the length you select.  If you are not that concerned with the ease of trimming - it is a very good choice.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged, shipped quickly. It&#x27;s a good trimmer but I&#x27;ve had better ones. The comb on top doesn&#x27;t allow for an even trim, I find that no matter how many times I run the trimmer over my jaw line it still doesn&#x27;t trim at the same length. The buzzer itself it great the only issue is the comb that attaches to the top.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift and haven&#x27;t heard any complaints. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Either the designer never had a beard or the R &amp; D department were without beards because this is a poorly designed, ineffective trimmer. As the other reviewer said, this machine stabs you. Do not even think about using this to trim a mustache as the guard is too big for any close work. I will gladly give mine to anyone for free.</li>
            <li> Got this as a birthday gift for my fella last year. His shaver died and he needed a new one. I chose it because it has the vacuum/hair collecting feature. There is very little hair left in the sink/on the vanity at home. It took him a few shaves to get his goatee even with a new device and all, but nearly a year later it&#x27;s still great. It&#x27;s slim design fits perfectly in the medicine cabinet and it holds a charge extremely well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dead within a year. Don&#x27;t buy it !</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QT4070/41 Beard Trimmer 7300 is on the top end of their line of trimmers.  I hesitated at first but when Amazon offered it at a lower price than I could find on eBay I purchased it.  Great deal with fast delivery.  I opened the package, which is a challenge in itself, and plugged it in to charge up.  While the battery was charging I took a look at the included instructions.  Another daunting task because of all it can do.  Once it was ready to go I disconnected the charging cord, followed the instructions, put on the Trimming Comb, set the length I wanted to try, and was ready to give it a try.  It should be noted that there is a table in the instructions that give you the length in inches for each available setting of 1 to 18,  They recommend starting with a higher setting and descending until you reach the desired length.  The Trimming Comb is meant to follow the contours of a man&#x27;s face and it works quite well.  The neatest (pun intended) thing about this trimmer is that it comes with a vacuum Hair Collection Chamber.  As you cut it sucks in the cut whiskers, which you empty as necessary.  It works great!  I was very satisfied with the entire experience.  The second time I went to use it, which was about one week later, I again was going to use it without the charging cord.  However, the battery was so low it would not turn on.  I had to plug it in and use it with charging cord attached.  That did not present much of a problem because the cord is quite long.  I was however, very disappointed with the quality of the battery that was included.  I am hoping that if I charge it longer I will get more that one trim when using it cordless.  In summary, I am very pleased that I spent the extra money for this model.  It is easy to use, makes clean up a breeze, and resulted in a trim that brought many compliments from my friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using different types of trimmers for last 8 years, I never shave and trim everyday before work. This is the best I have seen! Really vacuums all the hair, leaves no dirt and I had no problems using it!</li>
            <li> This really is a great product.   Had previously used it once at a friends house and when I was looking to buy a new trimmer I figured it was a good choice.  After using it for 6 weeks I can happily say it was the right choice. The charge has held very well and the product still works just like out of the box.  I use this without the guard for trimming my stubble and then with the guard at 8-13mm for trimming my sideburns and hair and it works great for both purposes.   Have never been so satisfied with a trimmer before.</li>
            <li> So I want to start out by saying this is a Beard Trimmer not a shaver. So don&#x27;t expect a close shave this isn&#x27;t what this product is for. Anyways let&#x27;s begin. The product came nicely packaged easy to open but had to be charged upon trying to turn it on. I also noticed it came with two guards for the trimmer once preinstalled and the other in the box. I use the one that doesn&#x27;t protrude into your skin and kinda just lets its glide over you. I knoe protrude sounds harsh and it is harsh if you use the other one lightly you will be fine. The vacuum seems to work great. Hairs still fall but not as many as you would expect so the vacuum is worth it in my opinion. The adjustable settings are nice as well 1-18mm I believe. (I only use 1-3mm) You are also able to take off the guard to be able to get even closer. Gives you a sort of 5&#x27; o clock shadow I guess but it wont be shaving it down to your skin that&#x27;s for sure. I bought this basically to trim my beard but I like shaping it up with a hand razor. Once I have my beard to a desired height i guess (2mm usually) I take off the guard and make an outline of where I&#x27;m going to be using my razor. Then I lather up and clean up basically. I&#x27;m rating this a 5 it does the job fine because it does say &amp;#34;Beard Trimmer&amp;#34; not electronic razor so it does what it&#x27;s meant to do &amp;#34;Trim&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Currently, this model by Philips and the Remington Touch trimmer are the state-of-the-art beard trimmers on the market. While the jury&#x27;s still out on the latter, given its very recent release date, the QT4050 &amp; 4070 lines have been out since 2009/10 respectively. I purchased the QT4070 recently and used it on a 4-week beard. The result was arguably the best trim I&#x27;ve ever had, owing to the innovative cutting design (flat head versus slanted, as with other trimmers), the consistency of the cutting, and the efficient motor, providing the torque needed to trim through a wiry undergrowth of facial hair (the turbo button is useful here). The vacuum feature works rather well, so that roughly 85% of the hairs were trapped in the receptacle beneath the cutting blades, obviating the need to use a towel or bowl under the sink to prevent drain clogging. The included brush suffices to clean miscellaneous hairs stuck to the blades (which conveniently require no oiling or other maintenance). Finally, the versatility of the trimmer, allowing up to 18mm of cutting length, puts it miles ahead of most brands on the market at department stores and pharmacies (Wahl, Conair, Braun, etc.). Conversely, Philips did produce a \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; beard trimmer that was woefully under-performing and cumbersome, so this line of trimmers is clearly an improvement. Overall, I&#x27;d rate the product a solid 9 out of 10. In future, perhaps a trimmer operating with lower noise emissions would round it out to a perfect score.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco beard trimmers before and they typically are very nice.  This one, however, has a hole in the guide which makes it incredibly easy to slip up on the angle you&#x27;re shaving at and cut your beard as if there&#x27;s no guide at all.  This is a horribly designed product.  I realize that \\&quot;I&#x27;m not using it correctly\\&quot; but this isn&#x27;t difficult to prevent incorrect usage.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to read the directions regarding the correct angle of attack in order to prevent over trimming my beard.  Find a different trimmer, this one is atrocious.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually purchase this product from Amazon, I actually rushed by a local retail outlet even though I had to pay $10 more, since I had a professional engagement and needed grooming in a hurry. I read all the reviews related to the Philips Norelco, the Braun, the Panasonic and the Wahl products, and my final choice was between the Philips Norelco and the Wahl for good solid results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What attracted me to this product was the fact that it seemed more solid and powerful than the Panasonic (the Turbo button does work) and like the Wahl had the one hour charge with the Lithium Ion battery. While like the Panasonic, since it is adjustable without changing combs you don&#x27;t need all the bits and pieces that may be hard to find as time goes by. It seemed like the best no-fuss solution, without the vibration of the Wahl and yet more powerful than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What gave me trepidation was the design flaw alluded to in the other reviews (the gap exposing the tines), and I will be calling up on Monday to get my Qt4050 comb. So it was with some nervousness that I approached actually using the product for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one hour charge was just that, I plugged it in and charged it and the convenient charge level lights showed it was charged, and it was quite powerful without the chord upon use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my first impression actually trimming my beard (I first watch this helpful video to make sure I got the angle right [...] was so delightful, I felt I had to write this review because the ones written so far seemed to be giving it a bad rap, and if there had been more positive reviews (I can only speak from my experience with my own medium length beard) my choice would have been much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working from the neckline up with the top flat part against my skin with the comb lifting the hair and the cutters in the first line of attack, I got barber shop results in three passes, one with the setting on 18, and one on 16, and one quick fix-it trim with the comb removed (give it a good pull to remove it, slip it on with no force whatsoever when you have the right vertical angle). Without the comb, my moustache was a breeze to trim also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To finish up, without the comb, I trimmed a clear beard borderline down to my neck in reverse position, without once feeling any pulling or discomfort of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole operation lasted a maximum of ten minutes and was a lot of fun.d (give it a good pull to remove it, slip it on with no force whatsoever when you have the right vertical angle). Without the comb, my moustache was a breeze to trim also.    To finish up, without the comb, I trimmed a clear beard borderline down to my neck in reverse position, without once feeling any pulling or discomfort of any kind.    The whole operation lasted a maximum of ten minutes and was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> My wife does not like to find hairs all over the bathroom.  This trimmer isn&#x27;t perfect but it SIGNIFICANTLY reduces the mess from a beard trim to the point where its not hard to clean up what is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but positive things to say about this beard trimmer.  I previously had the precursor to this product (T980) I believe and in almost all ways this is an improvement.  First off the battery.  They switched form nicad to lithium and it was quite an improvement.  The battery on this thing just goes and goes and goes (which is great).  Secondly it hasn&#x27;t died.  My T980 died after about 2 years which is why I bought this trimmer.  It just seems like this unit is going to last a little longer.  The reason i&#x27;m so positive on this uint, however, is that it DOES A GREAT JOB at sucking up the hair from my beard.  When I&#x27;m done i usually have a few hairs left in the sink i can just wipe down the drain with my hand and then run some water.  Its awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to the previous model:&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve added the digital display which is nice although i don&#x27;t really stray much from the 5mm setting so it serves mostly as looking nice than functional for me.  They no longer include a carrying case and the little mustache trimmer isn&#x27;t included any longer but i never used it so i&#x27;m indifferent on the topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel lock works well although it does require the charging cable to unlock so make sure you don&#x27;t forget it when you travel (a mistake i did once)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt; - KEEPS THE MESS TO A MINIMUM&lt;br /&gt; - Great battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt; - Phillips no longer includes a carrying case with this model&lt;br /&gt; - The charging cable is required to unlock the unit once it was put into travel lock mode&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:&lt;br /&gt;- When you empty out the hair from the chamber it looks kind of ugly i guess.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my previous Philips Norelco trimmer (they don&#x27;t make my previous model anymore). I need a beard trimmer for work. Who needs a beard trimmer for work, and where do you work where you would need such a device you might ask? Let&#x27;s just say I can grow out my facial hair and when/if the time requires I am mandated to shave it. Thus I needed something I can have with me out in the field and be able to shave at a moments notice. The QT4070/41 does not hold a charge at all and there has been several occasions I needed this device and it was deader than a petrified mummy. So the straight razor came out... ever try to dry shave a months worth of beard on a straight razor? DON&#x27;T!!! I&#x27;d rather get calf implants in a third world country (not really). I&#x27;m in the process of talking to Customer Service with PN to see if they can fix the problem.</li>
            <li> best trimmer i have used and i had 4 different ones, the only bad part is its next to impossible to trim around your nose but it can be done.  i\\&quot;d give it 4.5 stars overall</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase. It has a good range of hair length settings.   The vacuum portion works good. No hair all over. I trim once a week,   and charge the battery after about 8 or 10 trims. I do not have a full   beard, just a partial, so your charging cycles will vary.</li>
            <li> As stated in most of the reviews above this beard trimmer no longer arrives with the correct comb. It should come with a \\&quot;contour\\&quot; comb that doesn&#x27;t have a huge gap in it. The stubble comb in comes with creates a very uneven shave. When I went to the manufacturers website it appears that the shaver has been discontinued along with the stubble comb, and the contour comb is out of stock. I would strongly recommend you do not waste money on such a faulty product. Their customer service was unable to provide me with the contour comb, or a refund because I wasn&#x27;t the original person to purchase it (it was a Christmas gift).</li>
            <li> Works well and is much neater to use than old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not only does my woman think I&#x27;m immaculately groomed and rediculously sexy with my fierce beard game but she also wants to ravage me every time she enters the bathroom.  She thinks that I&#x27;m actually cleaning up all those pesky whiskers upon completion of my manly maintenance rituals.  What she doesn&#x27;t know is that this little blue and black gift from the Gods does it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Norelco, you changed my life.</li>
            <li> I bought a shaving machine face from you, and I do not like it at all I want to return it what should I do?</li>
            <li> I usually avoid Philips products like the plague. I have had experience of expensive Philips products failing the quality test too many times, from active speakers through to shavers. I therefore no longer buy Philips products. I received this product free of charge via the vine programme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice box so would look good for a present. The trimmer itself is sleek looking and appears to be of good quality, but too early to tell if it will last the rigours of the guarantee period. It has a digital display that is very useful and tells you when the battery needs recharging/partially charged and fully charged by use of different colours. The display also shows trimmer length. The trimmer itself can be adjusted to one of 18 different lengths, 1mm to 18mm. The head also moves to allow it to follow the contours of your face. The suction system is not perfect but is pretty good. Some hair did fall away but the system sucks up maybe 95% of all the hair that gets trimmed. So overall the product seems to be of reasonable quality and does exactly what it says it does, trims all kinds of hair safely and without too much hair dropping on the floor. Overall its a good product, but its difficult to judge if it is better than a trimmer at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So great product and is recommended.</li>
            <li> Does a great trimming job and has various lengths.  The vacuum ensures no mess.  Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the fifth Norelco Beard Trimmer I&#x27;ve owned in 22 years.  The first one died after about 10 years and the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge.  The second one was put in the trash this week because the length setting stopped working so here we are with number 3.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m good for another 10 years!!!  Well the vacuum door fell off after 18 months and it wasn&#x27;t abused.  Therefore in March 2015 I purchased the Model #QT4014/42, the 3500 trimmer.  Bad idea.  Too small and doesn&#x27;t cut well.  So in October 2015 I purchased another 7300.  There is a free 3 year extended warranty in the box so that&#x27;s good.  You have to register on line to qualify.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, it gives an excellent consistent shave without irritation.  The vacuum does a wonderful job at reducing hair mess.  Its not perfect, some hair does escape and the reservoir fills up quickly.  However, it is still a welcome addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Excellent razor, close shave, very little mess&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate waste, Reservoir fills up quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer off amazon and it has been a pretty good product so far. It seems to trim my face pretty evenly  and has yet to cut me. I consider myself to be and aggressive shaver and trimmer. I am usually in a hurry and also press it pretty firmly against my face. The vacuum system actually works very well. I rarely have to do much cleaning up and share a bathroom with a roommate so this is a big perk. There are only a couple things about this trimmer that I didn&#x27;t like but that I can live with. With the way it is designed, you can&#x27;t get the piece of plastic completely out of the way to get a really close shave. That&#x27;s ok because it is still fairly close. Also, the numbers that appear on the screen of my shaver are sometimes wrong. That&#x27;s ok because I just look at the side measurements to see what the actual setting is. Also, this can sometimes be fixed by just scrolling the settings wheel to one extreme end of the spectrum and back</li>
            <li> I began shaving my head in 1996 and since then I have been using many many shavers to do so. Most of them were corded and it was a real production shaving and then cleaning the area afterwards. I also used a number of cordless shavers when I travelled. After my older Philips Norelco died permanently (the NiCad batter would not charge any longer), I purchased this one. What I realized is that not only it is great for taking it with me while traveling, I can (and do!) use it for shaving at home. Prior to getting it, I would shave one every 2 weeks as the process was time consuming. Now, I do it every week as it take about 5 mins total. In addition, I love the feature that is has for locking the power button while traveling. My older one would turn on while being in the travel case and being pressed lightly requiring me to come up with a way to securely cover the power button with something hard. Overall, I am very happy with the new trimmer/shaver and cannot recommend it well enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the popup trimmer on my Braun Series 7 shaver for the purposes of both maintaining beard length and defining lines. For length, it does what it can with 18mm and it does an okay job. But take the guard off and try to use the trimmer directly for defining sharp lines and this thing is utterly useless. I still use my Braun popup trimmer for lines which is very badly ergonomically designed, because with this trimmer I have to literally saw at the edge of my beard and still doesn&#x27;t cut even the shortest hairs.</li>
            <li> Great product. But even with vacuum, the hair is falling and making a mess.</li>
            <li> Rechargeable trimmers are still just too weak to go through any beard efficiently, unless you&#x27;re going for stubble. Then again, this is true of every single trimmer I have tried, and is not unique to this model. There just flat out aren&#x27;t any good cordless trimmers that are strong enough/long lasting enough to get a beard trimmed up without it taking over 30 minutes and having to re-trim the same area over and over to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not very good for trimming mustache/under the nose, too bulky to get an even trim.</li>
            <li> I like the variance in the settings and the fast recharge time.</li>
            <li> I own the older T980 which was excellent.  I got this new model as a gift.  I asked for it since I figured it would be an excellent upgrade.  First off it did not come with the advertised contour following comb (advertised on Amazon and on Norelco&#x27;s own website).  The comb it comes with was absolute junk and messed up my beard.  As another reviewer recommended I called Norelco and they sent the contour following comb.  They acted like they had no idea it was not in the box and had never heard of anyone not getting it.  Lame!  With the contour following comb here are the pros:  -Lithium ion batteries are so much better.  -The trim height adjustment does not get changed accidentally like it did with the T980.  -It gives a great trim (WITH the NON-included contour following comb).  Cons:  -The vacuum does not work anywhere near as well as it did with the older T980.  I cannot use this trimmer if I already have my shirt on because it blows whiskers EVERYWHERE.  Perhaps the vacuum does not work as well with the contour following comb.  But one must use that comb to keep from gouging oneself and from gouging out hunks of beard.  I give this a 2 star because of the following reasons:  1.  Norelco is knowingly false advertising the included accessories.  2.  Amazon still is advertising incorrectly too.  3.  The vacuum does not work well.  I think my next trimmer will not be a Norelco.  I have used them for years.  Had they included the correct comb and if the vacuum worked as good as their old model this would be the best trimmer on the market.  Shame on you Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy.The product is easy to use and is very handy, you can carry it with a small bag.</li>
            <li> I only trust Norelco Vacuum trimmers, this is my third. The only annoying thing is the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; option, feels like it should always run at that speed. The adjustments are very precise and doesn&#x27;t move like other trimmers. The LED screen battery indicator is very usfeull. I hate having my trimmer run out mid-shave.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s meant to do--allows you to sport a bad-ass stubble with hassle-free trimming. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of trimmers in the past 10 years and I&#x27;m happy to report that this trimmer is the iPad 2 of the trimmer industry. Easy to use, clean \\&quot;interface\\&quot; and leaves an even stubble. Really, what else can you ask for? 5 stars without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Despite the name, the QT4070 really isn&#x27;t a mustache trimmer.  The vacuum chamber, while being useful in gathering clippings, also gets in the way of precision cutting of your mustache.  I like to get a nice clean line at the edge of my lip and the bulky trimmer prevents me from seeing where I&#x27;m cutting.  Fortunately Amazon&#x27;s return policy allows me to send it back so I can look for a device that is slimmer at the cutting end and better suited to mustaches.</li>
            <li> This exceeded my expectations. The old one i had was just tired and needed replacing. Maybe that has an impact on my impression of this new one, but wow is this thing powerful and precise! Cuts perfectly even and the vacuum function actually works (my old one had a vacuum also and it didn&#x27;t do much). He battery has never even shown a sign of fading at all. I try not to leave it plugged so it doesn&#x27;t get that memory issue.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased. This does the job nicely!!</li>
            <li> It shaves and trims your beard, other than that it is a piece of garbage I regret buying. The vacuum feature works poorly and any one who buys a trimmer would be better off with a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good product but tricky to learn to use.  Vacuum is a nice plus but you have to angle it just right.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver in March 2013, as I was drawn in by the vacuum functionality.  Anyone who regularly trims with the goal of a close stubble look knows what a nightmare this can make your bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the new razor delivered:  A close shave, ease of use and most importantly no more stubble in the sink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, plastic components are sub-par (as indicated by some other reviewers).  Just six weeks after purchase, one of the plastic length guards snapped off while shaving, putting me at risk for cuts if I wasn&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most recently, four months after purchase, the plastic latch that keeps the hair chamber closed broke, meaning it is at risk of swinging open and spilling shavings at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips offers a generous 24 month warranty and replaced the whole unit under warranty.  That said, I fear this new unit will be plagued with the same issues.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this to replace an old Remington that finally gave up. This does a great job and is sleek and smaller than the one he had. However, the directions are very confusing. He tried to read them and just got frustrated. I finally just tried to play with it for a minute and figured it out. Tnk overall he&#x27;ll like this</li>
            <li> it charges quickly and lasts a long time, and it trims the crap out of my beard. i look like george michael now.</li>
            <li> This poorly designed piece of garbage gives a completely uneven (and painful) trim because of the horrible comb that comes with it.  It&#x27;s open in the middle, so if you hold it at almost any angle, the actual razor portion of the trimmer comes in contact with your skin.  Please don&#x27;t buy this thing.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Doesnt get all hair or give a very even neat trim without SEVERAL passes, who knows maybe my face fur is coarse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews, complaining about the design of the blade guard. Personally, I use the trimmer mainly for beard stubble so I use it without the blade guard. It provides a perfectly even trim and the vacuum works very well to eliminate mess (I&#x27;ve even used it in the car). Haven&#x27;t had any issues using the blade guard for trimming body hair- works very well. Battery life is great - I charged it before a 3week vacation and had more than enough battery life to last the entire trip (using it about every-other day). Also has a convenient travel lock to prevent it from accidentally turning on while packed. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like my older one better, this unit will nick you if it can.</li>
            <li> I like it, came with two combs, I like using it with my goatee, whish it came with charger stand.</li>
            <li> Bad quality. The little door on the front stopped closing reliably after a single drop. Have to hold it shut to make it work. But even besides that, the trimmer often stops working with a single letter E on the little LCD screen. Have to restart it again a few times before it works again. Turbo feature actually makes it hit a dead stop with the E, so that feature is useless to me.</li>
            <li> Pros: The battery life is good - I only have to charge this every couple of weeks using it every other day. The adjustable length is quite nice as well, especially with the digital display. The trimmer is also quite comfortable to use. This trimmer does the job decently well, but several gripes lower the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The vacuum collects some hair, but leaves a lot in the sink (even if you clean out the chamber between trimmings). It&#x27;s better than a regular trimmer in this regard, but not quite as good as I&#x27;d hoped. The closure for the hair collection chamber is poorly designed - a small plastic tab holds it closed and mine broke off after about a month of gentle use. I now hold the door closed with a hair elastic which works okay, but not great. As for cutting quality, I find that I need to go over the same area several times to avoid leaving stray long hairs and the cut is not the cleanest. I suspect sharper blades would help here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: This trimmer does a fine job for the price, but when it fully breaks I&#x27;ll be looking for other options.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price. It doesn&#x27;t pick up all the clippings but it picks up most. Con- It would be perfect if it cut the hair down all of the way. Unfortunately my man needs a regular razor plus this. The longer setting is nice for other body hair as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely to keep a stubble / 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look -- and I was horribly disappointed.  The description says it can trim to 1mm with the comb on, and 1/2 mm with the comb removed.  After seeing the product in person, that is pure fiction.  The stationary part of the trimming blade, which sits between your skin and the cutting blade, is nearly a full 1 mm thick.  And of course the product has to be held at an angle to be used, the blades are set back from the leading edge, and no hair ever grows straight out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, your beard won&#x27;t be as short as advertised.  Not even close.  I&#x27;d estimate 1.5mm is the absolute minimum.  For me that was about 48 hrs-60hrs of growth.  I asked my wife if it looks professional (and she thinks 24-36 hrs of beard on me does), and she said &amp;#34;no, that just looks like you haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple/few days.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I&#x27;d bet that no other beard trimmer can do any better.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use. Great shape and easy to hold. Charges fast. No mess. Does exactly what I want. Would recomend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was very disatisfied to realize that after careful reviews prior to buying this product, I wound up with a poorly designed product anyway. There is an opening near the teeth of the device for the vacuum to operate. However, the placement of the gap is positioned where you can&#x27;t help but scalp yourself when trimming. In my opinion, technology should provide an easy/ fail safe way of doing day to day tasks... Basically make our life easier. All being said, I rate this product very poorly!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products on the market.  No mess or clean up when you are finished shaving.  It is easy to use and achieve the desired length of your beard. It is comfortable to hold and has a long battery life before it needs to be recharged.  I highly recommend the Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Norelco T980 when it gave up after a couple of years. There really isn&#x27;t a competing product with built-in vacuum from any other manufacture, so I decided to go with the Qt4070 despite mixed reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot; and regular comb were both included in the factory box. I don&#x27;t think the new type \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot; is as good as the one on the old T980, but with a bit of attention it works well enough for me to do the job with only a little poking and snagging on my face.  I keep my facial hair trimmed to 4 mm (setting # 4, pretty short) and the vacuum clipping storage compartment is large enough to not need emptying until after trimming is complete each time. I always use the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; setting, and the vacuum catches about 80% to 90% of the trimmings, similar to the old T980, which is all I expected.  With the comb removed (as for shaving your throat, neck, etc.) the Qt4070 leaves a little more stubble than the old model, about 1 or 1 and 1/2 day&#x27;s growth, which is acceptable to me. If you want it closer you&#x27;ll have to use a razor.  I liked the old T980 little better, but for me the new Qt4070 is functionally equivalent.</li>
            <li> This does a nice job and vacuum gets 95% or more of the whiskers. The design may be great for the cheeks and chin, it is not so great for under the nose. While it cuts the hair, it digs in and is less comfortable than my previous razor. The offset on the head also makes it less useful for trimming the hair around my ears, etc. I really don&#x27;t need an LED light to tell me the setting and I would prefer they use standard razor guard settings rather than mm. I&#x27;m purchasing this because the battery wore out very quickly on my Remington MB200. Hopefully this one will last longer. In summary, this is fine and it appears the battery will last longer, but having used both, I would prefer my Remington with a good battery.</li>
            <li> I grew a beard just so I could use this....totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.  Worked for a month and now will barely cut a hair on my face.  And the trim length comb is very difficult to remove and re-attach.</li>
            <li> East to use - great shave!</li>
            <li> I just got my trimmer. It still comes with open, face-stabbing combs not with the proper closed ones. Call Phillips, who now seem to be aware of the problem, and they will send you the closed comb. That problem aside the trimmer seems to work well.</li>
            <li> There have been a number of reiviews on this, some a bit mixed. In short, Norelco continues to improve on the design of its vac/trim system and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve owned from them - and they are among the best if not the best out there at this mid-level price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: Used to trim head and body where trimming the hair on my head is the most important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. There were comments on the trimmer&#x27;s head being a bit difficult to use, catching on your skin et al. As of  at least Feb 2012, they now ship the unit with the standard comb and a contour comb. The latter is exactly like previous models going back at least 4+ years. Best of both worlds. The default comb however does work however a bit more difficult than the contour version on harder surfaces - like my head. However, the default comb hasn&#x27;t any moving parts and will likely be a bit more durable over time as the contour comb eventually looses its spring ability. Bottom line: its pretty easy to make one of the combs work for face, head, body, whatever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The vac system is greatly improved. The turbo option does a good job of capturing the hair and more so, lifting hair a bit to do a better and faster job of trimming. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. They have reduced the overall size of the unit from past systems and it is now a very comfortable size. Better for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The setting display and overall LED display is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The setting wheel is SO MUCH BETTER than previous setting ring design. Thank you to that engineer / designer. In the past it was easy to start trimming at a setting and before you knew it, you were on &#x27;1&#x27; due to the ring turning in your hand. The wheel design is recessed and doesn&#x27;t suffer from this. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The lowest setting is now much better for the stubble look, be it on your face or head. As someone who wears his hair at a stubble look, this is very welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good design. Good value.</li>
            <li> I have given this trimmer a chance for the last 4 months, hoping that I would get the hang of it after a while.  I have owned several beard trimmers over the years and this is by far the worst.  I have tried both of the guards provided and also various settings when trimming, and the trimmer pulls my hair while trimming.  It hurts and is unacceptable.  I won&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> After losing my T980 on a trip last week, this was the obvious replacement.  However, all the earlier reviews gave me pause regarding the guide design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY NORELCO - Upon opening the box, you will find not only the shaver, charger, literature, etc. but also the alternate floating guide that so many have lamented is missing.  Obviously, that was something I was happy to see but I can also report something else...  The stock non-floating guide that comes with this unit does indeed appear like you should be more careful but it actually seems to allow a much better control of actual \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; length than was possible for me before with the floating guide on the T980... that&#x27;s right, it does a better job of what it was designed for - STUBBLE.  I&#x27;m quite pleased that the floating guide is NOW INCLUDED but I&#x27;m anticipating not using it as often as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about nine months and it works very well. It holds a charge for a long time, and works well for a stubble look. Have not used for trimming a longer beard.</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a month and it works better than the barber&#x27;s for beard trimming. So many setting options and the battery hasn&#x27;t needed a recharge since the original charge at least six weeks ago. This will pay for itself in less than six months.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works as advertised.  I have been using it for a couple of months now and I am not in love with it.  I tried to use the lock feature while traveling, but either I didn&#x27;t do it correctly or the unit malfunctioned.  I had no battery when I needed it. I charged the battery up completely when I got back, used it once and then a week later the battery was dead again.  I have since charged it again and it is keeping a charge as it should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these in the last 3 years. The battery seems to keep burning out after a while, first not holding a charge but still usable when plugged in, then giving up altogether. The claim is that the vacuum also prevents hairy sinks, and that&#x27;s just not true either. It helps, certainly, but does not have the strength to catch everything so be aware of that. The different adjustments is a nice addition, although finding that perfect length does take a few times unless you&#x27;re switching directly from another brand that does the same thing. The tines on the guard do tend to catch a lot if you extend them for trimming a longer beard, especially on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product but not meant for longevity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had previous models of this unit and ran them into the ground.  They really honed the design this time, great upgrades.  Smaller cutter teeth don&#x27;t pinch and cut skin as easy (not recommended for your privates without the guard).  It&#x27;s more quiet to run, battery lasts longer, and the digital cut height display is nice.  Note that with the height display, make sure to always reset down to 1mm each time, it can get confused if it starts mid extension after sitting for a while unused and can display the wrong measurement.  Some of the beard trimmings don&#x27;t always make it into the collection bin, and can bind up in the chute to it, just empty with a shake/tap and it clears up.  This is most likely due to cutter lubrication getting in there (you will need to keep it lubricated with a drop here and there to avoid overheating and slow cutter head speeds).  Also over time the collection bin door will fail to stay &amp;#34;snapped&amp;#34; closed and you will need to hold it while using.  The rest of the performance is amazing so I overlook these small issues.  Eyebrows for me are 11mm, and side burns are 14mm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great product but not exactly show in the picture....!</li>
            <li> Functions as advertised. Doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a mess to clean up afterwards due to its vacuum feature. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> So far its working great and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine, the only problem was the small door no longer closes because the bit broke off to close the door.  I am hoping I can use the warranty to replace, and will provide updates if possible.</li>
            <li> not that good, the Last philips I bought was better and cheaper too,&lt;br /&gt;next time I will buy moser hair clipper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy something else.  It does a good job vacuuming cut hair in, and making it less messy, but it fails to do an even cut on the jawline.  I&#x27;ve actually tried returning it now, 2 months in, but have missed by 30 day window because I waited too long.  I&#x27;d definitely buy something else if you worry about the hair on the jawline.</li>
            <li> I really like the features, but I wish it had interchangeable heads.  Love the vacuum, although it (of course) doesn&#x27;t catch everything.</li>
            <li> Great. Does the job and more that it&#x27;s supposed to. Being able to use it plugged in as well as on battery is a great bonus. Recommended.</li>
            <li> ...Although it does seem odd that Phillips Norelco seem to be ignoring the feedback here completely. The reviews here go back to 2010 with complaints that the contour head was not supplied as advertised, and yet, nearly 2 years later, mine arrived in exactly the same condition. I would not have bought this product if I wanted to use the adjustable comb because of the almost universal hatred displayed by previous reviewers, but I take it off and get a good, close, mess free trim. So for me this product works really well. I have no idea when I will actually get to charge it for the second time.&lt;br /&gt;What I can&#x27;t grasp, though, is that here is a free consumer insights resource (something companies pay millions for) which seems to be completely ignored by the people at Phillips Norelco. They have had 18 months to correct this packaging / advertising error, and they have done nothing. At all. How stupid is that.</li>
            <li> Just the product I was looking for.  I have been using a piece of junk $16 Walh trimmer for the past 3 years because I was to lazy to buy a better one.  Finally I did and this baby is great.  Vacuum doesnt catch 100% of the hair but hey, nothings perfect and it beats getting hair all around the sink.  Mine came with both head attachments which I am glad about.  People need to stop crying if they don&#x27;t recieve the flexible contour head...man up can just call Philipls and have them send it to you for FREE.  If you cant wait a few days to get this attachment then your beard probably sucks anyway.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Qt4070/41 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro, first of all ... has a really long name. &#x3D;)  Second of all, it was pure serendipity that this product came up for review for me when it did, because my Wahl beard and mustache trimmer had just started to go bad on me, and I was getting ready to buy a new one, and I was considering an all-in-one unit like this one, anyway.  Like I said, serendipity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away, I will say that the vacuum feature is a gimmick, and it doesn&#x27;t work that well.  If you have over a day&#x27;s worth of stubble, forget about it.  You will end up with hairs on the counter and in the sink, as per usual.  The vacuum just isn&#x27;t that powerful.  Also, if you decide to trim a really long beard into a fairly short beard, same problem, the vacuum isn&#x27;t powerful enough to contain that volume and length of hairs.  Even when you are using the trimmer daily to trim basically tiny amounts of hairs, you will still see hairs in the sink, etc.  So, it is a gimmick, but so what?  How does it actually perform?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performs beautifully!  I have a full beard (except for the neck), which I like to keep about 3 millimeters longer than \\&quot;stubble.\\&quot;  I have been using this thing for weeks now, and it does a darn good job, and it does it fairly fast, too.  I can generally trim an area with only a couple of passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as for the life of the unit, and when it will start pinching/pulling hairs (even with regular maintenance), I can&#x27;t say.  But I can say that the length dial works, and the blades cut quick and clean, and the unit holds a battery charge fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had an older model for years and thought it was time for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my head and an occasional beard.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature is great and works well.  BUT, the door to the vacuum chamber is very poorly made and broke within a month of about twice weekly use.  No, I did not drop it or otherwise abuse it.  I use a rubber band to hold it shut and some duct tape to reinforce the hinge.&lt;br /&gt;As a trimmer it works very well, but you will be using rubber bands and duct tape to hold it together.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day and he absolutely loves it. I had to make sure he charged it correctly the first time to prevent any battery damage, but other than that it was a flawless purchase</li>
            <li> This is by far the Best electric shaver I have used. I love that it has a vacuum to catch the hair. Highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> Very weak product.  It&#x27;s not shaving well.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to many shaving rounds and then use another machine to achieve the expected result.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer Pro arrived right on schedule. Charged it in under an hour. And my first trim was great. Really liked the vacuum feature which kept the little hairs off my shirt. I&#x27;m a happy, satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> My review on this product is as follows:  The product, if used strictly for beard trimming is awesome! It trims nicely and without pain or pulling.    That being said, it is not very useful on the moustache. The design itself makes trimming under your nose a pain. You will either get a very short cut near your lip and a long cut under the nose.    This is one of the better trimmers I have bought, I just wished it was designed to trim the stache evenly.    D.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied. Je suis tres satisfait de mon achat. Ce modèle ne se trouvait pas dans aucun magasin. La livraison au Canada a été très rapide. Moins de deux semaines.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer for a nephew who experiments with different variations of facial hair.  He says that he likes this trimmer; it does a good job.  He especially likes the portability of it and how it is configured.  He finds it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I started growing a beard last year.  I&#x27;ve never had one before, and I didn&#x27;t have a clue how to groom it.  I used some heavy duty Wahl clippers for a while, and it worked okay, but they are big and bulky.  I was considering getting a body trimmer and using that, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  This trimmer works well.  It sucks up a lot of the hair, though not all.  The adjustments are good, and it does a good job in trimming the beard.  I was a little freaked out about other people saying this thing cuts your lip and what not.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that.  The plastic is a little cheap and flimsy, and it is sharp on the underneath side, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I will probably upgrade to a 5 star review if the battery doesn&#x27;t die on me in the first year.</li>
            <li> I almost steered clear of this product based upon some of the reviews I read below.  I am glad I did not.      I purchased this beard trimmer because I have sensitive skin and live in the NE.  In the winter, it gets so cold and dry here that I constantly nick myself, and electric razors cause me to have ingrown whiskers.      Frustrated, I finally decided I would opt for a beard trimmer: something that would keep my beard short enough that I might still have a goatee as opposed to a full beard; yet, something that would preclude nicks and cuts that might cause breakouts.      I have found this trimmer to be perfect for those needs.  I keep it at the lowest setting and actually remove the guard so as to cut my beard as short as possible.  I have sensitive skin, mind you, and not once has the trimmer nicked or cut it.  Not even close.  In fact, I am so confident of this Norelco that I bet I could have a Bloody Mary for breakfast before using it and still not hurt myself; I really have no idea how the gentleman who wrote the fearful review is going about using the trimmer.       When I purchased it, I was more interested in the trimming aspect; I had no interest in the vacuum feature.  That said, it works really well and makes no more noise than a typical electric razor.  It is easy to clean and quick to charge.  I use the trimmer every morning and charge it for one hour every 7 - 10 days.      A note on length.  Some say that you are left with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, but I have a very thick beard. At the shortest setting, I would say that my beard looks like it typically did not at 5 pm, but at 6 am the next morning.  Just a tad bit longer.  I suppose the effect will depend upon how thick your beard is, the color, etc.  At work no one even noticed that I had gone from a razor to a trimmer, so it is surely cutting closely.     In sum: after more than a month using this trimmer every day, I have had no nicks, no breakouts, and no worries.  Oddly, as one reviewer mentioned,your beard does feel different after trimming it each morning.  So go on: don&#x27;t fear the reaper.</li>
            <li> We were looking to replace my husband&#x27;s previous trimmer that had quite working and found this one. It is not quite as good as that one and that s why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
            <li> Pros: The vacuum mechanism is great and catches about 70~75% of the hair. Adjust to different size is also easy and the digital display is pretty cool to look at. Charges fast and also holds charges longer than other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If you are trying to define beard lines on your face, this is not the product for you. Also in order to have an even and smooth cut, you must go over atleast twice</li>
            <li> Not the most powerful vacuum ever, but it does help pick up probably 70-80% of the trimmings allowing an easier clean up of fallen trimmings.</li>
            <li> I like the fact I&#x27;m able to change the heights of beard trimming &amp; vacuum system intake assemblage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best! I am extremely pleased with its build and quality. The battery lasts a very long time and could even be used plugged in if necessary. It cuts great and the height adjustment is awesome, it actually seems to work better than any of the removable spacers on other clippers and has way more options for height. The vaccum feature was just an added bonus when buying it but now I&#x27;m impressed! It works way better than expected, no more mess all over the sink, probably 80%+ of the hair is sucked into the vaccum. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Mostly works OK, but cannot trim moustache near the nose, have to use other means.  Vacuum catches about 90% of trim, rest ends up in the sink or on the countertop.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend, says he loves it, so 5 stars I guess?</li>
            <li> This is a nice upgrade to my previous Philips Norelco trimmer. It cuts very well and I like that it has the digital readout for the blade length and battery strength. The only thing missing was the edging blade. I&#x27;m not sure why that is no longer included but fortunately the one from my old trimmer still fits.</li>
            <li> Weak vacuum. Messier with it. Also does not give consistent cut. I have to repeat motion many times, then touch up with scissors. I don&#x27;t think I will be using it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a professional Wahl clippers that I will continue to use instead. It isn&#x27;t wireless, is big, and requires cleanup. However, it is worth the inconvenience since the quality of the cut is so much better than the Qt4070 and much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> So had this on my Christmas wishlist and glad I did.  Before I used the trimmer attachment on my electric shaver, which was ok but only cuts close to the face and throws hair all over the bathroom.  The Qt4070 was perfect for my needs...sometimes I like a 1mm close cut, but usually I keep it at 2mm.  The vacuum feature actually works on approx 95% of the cuttings; I will ususally find a few hairs on my countertop, but is night and day from my standard shaver.  The shaver holds a charge for a few weeks and has a really nice blue indicator for the power and length of cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one con I have is that it&#x27;s hard to trim the hairs just under my nose because the head of the unit is a little bluky on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this trimmer, gives me the look of that afternoon stubble all week long without any real maintenance...just a 1 min quick buzz in the morning.</li>
            <li> This unit came with two combs, neither of which exhibited the problems described in previous reviews.  I use it for a beard on the 12 setting and it is very consistent even without the form-following comb.  It&#x27;s still on it&#x27;s initial charge after 4 or 5 trimmings which is a plus.  The vacuum works quite well, leaving very little in the sink or on my chest as have other trimmers I have used in the past.  This replaced a less expensive Wahl and I must say it is far superior and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> great product. best trimmer ever. fast charge and super long life. nice led display too. could replace hair clippers. Extreme comfort when trimming</li>
            <li> Phillips now ships the QT with the correct crumb and it really is an amazing trimmer. Much much better than the previous generation.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, my 4070 came with two combs, the contour following comb and the stubble comb. I previously owned a Norelco T870 for over 5 years but needed to change when it would no longer hold a charge. I can say without a doubt that the 4070 is far superior to anything I have used before.  It is definitely a five star trimmer. The contour comb is perfect for my beard while the stubble comb is fantastic for keeping sideburns and up around my ears clean in between haircuts.</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers in the past.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for a couple weeks.  It came with the contour comb.  With this comb you will not be able get the lower stubble settings.  The other comb is the one that can achieve the 1mm beard height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, first of all, let&#x27;s establish a general scope of what 1mm means to a beard.  For those of you that can grow a dense, full beard before you finish breakfast and have a dark beard, 1mm may show a cool movie look.  If your beard grows at an average pace or you have a light colored beard or grey or less dense, don&#x27;t expect 1mm to show anything!  Sadly, mine was dark brown, but after 50 years, it is best to keep mine a little longer so people can see it without a magnifying glass.  Knowing now what I do, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with a stubble capable trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t do me any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Norelco trimmer that had multiple attachments and I liked it very much.  I will buy a norelco trimmer again, but I think I&#x27;ll buy one with multiple attachments.  This one cannot shave or trim nostril hairs.  The cutting width is too wide for trimming the length above my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the reviews before buying, so I knew what I was getting.  I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it does everything advertised.  The battery is good.  The height selection is excellent. The LED display for height and battery remaining is excellent.  Noise level medium. Easy to handle and maneuver.  The vacuum seems to work.  The door to the vacuum storage is ok (it&#x27;s a plastic door with a small hinge, be a little careful and it will last awhile).  It will trim your beard, or other areas very close without hurting.  It charges reasonably fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added it to my hair trimming arsenal. It has one function and it does it well.</li>
            <li> The Norelco trimmer works great! The vacuum feature is really super. I was surprised it worked this well. Other reviews had mentioned the sharp points on the trimmer guard. I believe Norelco has addressed this. The edges are not sharp at all now. Very comfortable trim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bald, I shave my head with this. I works great and reduces the mess created 10 fold.</li>
            <li> Like almost everyone else, my unit did not come with the contour following comb.  The comb attachment that was included has a giant gap in it that makes it very hard to achieve a uniform trim - you run the risk of the blades cutting much more than you were aiming for.  I called Philips Customer Care (with whom I&#x27;ve always had a pleasant experience) and by just mentioning the model number and the missing attachment, the representative immediately recognized the problem and took down my information to mail me the contour comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate that you need an extra step to get the advertised product but Philips has a very quick turn around to make sure you are satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number to call is 800-243-3050.</li>
            <li> I had been using the previous model, but the soldered in battery died and the unit was damaged when I attempted to open it to solder in a new battery.  The knock on this unit has been the supposedly sharp head.  HOWEVER, it now comes with two heads, the sharper of which is not bad and the other is just fine.  The unit charges very fast, and the LED display clearly indicates the charge level. It works as advertised, BUT has one flaw, the \\&quot;hair drawer\\&quot; in the old unit really collected the clippings, this unit is inferior in that category as around half the clippings fall on the sink not the small drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the research I&#x27;ve done, and the cutting experience I&#x27;ve actually had I would say it is the best available, but it could be better.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price I could find for this trimmer. I liked this specific one for its features, It works great with one exception. it only catches maybe half to two thirds of the hair it cuts. Which isn&#x27;t a big deal really. I would buy it again regardless.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice shaver. Only negative is its bulky and this makes it cumbersome to trim hard to reach places like my mustache. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t flow smoothly across my chin without stumbling but again overall its great. The vacuum feature is nice and the fact I don&#x27;t have to deal with changing combs to get shorter/longer cut is awesome. Just turn the dial. The battery charge last a long time. I bought this in Feb 2014 and have only charged it twice. I use it about once a week.</li>
            <li> Broke within six months of very light use.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer overall.  I gave it 4 stars because it really does not do a &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; job at reducing clean up.  Yes, it does catch some, but it is by far &amp;#34;mess-free&amp;#34;.  In fact, I would say that it only catches about 30% of the trimmings.  Other than that, it really is a good trimmer.  Holds charge for a long time and does a good job at trimming.  I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to those in the market for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband -- it does its job but still leaves hair debris on the counter.</li>
            <li> very nice product and low price</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  For the same price go with more professional (what they use in salons) models.</li>
            <li> Looking for a great trimmer? Well this isn&#x27;t it. Yeah it does what a trimmer is suppose to do, but not what it advertises to do. I&#x27;ve had mind for a few years now and still ever six months or so i look and see if i can find an actual good trimmer to replace it that won&#x27;t cost me an other pretty penny only to be dissatisfied again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is there less hairs in the sink? Yes, about half as much if not more is still in the sink. So eliminates a mess making a mess free trim? No! Not even close. Only reason i keep it is that it does a fair, not good job, of doing an even trim even for longer curly bread heard and i couldn&#x27;t find anything else that did that that was in the up to $80 range nor didn&#x27;t want to cough up $200+ for an actual good all round trimmer. And I&#x27;d be willing to cough up 80 bucks for a do-all bread&amp;mustache trimmer. Still when i want an actual good trim i have go back with my other small trimmer to adjust what this trimmer missed. Still saves time having having to do everything with my smaller trimmer and gives me a guideline where to fix the missed hairs to but it still misses about 10% or so of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So over all this is a 3 star product, it cuts (though misses a good amount of hair) and saves some time and guess work, yet you need a secondary smaller trimmer to finish the job. As for the vacuum part, it don&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s claim (don&#x27;t even really suck in hair to help trim and i use it in turbo mode) and falsely advertised to do  &amp;#34;mess-free trimming&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s more mess-over-half-left trimming (why 2 not 3 stars, for lying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros-&lt;br /&gt;  trims most of your face hair almost even&lt;br /&gt;  goes up to 18mm (i use 13mm max)&lt;br /&gt;  easy to adjust size&lt;br /&gt;  does a good (no exactly clean shave) close up&lt;br /&gt;  can be used corded or cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons-&lt;br /&gt;  vacuum don&#x27;t work as advertised (though helps a bit)&lt;br /&gt;  attachment comb is to coarse\wide so don&#x27;t really separate hairs well&lt;br /&gt;  is loud in turbo mode (which max vacuum from almost useless to kinda useful)&lt;br /&gt;  still leaves a mess&lt;br /&gt;  misses a noticeable amount of hair (have to use a second trimmer to fix it)&lt;br /&gt;  pricey for what you get&lt;br /&gt;  trimmer is always wide so not good for detailed work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all-in-all when i find a good replacement, this thing is going ba-bye, for not i&#x27;ll just have to make due with what i go.h max vacuum from almost useless to kinda useful)&lt;br /&gt;  still leaves a mess&lt;br /&gt;  misses a noticeable amount of hair (have to use a second trimmer to fix it)&lt;br /&gt;  pricey for what you get&lt;br /&gt;  trimmer is always wide so not good for detailed work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all-in-all when i find a good replacement, this thing is going ba-bye, for not i&#x27;ll just have to make due with what i go.</li>
            <li> no bad surprises and the charger work both on US and other countries so all good</li>
            <li> Works great.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Review updated one year later, March 2015:  After 1 year of weekly use, I downgrade this to 2 stars. Durability for a Norelco product is very poor. Within 3 months (about 12 uses), the catch of the clippings door broke and I needed to keep the door closed with tape. Now after 1 year the hinges email of the door is broken so the door is taped both sides. About 4 months into using the product I thought it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge from week to week, which is strange because I use it maybe 10 minutes at a time and a charge should last 50 to 75 minutes of use. With trial and error I figured out that either there is a short or a loose connection triggered by disassembling the blade head to brush clean and or very mildly tapping to remove clippings. It doesn&#x27;t happen every time but the only way to make it work again is to put it back on the charger for a full charging period.  Original revieew March 2014:   Four stars because it includes the contour-following comb, which is more comfortable than the fixed comb which is attached when it arrives packaged. This is a recommended trimmer if you like all the upgrade features. I paid for the upgrade features like 1-hour charging and two comb options, but now find I would have been OK with the features of the QT4050 because the 4050 has only the desirable contour-following comb but 8-hour charging. I&#x27;m going to keep this, but I wanted to let others know that if you don&#x27;t need fast-charging, get the lower model, and more importantly, in terms of comfort, the contour-following comb is better than the fixed comb. I have had this trimmer one week, but see below I&#x27;ve been using an older Norelco with the preferred comb for years so I&#x27;m not new to the Norelco line.  I needed to replace my Norelco G380 trimmer when I dropped it for the second time in a month and the comb length setting finally broke so I couldn&#x27;t adjust to the length I keep my beard. The month before the spring mechanism of the contour-following comb broke and that made the comb less comfortable. I had the G380 several years and the Ni-Cd batteries weren&#x27;t lasting very long, so a new trimmer was a must. I searched the reviews here on Amazon. What I really needed was a beard and mustache trimmer and that&#x27;s what I focused on. Also, it was time to go Li-ion technology for the improved charging and duration. The G380 was a combo system, meaning it included a nose-hair trimming head (hurts), a big comb to trim hair (never used), a smaller head for sideburn trimming (worthless) and a tiny foil head for &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; (again, worthless). If all you need is a beard trimmer, avoid combo kits as they don&#x27;t have good auxiliary tools. If you need one of those other tools, buy it separate.  To summarize, this is a good trimmer. Comfort should be your first priority. The contour-following comb is the more comfortable comb to use; the &amp;#34;fixed comb&amp;#34; sometimes grabbed my beard while trimming. Lower-cost models like the QT4050 have the better comb (per Amazon description), with a slower charger, but would be worth the savings.</li>
            <li> Since deciding to stay with a close-trimmed beard three months ago, I thought an electric trimmer might help me keep it at desired length better than scissors.  After reading through many Amazon reviews, the Philips Norelco QT4070 appeared to be the one to get.  After a month or so of use, I not so sure.  First, I thought that once I set trimmer for proper length, for me 5 mm., all I would have to do was run it over my beard and mustache in fashion similar to an electric shaver.  Not nearly that simple.  Getting most of hairs takes many passes from various angles and the bulkiness of the head makes trimming mustache awkward and only moderately successful. I still end up using scissors to get it trimmed to my satisfaction. While the vacuum does get much of hair, doesn&#x27;t get it all, even when set to higher speed.  Maybe this is typical of all such trimmers, or maybe I have to practice more, but I can&#x27;t recommend it as a stand alone option to good old scissors!</li>
            <li> Pretty much the best Beard Trimmer you can buy. The Vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect but gets up most of the hair, making clean up easier. And the LED display is a real plus especially for knowing when you need to charge it. I can be forgetful so I also like that it works while plugged in. Does great on general shaving, not so much on edging up however.</li>
            <li> Read a bunch of reviews, and went with these. Hands down the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. Highly recommended. Great battery life, easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Does everything I expected. Vacuum function not perfect but catches a good deal of hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second Norelco beard trimmer I purchased for my husband.  He wore the first one out and specifically asked for the same brand again.  Trims evenly and nicely.  He hasn&#x27;t said much about the collection of trimmings within the shaver, but I appreciate that I am not finding little bits of beard all over the sink in the morning!</li>
            <li> Such a great trimmer, I had a cheap one before and very happy I decided to spend some extra cash and get this trimmer which does not pull my hair at all, does not cut my skin and reduces the mass drastically with its vacum</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he says he loves it. Best he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> Seriously dont know why all the good reviews, this thing is so unbelievably loud and is no better than the 15.00 Wahl buzzer Ive had for ages accept that it vacuums up the hair which is really not that amazing of a feature because of how loud it is because of the suction. Spend money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the trimmer without it&#x27;s head (the shortest setting 0.5 mm) and it does a perfect job.&lt;br /&gt;I used an older model before but it&#x27;s battery died (don&#x27;t remember the model but also norelco vacuum trimmer).&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum option is very nice, although there is still some leftovers in the sink, it leaves much less mess than regular trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;Charging takes less than an hour. I use it 5-7 times between charges.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the results, and it does a better job than my older trimmer.</li>
            <li> The head design is poor.  It has sharp plastic fins that are only supported on the back side of the head.  So as you shave, it easily stabs your face, or any other part of your body you may choose to shave.  You have to be very careful ...  no fast movements.  The vacuum is nice, but not a necessity.  The electronic readout to accurately set the millimeter hight for the shave ...  was great ...  until it broke.  I much prefer the Panasonic ER224S.  Easy to use, no stabbing, and works great around the body.  I will be returning to it!</li>
            <li> I LIKED IT AND I GOT IT IN PERFECT TIMEING I COULDENT ASK FOR A BETTER SHAVER THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I know there are hair trimmers out there that offer every possible attachment, most of which end up in a plastic bag underneath the sink. This time Norelco concentrated on a specific goal instead of trying to be all things. It&#x27;s a trimmer meant for guys who keep their facial hair close and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charged the unit overnight back in January of this year, the day I bought it. Since then I&#x27;ve used it an average of three times a week. It is now the middle of August and the unit has finally blinked red. That&#x27;s eight months of excellent performance on one charge. Unlike a lot of older designs, this machine didn&#x27;t stall or slow down. It worked at speed until the end, then asked for more juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my beard and mustache close, never more than a quarter inch out. Once in a while I touch up the surrounding area. There&#x27;s a turbo boost button for extra cutting power but I&#x27;ve never felt the need to use it. Clipped hairs are vacuumed into a small but efficient little holding area under the blade, and it&#x27;s easy to dump out the hair and clean the hopper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no charger stand or wall mounting unit, and it doesn&#x27;t stand on its own. I took the clear molded plastic packing shell out of the box and put it on my bathroom shelf above the sink. There the trimmer lies flat, waiting for a more dignified home. What would it have taken to design the bottom of the unit so it stands up straight? Only flaw in an otherwise great design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase this trimmer to keep your close beard and stubble looking pop-album ready--you&#x27;ll be pleased with its performance, features, and especially the awesome battery life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several trimmers over the past few years. The last one was a Remington something or other that I bought at Walmart and it lasted all of 4-5 months. It&#x27;s still working fine but I&#x27;ve never hated a trimmer like I hated that thing. I pulled my beard from day 1 right out of the box. I had to use it so gingerly to avoid ripping my facial hair out by the roots that shaving took forever and I always dreaded it. I finally had enough and purchased this jewel. I wish there was a half star because I really would have given it 4.5 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Positives&lt;br /&gt;* Digital readout of your trimmer length setting&lt;br /&gt;* Digital indicator of battery life&lt;br /&gt;* Built in vacuum to clean up MOST of your stubble&lt;br /&gt;* Turbo mode to take care of business in quick order&lt;br /&gt;* Super close \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; setting&lt;br /&gt;* Absolutely no pulling even when rushing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Negatives&lt;br /&gt;* There is still some sink cleanup after shaving but the vacuum did collect probably 95% of the trimmings&lt;br /&gt;* The head is a bit bulky so it&#x27;s tough to get into tight spaces like under your nose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, the positives are far greater than the negatives. Worth the extra $15 bucks over the cheaper models in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only reviewing this product for what I&#x27;ve experienced so far. Just got it in the mail and knew I was going to have to contact Phillips about a replacement part after reading some reviews. That seemed fine to me, because besides that, it sounds like a great product. I was on the phone for 20 minutes with customer service ( at least the lady was friendly) trying to figure out why I needed a replacement, and mixing up the part number. There were no managers around to authorize a replacement (called on a Saturday) so she&#x27;s going to get back to me on Monday. Besides that fiasco, I was expecting some type of travel pouch to come with the trimmer, since on the Amazon product page, it clearly has pouch check marked as one of the features that comes with the 4070. Needless to say, there is no pouch that comes with it. When I mentioned this issue to customer service, she told me the pouch only comes with the 4090. Anyways, have not even used it yet, maybe it will be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews saying the contour comb for a full beard as I have is not included (thanks to everyone for your accurate reviews!) I checked Norelco&#x27;s web page.  It shows it was to be with this unit so I called customer service - that was an experience.  First girl could not tell me anything but try to give me a coupon to get me to buy it from them, finally got a supervisor who confirmed the contour comb for beards is NOT included.  This unit is for stubble ONLY!!  The only model that has this power and features and the contour comb is the QT4090, a special release unit that only a few stores have - neither Amazon or even Norelco had it to sell to me.  Have a Braun unit ordered, did not even bother the supervisor when I told him in this case a Braun would be ordered from Amazon.  Glad they have more business then they need at Norelco!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for 10 years-- the majority of which i&#x27;ve used a panasonic beard trimmer which wasn&#x27;t great but it did the job.  When it died and I went to get a replacement, this Norelco was all I could find at my local Target store.  The first time I used it, I knew it was the worst decision I could have made.   This trimmer fails miserably at everything it was designed to do:      1) it does not cut evenly across your beard.  My beard looks uneven and unkept compared to other trimmers I&#x27;ve used. (This is readily evidenced by pulling up hair at different spots in your beard and seeing completely different hair lengths).  And yes I used it correctly, with multiple passes--   2) the sharp plastic tines cause the most painful trim I&#x27;ve ever experienced  3) on 2 separate occasions, after setting the trimmer to level \\&quot;7\\&quot;, the guard has moved right in the middle of trimming- causing a large bald strip in my beard.  Now I have a mustache/goatee-- thanks alot, Norelco.    4) I recently noticed after a couple very, very short beard trims that what was setting \\&quot;7\\&quot; is now corresponding to setting \\&quot;5\\&quot;??  I noticed this when I set the trimmer to it&#x27;s lowest setting before taking it on a trip and noticed that at setting \\&quot;2\\&quot; the trimmer was at the lowest it could go.  So basically the guard height is no longer corresponding to the number setting... so you can&#x27;t even keep track of how short your beard is going to be?!    4) while the vacuum in this trimmer does function, it frequently gets full/clogged.  This will require you to turn off the trimmer and empty the hair trap numerous times during each trim.  This has nearly tripled the time it takes me to trim (previous to the Norelco, I simply trimmed over the sink- problem solved)  5) This trimmer does not function when you attempt to use it upside down in an attempt to reach tight spots like the part of your mustache right underneath your nose.  This results in the sloppiest mustache trim I&#x27;ve ever had the privilege of wearing.I end up having to use scissors to try and clean up the areas this trimmer cannot handle.     In short-- if you don&#x27;t particularly care for small details and/or your beard is very long- this trimmer may work out fine.  But if you like a tighter beard with more detail, this trimmer cannot function at the most basic level.</li>
            <li> Arrived early, and I have used the product for over a month without charging it.  Pretty incredible little machine. The shave is excellent, and Norelco sends two styles of head which is really helpful.</li>
            <li> I like it. I have no complaints. May be hard to get at the mustache; otherwise, I really like it and am sure you will too.</li>
            <li> This is okay. It gets the job done and the vacuum is nice. However, the predecessor to the QT4070 is much better made. The QT4070&#x27;s door no longer latches, I have read other reviews which also cite this as an issue. Battery does not last long, and where the older version cut in one swipe, this takes two or three. Not impressed. I am seeking out the older version.</li>
            <li> I basically don&#x27;t like this beard trimmer, because it does not do everything it needs to do.  It&#x27;s okay for basic trimming of your entire beard, however if you want to so some shaping on the edges, for instance to maintain your moustache or create a goatee, it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  When you try to apply the blade directly to the edge you want to trim, the vacuum intake gets in the way, so you have to tilt the razor nearly to horizontal to get the cutting blade to your skin.  Once you do this, you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing, you can&#x27;t see the blade and your hand and the body of the razor gets in the way.  Plus at that point the angle is not good for cutting.  So, I had to buy a second beard trimmer.  I use this one, but basically it was a waste of money.  It does save some time cleaning up cut hair, but to me, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Plastic door broke after few months of use</li>
            <li> excellent, exactly as described and works very well</li>
            <li> great product I recommended to any one that is looking for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.....I got this because four years ago I bought the older version, and it was amazing. It lasted about as long as I could expect, seeing as I trim my beard one to two times a week. I got a lot of quality mileage out of it and was very please. Do keep in mind that I have had and maintained a beard since 2011. Never once shaving since then. While I&#x27;m not, I&#x27;m sure, the best trimmer in the world I do have plenty of experience, and do know what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version, however, is the worst trimmer ever! It is impossible to trim your beard on the same setting without it taking chunks of hair right of your face, resulting in the patchiest beard to ever set foot on planet earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, and the first embarrassing trim, I thought it must be user error... So being the fair minded man that I am, I gave it another go once my beard had recovered from the prior botch job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How&#x27;d it turn out, I hear you asking?? Well, to everyone&#x27;s Great surprise, I left the bathroom looking like a drowned, mangy, disease ridden mutt. Guess that&#x27;s what I get for trying to expect a higher level of quality out of Norelco&#x27;s QT4070/41 beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to those who disregard this review. Pure crap.</li>
            <li> Works really well with several improvements over the older version that I&#x27;ve had for many years.  Vacuum hair collector is a real plus!</li>
            <li> This trimmer missed half the hairs on my face and it couldn&#x27;t reach the hairs under my nose. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I used to shave my head with a Head Blade, then I switched to using a Merkur DE safety razor, and now I use this.  It&#x27;s not worth it to me to spend the 45 minutes in the bathroom shaving my scalp and face when I can use this awesome tool to trim down to a nice stubble in about 5 minutes.  I still shave my face, but when I just want to trim around the edges with the razor, I&#x27;ll use this to whittle down to 1mm, and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a body hair trimmer.  It wasn&#x27;t wide enough head and the little vacuum immediately got stopped up.  It didn&#x27;t even shave very close.  Just wasn&#x27;t impressive at all.</li>
            <li> 2 day shipping.... Well it&#x27;s been 8 days now. Delayed by shipper 3 days ago and no new info since. Seeing as I need to shave a little more often than once every two weeks I had to resort to other buying options. Did purchase a similar model. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It is a great trimmer.  The vacuum feature does not work as well as hoped.  It sucks up plenty of hair but a fair amount still gets around the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is a good quality trimmer...just make sure that your face is smooth. If not, be careful. The forward facing &amp;#34;tines&amp;#34; are sharp as hell. I have a mole on one side of my face. Not Austin Powers big, but big enough. Trimming one day a few months ago and one of those &amp;#34;tines&amp;#34; pierced straight through my mole. Bled like a stuck pig for hours. Other than that, I love it. Good-ish buy.</li>
            <li> Bought a trimmer with vacuum for my husband years ago and had been looking for another one when I found this one.  He is very pleased with this one also.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and clean design.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum works better than expected, I haven&#x27;t notice any hair not being sucked-in.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to have a clean shave though.</li>
            <li> More length settings than you&#x27;ll ever need. Vacuum is awesome. Majorly reduces beard hair all over the vanity/sink. Very powerful motor.</li>
            <li> This grooming product works perfectly.  It operates smoothly and effectively collects cut hairs through a strong vacuuming feature.  I&#x27;ve owned this brand in earlier grooming products and the current model is far superior!  I would recomend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Just got mine. I am IMPRESSED!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s everything I was looking for. Don&#x27;t go any further if don&#x27;t mind to spend few bucks more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek, light, great hand-feel, and very easy to use. Trims like professional instrument producing effortless uniformity, and without the &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; mentioned in older reviews. The settings are spot on My only Con is that the latch on the small clipping catch compartment somehow broke or was shipped broken, so I have to be mindful to keep a finger on it.</li>
            <li> It looked quite well and worked as it was expected, but after a few uses I started noticing that the hair compartment lid wasn&#x27;t closing very tight. I checked and for no reason (I am very careful with these things), the hook was about to break apart from the lid, which it finally did after I touched it. Very cheap plastic. I can still say it works great, but the plastic was indeed very cheap.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for a few months now and am very happy with it. I have a thick beard and this handles it without the pulling and tugging. I like the vacuum feature as I don&#x27;t have as much hair to clean up out of the sink after. It&#x27;s a little big and heavy but works well and I don&#x27;t have issues with odd angles. The charge seems to last plenty long enough for me to trim several times.</li>
            <li> this is a very high quality beard trimmer. It does a good job of collecting most of the hair that you trim. However some does a getaway and end up in the sink. For me this was not a problem it is a very high quality product and I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I have had several bead trimmers now, each one failing for a different reason. This is a good, well-made, trimmer. What surprised me was how well the vacuum works in containing the beard clippings. My only complaint, and maybe that is just my not being used to it, is that the trimmer is too wide to do a very good job in trimming the mustache.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the kind of precision cut that I was expecting in regards to having so many adjustable settings. The LED screen is suppose to make up for that I guess, feels solid and I like the vacuum feature however you have to remember to intermittently throw out the hair as it is a small pocket that fills up quickly especially for larger beards / hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I have many complaints about this trimmer:     First, the comb head is cheaply made from soft, pliable plastic that bends, causing the trim to be uneven.   Second, by a flaw in the design, far too much hair gets sucked into the removable trimmer head casing causing the trimmer to slow and, therefore, stop cutting hair or cut it poorly, causing split hairs.   Third, I do not see any reason for it to have a \\&quot;turbo button\\&quot;. According to Norelco, the turbo button creates \\&quot;greater suction power and increased cutting speed\\&quot;, so shouldn&#x27;t it just be turbo all the time? This just seems to be a gimmick you end up paying for.   Fourth, at $44 it is severely overpriced. I also own the [[ASIN:B000FED5D0 Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer]], and the comb head is much more solid yet flexible, although the trimmer is pretty weak, which is why I bought this other trimmer in the first place. If the Norelco brand or vacuum feature appeal to you, at $5 less, Norelco also makes the [[ASIN:B003U8K6M6 Philips Norelco Qt4050 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer, Black]], which seems to be a good combination between the other two Norelco Vacuum beard trimmers, IF it has a powerful trimmer, because it does not have a turbo button. Also, any basic, corded trimmer will most likely outperform this trimmer.  Fifth: After a year, it will NOT function at capacity when unplugged, and further, the turbo button doesn&#x27;t work after a few minutes unplugged. When unplugged, an \\&quot;E\\&quot; shows up on the screen and it turns off immediately.  Conclusion: Split hairs, an uneven trim, eventually stops working. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Before buying this item last Christmas I read several online reviews.  This trimmer seemed to be the best of all. The vacuum feature was especially intriguing to me. However when I got it I was disappointed. It has 3 design flaws, listed here in order of importance to me:  1. Vacuum is of little use  For me, the purpose of the vacuum is to avoid having to wipe down my sink after trimming my beard. This does not accomplish that -- yes it reduces the amount of shavings that get on the sink. However it still loses enough that you have to wipe the sink down. Since it&#x27;s just as easy to wipe down a sink with 50 stubbles as one with 500, the vacuum feature was useless for my needs.  2. Couldn&#x27;t see exactly where I was trimming  I also didn&#x27;t like the angle of the head. While using it I was unable to see where the tip of the blades met my face -- so I was tapping a bit in the dark. I&#x27;d trim, move the trimmer to the side, trim some more, etc. To get a good trim, I need to see where I am trimming while I am trimming.  3. Comparatively poor battery life  The battery life leaves a lot to be desired since I&#x27;ve had a trimmer with a lithium ion battery. After returning this model I purchased the [[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]] I have charged it only once since purchasing it, i.e. in the past 12 months! It came pre-charged, so count it as 2 charges, and it&#x27;s still going. With such a better performance, I don&#x27;t understand why _all_ trimmers and electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t use lithium ion batteries.  4. Misleading product marketing  Philips sells a nearly identical model (the [[ASIN:B003U8K6M6 Philips Norelco Qt4050 Vacuum Beard Trimmer]]) that \\&quot;only\\&quot; trims to \\&quot;1/32\\&quot; of an inch. The 4070 promises to trim to \\&quot;1/64\\&quot; of an inch. But then on the box you see that it accomplishes this by telling you to take the spacer guide off. So unless the spacer guide is non-removable on the QT4050, it should also go down to \\&quot;1/64\\&quot; of an inch. This kind of misleading marketing annoys me.  I have been happy with the [[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]] since then, and don&#x27;t cease to be impressed if not amazed by it&#x27;s battery life.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver does a great job.  I really like how many choices I have for the beard length.  In particular, I also appreciate how short you can trim your beard using the comb.  I tried a competing Remington model but was disappointed to find that the Remington&#x27;s comb wouldn&#x27;t trim my beard as short as I&#x27;d like when on the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the QT4070 I charged it fully.  I was worried and disappointed when the battery quickly ran down during my first few uses.  However, after fully charging a second time the battery life was great.  I&#x27;ve now used this trimmer for several months and the battery life is more than sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this trimmer is a good buy.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any of the issues stated in some of these reviews.  People have different face shapes anyways :)  I don&#x27;t wear my facial hair very long so the vacuum worked quite well and the adjustments are a breeze.  It&#x27;s really a win win situation, try it and if you like it keep it if not send it back.  No brainers...keep life simple. LOL  If four or five hairs in a sink bothers you then the trimmer isn&#x27;t the issue if you know what I mean :)  Overall I give it five stars because of the one hour re-charge time, the vacuum (no other trimmer has one yet), the ease of adjustments, and low maintenance.  I ordered the contour comb anyways just because it was advertised and I get what I suppose to get by principle alone.  Good product guys.</li>
            <li> I hav used many trimmers and this one tops the list, its so easy to use, light weight, good battery life and less mess comes with this product. You can use it even while you are wearing your office attire because it stores all the hair with vaccum.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have a thick full beard and my favorite shave gel (Zirh) recently went from $2.68/oz to $4.44/oz which is what prompted me to look for an electric shaver/trimmer. I heard about this product while listening to Howard Stern and thought I&#x27;ll give it a shot. If you use this product with the guard on, then you will have the \\&quot;gap\\&quot; issue/problem that other reviewers have talked about on this site. I prefer the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look so I use it without the guard all together and it comes out looking nice. You make ask yourself why I don&#x27;t just use hair clippers but the other nice feature on this is the vaccum. While not perfect, it does well enough to keep from making a mess in my bathroom. And I find that if you use it often enough, the hairs are small enough to be caught by the vaccum and make no mess which means you can use it anywhere. I don&#x27;t travel with it so I couldn&#x27;t say much about the travel lock and I always keep it charges so can&#x27;t say much about the battery life but the turbo option is nice for someone with a thick beard. Overall I recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have owned and liked older Norelco shavers.  This is the first beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned and this review is written after using it a few times.  I bought it after reading a number of reviews on a number of different sites and came to the conclusion that it was one of the most highly recommended products in it price range.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, it does what I intended it to do; trim my beard evenly with minimal effort.  I found it easy to use and clean.  The vacuum feature is nice.  It collects most but not all of the trimmings but I don&#x27;t think that you should expect a battery powered device, never mind a corded device, to create enough suction to do that.  It significantly reduces the mess that you would otherwise have if it didn&#x27;t collect any trimmings.  It is easy to take apart and clean.  When re-attaching the beard comb one needs to carefully align the comb with the groves in the trimmer to get it to go on properly but this is only a minor quibble with the design.  It appears to be fairly well constructed, time will tell about its durability.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a body trimmer-I was looking for something to take my body hair to VERY short, but not quite a shave. For this, it is perfect. With the (fairly lame) comb removed it works with amazing speed. No hair, even the \\&quot;body huggers\\&quot; that you can&#x27;t get to stand up, can escape it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t much matter if you&#x27;re stroking against the natural growth direction or not, if you can get the cutter on the hair, it&#x27;s going to get trimmed.  The unit is brand new and the blades are very sharp. In this condition, I was able to trim most of my body with only perhaps a third of a charge. I also found that it didn&#x27;t make much difference how I held the unit against my skin. This made it easy to trim hard-to-reach areas. It cut all the hair and didn&#x27;t \\&quot;bite\\&quot; my skin anywhere. Just be certain not to put a loose fold of skin into the cutters, it CAN cut the skin if you do.  Overall, this does exactly what I was hoping for, quickly and well.  The vacuum gets almost everything. The QT4070 is slimmer than the T980 and takes less space in the drawer. The AC unit is very compact too. I&#x27;ll be getting the contour comb for longer trims, the supplied comb deserves the criticism it&#x27;s getting.  After a long wait (weeks) my contour comb arrived. I find it effective and very comfortable to use. After short consideration, I threw the supplied comb, in all it&#x27;s lameness, away.</li>
            <li> The Blade without the guard is so hidden and horrible for shaping facial hair. It is also very weak and doesnt cut the well. I suggest getting barber grade clippers for your facial hair.</li>
            <li> It is a miracle that Philips/Norelco still exists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is broken by design. It has an adjustable head, with a digital indicator. This is a gimmick of course, but it is mention as a feature and makes the device sound like &#x27;very precise&#x27;. However, when switching on the trimmer fresh out of the box, the sensor is already confused. It doesn&#x27;t know if the head is in 1, 2 or 3mm mode. And it will never figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that more people have this. Basically Phillips, being the crap company for consumer products that they are (they lost in all consumer markets for a reason) decided to release a half baked product, to insult their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuuming doesn&#x27;t really work. It&#x27;s not that it doesnt&#x27; work. But you still need to clean op your sink. I would say 30% doesn&#x27;t get sucked in by the vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trim head is impossible. There is a big gap between the two combs. so if you slightly tilt the machine while shaving, and NOT hold the machine perfectly at an 45 degree angle, it will eat a piece of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: Turbo Vacuum Beard Trimmer Pro: Vacuum doesn&#x27;t work. Trimmer doesn&#x27;t work. And it&#x27;s definitely not pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If their medical devices are as good as phillips&#x27; consumer devices, then I&#x27;m even more afraid of hospitals than I was before. It makes me wonder...</li>
            <li> These are absolutely perfect. My facial hair is nice and trim and my sink is mostly clean. It doesn&#x27;t vacuum EVERYTHING, but much better than not having a vacuum at all. A Great trimmer!</li>
            <li> This shaver works well when it works. The shaver is made with poor quality materials that continually break down. I am now on my second replacement in 6 months.  The concept is ok but the fabrication is poor. I do not recommend purchasing until the unit is redesigned. The name is deceptive as there is no mustache trimmer utensil provided with this unit.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer as as Christmas gift for my boyfriend. I chose this one because it had a vacuum to suck up all of those little hairs so they wouldn\\&quot;t fall into the sink. He really likes it, one of the better trimmers that he&#x27;s tried!</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews here are too harsh.  If you want your trimmer to be custom made to any and all of your specifications, you&#x27;ll probably always be disappointed in any product.  The good here is the vacuum that collects trimmed hair.  It isn&#x27;t perfect, but my sink is not full of trimmings when I&#x27;m done.  The charge lasts for a few weeks of trimming every two days.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the beard comb that guides the blade.  The teeth bend too easily and I can see how some have mentioned that it allows it to cut your lip or chin if on a low setting.  I&#x27;ve called Philips Norelco to ask for the comb mentioned in other reviews here.  That was at the end of December, and they still have not sent the comb that was promised.  Just an email that it is on backorder and will be sent the following week, each week.</li>
            <li> Uneven trim, poor comb design. Would not recommend to anyone who likes to keep a longer beard.  I will be looking for something else in the future and will avoid this brand as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Very good battery life. It is very easy to use. I like the number settings.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the vacuum option. It is not effective.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this specific model of norelco beard trimmer</li>
            <li> Bought as present for my husband. He is not that happy with it. He says it doesn&#x27;t do fine lines.</li>
            <li> I really like this beard trimmer. The vacuum sucks in all the cut hairs so it doesn&#x27;t make a mess all over the sink. I&#x27;d been trying to hold a trash can under my chin while trimming with my old trimmer, and it was a mess and a pain! This eliminates all that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts very well and the blades are sharp. Especially trimming without the guides on the neck or anywhere you want a clean spot, it does an exceptional job! The trimmer guide for the beard isn&#x27;t as good as my old trimmer, though. It&#x27;s a great deal stiffer and doesn&#x27;t seem to flex enough to get down to the level it&#x27;s supposed to to let the blade cut right. I seem to be going over the same spots quite a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like the digital settings to be able to trim to the exactness of a single millimeter. I use a different setting for my main beard and for my mustache above my lip and on the sides of my mouth. This lets me get the setting exactly right to keep a nice, even trim that blends in nicely. It&#x27;s a little loud on Turbo with the vacuum, but not too loud and not much louder than any other trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One really nice thing is it only has two attachments - not the 10 or 12 things you have to keep track of. One guide for trimming beards; one guide for haircuts; a small cleaning brush; and the charger. It would have been nice to have a carrying case or pouch to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is well worth the money. Holds a charge for a long time and recharges quickly. It gives me a nice, even trim, blending different length cuts smoothly and precisely, and avoids the mess of whiskers falling all over the sink. I may buy another one before they quit making it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars only because of the stiffness of the beard guide, but even that is something I can live with, and I hope it gets more flexible with use.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for couple years now for &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; (0 mm) head and face and trimming head (6mm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum Cleaner works great. Dramatically reduced amount of hair in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Fast charging time.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shave as clean as some other trimmers - leaves about 1-1.5 mm. Nevertheless, going to by this same trimmer when mine will go down.</li>
            <li> I owned two of these. They work very well and do a great job of doing what they are supposed to do. However the lid for the compartment that collects the hair is very flimsy. The first one I owned after a couple of months it would not shut properly, so it would open up while shaving and hair would fall all over the place. I returned it (using credit card return I think it was like after 2.5 months) and got another hoping I just got a lemon. But same happened with the second one. I now use an elastic band to hold it down, not really ideal</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like this trimmer at all. The hair catcher doesn&#x27;t work very well, so I end up cleaning up the hairs after every shave anyways, and the lengths are very inconsistent. The closeness of the cut entirely depends on the angle you hold the trimmer, I don&#x27;t like that I want it to be uniform, the blade guard is supposed to protect you from trimming to much. I would either get the WAHL peanut or in fact, the cheaper version of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after less than a year.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> Same problem as many before me: batteries will not hold a charge! As I travel, this is a huge inconvenience for me. I regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a waste of time. It&#x27;s almost impossible to trim all of your hairs. The latch for the hair collection also broke after a few months of occasional use  My old trimmer stopped holding a charge and became a corded trimmer. I now have an awkward routine of using this trimmer to cut 95% of my beard (it misses a lot even after multiple passes) and then finish it with my old trimmer. It is great at sucking hairs up, the only reason I use it to get the majority of my unwanted facial hair off my face.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it to shave my head</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer! Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had a similar version that I bought 6 years ago, and I was fairly satisfied.  It also caught the trimmings in a screen which made shaving and trimming more convenient - nothing to clean up.  This version is head and shoulders above the older version - more precise trimming levels, sturdier filter screen to catch trimmings, just a more solid product and a very good price.</li>
            <li> The Vacuum feature on this razor saves a ton of hassle with clean up.  I get a quick and easy trim of my beard.  The only complaint I have with this product is that when you take the trim guard off, I wish the blade would get closer to the skin.  Overall, a great product and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to maintain their beard on a day to day basis.</li>
            <li> NICE IDEA BUT DOOR FOR VACUUMED HAIR STORAGE CLOSURE BROKE OFF! NOT GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;Missed the return cutoff date. Looks like landfill to me!</li>
            <li> Cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very light in weight.  Easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not trim as close as i expected compared to my old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I like the performance and design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Pros: it looks and feels great - and I enjoy the vacuum since it catches most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is tough to determine exactly where the cut will stop, so if precision is important this may not be for you. This is more important to me as I keep only chin hair and need to get my sideburns and around the chin hair just right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you keep a beard - this is probably worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer for a couple of months.  Well engineered, feels good in the hand, and most importantly, performs exactly as advertised. Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for people like me who have thick beards and like to let them grow out then trim them back. This trimmer doesn&#x27;t pull hair or cause tangles it even has a setting that increases the RPM&#x27;s so that it will cut a lot easier through really thick hair. This trimmer is easy to clean, charge and store. It will work both on and off the charger so if your battery dies, you can plug it in and continue so that you dont have one side shaved and one side not.&lt;br /&gt;One negative I have is that the plastic door on the front that holds the vaccumed hair will come open and doesnt have a good latch on it to stay closed. It worked well for the first couple months, but now it won&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li> Still works well, cuts well, although for comparison I would try something else in the price range. Don&#x27;t like the cutting heads, but that can be changed with the length settings</li>
            <li> The most common complaint from two years ago was that the guiding comb was not included, but I&#x27;m happy to report that it now is included with the product. However, the travel pouch that came with previous trimmers is no longer included, which is too bad.</li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t work properly and hair falls all over the place. The trimming is uneven as well. Makes my beard look patchy compared to other trimmers. Long battery life is the only positive.</li>
            <li> I received my QT4070 vacuum beard and was extremely satisfied with the results. The length adjuster works great and the vacuum picks up most of the clipped beard if the clipped length is short enough</li>
            <li> Its nice and it does an OK job. But it drops a lot of hair that it should be sucking up and my biggest grip with it is the fact that the integrated guard keeps me from being able to get right up under my nose easily. I&#x27;ve used other trimmers and not had this problem so I know its cause of the guard. I keep my stache and goat a little shorter that the average bearded dude so maybe that&#x27;s the issue... I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I will use it and it is OK for what it is.</li>
            <li> I had the previous top end version of this trimmer and had it for many years before problems happened (mostly plastic part cracking/breaking).  I was able to work around them (by using superglue) until the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.  So I replaced it with this model despite the comments warning me about its shortcomings.  Well, two months in and I&#x27;m not that impressed with the design or quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: it provides a decent, consistent trim, charge lasts a long time, it charges quickly, good adjustment function/display, vacuum function works reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;  The trim guard - has too few comb tines that are sharp and poke you in the lip unless you are really careful when trimming your mustache, just feels hard and uncomfortable.  I much prefer the guard on my previous model (and that is on the current Philips Norelco Qt4050 model).&lt;br /&gt;  The vacuumed hair door latch is a tiny plastic tab that has already broken off.  When the tab was there, the door was cumbersome to get open.  I only use my trimmer 2-3 times a week, so it took less than 25 uses before it broke.  The tends to stay shut without the latch, thankfully.  I don&#x27;t like the swinging door design as much as I like the \\&quot;hair cup\\&quot; that slide out of my last model that I could tap in the trashcan or the sink to empty.  Tapping the whole trimmer on the trashcan/sink is more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;  There at just too many sharp spots on this trimmer.  When using it with the guard off, there are two sharp plastic points on the outside bottom edge of the trimming blade.  It was not comfortable to use for precise trimming around the mouth and nose because it scratched/poked my lips and nostrils.  I had to use a burly nail file to round of the sharp points to mostly alleviate this design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d chose the Philips Norelco Qt4050 over this one knowing what I know now.  **** EDIT (May 2012):  I&#x27;d stick with the Qt4070 based on the fact the contour trim guide isnow included.  See other edits below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit:  Today (3/14/12), I used Philips Norelco&#x27;s customer service chat to order the contour trim guard which was not included with my trimmer.  They are back ordered and was not given an ETA.  They said they would send it via expedited shipping once it was in stock.  When I bought this trimmer in October of 2011, it only shipped with the gray stubble guard.  I later chatted with support about the broken tab on the vacuumed hair door and they are sending me a replacement trimmer since the door is not customer replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit (May 2012):  I have received the new trimmer since the original trimmer&#x27;s door broke and I have received an additional contour trim guard.  The contour guard makes ALL the difference in the world in regards to comfort vs the standard trip guard.  I am also impressed with the customer service/support for this product and how I was helped.  I have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have to say this trimmer is a game changer. I used to shave everyday before I got it. It&#x27;s brilliant, because I no longer have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can steadily grow my facial hair without looking homeless, but I can also mow it down whenever I start looking like I belong in a Geico commercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum removes any possibility of a mess. Seriously, I trim my hair in front of a mirror IN MY ROOM! No need to be in the bathroom for grooming. The price point is phenomenal. Godspeed on this thing. Order one and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research prior to ordering this unit. I was VERY happy with it besides the bulk of the unit and the width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is less than 30 days old now and the vacuum chamber won&#x27;t close any more. The holding mechanism has completely snapped off and I have to secure it with a rubber band now, so trimmed hair doesn&#x27;t go flying all over the place (and into my eyes)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken EXTREMELY delicate care with this since day one and clean it with the brush after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very dissatisfied customer.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this trimmer was to avoid the annoying mess of little hairs we all experience after a good beard trim. The vacuum is a good idea, but doesn&#x27;t work. At all.</li>
            <li> As some other reviews that have one star ( only one star because 0 stars is not an option), the plastic cover that covers where the hair is trapped breaks easily and good luck getting the online rep to understand anything about the broken part, they will keep asking you to look at a web page with accessory parts that do not include anything remotely similar to what you are saying is broken. Also it does not get up to your nose when grooming. I have had Norelco groomers for years but now I will look for alternatives to their inferior products and online help!!!</li>
            <li> Big improvement over my past trimmer - strong motor that does  great job trimming, has a long lasting battery and even a power boost for tough beards.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Clogs up sometimes and lacks power overall, though it does have a &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; feature that gives it an extra kick. Vacuum feature is worthless.  But I do like the fact that its cordless.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well used it 2 times so far, and the vacuum system works makes for very little clean up. I have used a Conair trimmer for years works well knocks down the beard but then there is the clean up. I have not used the Norelco to trim a full grown beard 2 or 3 inches long I don&#x27;t think the vacuum system would be able to handle it. I am using the Norelco to keep the beard short so for it has been working out. I going to keep the Conair for the heavy duty work and clean up mess.</li>
            <li> Good looking and works really well but... Doesn&#x27;t come with any stands or holders to put it and accessories into, so it has to just lie flat looking not nearly as good as it could&#x27;ve. The suction of hair is nice but it&#x27;s not perfect and the compartment gets dirty real quick. It seems the charge sometimes messes up and you end up with a dead battery. The clear door compartment for trimmings/shavings seem to break after a while as other reviewers mentioned causing it to not latch shut anymore resulting in the hair just flying out, rubber band fixes that. The blade is wide, I wish it came with additional smaller sizes that you could put on, for those special places. The attachment does come completely off to expose the base blade but it still doesn&#x27;t seem to cut very close, my older cheaper one cuts closer somehow, for more special places. The charge seems to last long, so you could get to those special places. I&#x27;m done, sorry.</li>
            <li> I must have had high expectations, because this trimmer didn&#x27;t meet them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full time beard that I like to keep fairly short, a little longer than 5 o&#x27;clock shadow short. I had a Remington trimmer, it worked great except the battery was horrible on it. I jumped to this shaver as a replacement, but it doesn&#x27;t cut anywhere as good as the Remington did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature is more of a novelty than anything. It does pick up about 80% of your hair, but you&#x27;ll still be cleaning up the remaining 20%, so it really doesn&#x27;t save you much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t trim evenly because of the comb design, which is terrible. It has a big open space right where the trimmer is at, if you trim at a little bit of a strange angle be prepared for a very short or bare spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s battery dies, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Portable&lt;br /&gt;* Looks Great&lt;br /&gt;* Does vacuum about 80% of your hair&lt;br /&gt;* Easy clean up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Horrible Trimmer Comb&lt;br /&gt;* Vacuum still drops about 20% of your hair&lt;br /&gt;* Not a great one swipe trimmer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different trimmers and have been less than happy.  This one has been pretty good!  The vacuum feature does, surprisingly, capture a good chunk of the hair. Don&#x27;t expect it to get it all though or you&#x27;ll be very disappointed.  I love how easy it is to adjust and the number of settings that it offers.  Anyway, this is the first trimmer that I&#x27;ve actually been happy with! Recommend!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a vacuum assisted razor. I don&#x27;t have experience with any others, but this one seems to work well. It doesn&#x27;t capture all of the hair, but it captures alot of it and makes clean up easier.</li>
            <li> I shared a bathroom. Number one complaint was me leaving beard hair everywhere after shaving. Not anymore, thanks to this Lege&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace an older Norelco Vacuum Beard unit I used for YEARS.  I liked the previous model, and this newer model is better than the previous model even when it was new.</li>
            <li> With beards and stubble becoming popular again, after 30 some years of being clean shaven, I decided to give a beard a try and so I did some research to find the best beard trimmer. I&#x27;ve always liked Philips Norelco, and have used their electric shavers for years, but what made this unit really stand out to me was the built in vacuum that captured a lot of the cut hair. Upon trying it, I really like this unit and am happy with my purchase. The built in guard quickly slides up and down to adjust the length and it can go from a very close stubble to much longer. The battery life is fantastic, I think I charge it maybe once every 2 or 3 months at most. And the vacuum function really does capture a good deal of the clippings, making a lot of a mess to clean up in the sync. Some of the downsides is that the unit is a little bulky to get all the area on my upper lip (mustache) and that the door for the captured hair opens a little too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Captured a lot of the hair so very little sink cleanup&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;No separate combs to loose, all in one unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A little wide so it&#x27;s hard to get the upper lip area&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum door opens too easily so can make a mess if you&#x27;re not careful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good purchase and I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 11/2014***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the unit for over a year now, and the quality isn&#x27;t a high as I&#x27;d like. I had one unit that stopped working altogether, but contacted Philips&#x27; customer service and got a replacement unit. It did take almost 4 weeks though. Also, on both the old and new unit, the door that held in the waste stubble kept breaking so that it wouldn&#x27;t stay closed. I have to hold it in place which is annoying. I downgraded my review from 4 stars to 3.</li>
            <li> WITHOUT TRYING IT WAS RETURNED</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! His facial hair use to be messy and all over. Now that he has such a nice trimmer he actually enjoys maintaining his beard. I&#x27;ve got to say, its a win win.&lt;br /&gt;It has various length settings, turbo, and its portable. Easy to use and easy to clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I remember when I was looking to order this product that there were some bad reviews because of a missing clip etc. You can ignore all of those. The trimmer comes with everything and is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have only ever used a cheap Whal trimmer, thought I would buy a decent one.  Keep looking this one is horrible at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would not even cut my beard except on the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; setting, instructions say this cuts the battery life in half.  Even on turbo it struggled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cut even close to the claimed 1mm stubble setting, even with the guide completely removed I had to go over my face ten times to get most of it cut.  Eventually gave up and dug out my Whal, the Whal will nick my face sometimes but at least it works.</li>
            <li> I specifically purchased this item to give my beard a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the best i can get is a stubble beard. Not close enough for the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;look I wanted</li>
            <li> One of the best trimmers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Works great and the battery last long. I used it every day and have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I saw this highlighted in \\&quot;Mens&#x27; Magazine\\&quot; and ordered one. I like to cut my own hair and beard. I like the way this one works, and the results. Priorities starts with adjust-ability, that is can i make the adjustments for shorter here and longer there. This is a hit, and the speed is adjustable, too. Next was getting into the smaller areas and corners. Its a little big for that. The sell point was the vacuum catcher. This little compartment keeps the clippings from dropping down my neck. The problem is, that part broke rather quickly, and now i have the little door held closed with a rubber band. Some engineer tried to safe money for the company but making that part cheep. If i had a choice to do it again, i would not.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but works good</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift so I am unable to write a detailed review, however he likes it and says it better than the last one he had. he said it works great for trimming his beard which he keeps very short.  He likes the vacumn feature so there is no mess in the sink!!!</li>
            <li> Works great as a beard trimmer, but don&#x27;t expect much from the vacuum system. I guess I have thicker beard hair than most, so the vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped for. It does catch some hair, but It just seems to clog up and most of the hair ends up in on the counter top anyway like any other trimmer.  The trimmer itself is good and does a great job of trimming my beard. My unit came with both the stubble and contour combs. The battery lasts for a good amount of time before it needs to be recharged. I do like the LCD display that shows the length setting and battery charge remaining.  Overall, it works great as a trimmer, but don&#x27;t rely on the vacuum system to capture all of your hair if you have thicker hair.  Update: I&#x27;ve upped the rating to four stars. I&#x27;ve found that if I use it more often when my beard hair is shorter, the vacuum system works better. It&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t capture everything, but it works better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get an even trim with this, even if I go over the same spots again and again.  I&#x27;ve tried both comb attachments, same issue.  Also the open comb attachment has pointy and rather sharp edges which can hurt.</li>
            <li> Vacuum doesn&#x27;t suck up everything but to be expected and still a fantastic product. Received within a week.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible and mangled my beard.&lt;br /&gt;On top of that their 45 day risk free warrantee is worthless since they can&#x27;t seem to email, snail mail, or fax a form to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another product from Phillips Norelco and would strongly recommend that no one else does, until they fix their customer service.</li>
            <li> This really sucks up all the hairs and leave behind much less hair on the counter top then regular shavers I think its a must buy for men with facial hair</li>
            <li> Does a nice, efficient job of cutting your hair and not your face. The vacuum that sucks up the cut hair may be a bit gimmicky, but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Awesome job, goes above and beyond to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with cheaper trimmers for years and never got a quality trim without really working at it....  The Philips Norelco does a great job with minimum hassle in addition to keeping all the hair in the unit and not all over the sink - well worth the money!</li>
            <li> My husband LOVE&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVES this beard trimmer! Says he can shave in 5 minutes verses an HOUR or more with his old Norelco shaver! It&#x27;s a whole new world of enjoyable shaving he says! And he really likes that it sucks the hair in like a vacuum so it&#x27;s not so messy!! Great buy!!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Upgraded from an earlier model. Works great. Vacuum will not capture all hair but significantly reduces mess. I&#x27;m a user of Philips vacuum trimmers for 5+ years.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer and catches 95% of the hair trimmed in its compartment on the front if the shaver. If you are trimming facial hair it should catch most of them while using to shave a childs head you might have some stray hairs that it doesn&#x27;t vacuum up. It will shave down to a stubble of a quarter inch or so but you can make adjustments to longer lengths. I would recommend using it over a sink but you won&#x27;t need any elaborate setup with something on the floor or even a towel around your heck. It is certainly not designed for hair that is much over  an inch or two so would not recommend it for people with long hair. Its great for back of the neck cleanup and facial hair trimming. I had a conair trimmer before this and it was not nearly as good and broke down fairly quickly within 6 months.</li>
            <li> Good quality trimmer, no hairy mess to deal with, easy to clean,with good battery power digital meter lets you see how much power you have. Love it.</li>
            <li> Ok, first of all the trimmer works exactly as described.  The reveiwer who complained about cutting their lips must not know what he&#x27;s doing because I have not experienced anything of the sort.  Also, mines came with the extra black guard unlike what other reviewers mentioned.  It works, hair is sucked in, and my face looks good.  My mustache looks the best that it ever looked and my beard is oh so perfect. I would recommend this for anyone who still wants some hair on their face but not for a complete shave.  Good product, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> The design is awful!!! Especially at shorter lengths. It either gouges or trims uneven when changing angles. I have had great success with other models but this one belongs in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a stubble trimmer, and I was reluctant to buy this one after reading all of the reviews, but there really wasn&#x27;t any other great option, so I finally just bit the bullet and ordered this one.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, this did come with the extra contour guard that everyone says is a must.  I must agree as well.  I tried the first guard, and not only are the points on it sharper making it more uncomfortable, but there&#x27;s a big opening in it making it much harder to get an even trim.  I could put it on 4mm, and still shave down to the skin if I don&#x27;t keep it at a perfect angle.  There&#x27;s a big gap in the guard that you could easily stick your chin all the way down into.  Then I tried the contour guard, and it is a lot better.  I got a much more even trim, and I think it helps do a better job of trapping the trimmings and getting them vacuumed up.  I was hoping that when removing the guard that I could use it for a close shave on the detail work, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not very good at that.  Still, I&#x27;m happy since I&#x27;m replacing some corded hair trimmers that I was using.</li>
            <li> I have used a beard trimmer for better than 15 years and this trimmer is a pleasure to use. If it lasts at least as long as my last one did (15 years), it truly will be a great investment.</li>
            <li> the vacuum works just not as well as I had hoped but in the end it is less of a clean up then usual and most of the other comments about the turbo setting having to be used is mostly right but depends on if you can waste a little extra time not to use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this clipper, its noisy and not precis. Not recommended! I don&#x27;t know why I bought it, its definitely not worth the money</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Remington that died.  I saw some back and forth in previous reviews about the guard that comes with it, but some got two, and I got both the floating and regular heads.  I have no problem with the regular guard and have actually been using that one.  The vacuum works good, although it&#x27;s not like a professional one that&#x27;s actually hooked up to a real vacuum.  You still want to do it over the sink or trash basket, but there&#x27;s a whole lot less mess to clean up, which is about where my expectations were.  My main complaint and reason for docking a star is actually for edging with the guard off.  There&#x27;s kind of a molded guard that prevents putting nice sharp edges around my beard for a clear shaving line.  A mustache trimmer would have been nice, but I can&#x27;t dock for something I knew it didn&#x27;t have and bought anyway.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for closer shaver then pass this one. I returned mine next day because shaving wasn&#x27;t even and wasn&#x27;t close enough. I have older and cheaper Philips that shaves better than this.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good and the vacuum function works well. Like I saw in a video review for this it is kind of hard to shape with because of the positioning of the trimmer. I still use a razor to shape my beard and neckline which I am fined with because I never use electrics for full shaves but this is an easy way to keep it trimmed evenly so I don&#x27;t have a mountain man beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men that just like keeping a bit of stubble this is great for that also with the height adjustable settings I find the 8-9mm settings are a good compromise between a beard and stubble to maintain for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this almost daily for a month and I love it. For the price I might want something that would be easier to shape with but that isn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on the basis of reviews which said the device is fine, the problem is that they omitted the contour comb, but you can obtain the missing part by calling the company. I planned to call the day I received the item to have them send me the missing part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, when I opened the package I discovered that both attachments were included, just as the box and the enclosed paper manual says.  I have no experience with the item as yet, but I want to confirm that the company appears to have rectified their error and has begun packaging the contour comb with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Overall, I cannot recommend this trimmer based on several design flaws I believe will be problematic for most users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight of the QT4070 is probably its design \\&quot;look and feel\\&quot;. Despite some reviews that disagreed on the vacuum effectiveness, I do feel it works very well. However, in so doing, it introduces an additional functional design flaw that reduces the quality of this model. It&#x27;s difficult to shave a straight line, such as the sideburns. Since the vacuum opening is raised very close to the cutting blades (and is no longer a flexible shutter), it gets in the way of making straight line cuts. This is a critical issue that should be corrected for a trimmer at this price point. I would rather the vacuum feature work less effectively in order to have the trimmer work as expected - if a trade-off is required. Not being able to easily trim neat sideburns defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device itself also feels lighter, and has the feeling of less durability compared with earlier models. The vacuum deposit area is now a door instead of a drawer. It&#x27;s less effective and causes more messy cleanup. The door is awkward to open, and subject to breaking if you apply too much force. Likewise, the door is also a part of the storage volume, so when you open it up, shavings are likely to fall out and create a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital blue cutting depth and charging indicators look very nice; however, the rotary length selector lacks grip and is not smooth to turn, i.e. it feels cheaply made. This again, is a step backward from earlier models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My impression of this shaver is that the designers attempted to drastically lower the cost of materials, but compensated by making the product \\&quot;look\\&quot; better. I think they were successful in creating a lower quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the lithium battery, this seems like a product with a consumer retail value of $15-$20. If the older models were available, I would trade the QT4070 in an instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a non-impressive re-design of a product that was previously fantastic. I really hope the Philips Norelco engineers \\&quot;run\\&quot; back to the drawing board, and ensure the next generation of this trimmer re-focuses on quality and effectiveness of its core features. Thumbs down.t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a non-impressive re-design of a product that was previously fantastic. I really hope the Philips Norelco engineers \\&quot;run\\&quot; back to the drawing board, and ensure the next generation of this trimmer re-focuses on quality and effectiveness of its core features. Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> The built-in vacuum make for a much cleaner and neater bathroom sink surface.  The unit has a quality, solid feel.  I found the width of the cutting edge a little wide making trimming of the mustache around the lips a little tricky.  It also requires a little lighter touch over the skin than I am used to.  It is very easy to adjust, and a series of blue lights monitors the battery status.  I appreciate this last feature as you don&#x27;t start the morning off with a unit that does not work.  All in all I would recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> does the job, but not quite as effective of a vacuum as i would have hoped. catches probably 70%, which is better than 0%!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s also hard to line up to do a direct trim at the neckline because the guards block your view a bit - never had a problem with a full trimmer that had detachable guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;super easy to use though with the mm specific dial, and i trim my beard much more often because this device&#x27;s variability can get the actual length i like.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple shavers with guards to achieve stubble. This is the only one I have found that easily and effectively gives me an even 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> Husband uses it several times a week to keep that professorial look. Only complaint is the cheap door on the raiser keeps popping open. Have to keep it shut with a rubber band. You would think that they could make a small change to the design to fix that. But know about this flaw when I ordered it so was not surprised just annoyed. Still does an excellent job of cutting at various heights and it stays for weeks between charges.</li>
            <li> Great service and product worked as expected. Love the fact that it has a built-in vacuum to hold 99% of the hair.</li>
            <li> if you want to spend your money i would suggest to look somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe i got a defective unit and I should have asked for a replacement... or maybe the entire thing is planned to fall apart after one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the pro, the trimmer works pretty nicely but after exactly one year the problems started (and the warranty of course was expired).&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use the turbo charger anymore, an &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; is displayed on the screen and the trimmer stops working completely; sometimes the same happens during normal use!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the vacuum system really ever worked, i always have to be careful where i trim (especially for the 0.5 stubble) because it makes a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;door hinge/lock&amp;#34; broke almost immediately and i have to hold it closed during the entire trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big thing for me since i constantly forget to charge it is that you cannot really use it while charging, the cable doesn&#x27;t stay in place at all and you have to hold the connection if you want to use it while charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again the trimmer itself works nicely but all other problems are really annoying, i would use my money somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver to keep a stubble on my face and it worked perfectly. It didn&#x27;t make any mess all thanks to its&#x27; built in vacuum system which watched the hair in a little chamber. Aside from the stubble option, it has various length settings to get the desired shave that you are looking for. On top of that, it was affordable. I recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their stubble.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality but is still makes a little-bit of a mess. It prevents hair to be all over the place and it collects the majority but you will still get hair all over the place.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the device. However quite disappointed that when the device arrived, I realised that I needed an adapter for the power cord to charge the device. This means that I now have to go and find an adapter, possibly buy a combination pack for the world and not just for this device. It would have been good to know beforehand that this was the case and I have been told by friends that when they received their electrical devices from overseas they got an adapter included in the quoted price. The company surely knew that I would need one posting it to Australia. Ummm!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to replace my older trimmer with this one. Its smooth, good battery life, nice adjustments but the vacuum does not work as advertised. It collects only ~ 60 % of hairs and 40% scatters.</li>
            <li> Bought it for someone. They said it&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
            <li> i bought this for myself, and am glad i did. the razor works great and it keeps the stuble to itself unlike other one i had. the suction on the vacumn really works. holds charge good too!</li>
            <li> It is good, but not as expected, I mean it does not give me the option to do different bird styles, all what I can do is normal shaving, which sometimes sucks!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but the power cord is stiff wire, not very flexible. Also while the digital display shows the length (in mm) that you have it set for, I&#x27;ve had one instance of the battery running down and the actual length setting and that displayed were incorrect when plugged back in. Fortunately the digital display showed shorter than the actual setting so if this is some kind of &amp;#34;computer glitch&amp;#34; you will not cut your beard to short. The settings can also be read on the side of the adapter so not much chance of screwing things up. All in all I like it and use it regularly and will keep it.</li>
            <li> Quality product and given the engineering I believe it was well worth the price. Philips Norelco products are well engineered and this one was very efficient and did a good job</li>
            <li> The vacuum fills up rapidly. The blades are inset too far to work as a mustache trimmer. It has a hard time keeping up with large amounts of hair and cutting it evenly. It&#x27;s just not worth the money. My older clipper that was of similar design without the vacuum was much better.</li>
            <li> I use this about every 3 days. I have always had Norelco products, but love this one the best ! The built in vacuum keeps the blades clear of whiskers from clumping up like my last one. Very easy to clean, and I love the digital read out.</li>
            <li> As one who is generally disappointed by nearly every gadget I buy in one way or another, I am surprised to say that this is indeed the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. High marks in every category: form, function, versatility... the vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch all hairs, but most, which is more than I would have expected. Only time will tell if it holds up, but really it&#x27;s cheap enough that one could buy a new one every five or six months if need be.</li>
            <li> Great to have the 0.5mm steps and the display of the adjustment. Great to have the battery charge guage. Fast charging is also a great feature. Fits the hand well.&lt;br /&gt;I recommed havig the vacuum over not having one but done expect it to get all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace a Remington MB 70. The Norelco is better in all ways except that the vacuum doesn&#x27;t quite work as well and there are more hairs trapped in the removable comb.  Since the MB 70 doesnt seem to be availavle any more and the batteries gave out on mine this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing.  The vacuum, one of its main selling-points, works very poorly and only collects about 25% of the hair.  There is a gap which allows hair to enter into the spinning mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the previous model which was better.  I can&#x27;t understand how this company can re-design something so that it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  I couldn&#x27;t care less about the digital component of this.</li>
            <li> The Vacuum is weak but what a nice tool!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this, not me, but he loves it. It seems reliable. He has had it for about a year and a half now and hasn&#x27;t complained!</li>
            <li> Despite mixed reviews on this item, I decided to go ahead and purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned it for roughly 6 months now and am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a short beard and have not had any issues.  Vacuum function works great when the turbo mode is on (I always leave it on).  The vacuum is not 100%, but it gets most so that a simple wipe down on the sink gets rid of all the remaining hairs. My girlfriend never nags me about hairs in the sink (thank God)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the razor is super easy, just open vacuum compartment door and empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the stiff comb, based on the reviews here that people were having trouble with the contour following comb.  I have not had any issue with the stiff comb so I just been sticking with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life has been great, charges fast and last several trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality razor, was worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t understand why so many negative reviews, am I not enough of a razor expert in order to critique it further?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular guy here definitely recommends this razor</li>
            <li> Item did not last very long and had issues after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> F$&amp;ked after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I like how it works. The vacuum does work, but mostly on shorter hair. The battery holds a charge for quite a while, however if you do any body grooming with the razer, then you should leave it plugged in.</li>
            <li> ok, first the good:  It looks good.  It shaves ok.  The battery seems ok (second time around).  Works from the outlet without needing to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now - not so good:&lt;br /&gt;This whole vacuum thing is a joke.  At best it get half of the shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Latch on the shaving compartment is very flimsy.  It broke of within the first couple of month requiring scotch to keep door closed.  Previous models had this compartment removable without the need for doors.&lt;br /&gt;For $50 might have included a stand.</li>
            <li> After being fearful of replacing my T980 for some time, I finally broke down and bought this trimmer after one of the comb tines broke on it.  The new one arrived today, I charged it up and tried it.  Damn, it&#x27;s a honey!!  Aside from not being able to pull the hair receptacle out to dump those little suckers in the trash like the 980 let me do (this one&#x27;s hinged), which I prefer, this is a terrific trimmer.  I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t decide to replace my old (apparently worn out) one some time ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably one of the laziest people alive when it comes to beard grooming. I trim my beard because of a policy at work. Keeping that in mind, I quickly run over my beard once a week with this trimmer. And for the most part it does a decent job. It comes with 2 combs, one that contours to your face, and one that stabs you. Leave the second one in the box, it&#x27;s worthless. I usually get 3 trims out of the battery, which is cool, but pointless. When&#x27;s the last time you were in a bathroom with no outlet? The trimmer is adjustable for cut length, which is my favorite feature of this product. It adjusts in 1mm increments, and it tells you on the LED display what length you&#x27;re at. Pretty cool. Another cool thing about this trimmer is how easily it pops apart and snaps back together for cleaning. Now on to what is not so cool. The vacuum feature is a gimmick. It fills up immediately and sometimes to the point that hairs are backed up and blocking the trimmer blades from cutting. You have to stop and empty it, but yet there are still hairs all over my sink. So it really only catches some of the trimmed hairs. You&#x27;ll still have to clean up the sink and counter afterward. Personally, I&#x27;d rather skip the mid-trim emptying, and just let it all fall. The other thing I find lacking with this trimmer is the ability to edge. The blades are located in such a way that it&#x27;s difficult to get my upper lip, near my nostrils. I end up using scissors there, which does not go with my lazy beard grooming philosophy.  Update: Now I&#x27;ve had several months to use this trimmer. I&#x27;m reducing it from 3 stars down to 2 stars. The little door that holds the vacuumed hair no longer stays closed. The snap has broken, allowing the door to flap around if I don&#x27;t keep my thumb on it. And I still find it annoying that I have to empty it constantly during trims. Comparing this to my previous trimmer, a $10 Wahl Beard that lasted me over 5 years, this product is clearly not in it for the long haul. Piece ofjunk...and an expensive one at that.  Update 5/21/17: I&#x27;ve had this trimmer a few years now. About 6 months ago I noticed that the battery quit holding a charge. If I unplug it, the trimmer will only run a few seconds before turning off. It&#x27;s now a corded trimmer. Also, the springs inside the contouring comb always pop out when I remove it for cleaning. EVERY SINGLE TIME. The little plastic clips that hold the springs in place are no longer functional. This product has reached the end of it&#x27;s run with me. I did manage to get almost 3.5 years of use before calling it quits, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I was a happy customer during that time. I&#x27;ve ordered a corded Wahl Peanut to replace this trimmer. Something I probably should have done a long time ago, but I wanted to get my $50 out of this product. Funny, the Peanut sells for $40. So in summary, I really have no clue why this product has such a high user rating. I do wonder if most of the users rate it after a single use and never look back. Because really, and I mean REALLY, this trimmer was pretty much a huge letdown. I do not recommend it for any use for anyone. Here&#x27;s to hoping the Peanut works out much better than this...</li>
            <li> The latch which holds the hair is made of cheap, thin plastic.  Within a few weeks of regular use the plastic latch broke and fell off.  I got a replacement but that, too, broke within a few weeks.  Now I have a rubber band to hold the door shut - a poor solution for what was supposed to be a great razor.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this trimmer for the vacuum feature and it works as advertised. It will collect most stubble in the built in container. Not all mind you, probably 98%. Definitely a good buy and would recommend it anyone that uses a trimmer regularly..</li>
            <li> Really happy with this shaver. I haven&#x27;t touched a razor since buying this. Easy to use, battery lasts a long time - great for travelling. Hair vacuum works well too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and works like the description. Some very fine hairs do fall through.. But it&#x27;s essentially mess free. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> works great, as expected!</li>
            <li> Husband says works ok, but wish it would cut shorter.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Philips/Norelco beard trimmer. My T980 is still good, but the cutter unit won&#x27;t click into place any more, as the flimsy design causes a break at the housing. (Drilled holes for two self-tapping screws which works fine, but removal for cleaning was getting to be a chore). This one has the same design flaw, but only time will tell if they&#x27;ve used a more durable plastic.&lt;br /&gt;The QT4070/41 7300 feels good in the hand, on the face and moving through the beard. I miss the pop-up mustache trimmer that my first Norelco trimmer had, but the vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t leave room for one. I added their battery-powered detailing shaver/trimmer to my arsenal last year, as I maintain a close trimmed van dyke (goatee plus mustache).&lt;br /&gt;Hardly any trimmings left in the sink, and easy to use. Setting is locked, so no depressing the comb with the application of pressure, so it&#x27;s the safest one yet! Better collection box design (hinged), and it&#x27;s less bulky and slightly shorter than the T980.</li>
            <li> Well it can trim a beard, but the vacuum gimmick is really just that and there are other better trimmers out there.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever tried, it shows how many mm you are trying to cut. It has an awesome vaccuum technology and can remove almost all of the hair without the cap, its an awesome trimmer; the only downside is that you have to try to shave with the trimmer upside down because the blades are not long enough so thats how you can get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> My son loves the Beard trimmer so much, I&#x27;ll be ordering one for my husband.</li>
            <li> I love this razor for shaving my beard flip it on turbo and it cleaned up just about everything some hairs fly but it still works great better than having hair everywhere was out the vacuum</li>
            <li> Yeah, the vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch 100% of the hairs, but at least it&#x27;s like 90% or so. The battery lasts a lot and the extra power mode helps me cuts some hairs that my previous Norelco left cut halfway, yes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with a thick beard like mine and is tired of picking up 1000&#x27;s of hairs from your sink after you are done.</li>
            <li> ..the main feature for me was the vacuum feature: it does not work as advertised plenty of hair is going everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;The actual trimmer seems to work nicely, not better of worse than other ones, but the unique features of this one don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I got everything I expected. Charged it up and gave it a test run and it works great. I&#x27;ll give an update in a few months.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer that keeps a good charge.  At first I thought the whole vacuum thing would be just a gimmick but it actually does a pretty good job of sucking in the beard particles and makes cleanup  a lot easier.  So far so good as far as build quality is concerned.</li>
            <li> Save Your Face and Don&#x27;t Buy This!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing does not cut hair, it rips it out.  Very painful shave.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer WAS very good, but it completely stopped working after 9 months. 1 star for reliability/quality.</li>
            <li> Fantastic trimmer. Easily best on the market!</li>
            <li> Broke after 6 months of use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vaccuum part doesn&#x27;t work anymore and it can&#x27;t even hold a charge. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I bought a Phillips trimmer with a cheap Remington one in between. As with the 1st one, I am amazed by it&#x27;s battery life. It&#x27;ll last alteast 3 weeks on a charge. The vaccum feature that catches hair is super useful. I didn&#x27;t think it would be more than a gimmick when I bought it, but my sink has been much cleaner since then. It also looks very sleek and is comfortable to use. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Utterly disappointing response form Philips. Ordered Philips Norelco QT4070/41 trimmer on April 6th &amp; today its April 22nd... Can some one explain why this is taking this long.........??????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally unhappy.. as i was looking forward to using a philips product.. Dont know who to blame.. Amazon or Philips!! Bad job.... Going ahead with the cancellation.... You can keep this product with you.</li>
            <li> The product is very good so far, used it just a 3-4 times, less friction, easy length set up, Vaccum heally helps, smooth on skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it to keep a really short beard and its works well. It keeps a charge for a long time and it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag on any hair.</li>
            <li> I just contacted the &#x27;concerns team&#x27; as suggested by the chat representative. The guy seems not at all paying attention and seems pretty in a lousy mood as if they were partying and fluttering at a club.  I am new to electric shaving, so I was looking forward to some advice and tips. But now, I think I will just research on my own. The agent also mentioned that I can rinse the head under water, but the manual clearly says not to. For the most part, he wasn&#x27;t even paying attention to me as I can hear people laughing on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving unit seems okay on my first attempt, but it is just that it gets hot all of a sudden. I am little skeptical of what the drunk agent said that being normal.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works great. Two separate heads - one for getting close to the skin for a stubble appearance and the other to extend outward to trim your beard &amp; stache - even gives a clean smooth haircut. Strong vacuum keeps the sink &amp; counter clean and very easy to clean. This on replaces my old Norelco T980 - I have been looking for the T980 replacement for many months. Have not found anything that comes close to this. Earlier reviews show complaints about the stubble trimmer poking you and drawing blood. - This trimmer comes with the contour trimmer so no worries there. I have also used the stubble trimmer head - seems they may have redesigned this somewhat as it did not poke me while I was using it, but I was also being careful due to the earlier reviews....</li>
            <li> nice product, easy to use</li>
            <li> So far I am  very happy with this. I was replacing another vacuum trimmer that TSA removed from my luggage and broke. I am getting tired of TSA taking things and breaking things in my luggage. They have been good about reembursing me for those items but it gets tiresome dealing with them and the paper work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum has worked well so far. Understand the vacuum will not get all of the hair. It will get a lot of it. It also depends on what angle your using the trimmer. The settings seems to be accurate and useful. I haven&#x27;t tried the contour attachment yet.</li>
            <li> Works great. Needed something to trim the beard and this one has settings that are long enough for my preferred length. It is a little hard to do the mustache area, but it can be done with a little maneuvering. I have noticed the setting sometimes changes while you are shaving, so you have to keep an eye on it.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of the Norelco beard trimmer which I used regularly until the hair collection cup fell apart. This new one improves on every single element of that one, which is rare for most products, so I had to give it five stars. My wife likes the look of using this without the guard on the majority of my facial hair (which is fine with me - no razor burn), so I use this every other day to cut everything down and then with the guard to manage my goatee and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cup was replaced with a very secure door, so I don&#x27;t expect that to fall apart anytime soon, and there&#x27;s nowhere for hair to collect outside of the cup because there is no cup. This was a weak point on the old model. The new model uses a lithium ion battery versus the old NiCad - I don&#x27;t feel a need to go into the benefits there. There is a nice battery indicator replacing what used to be just a blinking red light. The guard height is a backlit digital number - much easier to see than the old one. These are all improvements over a trimmer that was good enough I would have bought another of the old one if needed. It is easy to get precise trim lines, and the turbo mode cranks up the trimmer speed and vacuum to the point where almost nothing drops and you don&#x27;t even have to be careful to get everything. This is just an excellent trimmer in every way.</li>
            <li> I was searching for years for the perfect stubble beard trimmer, and I&#x27;m glad I finally found this one. I tried almost every brand and didn&#x27;t find what I was looking for - they all had flaws. I virtually have no complaints and look forward to shaving with this puppy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts evenly and perfectly, gives me that truly 1 day stubble look whenever I want&lt;br /&gt;- Does not tug or pull&lt;br /&gt;- Both attachments work great (comes with a standard guide, and a contour guide)&lt;br /&gt;- Has a turbo mode which I haven&#x27;t even needed to use yet, but nice knowing it has it&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, isn&#x27;t too heavy&lt;br /&gt;- The LCD is great, all electronic, even the lengths&lt;br /&gt;- The vacuum system is a nice bell and whistle, but it isn&#x27;t 100% effective. I still shave standing in the shower so that there&#x27;s absolutely no mess to clean up. But still, you can feel the soft air being blown from the vacuum and it&#x27;s kind of soothing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this thing!</li>
            <li> The best beard trimmer I have ever seen and it works great. It does everything as was advertised. Love it.</li>
            <li> It do everything except vaccum. Tried all angles and hair stills falls and makes a lot of mess that have to clean, with and without turbo funcion</li>
            <li> I love the LCD display, the life on the battery is long, the vacum really helps to reduce the mess.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased at how easy it is to keep my beard trimmed with this unit. The comb flexes nicely with facial contours and the length settings are easy to use and stay reliably in place. The vacuum catches a lot of the clippings, but you will want to clean the sink after trimming to keep your fellow sink users happy. I trim the unbearded portion of my neck as close as possible with the unit after removing the comb and finish off with my shaver. Weekly trimming only takes a few minutes. I like this trimmer and the rating would be five stars if it caught all the clippings.</li>
            <li> Vacuum is nice but does not catch all hair.  Latch on cover for hair clippings compartment is plastic, small and weak and breaks so the cover doesn&#x27;t stay closed.  Had two - one replaced by Norelco under warranty - and both cover latches broke.  Badly designed.</li>
            <li> Quite satisfied with the performance and suggest that everyone consider this type of trimmer.  I am only 2 weeks in but I think it will last with a bit of care.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and efficient and the product lived up to all its claims, very pleased</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, its awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Bought another for my son in law</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. The only gripe I have is that when the guard is taken off it doesn&#x27;t trip close enough.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it! He says it&#x27;s the best beard trimmer he has ever had!</li>
            <li> very good, better than older models</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers I was replacing an older model Norelcom vacuum trimmer.  I liked the old one so much that I went ahead and bought this newer model despite all the reviews that had something negative to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After five months with this trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fast, comfortable, I found none of the &amp;#34;sharp comb&amp;#34; issue described in other posts, using either comb.  I think it was from a previous revision.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum does work in normal use, but be aware it is not going to work on a bird&#x27;s nest beard - it works well for those of us that trim our beards regularly.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is Li-Ion, giving it a great shelf-life and capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The digital display is superfluous, there are clear mm and inch marks on the combs that serve the purpose without consuming battery power.</li>
            <li> Hi..,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really fantastic shaver, and I really like it and recommend it to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;Supplier was great and prices soo good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mohammed Sagallah</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer. The adjustable length option is nice but a little flimsy. Takes multiple passes on curved areas of your face. The vacuum works ok too and helps keep most of the hair from flying around as you trim. Being able to use it while plugged in is good. Due to the shape of the head when you remove the guide hard to trim around your lip area.</li>
            <li> I was initially very pleased with this trimmer and it still does a good job with the trimming.  It is just that the rechargeable battery, which came fully charged, worked very well until the initial charge went down.  Subsequent charges have not lasted as long and now it will not retain a charge for any appreciable length of time.  I do not use this very often now.  Even though, I plug the charger into the wall and the status indicates charging, the next time I try to use it (no more than a week later), the battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not for this issue I would have given this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using a version of this trimmer for many years. Typically, I use it about every 4-5 days and it holds a charge through several uses before needing to be recharged. This is my third one in twelve years, and it does a pretty good job of keeping my beard and moustache trimmed. I know of no other such device that will vacuum the stubble, which is a definite plus as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Great man toy; can be used all over. The only thing I would consider next time would be to get a product that is all-in-one, so I could do away with my electric razor that shaves close and just have one hand-held item to carry in  my bags when I travel.</li>
            <li> Overall I like it.  The hair trap door is broken all of a sudden though.  Now I have to hold it closed when I use it.  I wish I knew how it was broken, but I&#x27;m not certain.</li>
            <li> this model does a nice job in collecting hair with its vacuum system and also does good job trimming beard</li>
            <li> I thought the older model was good.  This updated model tops that one.</li>
            <li> would def. recommend this to anyone...its vacuum chamber helps a lot during clean up..It was worth the upgrade from the previous</li>
            <li> Not the best out there but does descent job</li>
            <li> good product.  it does just what it is expected to do. I really like it.  so buy it you will love it</li>
            <li> Like so many others mentioned, the vacuum door is a little difficult to open. So far, I haven&#x27;t broken the clip. As far as how effective the vacuum is, it&#x27;s no better or worse than a Remington I used for many years. The one plus for the Remington was the flat base used to stand it on a counter. The Norelco won&#x27;t stand upright and has to go into a drawer for safety.  My beard is fairly short so I haven&#x27;t needed to test the turbo boost feature. Included with my warranty was the option to register online and get another 6-months of coverage. I hope I won&#x27;t need it, but it&#x27;s nice to have it.</li>
            <li> This stubble trimmer works ok. It gets fairly close when you take the blade guard right off, but it&#x27;s difficult to shave stubble evenly. It feels cheap, especially compared to the Wahl Lithium Pro Mini I tried at my salon (although that cost 4x as much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The really bad part is the vacuum door broke within a few months and no longer stays shut while I shave. If you don&#x27;t hold it closed manually, hair will go everywhere defeating the purpose of the vacuum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the battery, display, and vaccum system. But its impossible to have a perfect shave with only this machine.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. The only reason I give 4 stars is its vacuum quality. I had high expectations for its vacuum. But, it fails to suck all the hair and you&#x27;ll continue to see your hair all over the sink. Philips should work more on the vacuum part.</li>
            <li> great now  1st one was replaced due to a bad battery  - no hassle.  HOWEVER     9 MONTHS LATER    I HAVE THE SAME BATTERY PROBLEM.   I never know if it is going to work.  Had to plug it in again after 10 minutes usage.  I have down rated it because of the battery problem.  I can&#x27;t expect amazon to provide another one - it is the manufacturer&#x27;s problem.  I am trying to get hold to Norelco  - so we shall see.</li>
            <li> The old version was 10x better, this one is worse in every way. It doesn&#x27;t trim evenly, the vaccum captures far less of the hair, and the latch on the plastic door that holds the hair compartment closed broke after a few months. It wasn&#x27;t great from day 1, and went downhill from there.</li>
            <li> I like the adjustments to cut length by the Millimeter and the display telling me the setting.&lt;br /&gt;This is great for changing from stubble length to eyebrow length.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming eyebrows is very inaccurate with scissors and takes time. With the trimmer it only takes seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Beard trimming to give a stubble works great.&lt;br /&gt;Take your time the first few times you use it to understand what direction and angle to get what you want.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it on my eyebrows I started with a very high Millimeter setting and turned it down a bit and repeated until I got the length I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that head is made of plastic and the hair collection chamber door is plastic and I worry the plastic will break.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for about two years and it runs as well as it did the first time that I used it. I trim my beard about once a week and charge the battery about once a month. The trimmer is fast, easy to use, easy to clean, handles trimmings well, and does a great job maintaining different beard lengths. It is ideal for traveling since it runs for a long time between charges. If you like the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look and also want to go a little longer on your mustache and chin it is an excellent tool.</li>
            <li> It lasted about a year and a half, but the little &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; that keeps the &amp;#34;trimmings door&amp;#34; won&#x27;t stay shut on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;Add to the fact that the vacuum sucks INTO that compartment, it makes it a chore now to keep all the hair particles from showering all over you.&lt;br /&gt;I now have to carefully contort my hand to keep the door from popping open, while trimming my face...&lt;br /&gt;Nice...right outside of the warranty period.&lt;br /&gt;- 2 stars for that disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how well it&#x27;s shaves...  It does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;The battery doesn&#x27;t last too long, especially compared to my Braun electric shaver; you can hear the battery drain slowly each time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;On a full charge and brand new, you might get about 10 - 20 uses out of it before the battery needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;My Braun could easily go 30+ uses before being needed to be plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;-1 star for the average battery life.</li>
            <li> I realy like it. It works well and because of the vacuum it keeps my sink nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few more notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life seems to be quite good. I have had it a few weeks now and it&#x27;s still going on the first charge. Obviously, I don&#x27;t use it every day, but still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length adjustment is nice and seems to work quite well. Makes getting various lengths easy and it&#x27;s awesome not having a bunch of clip-on guards laying around for the different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Long charge, even shaving, vacuum hair collection a big plus</li>
            <li> A very good trimmer.  However I am on my second and the first wasn&#x27;t even a year old.  I didn&#x27;t have time for the warranty return route when the first one died so I had to buy a new one.  Then I made a warranty claim and the broken one was replaces without any problem.  The issue is recharging the battery.  They warn you to only recharge it for 70 minutes.  This is really important.  I was pretty good about this for 8-9 recharges and the unit worked very well.  Then one time I forgot and left it plugged in for 4 hours.  The unit would never hold a charge after that and eventually it wouldn&#x27;t even run with the charger attached.  A good trimmer but when you are charging it use a timer to make sure you don&#x27;t over charge it! If it didn&#x27;t have this charging issue (which is very easy to fix) I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Best everyday trimmer that I own. It works well without any tugging and very little mess. Should have bought one much earlier.</li>
            <li> Looks like a good and well designed product, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work well.  It doesn&#x27;t trim as evenly as my previous Panasonic trimmer.  The worst part is that it won&#x27;t hold a charge..  I plug it in to charge it, and it looks like it&#x27;s charging.  The next day, I go to use it and it won&#x27;t turn on.  It only works with the cord.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I had another Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer that worked the same way, but it had two heads on it that enter changed and I liked that one better. One was a smaller head that I could trim with better. Any way that one finally stopped working but it was a good one.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, great idea, but I found performance to not be all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could not get it to cut evenly, even with either head. I prefer a medium to shorter length beard and found it either would not trim this length well, or would only trim for me at the stubble settings, much shorter than I preferred. I could not get it to trim at the length I wanted to maintain, can not speak of longer trim settings. Neither comb head seemed to matter, and the one flexible head was useless as far as I am concerned. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging time and power was good (one hour for full charge). Turbo setting seemed stupid and more of gimmick than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, not worth the $$ being asked for it, defiantly NOT up to the hype of all the &amp;#34;be all to end all&amp;#34; you see everyone claim online and on You Tube also. :(</li>
            <li> - Battery life is excellent. Over 6 months of use and battery life has not changed.&lt;br /&gt;- Great for beard, body or even shaving your own head&lt;br /&gt;- light and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- great to use for a stubble beard&lt;br /&gt;- the setting for cut length does not jump out of position like some other trimmers&lt;br /&gt;- fits nicely into a standard travel bag</li>
            <li> Used it a few times now, working really well on 1/3&amp;#34; beard trimming.  Potent motor, turbo function is a plus.</li>
            <li> Purchased this last summer and have not had any qualms with it since. The adjustable height is nice for trimming facial hair to a uniform height and the vacuum is effective at capturing the majority of the hair and not leaving a mess in your bathroom. The &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; setting is a bit ineffective and found it easier to remove the guard all together and take to the face directly. Can run a little warm but that&#x27;s to be expected with any sheering mechanism as the friction builds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to those who can&#x27;t be bothered to shave on a regular basis and prefer the elegantly disheveled look as I do.</li>
            <li> This is really really great, I am happy with this purchase it is pretty much just what I needed. The hair vacuum is cool, it can be a bit tricky fully cleaning out the hair canister especially if the hair is wet, ( I am ocd with cleaning xD).But a cleaning brush with soft/rough heads is included! Albeit a bit small ...  but overall it is hassle free, and it hasn&#x27;t pinched me yet, which is why I got a new shaving device; my Panasonic I just got pinches my hair, so does the Norelco, but Philips, it seems they did this one just right! Oh, and it&#x27;s light as a feather! nicceee</li>
            <li> Works very well. Best trimmer Ive used so far. Length is easily selectable by twisting a knob. Turbo button makes it work 2-3x as fast and vacuum function sucks harder too to leave minimal hair on your counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1/7/14, the door to clean out hair does not close. The plastic tab that clips on to body is broken. Im trying to see if manufacturer can fix or warranty it.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1/11/14, Not going to bother getting replacement. I just super glued the tab back on and works again.</li>
            <li> I like the vacuum, the LED height indicator is a nice feature as well.  Seems to hold a charge for a long period, so far no cons.</li>
            <li> Use to trim my beard and sometimes trim down hair to shave completely if i&#x27;ve let it grow to long for my electric shave to cut. Mine came with the flexible guide and I have had no issues with it. The Trimmer cuts evenly and the adjustments for length are easy to set. The Vacuum is ok, as even with a day to day cut it doesn&#x27;t suck up some of the hair coming off, but does grab most. The charger is the same as the Senso Touch 3D so instead of having multiple charging cables I can just switch them out whenever one of them need charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have not experienced a bad product from Norelco and will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i am doing a mistake and buying a philips trimmer. Last one was 14 years ago and nothing changed. Fancier but also as bad as the old one. I am returning it and going with the made in use w. one.</li>
            <li> This is a solid trimmer with great battery.  It&#x27;s perfect for measured trimming, But could do better at trimming without a measured length.  If you remove the adjustable gauge spacer, It is difficult to use the trimmer for edging.</li>
            <li> It comes with all required features, vaccum thing works almost 80%..&lt;br /&gt;battery life is good..&lt;br /&gt;Little difficult in difficult areas of face, but i m learning..</li>
            <li> The philips Norelco, seems much better than my old Remington trimmer. The battery lasts much longer, we&#x27;ll see over time, seems like the more you use it the battery seems to deteriorate. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using philips norelco beard trimmers for years.  They used to come with an added attachment to trim tight spaces and it was perfect for trimming my mustache and chin.  They don&#x27;t include this anymore and it makes the beard trimmer pretty useless.  You used to also be able to get a much closer shave with that attachment, and I would use that for my final pass.  The regular attachment leaves a lot of stubble.</li>
            <li> This thing is ALL plastic. One drop to the floor and its gona bust!  And this will likely happen because there is NO grip at all..  There are two trimmer attachments and I found them both useless.  One is pointy and inaccurate and the other ones shortest length starts at around 2.5mm length... making it hard to get a good clean-ish scruff look.  Without the trimmer heads attached, Norelco claims 0.5 stubble length... I have to rake this over my face over and over to get all the hair which it just won&#x27;t do, always have to finish with a cheap $20 Remington.  The vacuum kinda works but don&#x27;t get all the hair so you have to actually clean out two things now, the trimmer and the left overs in the sink..  And the vacuum does protrude making it very hard to make trim lines..  Would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this is truly the best trimmer i&#x27;ve had ... the hair trimming is quite smooth, the vacuum works wonders ! truly recommended !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accurate trim, fast and clean.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: APRIL 2015, less than a year after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;This week my unit died (purchased May 2014). Problem with charging. Unit shows flashing yellow light pushing power on button.&lt;br /&gt;Unit still works with charger plugged into outlet.&lt;br /&gt;Charging overnight, next day - same thing. Called in for warranty replacement. They are sending a replacement and PP shipper for return.&lt;br /&gt;All well and good, but hoping for a unit that will last longer than (under) 11 months!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace my T780, whose batteries eventually died.&lt;br /&gt;It came with two combs, the contour-following comb being the same as that on my T780.&lt;br /&gt;That made it possible for me to buy and use it - I have use for only the contour-following comb.&lt;br /&gt;The unit works well under all the same conditions I used the T780.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco has always done some things on all their rechargeable products that are customer-hostile and have really irked me.&lt;br /&gt;The first is the inability to replace batteries. I have successfully replaced batteries on their shavers, but their other products are essentially impossible.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, unlike their shavers, you could never operate the trimmers with the charging cord plugged in. So they became useless when the batteries were dead, or if they lost their charge in the middle of a trimming - most annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, using primitive NiCad batteries just sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the first problem is still here. It may be possible to replace the battery, but if so, it&#x27;s not going to be simple and certainly not for the faint of skill. Oh, well - at least it&#x27;s a Lithium Ion battery now, so at least issue #3 has been addressed at long last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big delight is that issue #3 has been addressed. Hallelujah. You can plug the bloody thing in and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said at the outset, this unit works well under all identical circumstances. I find it to be a worthy replacement for the T780.&lt;br /&gt;The stubble collector bin door is a bit sketchy, and looks like the weak component. Making this user-replaceable would have been smart. You can have this replaced under warranty if it breaks within 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem absolutely identical to the T780, and that looks like the only component that is interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, I can&#x27;t find anything better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my product update at the top of this review.smart.

            <li> This is a great item for facial trimming.  If you have more body hair (chest, legs, etc) This item is not sufficient.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s first beard trimmer/shaver so we don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it works great with no issues. I&#x27;m glad it has the hair catcher though, I cannot imagine the mess without it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it!!! I would recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> The plastic feels a bit flimsier than my previous Norelco trimmer.  The comb stays in place and locked in to the length setting you choose. The vacuum chamber gets in the way of the trimmer blades and that makes it difficult to square off the edges of your beard or sideburns.  You need to hold the trimmer almost completely perpendicular to your skin to get the blades to touch the edges of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:October 2014&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tab that holds the hair clippings in has broken and now must be held with a rubber band or by hand.  Periodically the digital number that indicates the trim level goes berserk.  I have to remove the entire head and blade assembly, move the selector dial up and down several times and eventually it will reset.  Could be a disaster if the dial reads \\&quot;5\\&quot; but the blade is actually set to 1.  OOPS - there goes your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought a new one to replace a lost one of same type. I have a short beard and have tried many other brands before. This is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum function is effective, avoiding the mess almost totally.</li>
            <li> A little unwieldy.  Not great for getting close to edges, not very precise.  Sort of thick and clunky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this trimmer for about a year. Generally it&#x27;s working nice, but for me there some major problems:&lt;br /&gt;1. it comes without a case&lt;br /&gt;2. sometimes the hair stucks in the storage so it&#x27;s not so easy to out of there with the provided brush&lt;br /&gt;3. the battery life isn&#x27;t so long, I had a previous model, which had a much better battery&lt;br /&gt;4. the vacuum still not so effective</li>
            <li> UPDATE TO THE BELOW...  After less than a year, the battery only lasts a couple minutes if lucky. The power cord plug easily slips out of the bottom (and could drop in sink of water if you&#x27;re not careful) as the plug doesn&#x27;t seat itself solidly into the body of the trimmer. And finally, The little plastic door you open to remove the hair from the trap had its clasp wear out after just a few months, so no it just flaps around loosely and spills hair everywhere unless you&#x27;re careful about holding it down. So, off the shelf, this is great, but it becomes a pain to use after a year. One fix for the cord is that you could super-glue it into the body of the trimmer since the battery won&#x27;t end up being practical after a year anyway, and then that solves the dangerous problem of the cord plug constantly falling out...but then you have to be near an outlet. At this point you might as well buy a $40 T-edger trimmer that will last you much longer.  This was a replacement item for a Panasonic ER-GS60-S trimmer that died after less than a year of use.  The Panasonic was great while it lasted (not quite as good as this one), but the battery not being able to hold a decent charge after less than a year is unacceptable.  I wish I had found this Norelco trimmer sooner as it functions slightly better than the Panasonic with its vacuum and because the guard locks in place with the turn of the dial (the Panasonic&#x27;s guard would get bumped out of place sometimes, although I think they also have a new model with a dial to fix that).  But I like that I can use this while plugged into the wall whereas the Panasonic was limited to operating after charging on the stand for a while.  It&#x27;s a little loud with the turbo mode on...louder than a regular pair of Wahl or Conair hair clippers, but not obnoxiously loud.  You may or may not wake someone sleeping with the bathroom door shut. Regular mode, you&#x27;re probably fine, but I always use Turbo for my beard. It doesn&#x27;t catch all the hairs with the vacuum, but I&#x27;d say it catches about 85-90% which still helps dramatically with cleanup. The hair-trap door swings outward, pivoting from a hinge that&#x27;s located on the right side...you have to give a slightly aggressive push and pull on the left side to swing it open.  If you buy straight from Norelco, it now ships directly with the contouring head that everyone is raving about in the comments (apparently they removed it on the original change from the older model, but they now give you both heads in the packaging) so rest assured, this comes with everything you need.  The head has the widest range of lengths I&#x27;ve seen on any unit so far, and allows you to adjust 1mm at a time which is nice. I use this for a short stubble trim all the way up to side-burn cleanup, so the range is very nice.  It&#x27;s also very safe for body grooming, so this really does it all.  I can&#x27;t think of anything I dislike...it could maybe use a slightly stronger vacuum, but that may increase bulk of the trimmer and decrease battery life, so I can&#x27;t really complain.  This fits nicely into my compact / travel shaving kit, so I like it just how it is.</li>
            <li> ehhh, trying to get a close shave with this &amp;#34;vacuum shaver&amp;#34; is not all that easy. I wish the blades could have been designed to be pushed up, so that the blades can get in really close, but no dice.</li>
            <li> well mine runs about 1-2 min. on a full charge and than the red light comes on showing that the battery is low.  when you take the beard combs off it wont shave close enough to even touch a weeks worth of stubble.  my other clippers cut stubble nice and short,  they just don&#x27;t have a vacuum,  I quit using a normal razor because my neck seems to get reall iritated so i just use a trimmer to cut the stubble as short as possible but that just does not work on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now when i trim the long part of my beard it works quiete well,  if the battery did not start dying so fast,  the vaccume probably gets95% or more of the hair. there is usually only a few hair clippings laying on the counter that i just brush into the trashcan,  so very little mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i imagine i just got a defective unit as far as the battery goes,  ill probably have this one replaced or just return it.</li>
            <li> The vacuum function does not work at all, after first use I had to clean the bathroom as hair was all over and returned the trimmer immediately.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t get damaged in the shower. 5/5, and my face is happy too</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He loves the vacuum feature because it contains his whiskers and he can empty it in the trash. He says it works well.</li>
            <li> This is the best beard trimmer ever.  I almost never clean shave and use this daily.  By far the best trimmer out there.  The 2 different guards work excellent.  Ladies this is a great sticking stuffer for your man.  He will love it.  Probably his favorite gift of the year.</li>
            <li> 80% of the standard hair mess is not on my counter due to this amazing trimmer.  Buy it, BUY IT NOW.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a christmas gift. This was as advertised and when used was sharp and the vacuum worked great.  Would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for over 30 years.  Tried lot&#x27;s of different shavers and trimmers.  When I go to the barber he is able to give me a &amp;#34;shadow goatee&amp;#34; and I love the look.  Never really been able to give myself that look with my myriad of different trimmers - until now.  This shaver absolutely rocks.  It will cut your bear perfectly as long or as short as you want it.  I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This item was a gift for our son who started his beard for No Shave November.  When he decided to keep it this gift was a &amp;#34;no brainier&amp;#34;. He reports that is easy to use &amp; meets his expectations.  He looks good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of beard trimmers and (so far) have found this one to be very reliable. It holds a charge for a long time, has an accurate and easy to adjust length guard and the vacuum function is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, only four starts because I was hoping for a bit more from the vacuum function--it gets about 80% of the hair, which is certainly better than nothing-- and it only works so-so as a mustache trimmer when you remove the guard. Overall a nice product and good value.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QT 4070/41 Beard Trimmer 7300 does a fine job trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my old Norelco head was easier to precise trim, this unit collects the beard stubble much better &amp; it&#x27;s easier to blow out the residue.</li>
            <li> This unit was everything I expected and more. Received this as a gift from my wife and she picked the right one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable comb is very accurate at determining the length of the final cut and you can trim without great caution as it adjusts and tracks perfectly. This makes it easy to speed up the general trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades stay sharp and haven&#x27;t clogged or jammed on me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum/hair collection system while not flawless - is so much better than none at all. I&#x27;d estimate it gets about 90% of what I trim - making cleanup so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge life is excellent - I use it probably every other day and it lasts for months on a single charge. If I had to pick up another one it would likely be this one again.</li>
            <li> Work great and look great.</li>
            <li> This product was great when it worked. I bought it in january, use it about once a week, now its august and it will not charge anymore(have tried multiple wall outlets.</li>
            <li> My husband has liked it so far, and I am so grateful that I don&#x27;t have to clean up after every shave (I mean, he tries, but not to my standards:) The recharge lasts a long time, and it just looks so stylish!</li>
            <li> i love the length settings, tons of them, sets and holds well, holds a charge well, and the vacuum does suck up some of the hairs. the vacuum is not the end all be all of keeping the sink clean, there is plenty that it doesn&#x27;t pick up, but generally it works well enough and the vacuum does help to keep things cleaner.</li>
            <li> the vacuum part is sweet, works for the most part.  otherwise, i don&#x27;t really understand the great reviews.  this trimmer is great if you like 5 different options to get the same exact length beard: really short stubble.</li>
            <li> I like this thing, it works as advertised. The vacuum feature worked better than I anticipated. I only have one minor critique, the plastic guards on this have an opening so it makes shaving right under the nose rather difficult. If it had a rounded guard that went all around the blade it would make things a bit easier...</li>
            <li> I have a beard and a job. This razor enables me to keep them both. It trims my beard in a snap with little mess, though don&#x27;t be fooled by claims that it catches everything. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> It has nice features but the vacuum isn&#x27;t very strong so you&#x27;ll still make a mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the head height has a flexible plastic brush that when pressed against your face bends and makes the height adjustment pointless because it shaves you super short... Unless you basically apply no pressure..</li>
            <li> feel not as good as older model, vacuum less powerful or as easy to empty , but love quick charge and turbo feature.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased with this beard trimmer. I have been using another brand throughout the years but continued to have problems with the length adjuster. This product is great and adjustments are as simple as pushing a button. There is a slight learning curve with the look you want and the corresponding number. The vacuum works pretty good but do not expect it to pick up everything.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer, so far it functions as expected - most of the other reviews on here covered pretty well the pros and cons of this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said the build in vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch all the hair and I still find myself having to wipe down the sink after - but given that my beard is pretty thick and my trimmings are infrequent the cleanup is understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth the majority of hair is still picked up by the vacuum so it&#x27;s not as if the feature doesn&#x27;t add any benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback for me is that the design of the trimmer makes it a little difficult to get under the nose (mustache). With a little practice it&#x27;s still possible to get a clean even shave under the nose, but it takes a little time that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is great and charge is incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the beard trimmer and the vacuum feature is great!  I would definitely recommend this product to another person.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is a really great product.  After reading a number of online reviews I decided on the QT4070/41.  I thought the vacuum part might be a bit gimmicky but it works very well.  It&#x27;s a nice even trim and the mm adjustment settings are very nice.  All in all a great product!</li>
            <li> Love everything about it. Had the model down from this until I dropped it on its head and broke the adjustment. This trimmer is just as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the display on it, and the suction is alright nothing I couldn&#x27;t live without, but makes things easier for cleanup. Trims real well and comes with the two heads now, smooth and stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line for the price it is hard to find a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature makes it very neat to use. After I got familiar with the settings, it was much easier to use than the Remington that I owned previously.</li>
            <li> Bought this thing 3 years ago and still running strong. I thought maybe it was time to change it up and go with a Remington trimmer but that was a worse mistake than trimming your bits and pieces without the trimmer guard! Went straight back to this baby. Vacuum works better than expected. Turbo mode gets the job done. Very happy. Wont try another trimmer ever again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sadly the product is extremely disappointing. The issues: 1) it simply does not shave well or evenly. I have to use it 2-3 times over to produce an OK shave. Its a waste of time and looks funny.&lt;br /&gt;2) Its uncomfortable. The plastic flexible comb attachment is uncomfortable to use. Occasionally the razor bites and it shouldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it says. Nope not even close. In fact its uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco, its as if you did not even product test this. How could  you possibly be selling such a poor product? This is the worst razor I have ever used and I have used many. I shave every 2-3 days and this is by far the worst shaver...its uneven, uncomfortable, and just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So buyers...I know there is a lot of positive feedback (it fooled me too)...but I&#x27;d recommend another brand.</li>
            <li> I had to replace an older Norelco due to a dead battery. I have been using this model for a few weeks now and it works very well. I especially appreciate the vacuum function, which shortens clean-up time - and I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints about hair around the sink. I would buy this model again, and in general I would certainly pay a little extra for the vacuum feature again as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to other reviews: the extra comb is now included in case you were wondering. I also never felt that the few stray hairs that the vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up were an issue. I would rather have a couple hairs to clean up then hundreds.</li>
            <li> i read most of the negative reviews and i was really afraid i will get a useless item; especially those they spoke about cutting their lips :)&lt;br /&gt;in fact this is the best machine i ever used, fast, not noisy, light, the vaccum is useful (not the best but good)&lt;br /&gt;i gave 4 and not 5 stars and the reason is that i was hoping it cut cut shorter than this; it was mentionned in the specs as short as 1/2 mm but it turns out that i would want shorter.&lt;br /&gt;but over all it is a good product as long as it keeps working (i received it 2 days ago), i would recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two (first one last 5 years).  Great product.  Also bought one for my son-in-law.  I recommend highly for people with beards.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a beast, it holds a charge for at least a weeks worth of daily use. I have not had any trouble with pulling hairs and the cleanup is a breeze! I was skeptical of the vacuum feature but it really works. The turbo button rocks, I use it all the time for the extra power! Both included combs work well depending on your needs!</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews before buying this.  The vacuum feature is what got me curious.  My wife hates hairs on the sink and I am not always great about getting it clean.  So I told her about this shaver, and she said BUY IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come with both &amp;#34;guards&amp;#34; - and i liked the contour following one for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a very even cut with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of people saying the vacuum feature is not good - but I completely disagree.  I found it collected 90+% of the shavings and works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after seeing reviews. After using i realized its  not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;1) The vaccum is not worth. It does not suck all the hairs. You will still end up hair on sink &amp; on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;2) Its not 1/2mm trim as specifed. I tried using directly &amp; it took so much time to trim. Turbo is complete waste just makes lot of noice. I am returning the same day.</li>
            <li> Having used numerous trimmers over the past 15 years, I have seen improvements in trimmers but am still looking for the perfect one. In the end, like most things, you have to compromise and decide what is important to you. I was looking for a cordless rechargeable trimmer, with quick charge, Lithium Ion battery for sure, with a vacuum and adjustable head that trimmed well.&lt;br /&gt;I think I made the best available choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lithium Ion battery - 1 hour charge - good battery life&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum that works somewhat&lt;br /&gt;Both types of trimmer heads included (Philips learned).&lt;br /&gt;Regular and Turbo trimming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum only works somewhat&lt;br /&gt;Trimming results a little uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I think this device has the best combination of attributes available, now I just have to be a better user of the tool. I thought my previous Remington trimmer had more consistent trimming and the vacuum worked a tad better, but the battery life was horrible and it ultimately couldn&#x27;t hold a charge. Hopefully I will grow to like this one even better as I get better with it.</li>
            <li> Whenever I&#x27;m in a rush and looking scruffy, I can pick this up and trim it all down to an acceptable level in less than a minute. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t capture ALL the hair but it does capture most of it so cleaning up isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> I hate cleaning the hair that scatter all over the sink when I trim my beard - I was looking for something that could help me avoid that and came thru this. For the price that I paid for this, I am disappointed in its performance and capability for suction of cut hair. I would just go with a water proof one at this point and trim in shower!</li>
            <li> I ordered it as a xmas gift. The receiver loved it very much. He has a beard and it works fine</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job well but vacuum could be a bit stronger. Other than that i am very Happy with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver about a year ago to trim my beard and moustache.  One comb came with it.  This comb pinched and pulled so severely at my beard and moustache, that I discontinued using the shaver.  By chance, I today read the answers on this site to questions others had posed about this trimmer and learned Norelco added a new contoured comb to this trimmer after complaints from purchasers.  I called Norelco (866-779-0279) to purchase the new contoured comb.  Guess what...it cost me $24.90, including shipping.  What a rip off!  I hope it solves the problem.  If not, I&#x27;ll be back here to write another review about the contoured comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped Norelco would have sent the contoured comb for free and apologized for the trouble the original comb caused me.  That would have been the humane response, and would have made me a much happier consumer of this product.</li>
            <li> This product really surprised me. The vacuum feature works way better than I ever expected. No mess anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product stays charged for a long time, the display works really well and is responsive. It comes with two attachments. Great instructions. The vacuum allows you to get a clean shave perfectly. The brush included is crafted well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually keep my beard long but this device encourages me to keep a clean shave. Like the instructions say, start long and progress shorter to get a feel for how it cuts, you get the hang of it fast. I don&#x27;t review often but this product works great.</li>
            <li> I have owned a lot of norelco beard trimmers and this one is as good or better tehn any I have ever had.  The price was very good.</li>
            <li> Picked this guy up recently and was excited to see how many ways I could put this to work. Mustache/beard trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past have always been excellent multi-taskers, allowing me to trim much more than the name suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One use I&#x27;ve always found incredibly nice is the ability to trim eyebrows. Unfortunately, as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve got more and more eyebrow hairs that just decide &amp;#34;welp! It&#x27;s OLD time! Time to grow extremely thick and long!&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ve had to start clippering them regularly. With my old trimmer, this was no big deal. Set for #3 blade, press against the right temple, apply a little pressure to get the hairs to stand up, and run it across the brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this unit, the plastic is so soft on the blade guard that rather than causing the hair to stand up, the guard just bends. Now I have eyebrows that are almost non-existent toward my temples, and nearly regular length on my nose bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard/mustache trimming are excellent, and I like the contour following guide better than the one that comes on the unit itself. I just wish that one or both were made of stiffer materials.</li>
            <li> I had an older model that finally died. I found this one to hold it&#x27;s setting better and really like the digital battery readout. The attached vacuum is a huge plus. It&#x27;s also light than the older model. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> it is almost the same as the one I wore out had it many year&#x27;s This one has a few improvements</li>
            <li> Wonderful way to deal with the beard,  trimming rather than shaving. I will never shave again!! I trim to  1/32 of an inch twice  a week and my wife is happy and so am I. Brilliant!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would keep the sink cleaner than the trimmer I was using.  Well, the vacuum part of it does seem to work, so the whiskers mostly end up in the little compartment.  But then you have to clean the compartment anyway, so the trimmings still end up getting loose anyway.  Meanwhile, this thing is noisy.  I pretty much have to insert earplugs to protect my hearing when trimming near my ears.  And it doesn&#x27;t trim very well, really.  You have to go really slowly, and over and over and over again to get all the whiskers.  The corded trimmer is much quicker and gives more even cut.  I went back to the corded, and this now sits in my drawer.</li>
            <li> I used to trim my beard with a little $5 set of clippers and these work MUCH better.  The battery seems to last a long time as well.  I like how it trims everything easily and isn&#x27;t too messy.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and fast my concern is without head you still get rough beard i had an old one used to provide better results</li>
            <li> Vacuum function is lacking for sure and would be nice if it had an attached pop up mini trimmer to get more precisely around the mouth and ears.</li>
            <li> Craftsmanship is excellent.  Adjustment for my short goatee seems to be a little tricky.  Still experimenting, but I can&#x27;t quite seem to get it dialed in.  It&#x27;s either too short or too long.  Could be me ... or not.  Excellent battery life.  Vacuum mostly works.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. I use it almost everyday. Shaving (electric or razor) just gives me cuts. This on the otherhand is great. No cuts. Charge keeps for a long time. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up all of the trimmings, but it helps a lot with the cleanup.</li>
            <li> The vacumn is nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nearly 2 years ago to the day.  It is a decent shaver/trimmer of average to below average quality. The vacuum feature is nice but not 100%. Unfortunately, the clear compartment that snaps shut to hold trimmings latches with a flimsy, brittle plastic tab that broke off on mine 1 year ago.  Now the compartment just flaps in the wind.  My fix for that was to attach a rubber band around it to keep the trimmings from blowing out all over the place. Replacement parts for this unit are ridiculously priced so don&#x27;t even bother checking.  Are you going to spend nearly $30 for a new cutter head when you paid $45 for the unit?  Today while trimming beard, the unit started giving me errors and stopping.  After investigation, I found that you can easily remove the cutter unit.  Inside it was jammed with beard trimmings.  I was never aware that there is a second place trimmings accumulate.  I cleaned the trimmings out of the cutter unit and fixed the jam.  No big deal but it appears that besides emptying trimmings from the obvious compartment, you need to periodically clean the cutter head.  Now on to the battery life.  For the first year I could charge this unit and get 4 or 5 uses out of it.  Now the battery is much weaker and lasts 1 maybe 2 uses.  No easy battery replacement and none that I could find.  It requires dis-assembly of unit. Again this reinforces my belief that this is a throwaway unit.  I would have paid more for one that had replaceable batteries and cutter units that were reasonably priced.  Overall the fit and finish is what you would expect with a low to mid level consumer device.  The clipping compartment door will eventually break off and the vacuum feature become useless.  My advice is to purchase a cheaper unit you know you will be chucking out in a couple years, or go with a higher quality unit with better construction and decent, available reasonably priced consumables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture 1 shows unit with cutter head removed for cleaning and the notorious plastic clippings compartment, small plastic tab simply fatigued and broke off (should have been a metal clip)  Picture 2 shows other side of unit with cutter head removed as reference. I couldn&#x27;t get a better photo of the clear plastic compartment cover but as you can see it is just cheap plastic and that tab will break off sooner or later.ng and the notorious plastic clippings compartment, small plastic tab simply fatigued and broke off (should have been a metal clip)  Picture 2 shows other side of unit with cutter head removed as reference.

            <li> I shopped for a good versatile trimmer that could leave the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look with precision. I was very happy to find a model that had a vacuum to help curb the mess on the sink that other razors leave. It doesn&#x27;t totally prevent the mess, but I don&#x27;t have to shave outside anymore--it does a good job. The digital depth indicator is great as well. I really like this razor and expect to use it for many years. The number of depth settings makes it very versatile.</li>
            <li> the best beard trimmer i&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t have to clean up at all. The position and length stay very well. the charge stays good for a long time. Nothing is wrong with this product, at all!</li>
            <li> The vacuum on this shaver sounded kinda gimmicky, like a Flobie for beards, but it has its uses. For me, it was helpful for quick touch-ups on my sideburns and, with my wife&#x27;s help, for cleaning up my neck in the back and around my ears. Unfortunately, I keep my stubble shorter than this shaver was really good for. Generally, I use a Wahl without a guard, which is extremely close. The Norelco Vacuum needs slightly longer beards, but was great for trimming when I grew me beard out while camping. If a longer beard was my look, I would really like this device. Like other reviewers, I did find it hard to trim under my nose, but elsewhere it was fine and produced less mess. So, for touch ups and beards longer than a few millimeters the Norelco Vacuum works well.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product.  The plastic latch to the hair trap broke after a couple of months, forcing me to tape it shut so it wouldn&#x27;t hang open. As a result the razor is constantly clogged with hair.</li>
            <li> The product is way underpowered. I have moderately thick hair and it takes me a full charge to do a trim because I have to go over and over my beard. Its not just a problem with my specific trimmer - I have other Philips products. The vacuum gets about 75% of the clippings, but I&#x27;d much rather have more juice going to the clippers - whats the point in a vacuum if the clippers suck?&lt;br /&gt;[Note: it is underpowered even in the turbo setting, the regular setting it useless]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are flimsy - very thin plastic that bends and breaks easily. The Philips warranty does not cover these, so they gouge customers on the cost of replacing crappy attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Customer Service Representatives are truly the worst reps I&#x27;ve ever encountered. They do not know basic facts about the companies products or policies. Every call takes 30+ minutes and ends with the rep saying they can&#x27;t help with even basic requests: it took 10 minutes for the last rep to find the product number on their computer! I asked one rep if their job was really even intended to be helpful to customers and he said his job was really just to deflect complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a 45-day money-back guarantee, but you have to use the product for 21-days and it takes Philips a week to process your return request. Since the return must be postmarked by the 45th day, you only have a tiny window to return the product on time. They basically made  the guarantee useless, especially since it took me 45 minutes to get the customer service representative to fill in my information for a return. UPDATE: They told me they would process my return within 3-5 days, its been 10 days and I have 2 days left on the guarantee. I spent another 45 minutes with a rep and they said I would be okay to return the shaver in 3 days - the 46th day after buying the shaver! I made it extremely clear I had to have the return before then, they knew when I purchased the shaver. Additionally, the product reps take care of 2+ customers at a time (they admitted this to me when I confronted them about all the long pauses on hold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And overall, the product feels flimsy and is made of lightweight plastic. This product is not meant to last, they&#x27;ve focused on gimmicky details rather than a good, reliable product. I bought this reluctantly after pieces broke on my last Philips trimmer, and its battery didn&#x27;t last long enough to give me a good trim, nor was it powerful enough. This product had better reviews, but shame on me for getting fooled twice. The positive reviews are people with thin beards who were smitten with the product during the first week - I&#x27;m certain they regret the purchase a few weeks later. I&#x27;m going back to Wahl - my last one lasted 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;55 days after I originally purchased the trimmer (10 days after the guarantee ended), I got an automated email from Philips asking me to complete a survey and product review. I cut &amp; pasted the above review. An hour later, Philips finally emailed me a return slip for the 45-Day Guarantee. The next day, they emailed me saying they were removing my product review!!! I had to report them to the BBB and write a negative review on their site to get them to honor their guarantee, then they censor the reviews of their products - completely unethical.</li>
            <li> Pro: charges fast and vacuums pretty good. Does well on cut lengths&lt;br /&gt;Con: the cutter can&#x27;t get the right angle tp trim mustache edge due to part of the housing being in the way.</li>
            <li> I love the whole concept</li>
            <li> I charged the trimmer as described in the manual. I used the trimmer for less than 5 minutes over the course of the first week and the trimmer required another full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this trimmer for a new one thinking this was an anomaly.The second was worse than the first. The trimmer seemed to be losing most of its charge without my using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Norelco Electric Shaver that works great. I charge it once per month or less. I had a previous model of this trimmer and really liked it. The vacuum function is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided not to try this one a third time. It looks like others may have had better luck.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the product when I first got it due to it&#x27;s light weight design, but after using it for the first time I fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absolutely works as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> I like the product, however not the best. The vacuum suction isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really strong and fast, and doesn&#x27;t jam like smaller trimmers do. And the vacuum feature, while not perfect, gets almost all the hair. Definitely happy with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for about a month now and am very pleased. The vacuum catch feature sure keeps the stubble clutter down to a minimum. The precision adjustable cutting feature is just that, precise. Very nice cutting length readouts, 1 digital in millimeters next to a charge indicator and a pre-set display in inches along the side where the trimming heads seat. My model came with two trimming heads, 1 stationary and 1 pivoting, and I would have given it 5-stars if the stationary head slipped on a little easier. You must align the fastening slots just right to get it to slip on. Outside of that minor fault, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband and he loves it. And I love it because it contains most of his shavings leaving me with a cleaner bathroom.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does everything it is advertised to do. I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> especially good for that stumble look</li>
            <li> Have used the trimmer a couple of times and it gets the job done. It is a bit noisy, but should be expected from a trimmer. Only reason for 4 stars is that it is a bit pricier when compared to the others..but overall would recommend</li>
            <li> I like the vacuum, but too much plastic around the trimming edge makes it hard to get a close precise trimming.</li>
            <li> it got rid of all the mess when I am trimming my beard</li>
            <li> Works well and I love the vacuum!</li>
            <li> a great product and good seller</li>
            <li> Its a good trimmer, but not for close ups.&lt;br /&gt;overall satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> good quality, easy to use, charge holds for a week or so, overall acceptable qualtiy.</li>
            <li> It is a surely useful tool that goes over my expectation. trim evenly, easy to use, and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband at Christmas.  All the other beard trimmers that we bought in the past had a problem with the attachments breaking.  This particular one looks much sturdier and I really liked the fact it has a vacuum to it.  The price was very reasonable con paired to others I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Narelco for my boyfriend for Christmas because he loves to make a mess in the sink! I love the vac feature as it does contain most of the hair. The compartment is easily removable and placed back with ease. Perfect gift! He loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer a week and the digital display doesn&#x27;t work right already. So sad.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is wonderful. Length options are perfect and the vacuum on this trimmer makes for a nice clean trim. Also the trimmers work sharply for a perfect trim.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Vacuum Beard Trimmer and this operates smoother than the first.  Settings for beard length allow for more precise trimming and vacuum function is a must.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was pretty good, bought it to replace a 2-year old QT4050.  Looks classy in every way, but it&#x27;s really the EXACT same thing as the QT4050, literally .  Same cutting assembly (interchangeable with the 4050), and same contour comb (interchangeable with the 4050).  Only real difference is the turbo mode and it&#x27;s sexy look.  In the future I&#x27;ll probably just replace the cutting assembly instead of the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I know that philips makes the best shavers on the market, but to be honest, I haven&#x27;t found the QT4050 or QT4070 to be better then their predecessor the T980, that was by far the best philips shaver I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Avoid Philips&#x27; online chat service for warranty claims: terrible communication despite my specifically worded messages, didn&#x27;t want to help me at first, didn&#x27;t listen to the issue I had (dull cutting assembly out of the box), and I still have yet to receive my replacement (it&#x27;s been 4 weeks).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a little over six months ago and I believe I have given it a very good try but it continuously is a struggle to use.  It takes at least 30 minutes to trim a beard because of the design of the shaving blades.  They become totally blocked and jammed with shaven whiskers VERY quickly because the vacuum is not powerful enough to remove them.  I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone nor will I ever buy another similar Philips Norelco product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for grooming stubble and/or body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not overly impressive, the vacuum will not get all the hairs, but it does reduce the mess created significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for an on-the-go shaver, but doesn&#x27;t quite match up to a full kit of barbering tools.</li>
            <li> Has many useful features and the hair clipping vacuum function actually works, especially when trimming using short setting. When using longer setting it clogs up so cleaning out more frequently is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall wish I had one of these long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product due to some negative reviews.  I can see that without the contour head that this would be very uncomfortable.  I did find a recent review that said the new packages came with a contour head and a regular head.  So I took the chance and that review was right.  I got both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated having whiskers all over the vanity when I was done trimming my beard.  That is no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Norelco</li>
            <li> This specific model would not allow close trimming of my moustache and then it would not charge so I returned it about 2 weeks after buying it</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews I was a bit skeptical purchasing this trimmer...but I knew I wanted a trimmer with a vacuum to decrease the mess.  I&#x27;m definitely beyond happy with my decision of going forward with it.  When I received the trimmer I tried using it with the two different attachments which come with it but found that it did not give me the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look that I like.  So hesitantly I remove the comb attachment and decided to try it with just the blade (I was afraid cause of the reviews I read about others cutting themselves even with the comb attachment on).  Anyways, I have now been using the trimmer without any attachments for two weeks and have yet to cut myself.  So, if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this trimmer...don&#x27;t be and make the jump you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Also, the vacuum works like a dyson!</li>
            <li> Great product.  This will shape up every beard  and will do it fast.  It will also leave you that nice stubbly 5-oclock shawdow look if thats the look you want.</li>
            <li> Ordered on 8/26/13 and mine came with both combs, you no longer have to call Phillips to get the contoured comb.</li>
            <li> So happy to find the shaver that has replaced my older Norelco beard trimmer. In my experience with the last Norelco over the past 9 years, it was clean cutting, easy to use, and always kept my beard &#x27;shipshape&#x27;. The new model incorporates great updates that add to its utility.  In all, they are rugged, easy to maintain, and are built with quality not found in other brands. Great shaver!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s one reason somebody would buy this beard trimmer and that&#x27;s for the vacuum feature. While it&#x27;s not perfect, it certainly does the job. You may still have some clippings around the sink but it does suck up 90% of them which is 90% more than any other machine&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a contour flowing comb, which I&#x27;ve read older models advertised but did not contain in the box so Phillips have fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a strong beard so for me, I remove the comb and use the machine on the lowest setting which is 0.5mm for an even stubble and buying this machine was all about the vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;One downfall is that, the blades do not protrude enough which means holding the machine upside down and creating an outline for your beard or sideburns is not possible. For this I switch up to a small $10 machine I have lying around just for that.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a solid build and bulkier than any machine I have had and slightly loud, but I think that&#x27;s just because of the vacuum feature. Charges quickly and so far I&#x27;ve used it for about 30-40 minutes in total and haven&#x27;t charged it since the initial charge. Good led indicator for charge too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it would be better if the blade protruded out a little more so i didnt have to use a second machine for sideburns but the vacuum feature is the sole reason I bought this in the first place and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time or money. While a great idea, the vacuum system on this trimmer makes it almost worthless.</li>
            <li> perfect beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard the thickness of a lumberjack for the past 15 years or so and have tried(and killed) quite a few trimmers.  For the longest time I actually just used a regular industrial barbershop electric clipper(for the head) which there is no comparison for the ability to mow down the chops in no time.  That said, it&#x27;s not so good on fine facial features, setting length, and portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the most versatile and utilitarian beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  The length settings are locked in(opposed to a slide guard found on many) at the MM length and no worry about the length attachment accidentally sliding creating a bald landing strip on you check.  The rotary click dial makes it easy to set and read.  There are two power settings on here but due to my thickness I just use the turbo all the time.  I can&#x27;t say much about battery life on the go since I keep it plugged in most of the time.  One nice feature though is that when the batter IS dead, you can plug in and use.  Some I&#x27;ve owned in the past require the battery to juice back up before you can use which is really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum function is a neat idea but still needs some perfection.  When it&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;no mess,&amp;#34; it should be more accurately put as &amp;#34;less mess.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s true, you don&#x27;t have clippings flying all over the counter, nor is it without a few.  I&#x27;d say around 70% get trapped and the rest fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good clipper, will see how it holds up over a few years.</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra money for the upgraded version with the LED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic feels cheap... turbo mode does little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of hair escapes the vacuum and still creates a little mess in the sink, yet still less so than a standard electric timmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i find with the standard guard that taking it off still gives you the &amp;#34;1mm&amp;#34; length, not the 5&#x27;o clock shadow I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it IS useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just overpriced at above forty denaro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be worth getting the &amp;#34;downgraded&amp;#34; model and the extra money does not gain extra quality.</li>
            <li> Suction is not sufficient even after full cleaning. And the clip that holds the stubble release door has broken, so that I must hold it closed manually, Leaves tons of stubble in the sink even on turbo mode which defeats the purpose. Might as use a regular buzzer.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how quickly my stubble would turn into something shaggy and nasty.  This saved the day and works painlessly to whisk away those whisker remnants with its clever little vacuum.  Some old reviews were critical of an earlier version but this one seems to have all the problems resolved as of January 2014.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works very well, love the ability to adjust the height to all the different lengths. Both combs are great. Vacuum catches most the hairs. Battery seems to hold a charge for a good amount of time. Overall exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have gotten so far. Works really well and sucks up 80% of all the hairs that are trimmed and saves the clean up time by a lot. I would recommend this product if you care about your beard! #RNS</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shaving products for years and had been satisfied with all but the last shaver I bought.  The last shaver I bought was the poorest quality Norelco shaver ever.  I was very reluctant to purchase the current product for fear it would not be any better.  I was pleasantly surprised, however.  It is made from much sturdier material, handles easy and cuts cleanly.  The vacuum feature is very nice and makes the razor much easier to clean.  The plastic parts lower the rating.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband for christmas. he doesn&#x27;t really have anything to compare to other than a razor blade and cream but he loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought on in the summer of 2011. Used it nearly daily and it ultimately stopped working in 2012. Great trimmer. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Phillips and they told me that they no longer make this and cannot do anything regarding replacing it on my warranty. Yet Amazon and other resellers still have it (currently writing this Feb 08 2014).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought a new one in 2012. Didn&#x27;t get much use because I have a job that requires clean shaven face. So sure, the battery died during a long period of non use and no charge. Went to use it today, dead battery. Tried charging, nothing happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my result is I love the product, but it dies out very easily it seems.</li>
            <li> I read loads of reviews before deciding on this one.  My main concern was that everyone said the trimmer cut their lip, but further comments said that the second (more traditional) guard was now supplied and so it was great.  Based on this i bought it.  What i found was that the second guard worked fine, but really didnt cut the stubble short enough.  I found that it left me looking too unshaven, scruffy, like i wasnt making an effort (def not good enough for the office).  What i had seen on one post was a guy saying that he had read the other reviews and despite that was having no problems with the main guard and that actually it gave him a closer shave.  So i decided to give that a go and * definitely* found that the normal guard was better for me.  Im super careful when doing my lip because of all the warnings people had, but so far have not cut my lip at all, and have goten a way closer shave than with the second head everyone was asking for.  With this main head i get a really awesome length of stubble which is exactly what i was looking for.  It takes about 10mins to do, is noisy but makes very little mess in the bathroom, and has really great results.  From my experience of a few months its turned out to be a 5 star razor for getting a great stubble look.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a definite step up from my older Norelco, which essentially had only the most basic feature of a trimmer:  An adjustable guide.  In the interest of deciding whether it&#x27;s worth it to spend the additional money, I will compare the two.    The QT4070 blade cuts very smoothly and evenly, much better than my old Norelco.  The old Norelco (without vacuum) had clippings all over the sink and counter--the QT4070 vacuum captures around 97%, which leaves the sink and counter pretty clean.  The QT4070 battery keeps its charge well.  The QT4070 digital readout ensures I have it set to the correct length, and lets me know how much battery power remains.    There is, however, the need to be more careful in the use of the QT4070 than my old Norelco.  The QT4070 has a gap between the top guard and the side guard, which leaves the cutting surface more exposed.  (I.e., you can stick your chin between the guards, and get closer to the trimmer than the guard setting would otherwise allow.)  On the old Norelco it was impossible to bring the cutting surface too close since the guard covered 100% of the cutting surface.  I was initially concerned, but got the hang of it by the second use.    Conclusion:  The QT4070 is of course a luxury, but it does deliver for the additional price.  Any trimmer will do the job.  For the additional cost, the QT4070 will provide a smoother and more even cut, with a much cleaner sink and counter, keeping its charge well, and providing a clear digital readout.</li>
            <li> OK, for those guys out there who cultivate that \\&quot;I don&#x27;t need to shave everyday\\&quot; look, this may be the thing for you. I like a clean line &#x27;tween my goatee and the rest, so it&#x27;s not my bag. I thought I would give it a try for those times I wanted to cut down the goatee, too. Doesn&#x27;t cut long enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;At first pass it seems well made, nice controls and a good battery. The &#x27;vacuum&#x27; deal is a mixed bag of tricks - it doesn&#x27;t really work that well. It did keep some of the stubble from falling in the sink, but I could take or leave it.&lt;br /&gt;The thing is SHARP however. No pulling or tugging or any of that. And when you do use it for leaving stubble, it does a great, even job. If I were into that, this would be my choice. Very nice for the price!</li>
            <li> Replaced the slightly older model as I forgot the older one when traveling back to the USA for an extended period. Also the older one had a broken vacuum chamber door. Hopefully this one is more robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel lock is great, it works well except hard to get in near the nose/mustache part of the beard due to it&#x27;s slightly larger shape. But after some research I think this is the best deal around. The vacuum is really pretty nice at reducing the mess.</li>
            <li> Overall a solid facial trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cuts great--like new every time.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a long charge.&lt;br /&gt;Precise trimming and edging.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Door flap broke a few months in. Major pain.</li>
            <li> So glad I got this for him. I love the vacuum it has on it so now he doesn&#x27;t make such a mess</li>
            <li> This thing works as advertised.  I own the norelco everything so I&#x27;m biased towards the brand.  Having said that their products generally last for years before I end up losing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the beard trimmer because I wanted better control over my facial grooming.  Product works.  The cutting edges are rounded so there is little chance you can cut yourself if you use the lowest setting.  If you are looking for a groomer at a reasonable price point with some added features, go ahead and buy this thing.</li>
            <li> advertised as 1/32&amp;#34; cut but micrometer measures it as 3/64&amp;#34;.  that may not sound like much but i don&#x27;t shave with a standard razor &amp; instead use only a trimmer.  after a shave i usually have a 1 day beard look.  with this unit it&#x27;s a 3-4 day look.  if tight trims aren&#x27;t important to you this is otherwise a fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li> So this is a good product with cool features such as the hair catcher where you can throw them out in the trash and there arent hairs all over the sink. The reason I gave it three stars is because of a huge problem I have with this product. Every single time I shave this product does seems to leave a good deal of hairs without being cut forcing me to have to go over them with scissors. It is a huge pain in the you know what. I have tried to go over the hairs plenty of times over at different angels but still nothing. Overall, Good product with cool features but somehow has troubles cutting all my hairs.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected . Did not pick up any hair in the vacuum</li>
            <li> Nice even cut and better than average short beard trimmer. It&#x27;s not great for precision grooming or trimming mustache.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Turbo&#x27; mode sounds like a fighter jet, I cannot use it at night when other people in the house are asleep. Otherwise, works excellently.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the initial picture shown, the razor is black (like additional photos shown), not greenish blue.  The vacuum feature is awesome.  I was skeptical of how functional it would actually be, and I&#x27;m happy to write that it&#x27;s done an incredible job!  A few facial hairs still hit the sink, but this razor captures ~95% of regular trims, and the facial hair container is an adequate size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; feature is really neat, and I&#x27;ve fount it helpful when I&#x27;ve let my beard grow a little longer than I should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts well and the power cord and connection is very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mm display and the guard is awesome. It&#x27;s easy to read, it&#x27;s consistent, and it doesn&#x27;t move (unlike other trimmers and trimmer attachments I&#x27;ve owned previously).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use and accurate I can diversify my professional look to a tailored beard or stubble look without having to be clean shaven all of the time.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these. The first worked great and although over time had lost its ability to hold a charge for as long as it used to, it still worked great. As with all shavers, the blades just became too dull for my application, so I got this new one which is the same as the first!</li>
            <li> Excellent in every way. I&#x27;d buy it again.P.</li>
            <li> Second one I have owned. Works great</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  Functions as advertised.</li>
            <li> Since everybody wants to see the cons - the capacity of the clippings container only lasts half a trim before it spits hair everywhere. Lesson learned I empty it more often now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer feels nice in the hand. I thought at first I wouldn&#x27;t like it because I was used to a trimmer with a curve, but it&#x27;s great. The vacuum works quite well (until its hopper is full), it&#x27;s not overly loud nor is it an annoying noise maker. The display is very helpful, showing you charge status as well as length settings.  It also came with 2 types of &amp;#34;caps&amp;#34; for lack of a better word. Plus, since it will run off the cord even if/when the battery gives up, if you don&#x27;t want to replace it you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> This light trimmer is great.  I chose it because of its 18-length settings plus 1-more without a comb.  It has so many features, I can&#x27;t think of anything else I&#x27;d want.  It charges quickly, and can also be used with the supplied cord.  I was skeptical about the vacuum feature, but it really works, even without using the boost feature.  It collects virtually all hair if you don&#x27;t let the collection chamber get too full and brush off the filter.  It comes with two combs, one of which is a spring loaded contour comb.  A reviewer said tines were sharp and hurt, but I had no problem.  If you do, it&#x27;s simple to hold the tines near the tips for support and use a jeweler&#x27;s file to smooth.  5-stars for sure.</li>
            <li> best since the 980.  good that they now include the guiding comb, but hard to use the blade only portion to trim upper lip etc due to shape even when you take comb off</li>
            <li> Very Good excellent!!! Nice smooth comfortable enjoyable new useful necessary a must have. I feel better about myself now. Look out new and improve me.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who does not like a clean shave. I like a very little amount of stubble, so with this Norelco model I can trim my beard without a comb and just get a very close shave, without it being clean. It&#x27;s better for my acne and I enjoy the look that it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At times the suction feels like it gets clogged and you have to scrape some of your hairs out to get it going again. Also the battery lasts for a long time, but once it drops below half the second half goes very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is the one device I use to shave my face. It&#x27;s multi purpose because you can use it to trim other parts of your body too. Would really recommend someone who wants not a clean, but close, shave give this a go.</li>
            <li> The vacuum cleaner of the Norelco really works well. I was looking for this feature.&lt;br /&gt;The precision is quite good.&lt;br /&gt;The seller send the item in a nice packed way.</li>
            <li> Simply a great beard trimmer. First off I don&#x27;t go for the stubble look, I keep my trimmer set to around 10-13 mm. It works great, just keep in mind when going from a longer beard to much shorter your need to go in steps. The vacuum works great and gets most of the trimming. I can&#x27;t say it get&#x27;s them all but having 80-90% less hair to clean out of the bathroom sink is a great thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for a couple of months now and it works.  I can see the potential for breakage with some of the plastic pieces but the trimmer works well and the vacuum does pick up most of the trimmings for an easier sink cleanup.</li>
            <li> I love it,  It&#x27;s light, handles easily, and retains it&#x27;s charge well.</li>
            <li> I always tried to trim my beard with scissors and one of the big trimmers that you can use on your head.  Then one day I manned up and bought one of these.  The difference is amazing.  I wondered how some guys had that perfectly groomed beard.  This is a major part of that.  Man up, get the right tools.  This is the right tool.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it! And I love the fact that it vacuums the hair - less mess left behind in the bathroom!  Just make sure you dump out the hair before transporting it as movement will cause the hair to fall out everywhere from the trimmer!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW! I have had many trimmers and this is by far the best one I have used. The vacume catches about every hair and there is no mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> Had it for about a month now.  No issues or problems.  Hopefully it last as long as my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is awesome. I like stubble beard and it does the job right. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star because I almost cut my upper lips  trying to trim my mustache.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I typically use the trimmer set at 12 mm (so my beard is a bit longer than those in other reviews). I can&#x27;t saw how this trimmer works for short stubble but I don&#x27;t like it for my longer beard. I trim every 2 weeks and I find that the vacuum is not strong enough for my hair, the drawer for the trimmed hair fills up quick, it&#x27;s not a very even trim, and it&#x27;s not a strong trimmer. A lot of the reviews seemed to be for shorter beards and it might work great for those but for my beard this doesn&#x27;t cut it. This might be one of the two worst purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon but it might be fine for someone who just wants to keep a very short stubble. I still use it just because I have it but I often find myself going back to my broken Wahl to finish the job right (so it says something that a broken trimmer does a better job than this one).</li>
            <li> Great machine. i would say it&#x27;s my first one, but Nevertheless - i&#x27;m very Satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 09.2015:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to say that the vacuum feature isn&#x27;t working anymore :(&lt;br /&gt;what a bummer. I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m downgrading a star for this, so - 4 star is my new grade.</li>
            <li> Philips does it again.</li>
            <li> Terrible for trimming a beard - all or nothing, doesn&#x27;t really do anything different between the different settings.  For example I would run it over my beard at a level 4, 3, 2, and nothing would be cut.  When I used my old trimmer (4 setting), a lot would come off and my beard would look clean and even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how little you need to cut for this to work, but the little amount of hair left on my head was too much for this.  It won&#x27;t cut.  Hair gets stuck in the super teensy weensy vacuum hole.  More hair fell out of this contraption then was caught in it.  If you&#x27;re prepubescent, this if for you.  If you can grow hair, look elsewhere for a trimmer.  Going back to my conaire held together with duck tape.</li>
            <li> I used to own the previous Phillips-Norelco trimmer model and it was amazing. After 3 years of ownership it died and the old model was replaced by this so I was forced to buy the QT4070. Problems started early on. I first noticed how flimsey and cheap it looked and felt. All breakable/light plastic that I know will not last long at all. Then I discovered after each use the battery died and you need to charge it. Also the &amp;#34;digital light&amp;#34; displaying the comb numbers often mis-reads and displays the wrong numbers (if it decides to work that day). The worst part of all is the stubble trimmer doesn&#x27;t even trim. No, seriously, it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair at all. I can work with everything else IF the product actually trims a beard. This is not a double trimmer, it only works (barely) when you have the comb on and want to trim your beard with a certain number. If you want to get a closer trim/shave (like the older model) then forget it. I strongly advise you to not to buy this and save your money. I am still perplexed why Norelco &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; a perfectly fine product and made it into a piece of junk?</li>
            <li> I like this. This is the first real, quality trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had (after a series of not so great trimmers). Mostly, I love this trimmer. I use it almost every day. It keeps a charge and its functions were pretty easy to figure out. So far, the vacuum function has not quite been up to snuff, but I&#x27;m fine with that. It was really a bonus feature for me.</li>
            <li> I received an opened and defective product.  The blister pack inside the box was already cut open, the plastic guard is bent out of shape, and there are tiny springs and plastic parts broken off. Clearly this was a well used personal groomer complete with stubble residue! HEY Amazon, how about checking your products in the 9 days it takes to ship them? Or is this just my punishment for not ordering Prime?</li>
            <li> This would get my 5 star if it were a bit easyier to clean out.  But, it does collect the stubble, and you can&#x27;t say that about most other brands.  That is a real plus.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose well although the vacuum is not perfect. The battery charges quickly and lasts long. Its light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had.  I really like the vacuum concept, though it doesn&#x27;t work all that great in application.  I still get a decent amount of beard hair all over the place.  However, I feel that the trim is much more consistent than other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.  It&#x27;s hard to get the mustache hair closest to my nose, but other than that, works great.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much more effcient trimm withouth the guide comb but the beard barely comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very old Norelco Model and was a lot more effecient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a very closely trimmed bear I don&#x27;t recommend this model,</li>
            <li> iT IS FAR BETTER THAN THE LAST RAZERS I HAVE USED. THE QT4O7O AT LEAST , TRIMS A LOT MORE  OF MY BEARD CORRECTLY AND STORES THE TRIMMINGS IN GREATER AMOUNTS THAN OTHERS EVER DID.  THANKS!</li>
            <li> Shaver was excellent exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Good or better than expected. Great features and highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;View tips and guidelines | 10 more words required...one more...</li>
            <li> This is a great performing trimmer, with few drawbacks. I had an older model which I used for 10 years, and I&#x27;m happy with the upgrade. I am impressed with how well the vacuum works; if you trim at least once a week, it will collect almost all of your whiskers (unless you&#x27;re Robin Williams, or a member of ZZ Top). Others have been unhappy with the design of the new guide, saying it is too sharp. I agree that it is a little sharper, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be a problem. I have also found that it is better for trimming my sideburns, especially in the whisker/hair blend zone. Regardless, the trimmer came with one of the old style guides as well, so it looks like they&#x27;ve learned their lesson on that one. Battery life is good, and charge time is very fast. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t have the smaller mustache trimmer that older models had. Norelco has been the standard for trimmers for years, and continues to be so.</li>
            <li> worked great for 3 months. now it&#x27;s broken and only work when it&#x27;s plugged in to the outlet.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used! The vacuum is very helpful, as it can be used anywhere. It really does suck up all my facial hair without missing a single whisker.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Despite usually spending a lot of time on it at 18mm, I still need to go in sometimes and trim my face hedge with a Wahl, as it&#x27;s not always perfectly even (despite me shaving precisely how instructed).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a hurry or just don&#x27;t have the time for a complete shave then this is for you. The vacuum is a wonderful feature No mess to clean up. The battery lasts long if you use it 1-3 times a week. Easy to clean. Light weight but still durable. It certainly does what it is made to do.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with my gift to him of the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer.  He had an earlier model and used it for years.  Didn&#x27;t work any more, so I gave him the new one for his birthday and it is working fine.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco completely met my expectations. I charge the battery once per 2 months. Very easy to adjust beard lenght without damaging plastic changable head. One of the best design and useability.</li>
            <li> The door to the clippings collector chamber broke almost instantly. Still usable, but not as high quality a build as i would have hoped.</li>
            <li> Was getting this for travel and was expecting it to be a tad smaller but am not disappointed. They make great products.</li>
            <li> cant say how disappointed i am that they discontinued the best trimmer ever made...but this is second best, just because i dont want to risk being disappointed by anyone else.  the vacuum cup is nice and works well, but the door does open causing some frustrations...overall though, the greatest trimmer in the world lasted me over 7 years, if this one gives me 5....ill be happy.</li>
            <li> This is by far superior then the previous model.  The vacuum barely worked  on the lower model and i would just just get tons of hair on my floor. In this model I would say 90% of the hair gets picked up from the vacuum and the turbo boost gives a much better trim. VERY happy with this product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my old Philips trimmer that this one updated. Love it! It has a great feel in your hand and the digital readout is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Picks up bout 90% of shavings. Nice product. 5 stars if it picked them all up.</li>
            <li> Amazing beard trimmer! works just as described! great bang for your buck</li>
            <li> Boom! Best trimmer ever. Only I&#x27;ve only used it once so far I can tell you already I&#x27;m going to love this thing. It really does catch 90% of the hairs which is way better than other vacuum trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past. The digital display for length and battery indicator are awesome. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great quality shaver. Nice settings. Comes with both Trimming and Contour-following comb. Vacuum works pretty well, catches most hair; probably about 80 to 90%.</li>
            <li> Mine came with both the Contour Following and Stubble guards. I am loving it. The vacuum does a good job of collecting most of the trimmings and the adjustable height works well. I like the digital indicator for the length in millimeters. I agree that if this trimmer only had the stubble guard that would be a problem.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great.  It charges quickly, and if if dies in the middle of a trim, you can always plug it in. The battery and length display are a huge plus, and take the guesswork out of how much battery is left or if it is locked into the correct setting.The teeth are sharp and cut with no pulling or tugging, and the vacuum feature works pretty nicely, although after a week or so of trimming the sink does need to cleaned. It does ship with the contour head now if anyone&#x27;s still wondering. Overall, a very well made trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer replaces an earlier version of the Norelco vacuum model.  It has improved in being lighter weight, easier to hold and has a better grip.  The vacuum is superior to the vacuum on the earlier models.  I was a bit disappointed that this trimmer did not include a second more narrow trimming head to allow for shaving and shaping areas. I am using the second more narrow trimming head from my old trimmer as it fits and works perfectly with this new one.</li>
            <li> This item met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> In a world where you have limited time to shave your face thicket and even less to clean the sink below you there comes the mighty Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro. Don&#x27;t let the name fool you, this isn&#x27;t just for hair clipping professionals, but for the lowly ilk like you and I as well. For weeks I struggled using a tiny trimmer with a cheap comb and eventually I quit because the mess of hair left in the sink hardly made it worth shaving my face; as a result, I watched as daily my beard grew incrementally, looking ever closer in appearance to the heckled fur on a chihuahua&#x27;s back. A helpless feeling came over me because as it grew, I knew the mess my trimmer would create became larger, and drowning in my own fear and facial hair I reached out in desperation for Amazon&#x27;s website, where I found the Philips Norelco QT4070 and a breath of fresh air. I cannot more highly recommend a personal grooming item short of toilet paper, if it can be counted as such. A few people have complained that the turbo button is useless; to these people I ask, what in life would not be made better with the addition of a turbo button? Your car? Your Barbecue Spare Ribs? Your wife? Come to your senses people, if you have an option between something WITH and something WITHOUT a turbo button, you take the turbo button every time. Don&#x27;t ask stupid questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this trimmer get off the fence, build a new fence, climb on top and get off it again just to show the Philiips Norelco QT4070 how much you mean it.</li>
            <li> The vacuum system works as advertised which is awesome. However I was expecting a closer shave......the description has it going down to a .5mm setting but it actually only goes down to 1mm</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is very good and the vacuum works great. Five stars!</li>
            <li> I had the previous version of this product for many years.  I like this one even more since you can use it plugged in and I like the turbo function.  The old one had a nasty habit of dying half way through the trim.  Using this while plugged in is a big plus.  The vac feature is not improved over the previous model.  It still only catches maybe 80% of the hair.  In my opinion there is room for improvement of this feature.  Cleaning up a little or a lot if hair is not much different.  Other than that it does a great job of trimming and has a large selection of lengths to choose from.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> I really like it, but the numbers started getting offset. Other than that it does a good job, the hair trap thing fills up quickly.</li>
            <li> Does the job but very noisy while running.  Previous models were better insulated and motor much quieter.</li>
            <li> Purchased this trimmer to replace the QT4022.  First impressions: feels cheap and uncomfortable to hold.  The vacuum is an excellent feature, but the blade head is too big and impossible to use for precise trimming (upper lip, sideburns, ect).  Also it adjusts by 1mm increments instead of .5mm, which actually makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the QT4022 instead.  Very high quality, metal &amp; rubber build instead of cheap plastic and is contoured to fit the hand.  Just wish it had a vacuum and the lithium ion battery.</li>
            <li> Purchased about 6 months ago...battery wont hold a charge...period.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed to say the least</li>
            <li> Best grooming purchase I have ever made.  Now I can keep my beard any length up to 18MM.</li>
            <li> Turns on by itself. I had to crack it in half and cut the power wire for it to stop.</li>
            <li> I had huge expectations for this product because of the reviews, but after 2 months of use I realize it&#x27;s not for me, I would have preferred a washable trimmer instead of a vacuum system one, I spend more time cleaning the trimmer that cutting my beard, and the vacuum system isn&#x27;t perfect, it make some mess frequently.</li>
            <li> Charged once.  Worked great during that single charge. Never charged again.</li>
            <li> We are extremely satisfied with our purchase. All functions are exactly the same as listed on the box and the shaver is the same one. We cannot fault it.  One thing to be aware of is that, if you intend to use this product outside of the US, you will need an adaptor for your country of residance.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement to an older Norelco Beard Trimmer. This is no where near as good as my old one. The big issue seems to be that the head/combs do not pivot so it is very difficult to get an even trim which is odd since the \\&quot;lower\\&quot; less expensive model has this feature. Save your money and get a better trimmer buy the Norelco with the pivoting head/comb.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on the Qt4070 and other beard/mustache trimmers, I took the plunge and ordered the QT4070. I received the trimmer last night and was quite impressed with the neat packaging and the clear and concise instruction sheet that came with it. It took me an hour, as expected, to charge the trimmer fully and I set forth to trim my beard.     I have a very light goatee which was probably about 13-14 mm long. I started with setting the trimmer at 11 and then slowly kept going down and till I finally stopped at 8 mm. At first glance, it looks like the trimmer did a good job, but, then, I noticed that the hair length was fairly uneven at anywhere between 4 and 12 mm. Clearly disappointing. The vacuum mechanism worked reasonably well and sucked up most of the hair cuttings (about 80%).  Then I tried to get a neat trim line for my mustache on the upper lip and this was where the trimmer completely failed! I took out the guide comb and tried to get a clean line for the mustache and the trimmer couldn&#x27;t cut any hair. Then I tried to get a stubble trim on my neck and again, it couldn&#x27;t cut at all.   Needless to say, the trimmer is in the box and on it&#x27;s way back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just awsome works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Not the closest trim but close enough (not as close as traditional clippers). The vacuum makes up for it, but I need to use it on Turbo to collect most of the clippings.</li>
            <li> unfortunately i have to agree with a couple of the criticisms in some of the reviews here. yes, the comb is poorly designed. i haven&#x27;t had any problems with nicks and cuts, but it does make it very difficult to reach under the nose when trimming your mustache. my primary complaint however is that w/o the comb it doesn&#x27;t trim as closely as the previous model. don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re going for the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. think more of a 48-hour shadow! other than that, the vacuum does a good job of sucking in trimmings and the blue light looks cool. 3-stars.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. When battery is over, you can just plug it in and continue using it. Vacuum is powerful but some hair pieces still go around but it&#x27;s way better than before :)</li>
            <li> This product has some serious design flaws that prevent if from providing an even trim on any setting other than stubble.      First, the guard that sets the trim length is varying distances from the trimmer so, depending on the angle that the trimmer contacts your skin, the trim length changes.  This, alone, makes it crazy hard to get an even trim.    Second, there is a 3-4 mm gap in the guard over the trimmer.  This allows the skin at that point to be pushed closer to the trimmer depending on how hard it is being pushed into the skin.  The impact of this effect is compounded when the trimmer is on uneven surfaces, like a shin.      So, between these two flaws, I am yet to get an even shave.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.</li>
            <li> After more than 10 years using a Braun Exact 6 Universal, I was in the need of a new beard trimmer because Braun discontinued the supply of spare parts(battery and blades) for this model. The search led me to the Philips Norelco QT4070. A pretty good presentation of it&#x60;s qualities brought me to buy it and the great expectations I had vanished just by the very first use. The ergonomics of the comb and the hand holding result in a relatively uncomfortable feeling that ends with unequal beard lengths particularly the lower parts. The cut is not smooth giving the sensation that the blade is not as sharp as it should be. In addition, the mustache trimming is also uncomfortable since you can&#x60;t see the position of the blade.    Pros: the vacuum and the the screen indicators of battery level and cut length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a beard trimming set I bought 2 years ago for $15 with pretty great results. But I thought it would be time to upgrade. So when I saw this product mentioned in GQ of all places, I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never mind that this is one of, if not the most, expensive beard trimmers on the market. You know that when you buy it. My problem with this trimmer, as many people have mentioned, is that it leaves a very uneven shave. I used it on both the 1mm and 0mm (removing the guard completely) settings. Both left shaved divots on my face, barely trimming the rest. The end result looks pretty much like I used a cheese grater and I had to go ahead and shave everything off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about this purchase, do not, DO NOT, but it.</li>
            <li> The vacuum design for this model makes it fun to shave.  Fun in that there is no mess to clean up in and around the sink, other than emptying the stubble compartment when finished trimming.  The trim is even and uniform across my entire face, and the LED readout which indicates the length of the hairs makes it easy to taper the length from facial hair to sideburns in increments from 1mm up to whatever length you like.  Also nice is the LED readout indicating how much battery life remains, though the battery does recharge rapidly in the event that it does die.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Does exactly what it is supposed to do in an efficient, quiet and clean manner.  However, it is missing one key feature - a very close blade to trim the edges and make them perfect.  It&#x27;s a little pricy to be missing such an important feature.  That said, I love it.</li>
            <li> 2 power setting, multiple shave levels and no mess.  Bingo, much easier than close shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> It works well. It takes a few passes on my beard to get it even but it eventually does the job. I like the suction feature that collects the hair, it&#x27;s a nice touch and makes cleanup easier. I&#x27;d recommend it.  Edit: June 10, 2015: The door for the hair accumulation compartment no longer functions. The little notches that keep it closed are cheap plastic and because it fills with hair so quickly, you have to use the door all the time. One of these cheap pieces of plastic broke off and now the door won&#x27;t close... well nuts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer, the vacuum feature is superb. It doesn&#x27;t get down as close as I had thought it would, and you have to press down really hard to get it to trim out lines when trimming to stubble, not a huge deal. I can deal with some redness and scrapping, who cares, it works.</li>
            <li> There is no bag to transportation and no equipment for definition. It is a good equipment, but is not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> i bought this product about a year ago and its still like new. by far the best beard trimmer i have ever owned would buy this its well worth the money</li>
            <li> Works great!  Great customer service - I accidentally dropped this and the clip broke on the part that holds the clippings.  Phillips customer service was easy to deal with and immediately sent me a whole new unit!</li>
            <li> I like the dial-up trimmer guard and the razor is easy to use and clean. Do not like the fact once the Lithium battery dies the razor must be disposed of or used by wall outlet. Trimming takes a little practice but it does an overall good job. Vacuum not perfect but helps clean up the mess.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my nephew who seemed to really like all the great features on it, especially the vacuum!</li>
            <li> I received this shipping in 2 day and is a very fair deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not that much worth for this price but good to prefer becaz of  lot many options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once charged its lasting for long time.</li>
            <li> Our son loved the vacuum feature on this beard trimmer.  He said it will help prevent clogs in the drain.  He hadn&#x27;t realized how dull is old was</li>
            <li> I have used a slightly different model which was discontinued and replace by this one.  I was very please by the changes that were made.  This one is much more efficient and easier to set.  I use it for total hair cuts (my hair is very short) and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same beard trimmer for over 8 years. It was a hard switch for me, but I am very glad I chose this trimmer. It is significantly larger than my old trimmer but a great fit in my hands and works really well. The cut is even and consistent. Please note it does not increase in .5mm increments, which is fine because the 1mm setting is the perfect length for a groomed stubble look. All is all i&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this one because of all the listed features, the other reviews made it seem like a nice trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;1. Battery life, dies every 4 minutes or less when you use the vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;2. Charge cable doesn&#x27;t stay in charge port, keeps slipping out.&lt;br /&gt;3. The design of the trimmer and attachments prevent you from getting to the hair on the upper life unless you take off the attachments, making it impossible to have your mustache/upper lip the same length as the rest of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;4. The display can&#x27;t keep track of the height of the attachment, every time you click up to a higher setting from 0, the display will flash the next size from the number on the display, then go back to the original size. Display will show 1mm when you&#x27;re at 5mm, when you go to 6mm it&#x27;ll flash 2mm and then go back to 1mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these issues came up after the return window closed...I wasted my money, don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> The whole item is plastic except the blade and motor. There is a 2 1/2 years warranty. Now I have used this item and it performs GREAT! One feature is it has a suction while trimming your face. All the hair goes into a chamber located on the front. Once it is off, open the hair filled chamber, tap opposite side and into trash can. Norelco Beard Trimmer is a quality product! I even took the hair guard off and shaved my entire beard down to bare skin! No hair stubble and it was as smooth as if I used a straight razor. This is a really a quality product!</li>
            <li> Digs into the scalp and the digital setting for the blade is always wrong. Quality is questionable as i have had it only for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The previous version of this vacuum trimmer seemed to work better for me.  This one still leaves a ton of hairs falling all over the sink and floor.  Still a lot cleaner than a regular trimmer.</li>
            <li> Too bulky to be useful, cannot do actual detail trimming. I wish i had stuck with something smaller and cheaper for that matter that would do a better job.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, works great. It came with the contour comb. However after about one year&#x27;s use, one day all of sudden the battery just broke down and couldn&#x27;t hold any charge any more. Now I can only use it with plugged in to power.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have a lot of potential but then it stopped working all together. I bought a $20 panasonic one as well that works wonders!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my numerous previous trimmers that the battery dies on (the batteries are not replaceable).  It&#x27;s has worked great until...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 months of use, the little plastic clip that holds the vacuum door closed snapped off.  No the thing shoots hair all over.  I called Phillips, and they were VERY pleasant to work with. I provided the model and serial #, and she said they would ship me a replacement 405 right away....  But I have a 4070.  She said the 4050 is an upgraded version (obviously she has not compared the two) and if I was dissatisfied with it, then to call back and they would address it then.  When I asked why I could not get the 4070, she said they didn&#x27;t have any of them.</li>
            <li> does a great job.  no mess with the vacuum.  i only wish it were a bit more quiet.  other than that, it is easy to use and keeps it charge for a long time</li>
            <li> The trimmer definitely works as I expected.  It does a good job just like my Phillips Norelco shavers have always done.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer....the vacuum system works well  and the best part is the way the length setting is able to be locked and it doesn&#x27;t move again until you change it.  Highly recommend this Norelco!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer for my husband.  He already had a trimmer but his was on its last leg.  I saw this one had great reviews so I made the purchase.  The one that we received was black.  I wish there had been an option for choosing the color you wanted but they all work the same I guess.  There are several settings on this trimmer.  There are up to eighteen different lengths to choose from and there is a turbo button as well.  This one has a vacuum to suck up the hair and keep it out of the sink, however, it does not work perfectly.  There is still hair in the sink after my husband uses it but it is significantly less than usual.  It comes with a charger and you will need to charge it fully when you get it.  It doesn’t take very long though.  My husband really likes this trimmer.  It does a great job.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes it!</li>
            <li> Trims my bread great. Battery lasts pretty long. Doesn&#x27;t send hair flying everywhere and you can easily dump the hair into the sink. Overall a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works just fine. The vacuum picks up about 80% of the hairs from my beard, and the trim settings are multiple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is something to be desired, but portability is excellent!</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the Philips Norelco QT4070 so far. I&#x27;ve used it to trim my beard back to stub at least 15 times and so far I have had no problems. The vacuum suction is strong, although when I use it on &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; some bits of hair do flick out of the comb. I think that that&#x27;s unavoidable. However, the vast vast majority of the hairs get sucked in...which means no mess! I just empty the vacuum into the garbage when I&#x27;m done. I have only tried the first comb, the one provided on the machine (there is another, alternate comb in the box), but it works well enough. I enjoy the electronic display too (cool blue LED lighting) and I find the adjustment system (to adjust the length of the beard) easy to use. I also appreciate the battery indicator light, which lets me know when the battery is draining away. The battery seems, to me, to have a normal lifespan between charges. I&#x27;d say 6-7 hours...or, in other words, I can use the trimmer on my beard once a day for 6-7 days before I need to recharge it. It could probably go a little longer without the charge, but I like to be on the safe side. It doesn&#x27;t come with a case, but that&#x27;s a small detail. I highly recommend this purchase if you need a good trimmer. I&#x27;ll write back if I have any issues later on, but I have high hopes that nothing will happen. This seems like a very solidly-made trimmer.</li>
            <li> I think the product has been improved because the old reviews don&#x27;t really reflect the product anymore.  It comes with two combs, the stubble and contour following comb. Both feel sort of cheap, but they work pretty well. I liked the digital adjustment of this trimmer, It doesn&#x27;t change on me or become loose and adjust itself like some reviewers claim.  I have a coarse beard that does not grow too thick but can grow long (think Fu Manchu).  So I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer at least 1 to 2 times per week and have no complaints.  The copy says it catches about 90% of the shavings, I would say that is correct.  There is still a small mess to clean at the sink, but it may take about 15 seconds to clean up.  The compartment that holds the hair needs to be cleaned out pretty regularly.  But I clean it over the trashcan now, instead of sending all the hair down the sink, so that&#x27;s better for the plumbing. It doesn&#x27;t come with a case, which was not a big deal to me, but if you travel a lot with it, you&#x27;ll have to get something. All in all, I was looking for a trimmer that was powerful enough to cut my coarse facial hair and that would be easy to clean.  This trimmer fit the bill nicely.  If it breaks, I&#x27;ll probably buy another.</li>
            <li> Vacuum saves a lot of cleanup, but not all. Altogether a great trimmer and a great idea. I&#x27;ve been using mine for about a year and it&#x27;s still working great</li>
            <li> The Trimmer is loud. It is not so easy to adjust the correct Hair size.</li>
            <li> Works very well on shaving your genitals sucks up all those little hairs.</li>
            <li> This was my second shaver. It replaced a Braun which had a much better build quality (only reason I replaced the Braun was battery life had dropped after 3 years). This one felt lower in quality. Battery life new was flaky, the head is too bulky (due to the vacuum feature) and can&#x27;t trim evenly under the nose and around the ears. In the end, this got replaced by a Panasonic trimmer which is much higher quality (on par if not better than the Braun).</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer falls into the &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; category for me... it&#x27;s not terrible but it also doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s much hyped expectations either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;The digital guides make it much easier to know what length you&#x27;re about to trim to and keeps you from having to keep up with multiple beard guides (which I always lose)&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature, while somewhat gimmicky, does clean up a fair bit of the trimmed hair... but more on that in the cons below.&lt;br /&gt;Charge life is very lengthy and I didn&#x27;t find myself bringing the charger onto trips with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The beard comb provided had a very bad tendency to &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; on curved areas or looser areas of skin, like under the jaw line. In the worse cases this snag caused the beard guide to be shoved into a lower setting and giving me a &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature isn&#x27;t perfect and still leaves quite a bit of hair in/around the sink when trimming (That being said, when I trim my beard I do typically trim a fair amount off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It has been brought to my attention that there is a better beard comb being provided to some people that resolves the snagging problem mentioned above, I did not receive this and therefore have to base my review on what I received.</li>
            <li> this is more for hair cuts than beard trimmers unfortunately</li>
            <li> Read the instructions.  works great.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned the 7100 version of this trimmer, and loved it.  This new design trims just as well, and work a lot better in the tight spaces around my upper lip/nose.  The vacuum seems to be a bit more powerful too.  I haven&#x27;t quite gotten use to the digital display yet, as the 7100 didn&#x27;t have it, but I am sure i will be glad to know the amount of charge I have when it gets close to dying on me.  Though with a 1 hour charge that won&#x27;t be nearly as big an issue as it was for the 7100, and it&#x27;s 8 hour charge time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am loving it!</li>
            <li> My model 980 battery died last year after a little over 6 years of use.  After reading the reviews here, I was hesitant to buy the 4070, and continued using my old one with a cord for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my wife bought me a new one for Christmas last year, and in my opinion, it is better in every way but one than the 980.  The flip-open vacuum compartment is not nearly as easy to use as the removable one on the 980, but other than that, ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some people have mentioned, mine came with both combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subjectively, the vacuum catches a little more hair than my old one, though still not all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest improvement for me is the display.  My 980 had a tiny window with the number in it, and I simply could not read it without my reading glasses.  The new 3/4\\&quot; tall illuminated number makes much more sense in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/12/13:  Still waiting for battery to need recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final update 6/17/13:  After almost six months using it twice a week, the charge light turned yellow today, so I plugged it in to recharge.  I changed my rating from four stars to five.</li>
            <li> This is a great device for all the family!  My son&#x27;s hair, my beard...we are even considering using this device on our little dog.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing, if you&#x27;re like me and were tired of cleaning up the mess after a trim, say hello to this gem. Also, the other reviews say you have to call and order the right trimming head, although they since have updated it and I got all of the correct parts and am completely happy. The shave is perfectly even at any set length and this thing is very easy to clean. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!  It works well and it is great that is vacuums the clippings.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new Norelco since my old one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more.  This one is fancy, digital, etc but the issue is it tends to throw hairs out the top.  Quite high actually since sometime they have gotten in my eye.  I have gotten around this my never pointing the head of the shaver towards my eye.  Update: I have owned this now for about 8 months of casual use and it no longer holds a charge very long.  My old one held a charge for years before giving up the ghost.  Rating changed to one star as I now have to buy another one (of a different brand I assure you).  Update: I have owned this now for about 16 months and it no longer holds any charge.  My last one lasted 7 years before dying.  Please bring up your quality, off now to research a non-Philips brand to replace it.</li>
            <li> I like the adjustability of the shaver and it has both of the snap on guides, so earlier criticism is no longer justified.  Battery life has been good also</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. The trimmer that this one replaced was OK but this one does a fare superior job of keeping my whiskers nicely trimmed.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleanly addresses my good looking beard!</li>
            <li> The door to the chamber which holds the trimmed hair is very poorly designed.  The latch is a flimsy piece of plastic that breaks very easily.  Just opening and closing the chamber will cause it to break.  It broke after moderate and careful use.  They sent me a replacement and that one broke as well after a short period of time.  It is just a cheap poor design destined to fail.  I have a rubber band on mine now to keep it closed.  I don&#x27;t see the point in further replacement as it will just fail again due to the poor design.  For this reason I will not purchase Norelco again and don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great! Been using this for at least a year with zero issues. The built-in vaccuum thing traps the bulk of stubble in the little chamber inside, vastly decreasing the sink-area mess.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Cuts smoothly and has numerous features.</li>
            <li> bought this for my boyfriend but even with the low mm it&#x27;s not low enough. he cut his mole with it, which I can understand happens, but I find the length not low enough for a sexy shadow, slightly scruffy but not lumberjack level. it does come in handy when he&#x27;s half-way to a beard and needs to &amp;#34;mow the lawn&amp;#34; before shaving it all off or before using another trimmer to get closer but not baby&#x27;s butt smooth. the vacuum is okay, I still have to dust a little but not nearly as much! so that&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Remember, if you&#x27;re replacing your T980 with this model. The different blades from the T980 (mustache trimmer head) fits perfectly on the QT4070. And most importantly, the length settings are different in the two models! (If you don&#x27;t know this, you&#x27;ll be cutting off a lot more than expected). Also, while it&#x27;s only cosmetic, the length adjuster knob on my QT4070 is red instead of the blue/black knob.&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;After a little over a year the door that holds the hair clippings busted. I knew this would possibly be an issue because of other reviews. But none the less, I&#x27;m still relatively happy with this purchase. Although I&#x27;m taking a star of because that was a selling feature on this product that no longer works correctly</li>
            <li> Works well. Time between need for recharge is longer than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my old Norelco selectable height trimmer (which lasted me for ten years). This one has the fixed and contour following combs, adjustable heights, speeds, a little vacuum to prevent much of the mess. I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it. Don&#x27;t expect the vacuum to catch all of your trimmings, because it won&#x27;t. It definitely catches the majority though, a worthwhile investment. Oh, and the charge lasts forever on this thing!!!! I use it a few times a week on my whole face and I&#x27;ll bet a single charge lasts me over a month. I think I&#x27;ve only plugged it in maybe three times since I&#x27;ve owned it... Must be 5 months now. Packaging was just like you buy one at the store, shipping was on time, product was undamaged on arrival! Good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this beard trimmer when the guard on my old Norelco broke (not sure the model number). I read the reviews on this one and loved the fact that it has a self contained vacuum to keep hair from going every where. I do love this beard trimmer, but I will note that the vacuum does not work nearly as well as I had hoped which is why I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars. I would say it catches 75% of the hair, but you still get 25% falling in your sink or where ever you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other cautions I read about the guard possibly cutting you could be true, but they include two different trimmer guards. The bigger one included can still shave very close and I see no way to get cut using that one.</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly.  Good price.  Product works great and the vacuum part surprisingly works really good.  Always happy with a Norelco product.</li>
            <li> After setting it to &amp;#34;3&amp;#34;, it trimmed by mustache short, and nearly obliterated my eyebrows.  Twice now,  Not sure what&#x27;s the deal is with this, but it is inconsistent garbage for anything but perfect stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return it, but ran out of time.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer, but as had happened to others, the plastic tabs that hold the little door shut for the beard trimmings broke, so the door doesn&#x27;t stay shut.  I have to make sure to hold the door shut while I&#x27;m using the trimmer which is not ideal.</li>
            <li> Good quality razor leaves a great finish and look. Would recommend this product to a friend and great price too.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good upgrade from my old unit.  On travel mode now....left charger at home for 12 days....probably only use once.</li>
            <li> The trim you get is nothing that you can&#x27;t get form other trimmers, but having the clippings vacuumed is priceless.  My wife appreciates it also.</li>
            <li> I have a HEAVY beard - I needed a trimmer that \\&quot;gets it done\\&quot;  This trimmer does the job,</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 weeks back and am not thrilled by its performance. I use it to have close trim for my hard beard and see trimming is not even in few places. But close enough most part of the beard. Vacuum feature is great but didn&#x27;t see any use of turbo mode except more noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product if it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco was slowly dying so purchasing a new beard trimmer became a necessity.  I purposely selected the top of the line model because I don&#x27;t expect to make this purchase very often.  I was slightly wary of some of the other reviews that suggested the trimming action needed some time to get used to, however I put that concern aside and bought the QT4070.  The first time I trimmed my beard I trimmed it so short in front that I could see skin!  I&#x27;ve had it now for about 6 weeks and I&#x27;m slowly getting used to the idiosynchrocies of this device.  It&#x27;s okay, but not great.</li>
            <li> Good value for not having to clean up clippings from the entire sink area. Ladies if your guy cleans up after himself, it takes a lot of time and is frustrating as we are extremely lazy, this saves it, this is a great gift. It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; up 100% of clippings but a good 90-95% (you&#x27;d need a shop-vac attached for the rest) - the remainder is just a splash of water and it&#x27;s gone. Cleaning the clippers themselves isn&#x27;t much more work than \\&quot;standard\\&quot; open clippers and the wad of clippings that it catches will surprise you. The charger/power cord is nice and small/light, not bulky at all (no big transformer hanging off the wall plug or a stiff cord), the cutter itself feels nice in the hand, although it must lie flat as there isn&#x27;t a vertical stand for it. Charge indicator is nice as is the travel (power) lock although I haven&#x27;t needed it yet. Digital trim length indicator is fine although length is also marked on the sides of the guard/slide.  Removing the guard gives access to the clippers directly.  The clippers won&#x27;t give you a 000 length (against the skin), it&#x27;s more of a 1/16\\&quot;, maybe 1/8\\&quot;. Overall it seems like a very good design (I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a month) works well, charge lasts quite long and re-charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this for Stubble or 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. You do that without a guide on. That it seems to work great. It is actually more like one day&#x27;s worth of hair not 5 o&#x27;clock shadow but it works. Vacuum works. No problem trimming near nose area. Battery lasts for at least 3-5 days. Cleaning is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you want to keep longer beard, then you have to put on the guide, that&#x27;s where it has a small issue. As some others have noted, it is really hard to trim near nose area with the guides on.</li>
            <li> It is new trimmer from Philips which is perfect for stubble lovers. I always like the Philips product for trimming. It act so fragile with your skin and the vacuum help you to avoid mass after trimming.</li>
            <li> The Qt44070 is just what I was looking for. Works as advertised. No more hacking with a razor. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old T980, which was starting to fall apart.  On paper, the two devices are very similar.  However the T980, sadly no longer available, had a rigid pivoting guide that completely surrounds the blades.  This cheaper design has a fixed head that has flexible, pointy tines that approach the blades from either side but leave a large gap over the blades themselves and the vacuum entrance.  The result is very uneven cutting length because the tines flex and curved areas of the face can easily enter the gap and make direct contact with the blades.  It seems like there aren&#x27;t a lot of good dedicated beard trimmer options available right now, but I would avoid this one if possible.  Hopefully Norelco will redesign this flawed unit soon.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s for it serves it purpose, I wish it could give a closer trim. But the battery life is amazing only had to charge it once in a while..&lt;br /&gt;worth the money, recommend it !!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought they must be wrong, after all this is the coolest looking, and most expensive, beard trimmer on Amazon. How bad could it be? These people just don&#x27;t know how to use it properly. It came today and almost immediately after beginning to use it my upper lip was bleeding. I kept going, much more slowly but still found it difficult to get an even shave around my jaw and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get right under your nose. I&#x27;d recommend skipping this one. Mine is going back tomorrow.</li>
            <li> The main draw for this product is the vacuum system that captures hairs for \\&quot;mess free trimming.\\&quot; In truth, it&#x27;s a highly deceptive product that leaves a giant mess in the sink, cuts very unevenly and has an almost unusable mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The text on the box says it \\&quot;captures hair for no mess in the sink.\\&quot;  This is blatantly false.  At best, there is SLIGHTLY less hair in the sink compared to a typical beard trimmer or hair clipper.  That leaves the need to clean the sink and brush all the hair from the collection chamber which seems to have a static charge to make this task as annoying as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any chosen length this trimmer is very uneven and produces a patchy messy beard.  Not the look I was after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mustache trimmer is ergonomically terrible, cuts unevenly and required me to actually use another trimmer while trying this awful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing it has a 30 day guarantee, although you will be returning it the next day.  It&#x27;s that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money.  Returned.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box the first thing I noticed is that the product itself is actually just black and white but the image makes it seem like it has a teal tint, if that matters to you. It recharges way quicker than my last shaver which was a braun 3 series. One thing I had to get used to was the size of the trimmer head is not as wide as the head of the whole body so you have to play around with it until you figure out where it starts and stop trimming. The overall mechanism works great and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with how well the vaccum works. Cleaning it doesn&#x27;t take long. Overall very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> ### UPDATED ### I purchased this in October 2013, so I have had it for over two years now.  I use the trimmer twice a week and just last week it seemed to have slowed down.  However, the problem was with the blade as it had gotten a bit sticky.  I tried to use some trimmer oil on it and that was a mistake, as it created more drag on the blades.  So I soaked just the blade in water-downed dish soap (Dawn), scrubbed it with a toothbrush and now the trimmer works like new.  When it does fail, I would purchase this again.  ### UPDATED ### &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; I love the improvements in this model.  I keep my beard short, but not stubble length.  I use their newer comb and have had no problems with it as other reviewers have had.  I actually prefer it to the springy comb that others like.  My only complaint is for trimming my mustache, I prefer the narrow trimmer attachment that came with the older model (T980?).  Since I still have that attachment, I tried it on the 4070 and it works perfectly.  So that problem solved for me. If they provided the narrow trimmer attachment, I would have given this a five star rating.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our son and he said it works just great.  It trims his beard perfectly.  The vacuum feature is an added bonus.  It catches all the hair so the sink isn&#x27;t a mess!</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift that was requested specifically because of its good qualities and reliability.  They are very happy with it and intend to use it for many years.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s another case of poor design. The vacuum feature catches maybe half of the clippings, the rest need to be cleaned up the usual way. So why bother having to clean out a small hair collection chamber that doesn&#x27;t work anyhow?  Worse than this, I found the same areas of my face have to be gone over, and over before the clipper actually cuts the beard hair. Maybe if you have very fine, downy whiskers (who does?) this thing will cut. Also, I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the trimming comb attachments. Maybe the cord/cordless rechargeable feature works, but I wasn&#x27;t planning on finding out. And, not really material, but the packaging? Like a Chinese puzzle to open up.  The first, and best trimmer I ever owned was a Panasonic which they ended up discontinuing -  I don&#x27;t understand why something that works can&#x27;t be left alone. The search for a good beard trimmer goes on!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for keeping a close cropped afternoon shadow.</li>
            <li> Every man should own one of these I can not say enough great things about this. You can get the stubble look if you like or the length that pleases you. The teeth barely if ever catch on your skin and get caught, very easy to clean. You seriously should buy this over any other trimmer.</li>
            <li> really liked it, unfortunately after having it for only 7 months the battery is only good for a couple minutes. on the upside, when it quits, i can plug in the charger and keep going.  maybe it was just a bad one, owned a previous model that lasted 3 or 4yrs    update: and now i&#x27;ve managed to break the clip on the lil clear door, so you have to hold it closed for the vacuum to work</li>
            <li> Bad Bad Bad Bad!! don&#x27;t ever buy it!! i throw it in the Trash!&lt;br /&gt;1st :Uneven trim !!!&lt;br /&gt;2nd  Noisy!!!  i bought a 15$ trimmer and its not noisy! this one is 50$&lt;br /&gt;3rd : the led screen show wrong length!!&lt;br /&gt;4th : the battery not as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;5th : its not water resistent</li>
            <li> Love this. It trims my beard perfectly and charges up quickly. Very easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Junk - broke only after a few months.</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I&#x27;ve gone through countless shavers/trimmers. This one is great. The vacuum function isn&#x27;t that great, but it comes with two shaver heads, once that pivots, and one that gives you more control. Great for the stubble look or for maintaining a short beard. I think this maxes out at 20mm, so obviously not for massive beards.</li>
            <li> Four stars because overall it strikes the best balance between effectiveness and scratchiness.  The shave, even with the comb removed (thus the closest shave possible) is really not 5 o&#x27;clock shadow level - it&#x27;s more like 24-hours after a razor shave. However, it&#x27;s less painful on sensitive skin than other ones I&#x27;ve used that get a closer shave, so maybe that&#x27;s just the tradeoff.  Because of the width of the head and the plastic bits around the edges of the blade, it&#x27;s difficult to catch the hairs at the edges and on the contoured parts of the neck. Nonetheless it overall leaves less unevenness than other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.  The vacuuming is good but not perfect - there will still be some hair on and around the sink.</li>
            <li> Did an ok job while it worked. Mine broke after 4months of light use.</li>
            <li> Love it! Been using it for several months now and it works great. Its has a clear number display that lights up showing the head length.</li>
            <li> Was defective, battery didnt hold a charge</li>
            <li> Just as listed and timely sent , nice!</li>
            <li> I have had a Norelco T7500 for years.  It is, in my mind, the perfect trimmer, but after many years of use it is starting to wear out.  So, I bought the Qt4070 as a replacement.  It&#x27;s like Norelco forgot how to make trimmers.  I went from the best trimmer (T7500), to the worst trimmer (Qt4070).  With the 4070 I cannot get at consistent beard length due to the poor comb design.  As others have said, the tines on the comb are too flexible, thus the length of the cut depends on how hard you push the trimmer.  On my first use, I ended up with a small bald spot on the tip if my chin because of this flex.  So, the trimmer is going back...</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand how this trimmer has so many positive reviews... the battery holds a decent charge and the vacuum function somewhat works (not the problem). The trimming experience and the attachments that came with this product are terrible. Without turbo mode turned on the trimmer is useless... it is also very loud. Despite having a ton of length adjustments I still cannot get the desired length I once had with my old trimmer.... the attachment guards I still don&#x27;t understand... one is a rubberized comb that bends easily and the other a hard plastic guard and both are very inconsistent. I cannot get an even trim with either! When not using the guards you cannot get a good straight edge because plastic covers the blades so you cannot see your lines. I bought this trimmer over a year ago and have only used it several times and it is so bad I had to write a review about it a year later. It has to work for some folks out there but this trimmer is garbage to me.</li>
            <li> I am unable to get an even trim with this product, because there is an open gap in the front where the blades are fully exposed.  As a result, the trimmer either trims to a very close stubble length, or does not trim enough, depending on how you angle the trimmer.  This is a huge problem.  For over $50 I would expect it to give a perfect, uniform trim.  Because of this problem, I contacted customer support and was told that a contour following comb(similar to the QT4050), which would eliminate the issues I am having.  They offered to ship this comb free of charge.  Unfortunately, I keep receiving emails stating that the comb is on backorder, and the shipping date keeps getting delayed further.  It is now past the 45 day money back guarantee, and after speaking to customer service again, I was told that they no longer make this part and cannot give me an estimate of when I can expect to receive it.  I would love to give the product more stars, but without a contour following comb it is worthless. I just lost $50.  Also, according to the description page, the product was supposed to come with a pouch.  It did not.  Philips/Norelco customer service was very helpful.  They sent me a pouch free of charge.  I have no idea why Philips/Norelco would sell their trimmer without necessary / advertised parts.  If this is how they do business, I will not be purchasing anything else from them.  It would also be nice if the product had a stand.  Laying the trimmer on its side causes messy trimmings to fall out, and because of its rounded bottom it is impossible to stand upright.</li>
            <li> According to Amazon this product should have come with a contour following comb.  It did not.  Norelco on 1/3/2012 said they would ship this part within 7 to 10 days.  As of 2/6/2012 they say this part is back ordered and have no estimate when the part will be available.  Received part mid February. Increased score to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> good product overall , the little vacuum cleaner is a bonus and works for me</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older version of this same trimmer because the old one wasn&#x27;t holding a charge. And now I have this new one and have used it maybe three or four times and, already, IT&#x27;S NOT HOLDING A CHARGE. I mean, come on, I use this a couple of times to trim my beard, which takes maybe all of thirty seconds each time, and it needs to be charged again. Seriously? Use it for maybe one, two minutes (if I&#x27;m being generous) and it&#x27;s out of charge? So disappointed in you, Norelco.</li>
            <li> like that the collection part is now hinged so easy to open. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is as you have it recharging it like to roll around, would be nice to have a flat surface on the back so it will not roll of a cradle would be nice. Oh also my old one use to flash orange when it needed to be charged this one does not change color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco trimmer for years, but the old one had an irreparable fault. This is a replacement purchased by a (formerly) loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement is solid and works as advertised, but the lock mode has -- three times -- caused me to lose all power to the shaver. I&#x27;ll put it into my bag or a drawer in lock mode; take it out a few days later; and the shaver is entirely discharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my last trip I kept it in non-lock mode -- so I thought -- but when I tried to use it at my destination I found it completely discharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home it works just fine... I can&#x27;t quite figure out what the problem is, but I&#x27;ve lost patience with this device.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my husband and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Great trimmers.  It trims to 1 mm and is very powerful when fully charged. It has a digital display on the handle so you can read what setting the trimmers are set to &amp; the battery charge left.</li>
            <li> Works as intended.  No issues for me.  Zero danger of scratching or pinching.  It is not so easy to get into small spaces like under your nose.  The vacuum feature is not perfect at gathering 100% of trimmings but is a big help and worth using.  Battery lasts a long time.  Product met my expectations and I intend to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> So far so great! I wasn&#x27;t sure I could replace my dead Norelco T960 since it was the best beard trimmer I have used (and I have used several over the years). I fussed about this one at first, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like this\\&quot;, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like that\\&quot;, \\&quot;it&#x27;s not the same as my other one\\&quot; but this has turned out to be a very good trimmer and I am happy with the purchase. It comes with two comb guides but I really only used the contour one. It trims my goatee very evenly and cleans up nice. I especially like the vacuum on this trimmer. It catches most of the hair where before I had to clean not only the sink but the counter top where the trimmed beard flew everywhere. Now I have little in the sink and most is in the trimmer for easy disposal in the trashcan. Some reviews have complained about the vacuum compartment door breaking off but it seems pretty sturdy, not gorilla proof sturdy, but sturdy. Just like everything you buy, if you take care of it, it will last. Time will tell if this is a true replacement for myT960 but so far I am more than satisfied. I haven&#x27;t needed to use the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; on it yet but it sounds cool when you hit the button!</li>
            <li> The door that keeps in the waste was broken in the first couple of weeks, and the product became unusable thereafter. Lower price, less fancy products are way more practical.</li>
            <li> Does not do a good job of keeping the whiskers vacuumed. It still falls all over the sink. Good razor though.</li>
            <li> This product is great for general hair/beard trimming. It&#x27;s not as good on making edges and trimming place like under the nose. The hair collection chamber gets full really fast.</li>
            <li> I am loving this trimmer so far. Mine came with both of the comb attachments, so no issues there, and everything else works as expected. I love the vacuum bit, makes trimming significantly less messy.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great, and sucks up most of the hair when you put it in turbo mode.  It can&#x27;t pickup everything, but you can&#x27;t honestly expect that.  It does a pretty good job otherwise, though.  The best part, is that I was able to use the precision trimming blade from my old Norelco trimmer that died.</li>
            <li> Love the digital display for cutting length. Much easier to remember 10 than &#x27;was it up one notch or two?&#x27; The vacuuming of excess whiskers is just a bell and whistle ... not really necessary. I guess it does make cleanup a bit easier. .... I mean there will still be hair everywhere scattered about after use, just slightly less of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been quite happy with this purchase thus far. In the past I&#x27;ve opted for trimmers that used attachments for different lengths with one exception, and that&#x27;s where the bias against the notch trimmers comes from. It&#x27;s nice having the trimmer altogether in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that it is built well enough to last years of periods with and without beards and/or stubble.</li>
            <li> This Beard Trimmer is absolute junk. I&#x27;ve only used it about six times and the battery is totally gone. And it won&#x27;t work from the wall plug. I&#x27;m done with Norelco products.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this trimmer.  he says the battery has a very long life, and the trimmer does a great job of trimming.  the adjustable guide &amp;#34;works great&amp;#34; and the canister &amp;#34;collects 80-90% of the hair&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;and i&#x27;m happy because all that hair doesn&#x27;t end up on the sink anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer. The only thing I would want in a future model is a stronger vacuum. This one picks up a lot of the hair but I am still having a good amount fly everywhere. With that said I think it is a great trimmer for the price, don&#x27;t let other comments make you think otherwise. I had some concerns when I read some reviews but I just think they&#x27;re either misusing the product or are just being super harsh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but figured this one warranted one (pun intended, as you&#x27;ll see later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this unit close to two years ago, despite what any negative reviews said. I&#x27;ve never used the comb, only the contour following piece, so I can&#x27;t comment on the sharp edges or anything. I have never had any problems with the unit, and it has functioned very well. I use it probably 2-3 times per week to keep my beard in check, and with that the battery usually lasts a month or more. The vacuum catches the vast majority of trimmings, but be sure to rinse your face well afterwards. There have been days I trimmed before heading into work, and I&#x27;d notice tiny clippings all over the front of my shirt (the stuff that was stuck in my beard). Only other thing I&#x27;d note is that if you use it for trimming chest hair, the compartment fills up pretty quickly and you&#x27;ll need to empty a few times. Granted, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s billed as a beard trimmer and not a body trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a year and a half, I noticed the door on the front of the unit wasn&#x27;t holding shut very well and as a result the suction power was suffering. There&#x27;s a tiny plastic tab on the inside of the door that secures it shut, and that had begun to crack. I dealt with it for a month or two, just holding the door shut... and debated on taping it shut or buying a new one. However, I got in touch with Philips customer support first. After a brief 5 minute online chat they shipped out a replacement unit to me! Was planning on this being a 4 star review, but the customer service bumped it up that next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good trimmer to maintain your scruff, go with this one.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight shaver for light-duty trims.  The variable trim lengths are super easy to adjust and to read.  There are really no surprises with this device.  The vacuum actually works really well in it, and it is very easy to clean.  My only gripe with it is that it is very loud, when trimming your face near your ears.</li>
            <li> It works great, assuming you move slowly and work the same area several times. I use it everywhere, and this trimmer has been very versatile with a good battery life. The clip that holds the hair trap door broke so I have to keep my fingers on it, otherwise the hair just flies out.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this trimmer. However, it is my first one so I have no prior trimmers to compare it to. I don&#x27;t have any regrets, though.</li>
            <li> i have been using this item and so good, if you want to cut you hear this item is so good</li>
            <li> 4 years ago I bought an older version of this as my first amazon prime purchase. So far this one is even better. Slimmer, stronger, better quality. Great trimmer</li>
            <li> this is my second one. i left the first one at a hotel. After a year or so, the latch on the door broke, but that was the only issue. It does a great job keeping the sink clean and provides a precise trim.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with some trepidation because of several of the previous reviews. However, when the trimmer arrived I had absolutely no issues with it. It came with both heads (beard and stubble). The other main complaint I saw in reviews remarked upon the low quality of the stubble trimmer as well as the harshness of the trimmer. Personally, I have never had a more comfortable trimmer, with or without the heads. The last time I used this trimmer, I actually left off the heads for a closer trim and it was fine. As for the stubble trimmer, you do have to be a little careful of the angle, but it&#x27;s not very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for beards but just so so for mustaches.</li>
            <li> It seems like a novel and great idea; the vacuum suction picking up your stubble, a rotating gear to adjust height, a display that shows battery life (what?!).  However, it falls short of being a wonderful replacement for my cheapo Remington target pickup of yesteryear (whose own battery has been failing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 2-3mm stubble trimming I think this product works fine for most parts of your face.  It fails at the neckline and moustache areas as you cannot get close enough to the nose to get all of the hairs.  The hinge on the vacuum trap also fails quickly; note that I am not one to be manhandling my equipment, especially after learning that others had this same failure, I was determined to not let mine break.  Well, it broke.  The vacuum itself does an ok job but gets clogged easily and doesn&#x27;t quite capture everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing the guard, the trimmer is pretty useless for getting a close balding shave of the head.  My old Remington does much better with it&#x27;s guard set on the shortest setting.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is the case with this trimmer as it seems to shave stubble fine on the cheeks and chin yet falls short (hah!) on the head.  The vacuum is also not powerful enough to keep clumps of head stubble from falling everywhere, like a tiny stubbleball they will fall upon shoulders or ears and explode into tiny clusters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it holds a good charge and does an adequate job on the face.  The lack of decent head shave and the hinge breaking easily makes me leave it at 3 stars.  For the price I would expect it to do a much better job than the $20 Target pickup from years past.</li>
            <li> This one is really pretty good.  I don&#x27;t really notice the vacuum function until I look down, and there is very little hair in the sink.  It will trim tiny beards as well as very thick ones.  Trust me, I&#x27;ve done both.</li>
            <li> Scalps patches of hair uneven when using it below 5mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic guard flexes too easily so no matter what height you have it set to, it will always vary while cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using this for stubble which is 1mm so it cuts even now but you still need to be careful on the jawbone because it will still scalp the area.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer, but the vacuum function does leave a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. Works well at cutting my beard and is adjustable in 1 mm increments. It holds it&#x27;s charge for a very long time and sucks up the trimmings pretty well as long as you remember to empty the cuttings chamber every couple of days. Norelco even but in a second more powerful setting, but the standard power level works just fine for me. It even looks cool and the quality build is top notch!</li>
            <li> So, its now two years later. The trimmer battery is dead and I can&#x27;t find a replacement battery here on Amazon nor does it appear that replacement was a design consideration to start with. The door of the trimmings chamber has long since lost its latch (though it was repaired numerous times. All in all - as I an experienced user I say its official - this trimmer is a piece of crap that fails to fulfill its advertised promises of a measured length trim, maybe catching 50% of the cut beard, and apparently the trimmer is done when the battery is dead since the company provides no easy method of battery replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did a lot of research before I purchased this beard trimmer. What can I say I make a living researching things.  I always read the 1 star reviews first and look at the percentages of 1 star reviews. I have had the trimmer for about a month and used maybe five times. This trimmer seemed to be the best reviewed - with the least serious complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery - The first charge for three hours and until the lights went out as instructed - had a run time of about five minutes before it was dead. I charged it again until the light went out and it that charged lasted through three ten minute trimmings and still had two bars. The battery now retains a full charge as described in the literature and reviews. Not charging the first time - gave me some trepidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting - The shearing of the clipper even on regular speed is quite adequate for my beard. I haven&#x27;t used the turbo to trim with because for my beard it isn&#x27;t necessary. If the sound is an indication I could trim my hedge with it. The good news is the trimmer has yet to pull my beard - something other brands seems not to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting guide/gauge - this part of beard trimmer designs seems to be universally lacking in all brands from my research. This trimmer adjusts well mechanically - but actually guiding and picking up the beard to cut it doesn&#x27;t function at all- probably narrower gaps between the trim guide comb teeth. My beard lays close to my face and I had to have at least two trims before I managed to get all the longer hairs caught and cut - so don&#x27;t do what the ad says and throw away your scissors - you&#x27;ll need them for a perfect trims. I did my first trim at 12 mm and it was the one with the most missed hairs - and a lot of post-trim scissor work. The second I did at 10 mm and that was more accurate in both length and catching errant hairs. My last trim was at 7 mm and that was the best yet. Caught nearly all of the beard. I think this was a result of both my personal beard anatomy, my getting used to the light motion required to cut evenly and I think the trimmer guide/gauge is probably is more accurately functional for shorter settings. In my beard&#x27;s case I have to go repeatedly in the opposite direction of the beard lay (and a lot of other angles) to get uniform cutting to the gauged length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer Vacuum - Well... to me this is more of an advertising gimmick than it is an engineering/design success. My beard is light colored and I trimmed it last time with a dark tee shirt on. My estimate that less 50% of my trimmings made it into the trimmings vacuum receiving chamber - the rest was very plainly all over my dark shirt. Oh, and I suggest you wear glasses - I even got beard trimming thrown up in my eyes on occasions. I think the vacuum is great idea, but it will need a better intake design and far more suction before it is really functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary - I only give the trimmer a three star because its performance is a long way from being what is advertised and or perfect. That said, and based on reading hundreds of reviews on other brands of similar trimmers - this may be the best beard trimmer (at least for some beards) on the market today. I&#x27;m not sure that is good enough to please a lot of people. I will be keeping the trimmer - and my scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Had and used the trimmerfor three months now. I am exceptionally frusturated with the trimmers inability to lift the beard to make accurate cutting. No matter how many times and directions I go over my beard - there are far too many un-cut hairs. Consequently, my beard varies from 8mm - the cut setting - to 20 to 30 mm. because the horribly designed comb simply does not function. My beard trimming now consist of ten minutes of mowing the beard with the trimmer from every conceivable direction - and then another 10 minutes using my comb and scissors to cut all of the beard to the same length. Bottom-line is this product is not market ready, nor does it perform as advertised. I have down graded my original review to two stars and that is generous.</li>
            <li> the button broke and then the door of the hair bin broke within 1 week of purchase. it dies easily for some reason. the beard comb guide is terrible. not recommended for coarse hair. hard to clean also. can&#x27;t use water to clean</li>
            <li> Does not trim as closely as my old trimmer. Great length if you&#x27;re young and in college. Not quite close enough for a young professional who needs to look clean cut every day. Still a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works, but vacuum is gimicky doesnt catch all the hair, but cleanup amount is less.</li>
            <li> Its good. But i think I&#x27;ve had better. I don&#x27;t like the way you have to move it upwards. Its a bit painful and its result is also not that sharp.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Does all it promises. The only problem with it is the location of the cutting blade. It&#x27;s not at the edge of the shaver, so when trimming without the spacer on, such as trimming my mustache, it takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model that lasted over 4 years - it&#x27;s still running but some of the parts broke off (10/2014).  This one quit holding a charge just after the warranty expired.  It worked pretty well but the short warranty period isn&#x27;t too great.</li>
            <li> Does the trick! I managed to shaved off my viking beard. Those days are now over.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! He trims his beard in 5 min! Love it!</li>
            <li> This works great for head and beard trimming.  Ive been using the same one for over 2 years.  Everything about it is great except:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the vacuum compartment door came loose after a few months and would no longe lock in place, and lets out shavings (not a deal breaker, just empty frequently or use tape to hold on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)sometimes the mm display doesnt match up to the setting - always start from the lowest setting and be sure the display matches for each click (or you will wind up with a shorter cut than you planned for!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li> i purchased many trimmers, nothing like this..  purchased ones double and triple the price , you will not find any thing better than this!!!&lt;br /&gt;  i saw a youtube video by alphaM about this product and OMG that guy is always on the money. you should check out his vids if you are a dude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  i had it for a year or more and works , functions excellent. i broke the door clip that holds the trimmed left over hair but that&#x27;s because i keep banging the trimmer on the sink for over a year haha. don&#x27;t do that just use the brush provided with it to clean it. and although i broke the plastic part that holds the door close it still keeps the door close haha this product is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if you are looking for a great beard trimmer this is it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s haha i know aphaM also recommended this for trimming other areas of the body like down there.. ya know!! down there!! mmm just don&#x27;t do it man!! don&#x27;t do it haha it will cut you. it says beard and stach trimmer so make sure you use it for that!!!</li>
            <li> And he loves it! Both of us like the vacuum feature, no hair to clean up. Very nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I had this for about 5 months, used it maybe 10 times , i dont have a lot of facial hair either&lt;br /&gt;im really disapointed..</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my last one that has given up the ghost. Well nearly so anyway, it has a broken door, and the spring loaded comb has come apart several times.&lt;br /&gt;This unit works better than the earlier version. I hope it will outlast my first one. The vacuum is better than the earlier one especially with the &amp;#34;Turbo-boost&amp;#34; switch. That switch is press-on, press-off. No need to hold it and it seems to double the rpm of the motor, so assume 1/2 the run time. Still long enough to clean up my beard... It indeed has the spring-loaded comb as well as a fixed one. I haven&#x27;t used the fixed comb yet but having it means that if the spring loaded one gets damaged you can still use the trimmer. It still leaves a few whiskers in the sink &amp; on my shirt, but not bad as compared the my original unit. Definitely a leap ahead of a trimmer without a vacuum.</li>
            <li> It does not cut evenly. I agree to all the negative comments here. I used the Remington MB series for 6 six years and it was great. Going back to Remington though it does not have a vacuum</li>
            <li> Very good, but require cleaning very often. What do I mean by often? Well, a lot of the hair doesn&#x27;t really get trapped in the little compartment specifically for it. You have to open the blade encasing and expose the rotary thing and clean out the hair, otherwise it will put strain on the motor. The motor is pretty weak and has trouble operating at certain angles.  It&#x27;s ok, I wouldn&#x27;t replace it for as long as it still does what it&#x27;s mean for, trimming hair.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The Vaccum works well on turbo mode&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is great&lt;br /&gt;Useful display &amp; travel lock&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The attachments aren&#x27;t very helpful for trimming less than 6 mm. Pretty hard getting a good stubble with this.</li>
            <li> the vacuum makes clean up so much easier. the guides make trimming to the perfect length a breeze. i wish vacuum chamber was bigger</li>
            <li> Have recently acquired my first ever &amp;#34;Trial Run&amp;#34; of facial growth - and am 68.&lt;br /&gt;Received this shaver/trimmer as a result and have used it twice for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints - It Trims well.</li>
            <li> This product has been great.  I have been using it for several months now, and not one complaint.  The material is very light-weight.  The vacuum sucks up loose hair EXTREMELY well.  I can shave without having a mess at all! Which in my book is a excellent new innovation and a must have on a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting is smooth.  No pulling or ripping.  Just an overall great product.  Would recommend to others.  I will never buy a razor without a vacuum again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but I would be very happy if I could stop the engine that sucks the hairs</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, and once you call and get the superior contour comb guard(I have posted images in the product image gallery of the differences between the 2), you&#x27;ll have a truly great product. It holds it&#x27;s charge for a veryyyy long time, it feels sturdy and well made in your hand, the LED light is bright and clear, showing you which trim setting you are using, and the vacuum traps nearly all of the hair you have trimmed. My only (minor) complaint is that it showed up in the box with the clearly inferior plastic stubble comb, despite mentioning in the info and on the box that it includes the contour comb. A quick call to Philips cleared the issue up though, the rep knew exactly what I was talking about and he simply took my address and placed the order. While the part was back ordered for several weeks, it did show up eventually.</li>
            <li> Muito bom este produto, por em quanto a bateria esta durando bastante tempo, nem recarreguei ainda.&lt;br /&gt;O sistema a vácuo é muito útil, mas poderia ser melhor!</li>
            <li> I did not face the problems which other reviewers seem to be facing with the comb coming up with it. Maybe my box had the correct one in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very modern looking and can be operated cordless also. It worked as expected for me, and in fact, I have never used a better trimmer ever. My dad also liked it. It works exactly as expected and advertised by manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was accurate</li>
            <li> Norelco is one of the best companies around for men&#x27;s grooming products. Tank-solid product, very functional features....Amazon has great pricing compared to brick-n-mortar stores.... shipped very rapidly so it truly helped take it overseas for my cousin. What more would one ask?? Thanks PHILLIPS and AMAZON !!!</li>
            <li> The QT4070 is now shipping with both the stubble and \\&quot;contour following\\&quot; that the QT4050 comes with.  I almost did not buy this due to some of the reviews that complained about the stubble comb, but I just happened to wade down to the newest reviews and notice people Amazon is now shipping it with both combs.  I tried desperately to find the T980, but it is no longer available anywhere, even on Ebay, so don&#x27;t waste your time looking for that, as other reviews suggested.  With the turbo vacuum feature that actually does catch at least 90% of the clippings, I don&#x27;t think any other beard trimmer out there can touch this.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this on April 1st because the reviews posted last week said it comes with both the standard head and the contour head. I guess I&#x27;m just the unlucky one because I opened mine and nothing but the standard head in the box. I will be returning this and asking for another one hoping this doesn&#x27;t happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they fix this, I will change my review once I actually get to use it.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silver]]</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading the reviews about this trimmer, but I ordered it anyway. I received my trimmer on April 16, 2012 and it came with not one but two combs. The standard comb, which many people complain about, and the guided comb, which suppose to solve the problems associated with the standard comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the stubble look and I strictly use the trimmer to get a 3mm trim. So, I don&#x27;t know how it would work if I had longer beard and mustache. I think the standard comb works fine for 3mm stubble trim. I almost nicked myself once while I wasn&#x27;t paying attention but it is not alarming at all. If you don&#x27;t pay attention the task at hand, you can get a nick regardless what tool you are using. If you are a careful person, the reviews here shouldn&#x27;t discourage you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure when Philips started shipping the second comb with the trimmer but as you can see by the picture I posted here, the unit I received had both combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum collects about 80% of the trimmings. Cleaning the trimmer was easy using the included cleaning brush. I wish a case was included in the package to keep everything (charger, extra comb, cleaning brush) together, but it is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging took more than an hour. I don&#x27;t know the battery performance yet as I just got the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this trimmer 4 star because it feels flimsy. Plastic cover on the front below the trim adjuster dial around the air vents feels loose.</li>
            <li> I just got this in yesterday, and it didn&#x27;t have the mythical contour comb.  I called Philips support and they pointed out that the parts list in the instructions only show the \\&quot;trimming comb\\&quot; which come already attached to the trimmer in the box.  This isn&#x27;t a case that somebody forgot to put it in the box, but more like they don&#x27;t offer the contour comb with this product anymore.  The Phillips website says \\&quot;Contour following comb for a precise and even trim\\&quot; as the first line of the highlights for the QT4070. The QT4050 says the exact same thing, but the picture online for that product clearly shows the pivoting contour comb.  The picture for the QT4070 doesn&#x27;t.  Once I pointed that out, the operator agreed that something was weird here.  She found the contour comb in their parts catalog, but it showed out of stock, with no date on when to expect it.  Since she couldn&#x27;t get me the part, she&#x27;s now shipping me a full new trimmer, brand new, in the box.  There&#x27;s no guarantee that the new one will have the comb, but we&#x27;re rolling the dice.  Worse case, I&#x27;ll try it without the contour and see if I like it.  The great part about Phillips, is that they offer a 45 day money back guarantee on their products.  Even if my return time is up with Amazon, I can return it to them for a refund if I don&#x27;t like it.  I&#x27;ve actually used this guarantee from them before on an electric razor.  They refunded me with no hassle.  We&#x27;ll see what happens with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 5 days later, Phillips made good when the replacement trimmer arrived.  This one was also brand new, in the box and DID have the contour comb.  The box I got with the comb clearly advertised it on the back, so this is an easy way to see if the comb&#x27;s included without opening the box.  The parts listing in the instructions on the replacement clearly showed two combs, rather than the single \\&quot;trimming comb\\&quot; listed in the instructions for the original.  This is clearly a feature that Phillips either took out oradded at some point in the production.  With the comb mystery solved, I tried the product today and it worked pretty well.  I took a guess on the MM equivalent setting for #5 on my T980.  The trim was even and the trimmer itself was much more comfortable to hold than the T980.  The vacuum was about the same....so-so. It caught maybe 75% of the hairs.  As this is the only model I&#x27;ve found with a vacuum feature, I&#x27;ll take it.  Bumping this up to four stars, with the fifth reserved with the hopes of one day having a better vacuum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too impressed with this one. I wish the attachment had finer combs to grab the hair better. It takes several passes to get all the hair cut in one area to the length you want.</li>
            <li> Great product with many features. Definately would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very smart idea incorporating the vacuum as it greatly reduces the amount of stubble mess I used to have with my old beard trimmer.The trimmer is very well made and does an excellent job keeping my beard well groomed. Charge-up time is pretty fast and I also like the numerous cutting lengths.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is advertised. The vacuum is good, not great, but results in way less of a mess than just a regular trimmer.</li>
            <li> You know, it&#x27;s only okay—bummer. This is why for us it is just a B product: my son has fine hair and it just won&#x27;t cut it well; the vac quickly fills up and I have to empty it which really slows down the process; and last the adjustable clip made for cutting hair is awkward because of the way it is exposed. That said, charge is great. Design is nice looking. It just isn&#x27;t the perfect fit for our needs.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE - The one I bought only lasted about 9 months and now the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use was at least once a month to trim my beard, sometimes twice a month. So it was rarely used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for $65 this should last well over a year - if not two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piece of crap if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mfg make things to break these days so we have to keep buying.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. Works as advertised.  Had no problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco beard trimmers from this particular line for a long time and have gone through three of them. This is the first one I&#x27;ve gotten with the vacuum, and it really DOES work! A terrific improvement, and I expect to have it and use it for a long time. Norelco, just please don&#x27;t stop making these!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric beard trimmer, and certainly the last I will ever need. Turbo mode is very useful when the beard gets a little too long. The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect but it gets the job done. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works well and trims neatly. The suction function doesn&#x27;t catch everything though, but it&#x27;s still worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well as abeard trimmer. My main complaint is the vacuum only catches about half of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Some hair fall but most of it get sucked. But its awesome (not water resistance).</li>
            <li> I have only had it a short time, but so far it performs well. Lots of plastic, but time will tell.</li>
            <li> Works great with outstanding battery life. The brush is a joke most likely will drop on toilet or lose it.</li>
            <li> I tried charging this trimmer for 2 hours to no avail, so I am going to return it soon. I decided to buy the trimmer from the actual Phillips website &amp; it only cost me $10-15 more, which I happily paid to get the actual working trimmer. The real box has red labels instead of the green ones used here, yhe trimmer is completely black (no grey colors), has the words &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; instead of the tornado-looking thing (under the power button), &amp; has a red circular turning thing that changes the height of the trim, not back or grey.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  About 20% of the clippings do not get caught by the vacuum.  But you don&#x27;t really need that feature anyway.  It holds the charge a long time.</li>
            <li> my wife really likes this model because it doesn&#x27;t drop my hair trimmings all over the bathroom counter</li>
            <li> My old version of this died and this picked right up where it left off. Has both trimmer guards and a better vacuum collection system/filter, great product!</li>
            <li> My husband, really likes this trimmer!  Worked just like he wanted.  He&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I use it for a mustache and beard trimmer. Works great. I wear a royale beard with stubble on the rest of my face. The clippers make me look amazing.</li>
            <li> Battery life is great, Cuts uneven, hard to get straight edges.... I am buying a different trimmer. This one is just two bulky and is not easy to use imo.</li>
            <li> I like it. I also have a Remington MB4040. The Remington is okay as well, but I find it under-powered. I posted a review on it a little while back. I rated it as a good trimmer, but it takes quite a few passes and patience to get a good trim. This Norelco is MUCH better trimming my beard, AS LONG AS I HAVE IT ON TURBO MODE. On regular power, I find it no better than the Remington. I keep my beard at 14mm-16mm. This trimmer is very good at that, on turbo it cuts better, and is faster than the Remington. The vacuum feature is also pretty good. I don&#x27;t have near the mess I do with the Remington MB4040. The Remington does have one distinct advantage: close shaving neck hairs. This Norelco can&#x27;t do it nearly as close.  :-(    Except for that, though, I&#x27;ve moved on to the Norelco QT4070. Battery life is good and it can run on AC as well if plugged in. The Remington won&#x27;t do that. It will only run if charged.    UPDATE - AFTER 3 MONTHS: Two things - (1) With no attachment the blades do get neck about as close as the Remington did. (2) DO NOT TRY TO CLEAN UNDER RUNNING WATER! Yes, the instructions are very clear this unit is not waterproof, but I tried it anyway. MISTAKE. Took me a couple days to get it all dried out and the electronics back to working properly, this included a rice bag followed by near total dis-assembly. I think I got lucky.</li>
            <li> Great trimmers. Battery life good. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great for overall shortening to achieve stubble and blending sideburns. Not great for cheek line or clean shaving as the vacuum gets in the way. I use it to keep at 2/3 mm and use the 1mm setting under the nose because it&#x27;s hard for the blades to work effectively. Came with both attachments and I find the non pivoting head better unlike other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;Great that it works while plugged in and the vacuum works well aside from a few hairs on the sink. Roommates greatly appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product and haven&#x27;t had any problems in the first month of owning it.</li>
            <li> the best trimmer you can find today</li>
            <li> I like this product. Works very well for me.. This is the 2nd one in this model that i purchased. The first one with the vaccum lasted me for years.</li>
            <li> At first hated this product because if I didn&#x27;t shave at a proper angle, it would cut most of my beard off.  Then I found another clip (black with a clear plastic movable part) in the box and removed the default clip (the all black one with the open end that caused the shaving issues); and it worked perfectly lol!  I felt pretty dumb at that point haha.  Great product and all of the positive reviews are well deserved.  This thing really makes everything best and even.  The only minor issue us that the vacuum didn&#x27;t work quite as good as I was expecting.  I did reduce the hair spillage, just not as much as I wanted it to.  But I suppose the vacuum would have to be ten times stronger to meet my original expectations.</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking I was afraid to buy this trimmer after reading all the confusing reviews, but then I&#x27;ve decided to go for it and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a beard trimmer from braun that lasted for longer than I can remember, but the battery is dead and I was looking for more precise trimming settings, so  I thought it&#x27;s time for a change. I took my trimmer out of the box (which btw comes with the contour following comb as well), plugged it in to charge while I read the user manual, and took it for a nice smooth drive.... The results?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vacum:&lt;br /&gt;It sucked 85% or even more. I wasn&#x27;t even interested in such feature, but using it I have to say that I am impressed... Please keep in mind that this vacum is put into such small size - you are not carrying the carpet hover in your hands :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;This thing gives you perfectly EVEN trim everywhere... this was a big issue for me with my old trimmer, and I am more than pleased with this trim... smooth, nice, and even :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contour Following Comb&lt;br /&gt;This is a F***ing great addition to your trimmer. I have used it around tricky places such as my neck, and it serves you good... you might need to choose a different trimming length than with the normal comb, especially if you hold your trimmer in a more angled way like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim Length Settings&lt;br /&gt;18 trimming settings that I think are fabulous, you can choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5..., 18 mm with 1mm difference between each setting... Preferably start with long length for the first use and go down step by step - they tell you to do so in the user manual but I was stupid to think it&#x27;s the same settings as my old trimmer, so I ended with shorter beard than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No Pouch?&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with a pouch?! seriously philips, charge me an additional 10$ for a decent quality pouch and I would be more than happy to pay for it... fortunately for me, it fits perfectly in my Braunpouch :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short... For the first time in my life, I had my beard professionally trimmed at the comfort of my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it without any hesitation ;)</li>
            <li> I look to amazon reviews to find out about a lot of products I plan to buy. I have been looking for a good stubble shaver, so as usual I go to amazon to get opinions. To my surprise as nice as the shaver seemed folks were really giving it awful reviews while their were slightly more good ones. Well I rolled the dice and bought it and I want to tell folks who may be on the fence that this shaver is great. Its simple to operate and cuts evenly. In some of the reviews I read people were saying it was cutting their face, I had no such experience. The shaver comes with two guards, and both adjust to the hair length you want with the click of a dial. I use the guard with the piece that contours the shape of your face. I don&#x27;t write reviews often but this product I believe got a bad rap. It works fine and I would encourage anyone to get it.</li>
            <li> Using it now for one week every day.  trimming my stubble to get that 3-5 day no shave look and it works perfectly.  Trims all the hairs evenly, no pulling and guides over my face with no issues.  used the 1, 2 and 3 mm settings only and they all worked great.  Don&#x27;t know how it would work on a full beard but for stubble it is perfect.  would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very close. You have to go over and over and over the area being shaved to even get a litle close. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;1/64 inch (.5mm) stubble setting\\&quot;  Yeah, it doesn&#x27;t have that. The &#x27;setting&#x27; is likely when the trim measuring guard is removed, and you use the bare trimmer on your face. Problem? The plastic for the vacuum gets in the way. It&#x27;s nigh unusable, and leaves me with much more stubble than a millimeter, which the cheaper Qt4022 can do with ease. (I&#x27;ll link it at the bottom.)    Mine came with two attachments, one you might recognize as the one customers complained about rather frequently in other reviews, and one that some people had to order. I think Philips realized that everyone wanted the original trim guard, so they just started including both. I honestly don&#x27;t know what the strange guard is even for (pictured here:[...]), since it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very smoothly no matter what way I used it.    If I wanted a trimmer to keep a couple millimeters of hair on my face, or to trim an existing beard, this might work alright. The vacuum was useful when I was testing it, but it got in the way more often than it helped on the low trim settings. The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature was kinda cool, but I don&#x27;t see why it just wouldn&#x27;t always be on. Louder, I guess. I had it on pretty much all the time as I tried to trim as much as possible.    The last downside is the price. Sure, it has a lithium battery, but for 50 bucks? That puts it in the range of some rather fancy trimming devices. Worst part is that I paid more than that for it a couple months ago, only to (likely) never use it again. Maybe I&#x27;ll grow a beard or something.    I instead picked up the Qt4022:[[ASIN:B004QWST7Y Philips Norelco Qt4022/41 Stubble Trimmer Pro]]  This thing works fantastic, as advertised (actually does .5mm trim) to give you the permament 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. It works great, and for less than half the price, I highly recommend it. It works while being plugged in and charged, and is waterproof. NiCd batteries last me about two weeks when I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the previous less than \\&quot;Glowing\\&quot; reviews on this trimmer. My experience has been very good so far. The trimmer now comes with the newer trim attachment which is apparently much better designed than the former large toothed attachment. The trimmer&#x27;s vacuum does loose a couple of hairs, but a lot less than my old Remington that it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;(Even less hairs in the sink when used in the \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; mode). Very quick to charge, and the charge lasts a long time. The cut quality is great, no problems with pulling or an uneven cut. All my previous trimmers failed due to the Nickel based batteries no longer taking a charge. Hopefully the Lithium-ion battery on this trimmer (Great Upgrade for a trimmer!) will last a lot longer&lt;br /&gt;than the \\&quot;old technology\\&quot; Ni batteries.</li>
            <li> Several years ago while living in Florida my son gave me one of the other beard trimmers.  It wasn&#x27;t the one with vacuum on it. Since it was a gift I asked my son if I could return it and pay the difference in price and get myself the one with the vacuum.  I purchased mine from Walmart 6 or 7 years ago. My son a couple of years later decided to grow a beard. I went back to get him one because his didn&#x27;t have the vacuum and his hair was falling off on the counter and wasn&#x27;t  cleaning up to my standards. I have been trying all walmarts and none of them were caring this model anymore. Well just before Christmas this pass year the light in my head came on and that&#x27;s when I found it with u guys. He loves it and mine is still good except mine rolled off the counter and my hinge on the plastic door broke. I still  use it buy just holding the door on while shave and the empty it. I will soon or later buy another one. I would highly recommend this product to anyone else looking for a beard trimmer. Very satisfied and he is too. Thank u very much for helping out. Mike Haggard</li>
            <li> This replace and older one I had.  It should be the same trimmer, but the new one seems much better - like the normal mode on this one is like Turbo on the old one - so I don&#x27;t use Turbo much now.  Good trimmer for that &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; / &amp;#34;Lost&amp;#34; beard look. :)</li>
            <li> It works. I like having the ability to adjust the size of the trim. I tend to keep my beard between 9 and 10mm and this is the only razor I have seen that has the option. The price is great as well.</li>
            <li> These guys could probably bitch about having a wet dream!  The trimmer works fine.  I just took 1/2\\&quot; of beard down to stubble and somehow managed to do it without crying.  I tried a variety of heights and got an even cut all the way down, no pinching or stabbing occurred, even when I completely removed the comb guide.  I&#x27;m completely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver based on the ratings on Amazon and I suppose it has performed well during the time I have owned it.  As many others noted, the guards are very hard on the face and you have to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for 2 years now and the battery that started out strong (would last forever on a charge) just went down hill very fast.  It has now died completely after 2 years and 3 months post-purchase.  Of course that&#x27;s 3 months past the warranty date.  I only use this shaver every three days or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use it with the cord, no big deal.  But I will look for an alternative product brand the next time I buy a shaver.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick delivery. Very pleasant experience</li>
            <li> Perfect, reliable and very handy for beard or stash norelco products have always been good product for me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m really surprised this isn&#x27;t waterproof. I understand that it has a vacuum, but it couldn&#x27;t even handle a wet beard. I had to return the first one because the LCD got destroyed after shaving a wet beard. Now I always keep myself perfectly dry before using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fairly good capacity, and shaves well, although it may take a few passes if your hair doesn&#x27;t grow all in one direction.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. While it doesn&#x27;t get 100% of the beard clippings, it snags the majority and is an enormous improvement over what I used to deal with. Requires a fraction of the cleanup I was used to doing prior to my purchase of this trimmer. Some of the most worthwhile money I&#x27;ve ever spent. New trimmers now include two different guards, so it was unnecessary for me to contact Norelco to obtain a more comfortable guard.</li>
            <li> Good, clean design, clean trim line for detail, charges easily and maintains charge&lt;br /&gt;for an exceptional amount of time.  Trim guide can be set to Decimal, or Metric scales. Decimal&lt;br /&gt;trim guide pivots to meet contour of face.  This is the second beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned which was&lt;br /&gt;manufactured by Philips Norelco and am very pleased with it. The first lasted for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two things I wish were different are:&lt;br /&gt;1)the \\&quot;trimmed hair collection drawer\\&quot; swings outward and is hinged on one side.&lt;br /&gt;  It is harder to clean the cut hair out of it than a pull drawer, which I had with my previous&lt;br /&gt;  trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;2)there is no storage bag which had been provided with my previous trimmer. A good storage/travel&lt;br /&gt;  bag would have been appreciated.  This is not an inexpensive purchase. Still, it is worth the price. [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silver]]</li>
            <li> Overall, a good trimmer that does what it advertises.  I like the dual voltage and travel lock features.  The vacuum works as advertised, but only manages to pick up 60-70% of the clippings (I mostly use this as a scruff trimmer).  It did reduce the clippings in the sink and sped up clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable guards do not move after setting, a problem I had with previous trimmers.  The guards removed quickly for shaping my scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good overall...recommend.</li>
            <li> This shaver does an excellent job of trimming beards down to a wide range of lengths. If you&#x27;re looking for a detailer, you may want to purchase a cheaper one to complement the nice trims of this product. Even with the vacuum capability, you&#x27;re always left with a sink full of hair, but it does a nice job of catching quite a fair amount in the little recepticle. Boost is a nice quirk that I usually turn on as a norm -- why would I otherwise wish to prolong my shaves? I believe in efficiency! The quick charge is a Dog-send, and the battery life is pleasantly long. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> One of the plastic combs broke on this piece of junk. Thought Phillips wouldn&#x27;t have a problem sending me a new part for free (seeing as it&#x27;s a piece of plastic). $30.00 total they wanted to get a new part sent. Will never buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> This razor revolutionized my shaving experience. As someone who shaves both his head and his face it was time to up my game. No more breakouts from shaving, a lot less mess. It&#x27;s like the Terminator came back from the future to deliver to us this piece of technology. There&#x27;s only one little problem and that&#x27;s the difficulty of getting the little bit of mustache hair right below the nostril, not so easy to pull my lip out that far.</li>
            <li> Fans of the late lamented Norelco T980 vacuum beard trimmer will find a worthy replacement in the QT 4070, which does everything the T980 did and offers a better battery and illuminated display in the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my money this is the best beard trimmer currently available for a number of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The vacuum feature means no more beard whiskers in the sink. Once you have used a vacuum beard trimmer, you won&#x27;t want to go back to a trimmer without this useful feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The contour comb and dialable length settings make it easy to trim your beard to a consistent length. (Yes, the 4070 now comes with the spring-loaded contour comb familiar to T980 owners; no calls to Philips customer service needed!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The 980 had a nickel cadmium battery, which cordless appliance owners know is subject to battery memory problems that decrease charge capacity over time. The 4070 has a lithium-ion battery that doesn&#x27;t share this problem. It also charges fully in just an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The illuminated display shows the trimmer length selected in millimeters, as well as the current battery charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The power supply (which folks often refer to as \\&quot;the brick\\&quot;) is as lightweight and compact as any I&#x27;ve ever encountered, desirable attributes if you take the 4070 traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can report is that the 4070 really shouldn&#x27;t be called a stubble trimmer, as the closest trim using the contour comb is 1 mm. Guys looking for a real stubble trimmer might consider the Man Groomer Scruff Sculptor, which trims down to a third of a millimeter, but which also suffers from some unfortunate functional and ergonomic deficiencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4070 is a much more polished product than the Scruff Sculptor and represents a much better value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the next generation of Norelco vacuum beard trimmers will trim closer. Until then the 4070 is the beard trimmer of choice.</li>
            <li> Works great and the vacuum makes clean-up much easier (no complaints from my wife about wayward hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware, the closeness settings are calibrated in mm. and are not the same as the arbitrary units used by many other trimmers, so use a not-very-close setting to start with until you get a feeling for the settings or you may end up with a shorter beard than you planned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for a few months now and it is a good product even though learning curve wasn&#x27;t easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several failed attempts to use it for I wanted (short stubble and now a short beard) I finally  managed to get the results that I was expecting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum is ok if you are using it for stubble or short beard, but it you are using full beard expect hair to be present in your sink (turbo option reduce their amount a little bit).</li>
            <li> I give this three (instead of two or one) because I knowingly am using this for a hair cut (I buzz short of shaving it bald).  I was attracted to the vacuum feature for not making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;1. Know that if you use it UPRIGHT for facial hair, it will collect your trimmings.  The vacuum feature is not strong enough (on a device this small) if you angle or turn it sideways, leaving you with a hairy mess to clean.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you use this on your head, you must not tilt the trimmer at all or your hair will be exposed directly to the blades.  That is the fault of the guard design, so I do not recommend this for hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Beards can be tough to manage. I myself have very thick and course hair (beard only). This is a great way to help manage it. I would not expect much styling with this. I feel the best way to really have a clean looking beard is to have a barber clean it up for you. It is next to impossible to look at yourself in the mirror and trim with precision. The vacuum feature collects about 75% of the hair, which is more than I was expecting. It does a great job at self sharpening, I have yet to have a hair pulled. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Awesome battery back up. I can use it many times before charging it again! The vacuum works perfectly; so it&#x27;s absolutely clean. Large range of length settings, starting from 1mm. Well, personally I would have liked to get something like 0.5mm when the cap is removed; but that&#x27;s not an issue at all.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works surprisingly well but the head attachments leave something to be desired. The Remington MB200 design is better, but I really love the vacuum and lithium ion technology on this one.</li>
            <li> The battery has crapped out after about a year of use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m constantly having to recharge it after one use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, doe s great job trimming my beard, it charges quickly and the vacuum does it job.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY AS EXPECTED- COMPLETELY HAPPY WITH THE PURCAHSE.</li>
            <li> The trimmer helps my beard trimmed tight and nice.  it captures all the trimmings in a nice compartment and avoids the mess.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hopefully avoid using scissors to trim the beard however even though it has longer settings them other trimmers it still doesn&#x27;t work well.  The vacuum function works well except if you trim too much at once and it clongs.  But it does keep hair from going all over the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;Does what it does well. Vacuum feature is good, though don&#x27;t expect it to get everything. Guard stays in place and maintains setting perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Have had good luck with Philips Norelco in the past. However, the construction on this item feels weak. One drop on the tile floor would probably ruin it. The plastic catch that keeps the door closed for whisker collection inexplicably broke after a few months of use (2-3 trims/week). A rubber band now holds the door closed. Will shop another brand next time. The battery life isn&#x27;t the greatest. Requires a charge the night before you use it.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works great. Big improvement from my trimmer of 3 years ago!</li>
            <li> I have been a bearded man for most of my adult life and have used trimmers for the last 20+ years. After a lot of shopping, reading and trying many of the trimmers available I am more than pleased with my choice of this model. Most of the others were designed for &amp;#34;pseudo beards&amp;#34; i.e. stubble or intricate goatees and artistic facial hair. Although I have always maintained it neatly,  It is a full faced (albeit) gray, BEARD! So this is a great product for guys who can, and do, proudly count themselves as part of the old fashioned bearded society.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, it works well, and seems powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works very well- far, far fewer hairs to clean up post-shave.  Adjustable lengths work great, and the battery life seems excellent too.  Overall, a great shave.</li>
            <li> I was especially interested about its integrated vacuum system, one of the main reason for choosing this model. The trimmer worked great for first 3 months. I have used it 2-3 times an week to maintain a stubble style. Unfortunately, the vacuum chamber cover fails to lock nowadays, (I don&#x27;t have any clue why this is happening as there is no breakage or damage ) and this one single issue makes  the unit almost inoperative: the suction mechanism do suck the beards only to toss it into your clothes!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Like the easy way you can dial in the exact length of your beard (1mm to 18mm).  It is also neater to use, the hair is caught in a area that is very is to open and clean out.  Charging is done in less than a hour, and it has a travel loc which prevents it from turning on during transit.  Though I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, and it was more than I wanted to spend, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on beard and mustache</li>
            <li> Lighter weight than my older one. Works great.</li>
            <li> Recently started to grow my beard out and this is a must have trimmer. It&#x27;s not very precise so I only recommend for maintaining long beards. Despite providing a stubble guard this is not a great stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very good for stubble trim. Collects hairs well.</li>
            <li> I have had quite a few beard trimmers and this is easily the best. It has lots of grunt and holds charge well. It cuts fast without ant &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; at all. This is the only trimmer I have had that does this. Also easy to get a straight line and trim moustache.  The vacuum feature is also worth having, I thought it would just be a gimmick, but it helps. Should have given it a 5 but it is just a little large for travelling.</li>
            <li> So far so good, still charging it up and I expect it to be as good as my old 4021 but I do have one complaint about delivery - UPS left the package in the snow in front of my garage when the front door is twenty feet away and the walk was clear.  NOT GOOD, UPS!  Use your considerable influence, Amazon!  UPDATE:  After 6 months use (once or twice a week) the battery will not keep a charge longer than a week.  This will be the last Phillips Norelco product I will ever buy!</li>
            <li> The Qt4070 is the updated version of my old Philips Norelco Turbo beard trimmer.  Since it was the model with the turbo boost for the vacuum I assumed it would have the handy-dandy contour following comb that was with the old one.  Wrong!  I read a review that stated that PN had started shipping it with the contour following comb so I went ahead and ordered it.  Why step down to the model without the turbo boost was my rationale.  Well it came without it.  So I ordered it as an accessory (for another $15), but it is back ordered. Hunh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my old one, but it is missing a tine on its contour following comb.  The part makes the trimmer very forgiving by making it hard to mess up your beard.  The new one has a stationary comb that requires a steady hand or you will take a chunk right out of your beard.  So, I am still using the old one and counting the days until my new part shows up for the new model.  Bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three months Fox Industries contacted me directly to take care of the back-ordered part issue.  My Amazon credit card info had an expired date on it so Amazon quit processing it.  Thank goodness Fox followed up and figured out what the problem was or I would still be waiting for the part.  It came quickly and I am very happy with the Qt4070 now, it is quiet and powerful and trims my beard safely and comfortably.  So the only problems were with customer service, not the product itself.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected. A++ seller</li>
            <li> Very nice.  The &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; setting allows me to do a single pass.  And it also sets it up for a full &amp;#34;smooth shave&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m upgrading over a 10 year old model that had a loose door and tended to turn on inside my luggage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned products out of this range for years and had to buy a new one when the charge wouldn&#x27;t hold on my previous model. It now has a vacuum attached, which is great if you need a really small vacuum but not so great if you want to trim facial hair as this places the cutting head further back meaning that you can no longer use it to trim either closely, trim an edge or follow contours as the cutting edge being so far away from the front precludes this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just too hard to use now and for my purposes a poor paperweight. If anyone does require a miniature vacuum cleaner let me know and I&#x27;ll pass it on. I now have to find a product that trims beards.</li>
            <li> I have had this product before and it worked for many years and it broke. I was very satisfied with the way it worked so I bought it again. I have bought it for gifts for other people because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> Works cuts well. Seems to have a much stronger motor to cut thru a thick beard. Pretty much as advertised.</li>
            <li> this is very easy to use, a well made product for the money spent.  the instructions are clear &amp; accurate</li>
            <li> Very unfriendly in use!!! Hard to clean and impossible to adjust.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience when I shaved myself for the first time. The blades don&#x27;t cut the hair, very well. The result was an ugly shaven. I&#x27;m very disappointed with Phillips and this product. I want my money back or another product for trading.&lt;br /&gt;If the company wants, I can send a picture of my face, after shaving.</li>
            <li> Ordered for the precision trimming levels and they are fantastic. This is my first beard trimmer that does not require a change of guards. While not an important consideration for me I am very pleased with the vacuum feature. As many have already stated it doesn&#x27;t capture 100% of the hairs but it&#x27;s better than a stick in the eye and it does not bother me that the chamber isn&#x27;t the easiest to clean since I don&#x27;t have a need from it to be completely hair free between trims. So far I am very satisfied with this trimmer. I will update this review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> Excelent product !!!!! I love it&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it to buy it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Richard Andari&lt;br /&gt;By bye bye bye bye</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son. He has a &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; that was in desperate need of trimming. This product allows him the stubble he desires and allows me to still see his handsome face! Highly recommended. He said it works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works ok for the 5 O&#x27;clock shadow, but other than that, its not that great.  I try to trim my chest or leg hair and its hard to tell the length of the cut with all the plastic surrounding the blades.  The plastic door that holds all the loose hair broke the first week I had it, so now all the hair falls all over the place, defeating the whole purpose of the vacuum keeping everything clean.  Im going back to my Panasonic clippers..</li>
            <li> After the vacuum door on my old norelco vacuum trimmer finally wore out and cracked off (you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d put in a pin hinge at least), I decided to give them another try. Unfortunately, this one also has a cheaply-mounted door, and the non-serviceable battery died in less than a year of once-a-month use. I&#x27;m seeking alternatives, but I suppose no one wants to spend time making a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it worked, it was stellar. So, the battery and cheap door hinge are my hangups. At least allow the battery (a single AA battery was found after I took the unit apart) to be changed by the user. Add a $2 battery compartment and call it a day... Then add a cheap pin hinge, and you&#x27;d be all set!</li>
            <li> works great. little bulky like most. trap door no longer clips shut but seems to stay in place.</li>
            <li> Works well. Used to seeing the hair fall off as an indicator that I&#x27;m actually shaving something. Outside of having to judge better by looking at the length this is great.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works great for what it is intended for, trimming up a beard. It doesn&#x27;t have a very large amount of adjustability, which is fine as long as you aren&#x27;t trying to do anything crazy with your facial hair. I use it to keep a pretty consistent stubble and to shave down my sideburns. For those two purposes it works amazing! The vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair, but it does a really good job of getting most of it. The only thing I wish was that when taking off the guard I could get a closer shave occasionally. Even without the guard the closest you can get is a longer stubble.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers here, after 3-4 years my Norelco T980 quit holding a charge. The 7300 &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; a lot more sturdy than the older model. Whereas the T980 rattled and the length setting felt a little unsure (push a little too hard and it would cave a bit), the T980 had a major advantage over this new model - the vacuum was stronger. Norelco appears to have spent so much time firming up the housing of the trimmer and adding a little LCD display (totally unnecessary), but they dropped the ball on the most important part of a VACUUM trimmer. The T980 caught around 95% of the hairs at 2 days to 1 week of growth, but the 7300 only catches about 80%. That may not seem like a big difference, and that&#x27;s probably why the product pre-testing made Norelco think this trimmer was fine... but when you&#x27;re in your own bathroom, an additional 15% of 1000 hairs is a lot of stubble to go searching around your granite countertop to clean up. I find myself spending about 3 times as long doing cleanup with the 7300 compared to the T980. The little cleaning brush they ship with it has also gotten a lot worse. They tried to make it more compact but the bristles are too short and firm. They should fire the engineer in charge of the redesign of this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I revised by star rating from 2 to 1. Last week, the door to the vacuum chamber suddenly fell open while I was shaving. I tried to close it back and it would not stay shut. I examined closely and the cheap little plastic tab on the door had basically worn out/bent in too far. I have treated this thing so nicely. I never dropped it, banged it around, or anything. I can&#x27;t believe it broke after only 9 months of use after I had the old model for years. I will not be buying another Philips shaving product in the future - I already ordered a Remington vacuum unit for haircuts that I had formerly been pleased with many years ago.</li>
            <li> This works OK but I like my old trimmer better.  The vacuum function on this doesn&#x27;t work that great, my 12 year old Remington MB 70 that this item is replacing has a vac that works much better.  I&#x27;d say this one gets about 50-60% the hair.  I have a medium length beard so if you have a short beard it will probably get more.  The battery seem to last though which is good.  I use it about once a week and can get a least 5 or 6 shaves before a recharge.  I really like that I can use it while its plugged in, I couldn&#x27;t do that with my old one.  There&#x27;s nothing worse than running out of juice when your half done with your beard and your late for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll get one without the Vac so that I can just rinse it off which you can&#x27;t do with this one.  I&#x27;ll make a mess but I&#x27;m doing that anyways since the vac on this one is so weak.</li>
            <li> On paper this looked great:&lt;br /&gt;trimmings vacuum, finely adjustable increments, cordless -- really what more would you want from a trimmer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February of 2012 - 4/5 product rating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to trim and fade my beard to give it a sharp, professional look.&lt;br /&gt;It was able to pick up at least 80% of the hair trimmings that it cut -- not bad!&lt;br /&gt;(you always had to keep it on full power mode, i have no idea why the normal mode exists)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trimming around uneven surfaces like around the mouth, the guard was insufficient to protect your skin. It nipped the edge of my lips a few times.. but it was ok, just like a standard shave cut -- healed in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest trim setting on it (when you take off the guard) is pretty good for a stubble. However I found that my Wahl and Remington trimmers did a closer trim to the skin (without any cuts!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 months later - product rating 3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front flap that keeps the hair trimmings in started failing. It would not stay closed at all which is pretty important given that the vacuum is one of the main differentiators of this product. The design is composed of a plastic door, on a plastic hinge, with a 1mm plastic lip that clicks onto the main housing. A bit of wear later, the door would not stay closed -- so I had to use some tape to keep it closed. Which is not too bad considering that you don&#x27;t need to open the door to remove trimmings, just hold it upside down and shake it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 months later -- product rating 2/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery started showing wear. What started off as 1 week of use (10+ sessions) with a full charge ended up being two x 5 minute trimming sessions. Just charge after every use I guess, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 months later -- product rating 1/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts 10 seconds -- so this is now my limited edition CORDED Philips Norelco QT4070 Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Thoughts&lt;br /&gt;I require products to last at least 1 year, with an expectation of two years.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I got a lemon, but considering some of the designs on this I dont think so.&lt;br /&gt;Many reviews on this site are probably from use within the first month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation? Stick with Wahl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion to manufacturers?  PLEASE produce non-throwaway products&lt;br /&gt;ie. replaceable batteries</li>
            <li> A great product for the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer from a department about two years ago for trimming my beard about every other day (setting #4) and the occasional man-scaping.  The vacuum feature is quite efficient for limiting the amount of hair stubble that ends up on the bathroom counter, especially with the turbo boost on.  The battery life is incredible compared to other trimmers that I&#x27;ve had and I only need to charge it about every other week.  I&#x27;ve noticed that you need to exercise a little caution with trimming your mustache on lower settings to avoid nicking your lip, but this is easily resolved by adjusting the angle of your cut.  My only negative experience was that the catch for the plastic door broke off  a few weeks ago and now I must use a rubber band to keep it shut.  Looks a bit ridiculous, but it still works fine, so I deducted a star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the second unit, replaced under warranty. The latch that keeps the trimmings compartment closed appears to be so delicate that after moderate use, it will no longer remain closed. Since this is my second one, I have been very cautious with it, yet the result is the same. Such a tremendous waste of resources and poor design on an otherwise great device. I just writhe thinking about how many of these are going to end up in a landfill.</li>
            <li> First of all, Philips Norelco was fantastic.  The trimmer I received had a bad battery which did not hold a charge.  Philips Norelco immediately sent me a replacement.  Great product, I highly recommend it.  The vacuum function really eliminates the mess and clean up.  Best trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the one I had at home stopped working. I&#x27;d had it for a couple of years. I was looking for the same model, but it was discontinued. I bought this newer model and I love it! I even paid less for the newer model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few beard trimmers and so far this is the most disappointing. It fails to deliver on everything the description promises.    1) The vacuum \\&quot;sucks\\&quot;. It grabs some of the hair but missed most of them which left them in my sink.   2) This doesn&#x27;t make an even trim. The length varies depending on the angle you hold it. The previous Braun this replaced gave an even trim so this is unacceptable.  3) The turbo boost isn&#x27;t needed on short hair and if you&#x27;re buying this to trim, you&#x27;ll probably never use it.  4) Portable - This is significantly larger than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned, mostly due to the fancy LCD screen and the vacuum compartment.     The one major complaint I have about this is that it kept catching and pulling on hairs which stung. It felt like it was pulling them out completely rather than trimming them.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer.  It is very easy to use, and the early complaints about the screen pulling the beard hair seem to have been fixed.  I had no problem.  The trim length is easy to adjust with a dial and the length lights up.  The charge level is readily apparent on the front display.  The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect, but gets about 95% of the hair.  The trimmer works very well.  I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The table currently displayed at the bottom of the page for this item notes that this model comes with both the stubble comb and the contour following comb included. I received mine today and only the stubble comb was enclosed. Now I have to go through Philips Norelco to get the contour-following comb. Note that since this item could not be returned (as a personal care product) Amazon refunded my money and let me keep the trimmer, which is pretty awesome. However, I&#x27;ve spent over an hour on the phone trying to get the desired contour following comb and my time is precious like yours.</li>
            <li> The unit that I received did NOT have the guard with the spring actuating clear guard that follows the contours of your face.  Thus I had a really uneven and all around poor quality shave.  I had to get out my T980 to shave again.  I did see that others said that I could call Norelco to receive the spring guard, but this was after I dropped it off at the post office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had higher expectations for this beard trimmer.  On that note I did test that the cutter head from this unit does in fact fit and work in my T980.  That&#x27;s actually good news because I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement cutter head in quite some time as all were back ordered.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a stubble trimmer so I use it without the guard at the minimum setting.   Positives: it cuts evenly and quickly.     Cons: It heats up pretty fast, when I turn on the vacuum it stops after about 10 sec. and displays an \\&quot;E\\&quot; so I have to use it without that feature. As others have stated there is a large gap between the blades and the housing of the trimmer so it would be easy to cut yourself though fortunately it hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet.</li>
            <li> I have a moderate to heavy goatee.  I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;shavers\\&quot; to groom in the past but none of them did as good a job as this.  It&#x27;s settings are adjustable and there is little chance they&#x27;ll be accidentally changed by routine handling.  The trimming is very uniform and quick.  As for the hair-catching feature being somehow difficult, all I have to say is \\&quot;stop whining\\&quot; and enjoy the purpose of this device which is to crop facial hair.</li>
            <li> Dammit.  I specifically bought this trimmer so I could stab and gash my face all over and sue Norelco, but no such luck.  Instead, it did the most amazingly fast beard removal, cleaned up my mustache, and barely a hair in the sink.  I don&#x27;t actually have a beard, what I do have is a laziness gene which prevents me from shaving for days at a time.  So then what happens is my facial hair is so long that my electric razor can&#x27;t get through it, and the little trimmer that comes on the razor sort of works, but takes forever to get the beard short enough that I can use the razor.  Problem solved!  The 4070 trimmer arrived today, an hour later it was fully charged and I was ready to attack my Geico caveman lookalike face. I set the trimmer on the lowest setting (it says it goes to .5mm, but mine only went to 1mm, what&#x27;s with that!  But no matter, as I later took off the trimming comb so I could go deeper).  It simply plowed through the beard like it was butter; super smooth, no nicks, no facial stabbings, no drama.  Along the way, whole clumps of hair would stick to the shaver blades and I&#x27;d have to pull them off to continue. As others have pointed out, the vacuum feature isn&#x27;t a shop vac so don&#x27;t expect it to catch everything if you are doing anything more than a daily trim.  But it caught pretty much everything I didn&#x27;t pull off manually, and at the end the sink and surrounding area were hair free (I know this because it&#x27;s now 3 hours later and I still haven&#x27;t been yelled at).  After the first go around, I took off the removable &#x27;trimming comb&#x27;, then got what was left of the beard to a sort of rough stubble, ready to attack once more with my trusty razor (although I could have skipped that step and gone straight to razor, but I wanted to see if this trimmer could be a razor replacement.  It can&#x27;t).  I also used the trimmer on setting 6 or so to trim my mustache, something I&#x27;ve never really done before with any precision; the 4070 did a super efficient job, and for the first time ever my mustache actually looked neat and I felt I could rejoin society.  I don&#x27;t doubt the design problems others are having, but I didn&#x27;t experience any of them.  I think this is a great product that comes exactly as described, and does exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this product except one thing.  I bought it because of the combination of features it offers; it has a very wide adjustable range and a hair catching vacuum feature.  Plus it comes from a very good company which is reflected in the build quality. But there was one design feature which worried me and tonight I found out it was warranted. The two comb guards that provide height adjustment don&#x27;t completely cover the clippers.  There&#x27;s a sizable gap in between them which could allow you to shave a bald spot into your facial hair if you were to say, press down a little while trimming to ensure even length.  I will be returning the item and buying something else.</li>
            <li> well i have had the t980 for about 5 years now and i loved it . so i read all these reviews on the new model and found out some bad ones . well i still bought it anyway and used it for the first time today . people cutting the selfs must be pressing down way to hard on it and yes the heads cover does let the blades show at the 2mm setting and i use that one today and did cut myself i just think you have to be gentle while doing it that sort and also if you have to trim that short then just shve it off with a razor.oh and also it dosent come with the extrx trimming head i was kinda mad about that and thats why i gave it 4 stars. but if you own the t980 both the heads fit on it and work so will just ues that for mine new . it cut even and level and it was kinda hard to get used to how you have to hold it to trim everything but im sure not going to trade it in hope this helps anyone</li>
            <li> To be brief, I should have taken to heart the criticism others have made regarding this trimmer.    Pros:   -Vacuum works well.  -Can trim to a close 5&#x27;0clock shadow look.   Cons:   -Beard guide is SHARP and doesn&#x27;t move smoothly over your face.  Really, the guide fingers are like cats claws, and too thin to file smooth.)   -The display frequently gets \\&quot;confused\\&quot; making it useless; you must rely on the length index on the side.  -The trim length is inconsistent because of the design of the beard guide.  Even though I just bought this a few weeks ago...in the trash it goes.</li>
            <li> As per Justin Yentile&#x27;s review, this didn&#x27;t come with the advertised contour-following comb, and as nearly everyone here has observed, the comb that it does come with sucks.  As per Justin&#x27;s instructions, I called Philip Norelco customer support at 800.243.3050 and asked for the contour-following comb.  The woman informed me that it does not come in fact come with that comb; I complained that the product&#x27;s page at their web site says that it does and has a picture of the comb pivoting on a hinge.  She told me that they&#x27;re trying to fix the website to correct that, and as a one-time courtesy she&#x27;d send me the contour-following comb.  I just got off the phone with her--I&#x27;ll wait until I receive it to ammend this review with my impressions of the product and adjust my rating.  I have no idea why they&#x27;d choose to supply the more expensive model with an inferior comb (the comparison table says that it has \\&quot;Stubble + Contour Following Comb\\&quot;, which implies that it should come with two different combs).</li>
            <li> Excellent, does a fantastic job. Exactly what I was looking for. I will always stick with this brand for the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Trimmer for past 4 months and never had to think twice about trying out different stubble looks. Its easy convenient and fast. Easy to clean. I Recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I should begin this with admitting that perhaps my expectations were too high.  I have used the same pair of actual hair clippers to trim my beard for years.  For some reason, recently my clippers began pulling my facial hair so I looked for a good trimmer.  I landed on this Norelco.  The trimmer simply does not give even close to the even cut that I receive with my clippers.  I cut mine pretty short, I use the 3 or 4 millimeter setting, so with a good even cut it actually makes a great line to frame my face.  They have plenty of power, particularly with the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; and they cut through hair great so I assume it must be from the difference in the type of comb to raise the hair.  I do love the vacuum feature that provides adequate suction to get the massive majority of the hair.  Unfortunately without being able to provide the same cut as my clippers I will be left to using these solely as trimmers for body hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased to replace a similar product that I had a long time ago.  This does just about everything that i expected it to, and at a price that was less than expected.  I&#x27;m totally satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper does come with both options of guides.</li>
            <li> working perfectly   great battery life   very sharp and strong blades  length adjustable in 9 steps  no issues with the product</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved this gift and so did I. I particular like that the vacuum catches most of the hairs so I don&#x27;t get his mess of hair all over the sink. Also, he likes not having to look for all the trimmer attachments or worry about them getting lost. This is one of the best trimmers he has ever had and it gets the job done in no time plus gets rid of the mess. This is a keeper and we would get the next upgrade of this style if they come out with one. No complaints, this is 5 stars!</li>
            <li> The cut on the QT4070 is so smooth. No tugging or pulling of the hairs and the vacuum actually does work! There will still be some hairs left in the sink, but the vast majority of them are sucked up by the vacuum for easy cleaning. I only use it on the lowest setting without any of the attachments so I can&#x27;t speak to their quality. Best shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> I have been a hair stylist for many years and am very impressed with this clipper. It is very solid and not some plastic piece of junk. I would recommend this clipper to everyone who likes that stubble look or to keep a beard short and neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> Very different from the previous vacuum model, but I liked it.  Seems durable and the &#x27;lock&#x27; option is great for traveling.  It got a bit embarrassing when my trimmer would start vibrating as I attempted to get through airport security.</li>
            <li> This is a nice improvement over my last Norelco trimmer. The charging display is a bar graph type giving you a much better idea about the state of charge than a simple blinking LED. It does a decent job of trimming hair short as long as you cut against the lay of the hair. The blade is nicely contoured so you will not be cutting your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an LED indicator showing the length you are set to cut to, it goes blank if you remove the cutter guides to get the closest trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trap door on the hair collection compartment is a bit stiff to open but it is getting a bit easier to use over the last few days. Still a nice improvement over the removable collector on my last unit.</li>
            <li> Better than my previous Norelco which lasted 15 years!!! Includes both trimmer heads which previous customers said isn&#x27;t the case. Excellently engineered.</li>
            <li> First off, the photo of the trimmer is MISLEADING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the actual product IS NOT BLUE. It&#x27;s an Ugly Grey-White-Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second off, the Photo&#x27;s proportions are also FALSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unlike the (promotional) photo, the actual product is just UGLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not shaped like a slick Cone, but rather as a bulky, long, and massive rectangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the design is not a trivial thing, since it&#x27;s a daily-used appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a Plain Deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Be fooled by Philip&#x27;s fabrication.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with this product. Best trimmer I have ever used. The adjustable razor height works great to give me the look I want and the vacuum chaimber saves the need for laborious clean up while the option for plug-in electrical or battery powered operation offer a choice of powerful operation modes.</li>
            <li> After years of using different shavers this one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum is not the strongest but still helps a lot. Easy to change settings and the feel is awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for the best shaver i have used</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not fond of items made in China (hence the removal of one star), this trimmer is great. I recently decided to grow a beard and this trimmer makes it very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is a two-edged sword.  It works pretty well but causes difficulty when trying to cut areas of your beard closer when you use the trimmer without the adjustable guard.  The vacuum feature adds thickness to the area near the trimmer blades and thus makes it harder to get a close cut.  A trimmer without the vacuum feature like I&#x27;ve used for years is much easier to use for this purpose.</li>
            <li> The battery last forever, there is an aspiration system that collects all the hairs cut, the cutting length is easily adjustable. I just wish it was slightly less bulky.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal I did when I bought the above product&lt;br /&gt;Product answered my requirements:&lt;br /&gt;Price, charging time, and time use&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product I recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is certainly worth the money. It is the best one I have found yet. Yes the vacuum does not get everything but it does pickup most of the hair.</li>
            <li> It has worked fine so for me. I like quick charge capabilities and LEDs showing remaking power. Vacuum collects 90% plus of hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried various trimmers over the years and this one I just love. The vacuum option is great and doesn&#x27;t leave a messy sink. The trimmer feels powerful with decent speeds, looks elegant and the closeness settings are good.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Yes you need to go over the beard several times to ensure a uniform length but I don&#x27;t see that as an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great but the compartment for storing the trimming is very small and needs to be emptied multiple times.</li>
            <li> Having purchased this a few months ago, I&#x27;m satisfied with this trimmer. The vacuum function could work a bit better. But compared to my previous trimmer which left stubble all over my sink and surrounding areas, it works great. Other reviews mention requesting a different guard. I believe I&#x27;ll be doing so in the near future. But the trimmer itself works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these over the years and they just keep getting better with each new model. I highly recommend this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> broke after minimal use</li>
            <li> I received my QT4070 today.  It may be a little premature of me to give this review now but I have had a chance to use it and I think it&#x27;s great so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am confused with some of the reviews that I have read though, particularly those who state that it does not come with the contour trimmer.  Perhaps earlier versions didn&#x27;t come with it but I think they may have changed that since my one certainly did; i.e. I received both trimmer guides in the box.  I am embarrassed actually because, prior to it arriving and having read the reviews (particularly the one telling customers to contact Phillips), I visited the Phillips website, opened a customer services chat and requested a contour trimmer guide.  The customer rep was fantastic and sent one out to me with no hassle or questions other than to confirm the order.  Unfortunately I cannot cancel the order since it&#x27;s already in transit and I feel like I cheated them now.  Oh well, at least it&#x27;s a spare if the one that came with the trimmer was ever to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two cons for the product:&lt;br /&gt;1) wish there was a loop or maybe a stand or something to allow me to hang it. (no big problem, I&#x27;ll engineer something)&lt;br /&gt;2) the naked trimmer (i.e. without either of the guides) is not prominent enough (what I&#x27;ve been used to in the past) to get a good trim for definition making it kind of awkward to use for that.  no biggie for me personally because I have a small travel trimmer and my razor that I can use for that.</li>
            <li> The multi-year long-life battery this thing uses is pretty worthless when the clip that keeps the door of the hair trap shut is made of cheap plastic.  I called Philips Norelco about having it fixed to keep hair from spilling out all over my counter, and they told me my only option was to buy a new one.  Super lame.  How are we as consumers supposed to keep waste out of landfills if lazy companies sell us products that never last more than a couple years and can&#x27;t be repaired?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it worked, I liked the thing alright.  The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect (it probably gets about 75% of the hair), but for the most part I had no other problems.  Just know that you&#x27;re buying something with a 2-year lifespan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a full beard for 30 years and have used Norelcos since the beginning. This QT4070 replaced a Norelco QT4021 which only lasted about a year. The design problem with the latter is that its contour-following comb piece retains the blade; so, when the comb hinge cracked, the blade loosened and disabled the unit. I thought of ordering a part from Norelco, but decided it was a bad design to start with, and that the kind of trim I was getting from that one was not worth the hassle or wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the design and the trimming of the QT4070. Unlike some others&#x27; experiences/reports, the unit I got from Amazon last month came with both a \\&quot;stubble comb\\&quot; and a \\&quot;contour following comb\\&quot;. The stubble comb works fine, but it is not comfortable for my fairly thick 3/4 to 1\\&quot; beard -although the cutter does not reach the face/skin by any means. The cutter or blade is built into the base, so any damage to the combs will not affect the operation of the unit. The removable contour comb is very comfortable, and the trim with the contour comb is as good as I was getting from my old Norelco. The vacuum makes the clean-up easy, although some cuttings do stay on the unit head and a few more tumble out. The only aesthetic flaw is a white strip winding through most of the unit. Black and gray would would have been plenty of coloring and made for a classier looking unit -to my sensibilities, that is; although -to paraphrase Alan Iverson- we&#x27;re talking about shaving here, men, and we&#x27;re the only ones who have to look at this thing every every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I believe Norelco has solved the trimmer issue mentioned in the negative reviews.  I just purchased the QT4070 and it has both combs included with the trimmer, Trimming Comb and the Contour-following Trimming Comb.  It matches the part numbers in the cautionary reviews.  The Stubble Trimmer has been discontinued as a replacement part.  Hope this helps others looking at the product.</li>
            <li> I liked my old trimmer, but it would not hold a charge and was no longer making clean cuts.  This trimmer uses newer technology.  It has more settings for the beard trimming and it does a better job capturing clippings.</li>
            <li> The vacuum didn&#x27;t work, like at all, and the trimmer gave me a completely uneven trim, RETURNED.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He likes to keep a nice beard.  I have never seen it look better!  Many settings allow for a really customizable beard.  The compartment to catch the hair is not perfect, but it does get a lot in there making it less of a mess to clean up.  Very satisfied with this product, from a wife&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband&#x27;s birthday, along with other stuff.  Husband thinks it catches about 70% of beard hair.  One plus is that the battery lasts extremely long.  Also, he is not critical of this particular trimmer--he rates it as GOOD, and very likely as good as it gets.  As a negative, he says that because he wears a guard on it, it rubs his face and bunches the facial hair up. (?)  However, he does not think that is an issue that can be remedied--i.e., he thinks any trimmer would do that.  Overall, he recommends it.  He&#x27;s just not blown away by the technology.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work properly. I haven&#x27;t used it for a while after receiving the package so wasn&#x27;t sure if I can return the item. I have almost spent $50 on this but trust me even a $10 trimmer can do a better job than this. Extremely unhappy with my purchase. I wish if there was a way to send this back to the seller.</li>
            <li> This is elite product. As I do not use blade for shaving so its 0.5 mm( without the comb) blade give me perfect grooming for office. Earlier I was using QT 4019 and I was looking for the replacement for the same and I ended up with perfect satisfaction with this product.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for the people who avoid razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Good price.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well!  I was surprised how well the vacuum works in the trimmer.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it is the battery life... Last 4 times as long as I thought! And it has a great cut!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get a consistent beard trim with this, and it takes forever.</li>
            <li> Wanna&#x27; look romantically stubbly shaven? Good tool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say in comparison to the older Norelco vacuum beard trimmers this is the best.  Although, if you&#x27;re expecting the vacuum to capture everything you&#x27;ll be very disappointed.  The trimmer could be better on the neck but if you are patient and try every and all directions you&#x27;ll eventually get everything the way you want.</li>
            <li> This works great. It is very easy to use. I use it for daily shaving. The adapters don&#x27;t work that great. But, I just use this for a zero trim.</li>
            <li> Dissatisfied - Does not hold charge. First charge showed fully charged but when I took it off charger it shows Orange (7 minutes or less time left). Trimmed  and worked OK but after another charge still shows Orange. Warranty says I have to pay postage to return - not OK. Would like Norelco to respond but the web site so slow I can&#x27;t get on.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer as a gift (after I did extensive research to choose it). I wanted to find a good trimmer with the vacuum option to minimize the mess when trimming my beard. I used this trimmer for about a year and a half when the door that held the beard trimmings started to come open suddenly with very little pressure. After another month or 2, it literally flaps open whenever I even turn over the unit. The latch that holds the door closed is a tiny piece of plastic that does not seem to be durable at all, and after being used consistently, seems inevitable to break. I would not recommend this product, unless you only plan to have it for a short period of time. Until Norelco changes the design back to the tray they used in previous models, or at least alters this to make it more durable, I won&#x27;t waste my money on another one of their trimmers.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does...give a nice stubble, but there is no clean line trimmer on it so I have to use something else to define lines.  Would have choice another trimmer had I realized this.</li>
            <li> Works great. Actually better then expected. The best beard trimmer by far. Charges fast, its clean since it has a trash compartment.</li>
            <li> i bought Phillips norelco qt4070 for  my boyfriend and he really loves it.he keeps his  beard 15mm  and was disappointed with all kind of trimmers  except this.my brother has  T980. and charges it all night to use for 30 minutes..just  one hour for  charging is enough for norelco qt4070 .&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use, just have to find right position how to hold trimmer-i don&#x27;t understand why it makes difficulties for others :)&lt;br /&gt;vacuum cleaner is &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;  option, as there is no mess after trimming.&lt;br /&gt;  girls i definitely recommend to buy for your boyfriends/husbands ,  you&#x27;ll receive many kisses  :))</li>
            <li> I t met all my expectations.  The vacuum feature is great.  Much less cleanup.  Adjustable shave head  has very smooth operation.</li>
            <li> Far superior to my last Panasonic beard trimmer. Smooth, close and reaches that tough spot under your nose. I highly reccomend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> it does not vacuum all of the beard remaining but only 75%-80%, still the trimmer is very good quality and great value for the price</li>
            <li> For what your getting with this product, the price is completely justified. I have never used a trimmer this easy and as efficient. It trims facial hair right away and does a pretty good job sucking all the hair in. Everything else tends to hurt my face and causes me to breakout. This was the answer to all my problems.</li>
            <li> This item showed up and it was great. It gave me the perfect length shave I was looking for. The vacuum feature didn&#x27;t work great, but sufficed and the rest of the features were so good that it didn&#x27;t bother me much. The the 7th week hit and I went to use it and realized the cover for the hair reservoir had broken where the clip hold it in place. This shaver is completely useless at this point and shoots little hairs everywhere due to the vacuum feature. it now acts like a blower and sprays the clippings out. The only way I can fix it is to duct tape the lid shut but then it fills up after a few uses. If I had gotten at least a year use out of it I might not be upset, but 7 weeks??? and of course you only have 30 days to return it.</li>
            <li> Just great, except that the vacuum feature is far from adequate to avoid a mess on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Decent shaver. Had one older one that I got in 2010, seemed more durable than this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, what the heck--it doesn&#x27;t come with a bag!</li>
            <li> The built in vacuum is not the best but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its either this or manually clean up my sink which is 10 times worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still makes a mess but nothing compared to not having this feature.  Clean up now takes 2 min tops compared to 5-10 mins.</li>
            <li> PROS: It works as a beard trimmer. The vacuum is a nice feature. I &amp;#34;taper&amp;#34; my beard, so the distance-from-the-face adjustment is not useful to me. However, you can fully retract the length guide and expose the cutters so that you can have complete control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It desperately needs a charging stand of some sort. There are no flat surfaces anywhere on this trimmer, so you can&#x27;t rest it on either end. Shelf space is a premium in my bathroom, and I never had a space big enough to put it down on its side. I finally brought a heavy mug up from the kitchen and use it as a dock. Since there&#x27;s no stand, managing the cord is also a constant problem. You can&#x27;t just run it to a plug once and forget about it, you have to do that every time you charge the clipper.</li>
            <li> First, this review is strictly about this product as a stubble trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I have had two stubble trimmers in the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;The first was the Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it but once it died I discovered a better product.&lt;br /&gt;The second was the Conair iStubble.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it, until it died. Went very short and was smooth leaving no hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Next, I decided to give this handy dandy vacuum one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it did suck up almost all of my stubble (might not work so well for beards).&lt;br /&gt;BUT, it was rough on my face, didn&#x27;t go very short, and missed a lot of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;It also took forever to shave my entire face, neck, and didn&#x27;t get under my nose well.&lt;br /&gt;And the turbo is a joke, just loud. HATE IT.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is useless and it&#x27;s the only reason i bought this one.</li>
            <li> It lost a star because its larger size and loud noise. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the smaller models even without the comb attached and the size makes it harder to get the edges and corners right without hitting their surroundings.</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a year now, and I don&#x27;t like it.  It is not nearly as good as the previous Norelco that I had for many years (that finally completely wore out).&lt;br /&gt;1) First, the 0.5mm closest shave is not what I experience -- more like 1.5 to 2 mm on my stubble.&lt;br /&gt;2) Second, it was supposed to come with a contour following comb, which was NOT included.  I checked with customer service, and it was &#x27;not in stock&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;3) Third, after the trimmer was out of the Amazon return period, the sharp tined comb that was sent grabbed a loose piece of my skin and the blade bit my face a tiny bit, drawing blood.  Not happy.&lt;br /&gt;4) Fourth, the plastic cover that holds the vacuumed hair in it&#x27;s little chamber broke.  The latch that holds the cover closed is a cheap thin plastic extrusion on the cover.  Far too thin to last a long time on a latch stress point like this.  Seems like very poor engineering on this part, or planned obsolescence,  Now I have to hold the door closed with my hand for the vacuum to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco used to be really good.  But this thing was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer but the vacuum isn&#x27;t the best!  Still love it tho!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very big improvement from what I was using.</li>
            <li> And, it cuts well.  The adjustable feature is great for cutting the beard and mustache and different lengths.  The digital display is easy to use.  And the vacuum has a low/high speed setting.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it. It keeps the sink nice and tidy and he says that it makes shaving a breeze!</li>
            <li> Even better than I expected. I had been using the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer since Christmas 2006 and I really loved it! But it finally became sort of worn out. Yet it was difficult to think much real improvement could be made on that great product. I was WRONG! The QT4070 is far superior in almost every way. It is smaller and lighter and thus easier to handle. It is also MUCH easier to clean! It is a dream come true for this type of appliance. I could not be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/4/2013:&lt;br /&gt;STILL proud of this purchase! Been using it for 2 months now. Battery lasts MUCH longer than the T980. The cuttings chamber appeared smaller than the T980 yet somehow it isn&#x27;t so I can usually get through a complete usage without having to empty it. Some background why that is significant. I not only shave my beard but also my entire head--at the 1 mm shortest setting! I hate having to shave but not as much as I hate not shaving. So I shave only every 2 weeks or so. Not only is the chamber big enough, but even the vacuum \\&quot;tunnel\\&quot; (between blades and chamber) remains pretty free as well. So that makes the whole job quicker and easier. But even after shaving my entire head, the battery indicator is still full or near full so I don&#x27;t usually have to recharge until after at least 2 shaving cycles. THAT IS NICE! And no, I don&#x27;t work for or own stock in the company. I&#x27;m just a happy user.</li>
            <li> These trimmers/clippers  have a built in vacuum to save me from having to clean up the bathroom.  It also has the strength to even shave my head.  (of course my head is maintained fairly short.)  I would suggest anyone that likes a good clean trim to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> The battery did not last very long at all on the first charge, but that seems to have been a fluke. Since then it holds a charge for 3-4 uses while sleeping in the drawer for 2-3 weeks between each use. The vacuum feature actually works pretty well and now it comes with the curved guard, so I started with that one and never tried the other one. This was a really nice upgrade from my 8-year-old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve had, the vacuum is a plus and the battery last for days. Totally recommended, it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Cuts good, but returned it because the vacuum is nonexistent.  Hair was still going all over the sink.  Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro, it is a bit loud but i live alone so wouldn&#x27;t disturb someone sleeping.  Other downside, where is the stand or travel case?  WOrks great the vacuum doesn&#x27;t capture every hair but far less to clean than before.  I would recommend purchase</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas. He likes it just as good as his old one! I like that it collects the trimmings!</li>
            <li> I really like this.  I keep a stubble beard and this keeps it close while also sucking up a lot of those little hairs.  The door that houses the cut hairs is opened slightly now, but it is not bad.... just a result of a lot of use.  I would buy this again and would recommend it for anyone who wants stubble.</li>
            <li> I was excited to purchase this for my husband for Christmas - Unfortunately, it was a dissapointment almost immediately.  It stopped working after 1 month and wouldn&#x27;t recharge - we had to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Really love the Trimmer. Its my first trimmer that I didnt buy off some cheapo discount rack. I had a cheap..i mean really cheapo norelco unit i picked up at big lots... (enough said)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gets my stubble just perfectly groomed. The wifey loves the new cleaner-messy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend</li>
            <li> With many of these reviews, check the date they were posted. There might have been some issues on initial release, but the QT4070 works fantastically now and *DOES* come with the contour comb.</li>
            <li> Good product. Works as intended.</li>
            <li> It is ok ,but hard to trim evenly and difficult to do it.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, love the accuracy of the guide and do feel that the vacuum is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: the vacuum doesn&#x27;t get everything so I still have I use it over the sink.</li>
            <li> my main issue with this one is that you have to keep cleaning out the filter where the hair is vacuumed into. the perk is ...that it vacuums your hair in the first place. this is a nice shaver and one of the best ive used. ive seen complaints about the comb included scratching your chin or being hated, but i do not use the comb i take it off completely as i like a clean shave, so its a nonissue. take that into account, the comb did seem pretty uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I meant that the size of the compartment holding the hair it vacuumed is small, and the compartment has too many small tight spaces for hair to get stuck. i was expecting a larger and less tight space for the hair, so it&#x27;s easily removed. thanks to person who commented and helped me correct my error.</li>
            <li> Agree with the other reviews. Mine came with both covers so the company must have got the feedback and fixed the problem. Early days but seems to hold charge just fine. Works great.</li>
            <li> It does not shave much and you do not get that smooth face after you shave.</li>
            <li> This looks like a very good product, and I&#x27;ll definitely keep it. It is very easy to use and seems to be well-built (I have been using a Philips shaver for many years and never had a problem with it - this one seems a little bit more fragile because of the LED display, but still looks solid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the only reason why I chose this one and not other similar products (some of them cheaper) is because it has a vacuum system that is supposed to catch facial hair, according to the description, &amp;#34;without leaving a mess in the sink&amp;#34;. Well, the system does catch some of the facial hair, but it still leaves some mess. And I suppose this must be much worse for those with extremely dense facial hair who will need to use that &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; button most of the time. I hope the system becomes better in future versions - as is, it is definitely not the dream machine being advertised, at least as far as that feature is concerned.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim thick stuble down to slight stuble. Works great. Vacuum is great. Turbo is outstanding for thick stuble.  Only flaw ive found is that it isnt the best edger for around ears or around goatee</li>
            <li> My previous Norelco trimmer worked perfectly for 13 years. But finally the battery stopped holding a charge and it did not have a corded mode (only cordless). I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth ($35).  So when looking for a replacement, I knew I wanted another Norelco.  I chose this model because the one thing that always bothered me was the mess of stubble that would collect in and around my sink when shaving/trimming. And, this one could run in both cordless and corded modes. If my old one had a corded mode I would probably still be using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars because it does a nice job of minimizing the mess; but it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it.  The vacuum feature works, and I&#x27;m glad to have it, but with just a bit more power it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not perfect, the battery is very good, one month of use with a single charge...&lt;br /&gt;u need to think that will not collect 100%, maybe 95%, and it is very dependent of the trimming direction,&lt;br /&gt;but still worth the money...</li>
            <li> I use this all the time I am relatively new to a beard but this has made life so much easier. The screen does make it a bit harder to clean up once it is dumped but you figure out little tricks as you go . The vacuum while not getting everything that is cut, it is a huge help and limits the amount of cleanup in the sink.</li>
            <li> Works great. Battery lasts a long time. Still plenty of mess in the sink, but not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> The next best thing. since they have done away with the one he really likes. As for this one it is very good and does just what it says it will. good cut and the vacuum is what we both like very much.</li>
            <li> The trimmings door broke early on. The spacing between the guard and the clippers makes it very ahrd to do some areas. The vacuum at best caputres 80% of the clippings, and at worst approximately 50%.</li>
            <li> Vacuum actually does work well and the settings a pretty precise.&lt;br /&gt;Only shortcoming, at least for me, is the blade doesnt prtrude long enough to easily trim/edge without the attachment afixed.&lt;br /&gt;Suppose for that I would need one of the professional models, whihc wasnt exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do but not without a couple hiccups.  This is a fine beard trimmer but you have to pay attention to a couple things in order to not accidentally mess up your glorious man beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll start with the good.  I enjoy the quick easy adjustability with the turn of a dial because I like to trim the areas directly around my mouth (mustache and soul patch area) closer then the beard itself.  The readout is a wonderful idea... and would be much better if it worked correctly.  The LED readout tells you the length in MM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the led readout is quite unreliable, it gets confused oftenly and that has caused me a serious issue on one occasion (No more I&#x27;m super careful now)  The readout got stuck when I dissasembled the razor to clean the hair out and when I used it the next time I dialed the LED to the number I usually trim at, and when I went to shave it was on a 2!!! My beard was gone.  I started noticing that it seems it relies on some sort of contact which if it gets dirty will cause it to go haywire.  Even now that I noticed it I will occasionally see the LED number jump around or get stuck on a number I just have to be ultra careful (there is also a Standard measurement hard guide painted on the backside you can use to double check)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I will say is while the vacuumm feature is nice it isn&#x27;t 100% reliable.  The channel it uses to vaccumm the hair gets clogged too easily and is very hard to clean (because you aren&#x27;t supposed to use water on this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well but I have to imagine there is something else better out there, in the meantime this will get the job done.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the vacuum container, but it certainly was not sufficient when i took off 2 months of beard growth. We&#x27;ll see how it does with more routine maintenance of facial hair. I really like the gauge that gives the length, and it seems plenty powerful to quickly take down relatively thick hair.</li>
            <li> Got this as a christmas present for my fiance, He LOVES it! Best shave he said he has ever had with an electric trimmer! Will buy this line again!</li>
            <li> I was worried when my Norelco T980&#x27;s hair collection basket fell apart after five years. I really liked the product and it worked very well. I must say that my new QT4070 has been just great so far. I must admit, as others already have, that the hair collection system was better on my old T980 but all in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this new model. I was also delighted, as pointed out in a prior review, that the mustache blade that came with the T980 works with the QT4070. Having this separate blade really makes a difference trimming my mustache. It&#x27;s too bad that this blade does not come standard with the QT4070, but if you have one, it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing, the vacuum really works, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s the kicker. The guide that comes with it [#422203617701] sucks.&lt;br /&gt;The 1st couple times I used it I got my neck bit! I read, on line, of other reports of the same thing so I was going to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;My brother has a qt4050 model and when I mentioned the problem to him he said that it had never happened to him. He let me see if the guide he had [#422203617711] fit my qt4070 and low and behold it did. I tried it and the story has a happy ending, almost. I got the Norelco customer service # [1 800 243 3050] and called. The guy I spoke with said it wouldn&#x27;t fit and if I wanted to return the trimmer I could. After all the frustration I asked to speak with a supervisor. He said if I wait for a wihlle he&#x27;d connect me but assured me that the supervisor would tell me the same thing. I finally spoke with the supervisor, explained the situation, she checked their stock and said the [#422203617711] would go right out at no charge. So much for the 1st customer service guy. Now all that has to happen it it gets here in good shape and I&#x27;m a happy camper with a trimmer that works great and isn&#x27;t a meat eater!</li>
            <li> It kind of works - the vacuum is not impressive, and the cutting overall is acceptable but not very good. Laziness only reason I did not return it.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES his trimmer! Ever since I got it for him he has been sporting at least a little bit of a beard, and trying out different lengths, no more clean shaven hubby for me :-) Not that I mind!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer with many adjustments. Vacuum works well and the batter lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> Beard never looked better and this thing will hold a charge for a month with full beard trimmings every 3 days.  To clean it out I take it outside and give it a quick blow with the leaf blower.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time and I&#x27;m pleased so,far. I will update later. This is my third Norelco and I have been pleased with each trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has two uses, and excels at both. First, if you want the scruffy look, this is an easy way to get it and keep it. You can set the length of scruff you want (I use 3mm), and then just run this over your facial hair every three days or so. Takes way less time than traditional blade shaving, and you don&#x27;t have to do it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, if you have too much length to easily shave with a blade (say, after a long, casual vacation), this trimmer can reduce the length down to something easily manageable with a blade. For that, I go all the way down to 1 mm. It is much faster and easier to do the two-phase approach (trimmer, then blade shave) than to try to make a five-blade razor chop through 1/4 to 1/2 inch facial hair. It&#x27;s worth having this device for that purpose alone, because it isn&#x27;t very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In either case, it&#x27;s easy to use. Just slowly brush it over the area you need trimmed. Some areas I find it helpful to approach from two directions, one after the other. The neck under the chin is an example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You set length by twisting a dial, using finger and thumb. The dial goes through the device, and is exposed on both the front and back. An LED shows the length, and a scaled area on the sign does too. The LED is in millimeters, while the scaled area is in fractions of an inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single charge works over a month for me. It recharges fairly fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor glitch: at one point when I was fumbling with the length adjustment, the dial slipped and then the trimmer would only go down to five millimeters. I had to force it all the way in the other direction to make it slip the other way, and then it was fine. Lesson from this is, don&#x27;t force that dial, and pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty comfortable, lasts a while on a charge and it&#x27;s my first with the built in vacuum which does a fairly decent job of preventing larger cleanup efforts.  If only it could cut the gray hairs lower than the the others.....</li>
            <li> Have used/still use multiple, various razors and trimmers, primarily Norelco and Braun.  This recent addition was purchased to simplify the &#x27;3-day beard&#x27; and &#x27;essentially-bald&#x27; effect.  So far it has fulfilled its purpose.  Will update as necessitated.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great, the vacuum compartment contains the hair, the adjustable settings are a big plus compared with interchanging heads. The only thing holding back the fifth star on this review is due to the bulky size of the head makes it nearly impossible to trim mustache under nose.</li>
            <li> Best Beard Trimmer on the Market</li>
            <li> Works well, is not too big but is a bit loud -my husband shaves at night so he doesn&#x27;t wake me in the morning.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with his trimmer.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer, best part is you can use it cordless or plugged in so if the battery dies you can plug it in and keep trimming.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Cuts well and easy to clean. I really like being able to dial in length to the mm my bear grows unevenly and some strays get longer than others so this clips to a uniform and adjustable length.</li>
            <li> doesnt trim as close as i would have liked, and seems to leave longer straglers. Its REALLY hard to find a strong performing beard trimmer now days</li>
            <li> Vacuum only sucks in half the trimmings, so that feature is pointless. Head of the trimmer is too wide and flat to fit a human face. Doesn&#x27;t cut evenly. Cord falls out constantly if you try to use it while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promised 45-day satisfaction guarantee has strings attached and requires you to make a phone call to Norelco for \\&quot;authorization form.\\&quot; I will be trying that tonight.</li>
            <li> you need to repeat the shaving for a couple of times on each side of your face. The vacuum option was a great idea, but it is make shaving more difficult specially if you remove the cap.</li>
            <li> My brother recommended this product to me. He has a long, full beard (think Amish). He has used this product for years and swears by it. I bought it for my husband who wears a trimmed goatee and he loves it! The vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up all the hair, but it picks up most of it! My bathroom is no longer a mass of hair and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge is awesome, it&#x27;s super simple to use. I love that it adjusts so you don&#x27;t have to worry about all the other pieces which we always end up losing. We even used it to do a quick trim of my husbands back/chest hair as we were headed to the beach. Love this product! It shaves down to a nice &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; length.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! Vacuums up about 80% of trimmings; all problems that the device might once have had seem completely resolved.</li>
            <li> I wear a beard every day that ranges from one day stubble to 2-3 week growth. My beard is pretty thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this thing is great if you want to cut down all the way to 1 day stubble but if you want to trim down a 2 week beard just a bit, you get major areas of unevenness which leads me to have to cut the whole thing down to stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum piece is cool and the design of the unit is awesome but I really hate how uneven the results are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this at all unless you plan to only use it to go down to stubble.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver from philips, the vacuum prperty works fine. Battery charge is long enough and over all the unit is of good quality</li>
            <li> After a lot of internet research, I settled on this trimmer. The 18 mm trim length is one of the longest I&#x27;ve seen, and since I recently decided to grow my beard longer, I needed something that gave me more margin for error. The trimmer comes with two combs, the basic stubble comb and the contour following one. Personally, I prefer the basic stubble comb as the contour one tends to get tangled in my beard. The motor is strong, with no noticeable decline in power when on battery alone. The battery life is good, lasting me multiple shaves (I haven&#x27;t counted exactly, but I really only trim once a week, so I imagine I could easily go over a month without charging). My only complaint is that, as others have noted, the vacuum component is relatively mediocre. Sure, you&#x27;ll definitely notice a reduction of hair falling on your sink, but you&#x27;re still going to have to do some clean up. It&#x27;s a great trimmer, and I highly recommend it, but I wouldn&#x27;t treat the vacuum as a deciding factor, it doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for months now. If you have long facial hair or move too quickly the trimmer won&#x27;t collect it all but it&#x27;s still a huge upgrade from one without it. I highly recommend this bad boy.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t keep a charge. I&#x27;ll use it for a few minutes in the morning, plug it in to charge it, and it reports full charge. Half a week later when I go to use it again, there&#x27;s a 50/50 shot that it says the battery is completely empty. I just engaged the travel lock, which is done by holding the power button. While the button is held, the shaver ran, and it reported a full charge. I set it down, and then thought I should test the unlock function. I can&#x27;t, because by the time I picked it up again, the unit reports a completely empty battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I can use it as corded, but then why pay for the expensive lithium ion battery? There&#x27;s only 30 days to return it, which for me was not long enough to discover the battery problem. Do yourself a favor and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I am a Sasquatch of a man, with very coarse hair. My beard is curly and coarse. I have to stop and empty and de-clog the vacuum of this trimmer FOUR TIMES during a routine trim. The whole built-in-vacuum thing just doesn&#x27;t work for me. This trimmer might work for less hirsute customers.</li>
            <li> He loved it. still working great after a few months the battery charges fast and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The number of mm digitally displayed was off after a short time of purchase. The mechanism by which the hair compartment opens and closes is poorly constructed with my device at first being loosely closed and now open if I do not physically hold it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the price seems reasonable, other classic trimmer brands such as Wahl and Remington and Andis have offerings in the same range. I am going to try out the Wahl 9854-600 or Wahl 9818 and see how it compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respect</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES it! I love the vacuum that makes the bathroom sink clean up so much easier!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well and I like the beard comb for close trims. This is the second one I have owned, the first one worked fine, however, the  plastic clip where the beard hair is caught, broke, necessitating the replacement.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far, use it for trimming my beards, or sometime trimming my body hair. Good battery power last long enough to shave all my body, and I like the adjustable head, plus much less messy with the suction.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Just what I needed. Great transaction. Fast shipping time...</li>
            <li> Great trimmer! The vacuum works well!</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for a while now and I LOVE this thing. It keeps a charge really well, vacuum works wonderfully and the different size options are great as well. Its by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li> Loving this trimmer. I haven&#x27;t even charged it yet! But in use, it works excellent for beard trimming and the trimmer /w guard works excellent for trimming up &amp;#34;body hair&amp;#34;. Definitely a dual-use device that performs very well.</li>
            <li> This is an adequate product, but I find that the design of the clips tends to make the trimming uneven.  Perhaps it is my lack of talent in using it!  However, I honestly found the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; trimmers to be better.</li>
            <li> The plastic parts don&#x27;t move in/out easily. Looks cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well, but the latch to the door to the cuttings chamber broke, so I have to secure it with rubber bands to ensure the vacuum functions well and that the door stays closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Philips Norelco trimmer; it will probably be my last.</li>
            <li> It has a few more trim levels and a little change in style. It is preforming as good as my old Phillips Norelco bread trimmer. This is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband when his trimmer would no longer hold a charge.  He absolutely loves it!  It holds a charge for a very long time (through multiple uses) and catches most of the hair inside.  It is also very easy to use.  I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Turbo feature is well worth the extra $10.00. Performs as expectated. Keeps the sink clean and virtually no stuble escapes the vacuum.</li>
            <li> As a man who&#x27;s been trimming his own beard/hair for the past decade (ladies, if you see a balding man at the hairstylist that man is quote obviously RICH given today&#x27;s prices for a trim), I&#x27;ve used my share of Norelco (and their competition&#x27;s) electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the 7 or so that I&#x27;ve used in that time, 6 failed at the battery from continued use. Most tend to suffer from poor design, and when my last razor broke (battery kept getting weaker and weaker), I started hunting for the oh-so-familiar Norelco cordless.  Considering I&#x27;d already spent about $300 in unreliable razor over the years, I decided to take the leap and try a more expensive (&gt;$40) model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, so far this has been the BEST Norelco electric razor that I&#x27;ve owned. It becomes obvious after using so many of these that their product line gets better-engineered above a certain price point. This razor not only has the best ergonomic shape for holding behind your head, but it is lightweight and the integrated vacuuming really keeps trimmings from flying all over the place while you buzz. Apparently this also leads to a better cut from what I&#x27;ve seen so far, as previous razors would discard trimmings onto the head while shaving leading to a &#x27;rough&#x27; hairline profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just about every &#x27;nearby&#x27; model of Norelco will share the same charging system, but be sure to read the exact voltage/current specifications on the adapter to make sure you don&#x27;t rush the razor to an early death.  The Qt4070 comes with 2 combs, and both are difficult to place on the razor&#x27;s rails - just something you have to get used to. If you trim without the comb, you might find it a little more difficult as there is about a 3mm gap between razor blade and razor body which requires you to tilt the razor up at an angle to get around your ears or trim a moustache. Not much else comes in the box aside from the standard brush and instruction manual in 28 different languages showing how to plug it in and how you shouldn&#x27;t shave underwater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, the LED charging status and blade level indicator will eventually time out and go dark while the unit remains plugged in, so if you&#x27;re one of those people who are bugged by stupid-bright LED lights on 100 different appliances at night, this won&#x27;t be an issue with the Qt4070.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, for those shady resellers who are trying to gouge the electric razor market on Amazon with stupidly overpriced DISCONTINUED Norelco models, you can get lost. Norelco is always releasing better and newer models, which makes your efforts pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something newer and better, BUY THIS RAZOR.yeah, the LED charging status and blade level indicator will eventually time out and go dark while the unit remains plugged in, so if you&#x27;re one of those people who are bugged by stupid-bright LED lights on 100 different appliances at night, this won&#x27;t be an issue with the Qt4070.

            <li> Good one, easy to use, Vacuum is working good and most of hair got collected. Little bit on higher cost</li>
            <li> The problem cited in other reviews has been resolved.  The QT4070 does come with the contour following comb, which is truly the best of the two comb options for me at least.  The vacuum also works very well, capturing 95% of the clippings I&#x27;d estimate.  Rated this five stars as I am very pleased with the trimmer and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift and he told me to rate it with 4 stars. He said the vacuum feature isn&#x27;t great but otherwise it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is surprisingly useful, the length selector feels sturdy and the device feels well made overall. Also, unlike other people who purchased this trimmer, mine came with appropriate contour comb so no call to Philips was necessary (ordered in March of 2012). Overall, really dig it.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, thought I would get both heads.&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. Going to call norelco tomorrow. If it takes me more than 90 seconds to get someone to say &#x27;the additional head on the way, thank you sir&#x27; the razor gets returned.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: took ~240 seconds with the 1800 Norelco folks to approve shipping the contour head. I didn&#x27;t speak to a supervisor, and it will supposedly be here in 7-10 business days. Will edit review upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: so it took 3 months to get the second head. Not the 7-10 days they quoted. Just getting around to updating this- head works as advertised, unit is great, but 3 stars for the 3 month delay...</li>
            <li> I have had many eletrical/elecronic razors before this one.but none of them could be used for a stubble 5 o clock look. Qt4070 came to my rescue.... Has many calibrated levels and gives a smoth and even beard....definitely a must buy!!</li>
            <li> Within about a month the little door that holds your beard trimmings broke. There is a small plastic piece that snaps into the housing of the trimmer to secure the door and that piece broke off. I had used it maybe 4-5 times at that point and hadn&#x27;t dropped or in any way been rough with it, so it&#x27;s pretty inexcusable for it to break in that short of a period of time. While the trimmer is still usable, the door can come open on it&#x27;s own and sprinkle it&#x27;s contents in a clump in my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, here are the high and low points of the trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Nice shape and feel&lt;br /&gt;-Cool display that shows battery remaining and the length the guard is set to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Poor build quality (broken door)&lt;br /&gt;-Vacuum feature is more of a gimmick. It sucks up maybe 1/2 to 2/3 of the trimmings, the rest falling in to the sink like any other trimmer. If I&#x27;m going to have to wash some of the trimmings down the sink anyway, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s 1/2 of them or all of them.&lt;br /&gt;-Vacuum feature adds a little plastic channel that pops out under the blades that makes trim/detail work difficult to do. My previous trimmer I would take the guard off and use it do do the bottom edges of my beard and mustache area around my lips. I can&#x27;t do that with this because the air channel for the vacuum gets in the way. I have to switch to the pop out detail attachment on my electric shave to do this now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second bad experience I&#x27;ve had with a Norelco product and I can guarantee you I won&#x27;t be having a 3rd bad experience as I&#x27;m never buying Norelco again.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, my husband loves it.  Has a vacume to catch extra hair, so I love it.  Powerful, holds charge good, plenty of attachments to use with it.</li>
            <li> I had it for a month and a half now, and are very happy with it.It does a good job.</li>
            <li> I do have their previous VACCUM model and have to replace because it is not holding charge. When I got the QT4070 I was disapointed because of the following things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Does not have a docking station for charging the device, meaning that you have to leave the device @ your sink when charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not have the detailed small trimmer that is very useful for cut hair behind the ear and close to the nose (the small trimmer was available for the older model and works very well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called NORELCO and they understood my feedback but have been unable to help or to provide a more pricey model that would have those features. Indeed they suggested I tried to buy another old model via ebay or any other site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not what I was expecting. Weird they are making a device that is worst than previous one.</li>
            <li> I owned this trimmer before and had it for a little over 2 years and the clip that held the cover for the hair trimmings broke and would randomly open and the hair would fall out everywhere. I figure 2 years of service was worth a 2nd purchase.  I did try 2 different models before this re-purchase but ended up returning them and buying this again!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think but it came with 2 plastic blade guard covers. One is grey plastic and fixed, the other is black plastic and has a spring on it. (There are pictures of both together on the product page). Does this mean that they are shipping this unit with both because of the calls to replace the original one that was jabbing users? Thanks.</li>
            <li> fast ship and as described</li>
            <li> trims great. yhe vacuum works great. it reduces the mess I had to clean up before.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Corded / Cordless&lt;br /&gt;- Long Battery Life&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum Function ( also a Con ) *Easy Clean Up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum Function *Only sucks up about 50% of the cut hair&lt;br /&gt;- Blades do not protrude enough to be used for lining or detail work. Can only cut in upward motion with front/ display side facing the ceiling. because the vacuum portion block the blade any other way.&lt;br /&gt;- Only the contour attachment is worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preciously owned a similar shaver/ trimmer to the Philips Norelco G370 http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-G370-Grooming-System/dp/B000FED5DU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1362518685&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;norelco&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well but i wanted something that would be able to work cordless/corded and something that would be able to trim and line my beard/ goatee up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did love the QT4070 as a trimmer and for its vacuum function. But it really fell short in many ways which is why i had to return this product. You can only use it in the upward motion and it is very hard to line a beard or goatee up since you cant see what your cutting if you can only use it in the upward direction. The vacuum function seemed good but i found that it didn&#x27;t catch all the hairs and was fairly noisy. I wish that the vacuum function had more sucking power in order to get most is not all the hair that you cut. I would have also liked it if the blades would protrude farther then the vacuum tube. The vacuum scoop is right up against the blade and is just as long so if you try to line or use it in any direction other then having the front/display area facing the ceiling you end up having the vacuum scoop against your skin and the cutting blades are unable to cut any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a trimmer you like to use or like to use a razor or straight edge to line your beard or goatee this will be great but there are many other trimmers that will do just as good for half the price and have better cutting accessories.</li>
            <li> Have the original version of this item-can&#x27;t find the cord so I have to buy another one-thought it to be one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used/owned and I have had a beard for 44 years</li>
            <li> The man loves it.  I was looking to buy my husband something to keep his newly grown beard cleaned up &amp; short.  This definitely does the trick &amp; easy for him to use.  I went with this based on reviews and am glad I did.  Now he&#x27;s trimming everything with it- hair on head, chest hair- lol.  His new toy I guess.  But he never owned a trimmer like or even clippers so needed something easy for him and this was the answer.  Keeps his beard nice, short &amp; clean looking!  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> On time exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> So far so good after a month.  I keep my beard pretty short and for me this shaver works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, precise control</li>
            <li> The vacuum door broke after 6 months of use. I only use it once every 2 weeks or so. Definitely not what I would expect from a Philips product.</li>
            <li> Got it after I was looking for a beard trimmer for a while. It&#x27;s a little pricey (got it as an open box , $42.99) since it&#x27;s not a multi-trimmer and just a beard trimmer. The battery life is really great, you get 75 mins of charge for 1 or 2 hours of charging. To get into proportions- most trimmers give you 20-30 mins of work for 10 hours of charging. So the rechargable Lithium-Ion battery is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself works pretty well, including the vaccum feature that supposed to keep your sink and house from getting hair all over the place. The only problem was because I had a full beard (grew it for a couple of months) the hair tray got full really fast, so I ended up cleaning it pretty often while trimming. Also, the LED display with the length of the beard works well and is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Talk about nice. Shaving was a breeze and left me with just what I wanted. Vaccuum picked up around 90% of the hair which made cleanup alot easier! Turbo button is nice to have as well. I&#x27;m impressed! Should have bought this sooner!</li>
            <li> The unit is much bulkier than my last one. A good trimmer should feel sleek and cool, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum didn&#x27;t catch everything, so a sink cleaning is still needed, although I must admit the clean up is much easier than I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on returning this and getting a smaller unit.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silver. It arrived quickly and undamaged. I got this one to replace the older version that I had for a long time. It works well as advertised. Mine came with the \\&quot;sharper\\&quot; comb as well as the more \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; comb. I prefer and use the more \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; comb which is what my older clipper had. The \\&quot;sharper\\&quot; comb tended to irritate me. If Yours does not come with the More \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; comb, you can contact Norelco and they will send you one free of charge.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon Shopper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be clear, for the vast majority of you, this trimmer is not likely to be worth $50.  This trimmer will not replace your razor.  Neither will this trimmer, with any of its accompanying attachments, effectively trim a scraggly beard unless you&#x27;ve been living in a cave without a razor for half a year or more.  The only way to get a decent trim out of this thing is to use NO ATTACHMENT AT ALL.  I use this in a razor-assisting capacity for when I&#x27;ve gone a little while without shaving and my beard is a bit too long/tough for my normal electric razor.  With no attachment, you can actually trim your facial hair to a reasonable level and finish it off with a standard razor.  To other reviewers who have said that this product enables them to no longer use a razor, I cannot fathom, logistically, how that could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the average shaver, this trimmer strikes me as being good for all of two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - The vacuum feature of this trimmer picks up about 70% of the hair that would normally get all over the sink when using a normal razor/trimmer.  This feature SIGNIFICANTLY increases the ease of cleanup, which is this product&#x27;s saving grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - This product, with no attachment, WILL work to trim your beard down to a level where a once-over with normal razor will leave you with a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come with a stand, so prepare to leave it in a drawer.  It&#x27;s cordless, which is convenient, but I&#x27;m rarely far from the sink, so I can&#x27;t comment on battery life.  I consider this a non-issue though, since on its own this trimmer&#x27;s usefulness is extremely limited (nil in my case), meaning its battery life is at best only as good as that of the product it is functionally tethered to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This offering from Norelco is JUST shy of a swing and a miss.  However, if anything I&#x27;ve mentioned makes this product connect in some way with your intended use, it might be worthwhile to pick up if significantly discounted.discounted.</li>
            <li> good at trimming beard down to a specific lenght--vacuum of hair a plus.&lt;br /&gt;however, NOT good a trimming EDGE of moustach or beard. need another type trimmer for that as well as for nose and ear trimming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not all that i thought it would be but still worth the price since it easily adjusts to a wide variety of lenghts of trim</li>
            <li> Powerful, quick charge,works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is door to compartment for trimmings appears poorly designed and breakable,  will be extra careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to all</li>
            <li> The 0.5mm setting is what I wanted - this does many fancy things, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for a beard/mo mower. Specifically I wanted the short 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look at 9am, this was the only thing that specified that 0.5mm length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my list of things I didn&#x27;t like - This does an ok job of trimming for 5 o&#x27;clock, but isn&#x27;t that easy to get under the nose or nooks and crannies (as the unit is quite large), so you have to really work it.  It may be useful to know that the 0.5mm setting is with all attachments removed. The vacuum is ok, I have black hair which did get on the sink, which meant that there was still clean up to do (nothing like the Philips video btw, which made it look so great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are doing beard shaping this trimmer could be your best friend, but for what I was looking for it was overkill on features, and underwhelming on delivering the 5 o&#x27;clock look. Time to go back to the mini-Wahl...</li>
            <li> Great trimmer that I use at least 3 times a week for my beard and hair. The battery last for hours and I highly recommend this item to everyone. I promise that you will no be disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this razor. I have a beard that I keep fairly trim. I don&#x27;t go for the stubble look, but keep it probably around 3mm. My previous razor had finally died and thus I needed a new one. Having always held the bathroom garbage can under my chin to catch the hairs, I thought this vacuum feature would be fantastic. In actuality, hairs still go everywhere and while it does suck in a handsome amount, a lot still ends up on the floor (yes, I tried it without the garbage can under my chin and made a mess). That, however, is not why this razor gets a 1 star. The issue is with how the trim guide is designed. If you look at the pictures closely, you&#x27;ll notice that the trim guide is set back from the razor blades. This means that if you change the orientation of the razor with your face, then you can accidentally lean it forward to where the razor blades are directly on your skin and loose the height guide you&#x27;ve specified. So, if you have a nice thick beard you&#x27;re trimming, suddenly you go around your jaw line and shave it down to a stubble. Now you have a big hole in your beard. It&#x27;s terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve wrote the same review on Philips&#x27; website, so hopefully this model is taken out of circulation. I did get another one from them and carefully examined how the trim guide was designed. Interestingly, all the rest have the guide (as I have traditionally seen) wrap around the razors so that this issue doesn&#x27;t arise at any beard trim length you&#x27;re going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> The blades stayed sharp and the battery life was excellent; but one too many times in the humid environ of my bathroom spelled the end for this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame, since otherwise it was rather excellent; though the vacuum feature was a bit gimmicky; I still ended up leaving stubble trimmings everywhere to clean up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few trimmers in my time, and this is by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;First off the one and two star reviews that mention the lack of the contour comb attachment are now invalid - it now includes it AND the new stubble attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Comes with both contour comb and stubble attachment. Use whichever one works better for you.&lt;br /&gt;2. Works great for both hair and beard (I use the 4 mm setting for my head, can&#x27;t say how good it is for long hair).&lt;br /&gt;3. Vacuum system works very well and a real sink-cleaning time saver.&lt;br /&gt;4. Small power adapter that works with 100-240 VAC, so can be used abroad.&lt;br /&gt;5. No risk of trim height changing accidentally due to rotating ring selector.&lt;br /&gt;6. Light weight, small size compared to a lot of wired trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;7. Corded + cordless use.&lt;br /&gt;8. Guide comb comes off for detail work.&lt;br /&gt;9. 1 hour charge time.&lt;br /&gt;10. 2 1/2 year warranty if registering with Philips online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on. Get it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a consistent cut on a flat surface however my face and chest are not flat. Cuts or shall I say gouges inconsistently with varying lengths. I can&#x27;t return it and have tossed it in the garbage. I did read instructions and tried both attachments...Even cut my...chin beard.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this new trimmer so much.... Mainly because of its integrated vaccum system... I do fully recommend it...</li>
            <li> As good as advertised. Fine battery life for cordless use. Vacuum keeps the mess to a minimum, and the ergamomics are better than my past trimmers.</li>
            <li> The vacuum section makes it a little clunky and not that easy to get an even trim across the face. I would go back to my old philips in the future as it was simple and works effectively.</li>
            <li> The little plastic piece that locks the hair collection compartment broke. Also the travel lock is completely useless, the trimmer drains itself on almost every trip I take.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro far exceeded my expectations. There was nothing to dislike about it. The adjustment was easy to use and holds its place. The didital display is very easy to read. I appreciate that since I am a senior citizen. It is easy to empty and clean.  The vacuum feature keeps the trimmed whiskers off my sink. Best beard trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t suck up any where near as much as it should the guard at the top bends too easily when pressure is applied and it catches on my beard. Not happy with this at all. Will be buying something to replace it soon.</li>
            <li> He uses it regularly and says it does a great job. Here are all the features he likes: comfortable to hold; cleans easily; collects hair so it doesn&#x27;t go all over the sink; good battery life; attractive design; precise range from 1 to 18 mm permits him to shape his beard easily and as he wants. Philips description of everything this trimmer does was 100% accurate. So far he hasn&#x27;t had any problems, but he worries a bit that the door that holds the hairs might break eventually.</li>
            <li> The product says that it has a display feature to show the length setting. However, for me its just two dashes (- -)    The vacuum is leaving little trimmed hairs and it is not giving a close shave as the products from Norelco which are cheaper than this. I do not know how to contact for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I shave and Touch Up my Beard Daily.  I am a Dad.  This thing is the one you want.  And no HAIR left behind.&lt;br /&gt;IT catches ALL HAIR. yOur wife will thank you!  Please buy this Product it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I&#x27;ve had this for 3 years now and it still works like it did when it arrived.  The only downside to the product is you HAVE TO SHAVE UPWARDS for the trimmer to work well--if you follow this guideline you won&#x27;t find a better trimmer.  The battery still holds up well, and mostly all of the hair gets pulled in by the vaccuum (some will get away though).  The lock on the hair collector part has since broken, but it isn&#x27;t a hassle to hold it since your hand covers it anyways.  Very worth your purchase.</li>
            <li> Its good quality for beard length control, and shaping.&lt;br /&gt;Does an ok job of sucking up hair into the holder.&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job not cutting your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Durability is good, other than the latch on the hair holding compartment broke.</li>
            <li> Everyone was like &amp;#34;get a Norelco get a Norelco&amp;#34; so I ordered this one and there isn&#x27;t anything special about it, yea it catch most of your beard hair in the suction trap but my biggest beef is that I can&#x27;t see the blades when I am trying to outline my beard, I like to see exactly where I am cutting, exactly where the blades are on my face and its very difficult  because the suction thingy is in the way.  Another thing is that it don&#x27;t cut close enough for me... l might continue to use it but only cause Im stuck with it now..</li>
            <li> i bought this product as a christmas gift to my husband and he loves it easy to use and its great to use on his beard.</li>
            <li> This replacement for a previous Norelco, does an excellent job of removing all the stubble from my scalp and trims my beard with  consistency. The old one did for a long time, but then two of the plastic attachments cracked. I&#x27;m not rating this a 5 because the plastic attachments of the new one do not appear to be constructed of materials which are stronger than the previous razor.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer because I prefer to have short stubble vs. a smooth shave. For that this works great. I remove the comb completely and just trim away. I was worried about cutting myself as some of the reviewers said that they had cut themselves, but I have yet to do that once. I was also skeptical about the vacuum working but it does pretty good. This has a turbo mode and while I can&#x27;t tell any difference while shaving I do feel that it sucks up the hairs better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing on the vacuum feature though, you have to clean it out after every use or else the compartment fills up and it does not work as well.</li>
            <li> This little jewell can trim your beard and cut the hair on your head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two guides included can be set for close or not so close. If you are bald, or want to be, those settings can be used on the top as well as on your chin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger works quickly and lasts a long time. The body shows a graphic so you will know time to charge! It also shows your closeness settings in blue neon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will love this rascal...buy it and smile!</li>
            <li> This is a great beard trimmer. It is easily adjustable and easy to confirm/check the setting. It is lighter than my previous beard trimmer and has a great feel in your hand. The vacuum for whiskers works better than I thought making for easy cleanup. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, no cords to get in way. Efficient, effective, no nonsense trimmer. I bought this as well as the Pulsonic shaver system by Braun. This keeps the beard well groomed and limits the clippings in the sink. (A major turn off to a GF or wife). I wisk out the head once every three days, and make sure blades are lubricated. (Shave before showering). It also keeps drains clear since the vac makes it easy to empty as well.</li>
            <li> This is not a BAD product at all. It works ok, but doesn&#x27;t do exactly what I was expecting it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the vacuum part is as useful as made out. I mean, it gets a majority of the hair, which is nice, but you still have to clean the sink. And for me, if I have to clean the whole sink/counter for some hair it wouldn&#x27;t really matter cleaning it for all the hair. From some of the reviews I had expected the hair it missed sucking in to fall downwards , but instead (like just about every trimmer) it flings the little hairs everywhere. So the suction (even on high) doesn&#x27;t cut down on the area of mess, just the amount of mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The height adjustment is solid and won&#x27;t be a problem / adjusting as you trim, but I still haven&#x27;t been able to get it to \\&quot;be a pro\\&quot; at stubble. It works great with my mid length and shorter length beards. But for the \\&quot;perpetual stubble\\&quot; style, you&#x27;ll need to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mustache trimming is limited. It does trim my mustache (unlike some reviewers who said their nose gets in the way) but it just barely works. I still find it easier to trim the top of my mustache with scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works fine, blades don&#x27;t pull, build quality is great, weight is balanced, etc etc. Nothing is inherently wrong with the thing. It just promises a bit more than it can deliver. Unless you&#x27;re keeping a simple mid-length beard, it isn&#x27;t an all-around trimmer as advertised and you&#x27;ll still need other tools to keep tidy.</li>
            <li> This is my third beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cut as short as some other Philips I had, but is OK.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum works as is described. I have less residual on the sink. Great idea Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I miss is a timer of how much battery I have left, in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I don&#x27;t use the combs, I cut directly to the lowest hair length.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have any problems with it. The door to remove the whiskers is pretty cool. A little hard to open, sometimes, but an improvement over my older Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have had other vacuum trimmers and one will be at the top in ranking. Although, I am used to trimming sizes by numbers rather then mm. None the less its a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent the item in good time as well. Thanks</li>
            <li> bottom line, it actually works like they say it does.  good shave and a strong battery life.  fully endorse it.</li>
            <li> Problem reported by earlier reviewers has been corrected:  Both &amp;#34;grilles&amp;#34; are now included in the package. Other than the new digital display it works just as the original - - EXCEPT the old charger is not compatible with the new model, AND it does not come with the case as did the original.  Very glad I had saved the old case.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this thing but it just doesn&#x27;t quite cut it. It seems like I have to go over the same hair over and over to get the trim. The vacuum works ok but unless you&#x27;re just trimming short stubble it tends to clog just under the blades.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. Charges fully within an hour. Lasts over 1 week with every other day usage. The vacuum feature grabs 80% of the clippings and is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, nice adjustable settings.  It is a little loud (and louder with turbo) but not a deal breaker for me.  The vacuum function is a nice add-on, but doesn&#x27;t suck in all the hairs (I still have some fall into the sink).</li>
            <li> Great trimmer and shaver.</li>
            <li> I finally had to retire my old Norelco vacuum beard trimmer recently, as the metal grates over the vacuum intakes had gotten bent from knocking whiskers out of it, and the motor blades were grinding hard against the grates and making all kinds of noise. That and like others here, it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and I had to have it plugged in to use it. I really liked that trimmer though and it served me well for years, so this was the replacement of choice.    I was a hair concerned ordering this with the complaints about the comb, but when I received it I found that the box contained both the new comb everyone seems to hate, as well as the good trusty old contour comb. I went straight with the contour comb, so I can&#x27;t say how the other one works, but it works like a charm with the contour comb and there is no nicking anything even on setting one. I would say it is even better than the old Norelco, as I sometimes would get a nick on setting one with the old trimmer, and I&#x27;ve not nicked anything on any setting with the new trimmer.    They have made several improvements in this model over the old trimmer that I definitely appreciated. First off having a nice solid plastic body will be a plus, as there aren&#x27;t the metal grates anymore to get bent and rub against the vacuum motor blades. Also the comb adjustment is stiffer and the comb doesn&#x27;t accidentally change position during use like the old Norelco used to sometimes. I&#x27;ve also found that the battery holds a charge much longer than the old one, even when the old one was new. The vacuum is also more powerful and does a better job of pulling the hair into the catch chamber than the old trimmer.    I loved the old Norelco but I would say this one is an improvement in every way. No complaints here at all! Nice Job to the Phillips/Norelco engineers this go around!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works well with the contour following comb on a medium length beard.  The vacuum feature catches most of the clippings.  Holds enough charge to complete a beard trim.  Charging time is per spec.</li>
            <li> Latch that keeps the door on the hair compartment closed is very flimsy and broke very quickly. Now I have to hold it closed when I shave.  Annoys me every time.</li>
            <li> The unit came with two trimming heads. One is fixed and the other follows the contours of your face. I was surprised to receive both as I read a number of reviews before purchasing and many people complained that their unit only came with the fixed head and had to separately contact Philips to get the other head. The vacuum concept works better than expected. It does not pick up every last stubble but the bathroom is 99% cleaner! The only reason why I do not give the product 5 stars is that it does not give a close enough trimon its lowest setting (without the head piece). I need to use another shaver to reduce the stubble further (I am not referring to a close shave for which you obviously need to use something else).</li>
            <li> Not happy with the price . Found the same thing cheaper in walgreens. Also there is one more version of the same brand does the same thing but not digital.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job overall. The vacuum feature works as described. Just be very carefully opening the whisker chamber and removing the cutting guide. They are very flimsy and made of cheap polystyrene plastic. The only other con is the cumbersome shape of the cutter itself makes it less than great for side burn trimming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and the vacuum gets a lot of the hair (though definitely not most of it).  The adjustable guard is easy to use and the digital display is a nice feature.  Just wish they had included the small detail head that the old version had.  This trimmer really doesn&#x27;t work at all if you try to use it without the guard, the angle just isn&#x27;t right and god forbid you get near the beard line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Norelco will quit gearing all the trimmers on the market to stubble lovers, but it is what it is.  Combined with a Gilette Fusion razor you&#x27;ll be looking clean, just more of a pain if you have to travel.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews everywhere, I came to the conclusion that this was the best choice for me.  I just needed to be careful with the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;.  One review even said to call and complain to get the new cover for free.  Well mine came with two.  The one that was on there looks like it is the one that everyone is complaining about.  The second one was separate.  So now all my worries are gone and it works great! Recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews said we would have to call to get the extra guide attachment and they just sent both with the order and we didn&#x27;t have to worry about it. My husband using it regularly and loves it for his short beard. There are still clippings that escape the vacuum, but it does help with the clean up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> My goal in getting this trimmer was to get one that gives an even and close trim, and this one definitely does the job.  You can&#x27;t get a closer trim than this.  The only issue I have is that I find the vacuum to be sort of pointless since you have to clean up anyway.  But this isn&#x27;t a big deal.  The vacuum isn&#x27;t loud.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my Remington unit.  Great step up for me.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts easily, catches shavings an leaves little excess hair outof the unit.  Opens easily to dump shavings.&lt;br /&gt;Adjusts lengths easily, nice display shows length of cut.  Highly recommend it if you need somethign to keep that beard/goatee trimmed on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I really like this thing. It&#x27;s my first cordless trimmer and it works quite well. The convenience is excellent and it&#x27;s ergonomic and maneuverable in use. My only gripe is that the vacuum collection system is not as dependable as I would like. On the regular setting is drops lots of cut offs so you need to stay right over the sink or trash can. On high suction it works much better (not perfectly) but reduces the run time much more quickly. Overall a good product and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> so so - doesn&#x27;t really vaccum well.&lt;br /&gt;Probably perfect for just sideburns and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;But for hair cut skip it.</li>
            <li> Vacuum function is kinda bs but shaver works great</li>
            <li> i went to use the shaver last night for the third time ever and it was already dead, i had to charge it after 15 min total use. If you don&#x27;t mind plugging it in constantly its great, but don&#x27;t leave home without the charger.</li>
            <li> With the adjustable length attachment on it, it&#x27;s nearly possible to get the right angle to get it to even cut any hairs at all!! Pretty disappointed in the one specific way that it has to be held in order for it to cut and trim my beard!</li>
            <li> Exelent beard trimmer not recomended for shaving anything longer will clog up and hurt you, very nice for keeping clean facial hair has my Recomendation.</li>
            <li> Quieter and this vacuum works better than the previous model I owned. Don&#x27;t like the proprietary charger, go to a standard charger.</li>
            <li> Pros:  - Many length adjustments - Holds charge for a very long time - Looks cool - Comes with useful attachment  Cons: - Large - Not for fine trimming - Buttons are not placed conveniently - Very Loud - The vacuum system does not work effectively, still have to clean up after almost every shave  Update:  It just died one day and won&#x27;t even turn on anymore. No idea what happened to it and probably not worth fixing. Going to look for another shaver. I regret buying this one.</li>
            <li> WORKS FINE AND INEXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum feature on this trimmer, however the door that holds the waste bin doesn&#x27;t stay secured.  Initially the door stayed shut, but about 6 months in the clasp no longer shuts.  I now have to hold the door shut while trimming, sigh....</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. It&#x27;s really nice because we don&#x27;t get hair all over the bathroom sink since there is a vacuum inside it. Only con is that the storage space for the hairs is pretty small and you have to empty it pretty often.</li>
            <li> This replaced a seven year old Philips Norelco beard trimmer which simply died due to the battery.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get it to go through my beard. Frustrated, I should have returned it but waited too long.</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer for 3 months. The convenient read out when adjusting the comb head makes trimming different parts of my beard (that might require slightly different lengths) easy and accurate. The vacuum collection is surprisingly helpful. The noise level is certainly acceptable. This trimmer does all that&#x27;s promised and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> A bit unwieldy for beard use. Otherwise quite nice</li>
            <li> As expected in every way.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model and had problems with battery life (battery would not hold a charge) and warranty ran out so I decided they would have fixed the issue.  I purchased this newer model and found out that I mis-calculated - they do not seem to have fixed the problem.  After the order the one I received developed the same issue - after two or three months not holding charge.  I sent back under warranty and received another, which developed the same problem after a couple of months.  Again under warranty I sent in for a replacement to THAT replacement.  Received that replacement (now third one of this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; model) and after just two or three months THIS one no longer holds a charge. Philips&#x27; customer service is very good and they were responsive to my issue.  I fully expected I was doing something wrong, but after careful discussion with them found I was doing what should have been done.  Sorry, but after 4 units developed the same problem, I have to think this is not the trimmer for me.  Hope none of you have this problem.</li>
            <li> Good quality, provides great stubble look all the time. Do not use on your head.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent replacement for my old Norelco trimmer (which broke when I dropped it in the sink. 7 years. Not bad). Needed to find a new trimmer that could produce a stubble beard. Searched far and wide and this particular trimmer appeared to garner recommendations towards that end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I liked:&lt;br /&gt;* Locking wheel system for changing the guide depth. Much stronger than my old Norelco, which held on by a tiny clip&lt;br /&gt;* Battery seems to last a good long time. I trim once a week and need to charge it every 1.5-2 months.&lt;br /&gt;* The vacuum feature is new to me and I generally like it. It&#x27;s not flawless, so I still have to cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;* Found out that the best and fastest way to give me that stubble look is to remove the guide head entirely (0 mm) and use the cutting blades in a downward motion. Then cleanup with a 2 mm in various directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I did not like:&lt;br /&gt;* The brush for cleaning the collected hairs and such is small and easy to lose. I wish it snapped into place somewhere on the device.&lt;br /&gt;* There is an additional gap/hole between the cutting head and the vacuum collection hole where lots of hair falls through to the grease-coated moving parts. From a design standpoint, I don&#x27;t understand why this gap exist because the hair will stick around if you don&#x27;t clean it. Recommend 1) pulling off the cutters and tapping out the hair after every trim and 2) more thorough cleaning of the motorized parts (with a rag or something) and adding fresh lithium grease every few months.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s rather large and it&#x27;s less difficult to be precise, even when working with two hands&lt;br /&gt;* Difficult to trim mustache because trimmer guide hits my nose. Needed to remove entirely and use 0 mm size.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. I have no issues with it whatsoever. Been using it for a few weeks and it works very well. I recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> To bad remington stopped making the vacuum trimmers , why&#x27;d they do that I have no idea, this norelco is one of the only vacuum trimmers left on the market but the blade is angled at a weird direction and the vacuum is right on top of the blade so you can&#x27;t clean the blade easily after use. The door that the hair gets sucked into also feels weak and can probably easily be snapped off, dumb idea, why not put it on the bottom like remington USED to make instead of the top front. I use this to cut my hair with a buzz cut and it works great for that. I wish this had a base but it doesn&#x27;t so you have to leave it on its side when not in use. It looks real cool though european styling on the trimmer, although nothing was as easy to use as the old remington mb 70 or mb 400 That stood up on its base. I&#x27;m glad to have this norelco cause vacuum trimmers are getting harder and harder to find these days. This has a kool blue digital light which tells you what mm the trimmer is on at the moment and also how full the battery is and when t charge it. So all in all its probably the best and maybe the only vacuum trimmer on the market, norelco also makes another vacuum trimmer but this is the higher model supposedly with much better battery life and much shorter charging time. So pick one up today.</li>
            <li> Being able to assign numbers to trim levels can help you achieve the same look over and over. It takes the guess work out of the equation. Unlike other beard trimmers, this one feels like a massage for your face. No cuts even when you apply a lot of pressure. The vacuum/container keeps the area clean from trimmed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally looking at norelco&#x27;s shaver line, but those are for clean shaves. If you like keeping a beard, then this one is for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and hard to mess up.  It easily trims to a variety of lengths, and the battery last much longer than you&#x27;ll probably need it to.  Also, it does good edge work (and, apparently &amp;#34;manicured stubble looks&amp;#34;) with the attachments off.  No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The middle bends which cut lower than expected.</li>
            <li> I bought mine and it stopped charging after 3 months of light use. Philips replaced it for me free of charge but now the second one wont hold a charge anymore. I&#x27;m done with these. Did work like a charm when it worked.</li>
            <li> It does what it is advertised to do, and  it does it very well. And the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Had another Norelco that also had vacuum ability. It was great! Had it for 10 years. The new one doesn&#x27;t cut evenly. Vacuum not as effective. Will send it back after I find another</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  You can quickly select the length you want, and the vacuum works as claimed, with almost no mess in my sink.  I can&#x27;t believe I put up with my old piece of junk trimmer for this long.</li>
            <li> Deliver what have been promised</li>
            <li> wont hold a charge after owning it for a year</li>
            <li> Its good compare to all,but it some times cutt the skin without clip</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, although i cant really see a difference with the turbo mode, but still that is a plus. This is a great all around trimmer I would totally recommend it</li>
            <li> I love it with the vacuum.  It still makes a little bit of mess when he shaves, but not NEARLY as bad, and not NEARLY as much hair is in my sink!  I would recommend it just for that alone...but he tells me it works great too, he seems to love it also for the shaving part.  :-)  I just had my own intentions when I bought it with a vacuum!</li>
            <li> I want this one for a long time.now,I owend it.But I do not think it worth $50 .Someone like this in China just $10 or $20.so,I think Philips is just soso.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the cutting increments I was expecting. Same as old trimmer I have been using. Can I return it?</li>
            <li> Had a number of beard trimmers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QT 4070 does as advertised but it&#x27;s loud ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum catches about 75% of hair... Sort of  defeats purpose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUESTION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANY NEED TO LUBRICATE THE BLADES OR UNIT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thx</li>
            <li> But vacuum does not work nearly as well.  The intake gets jammed and leaves lots of stubble in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I feel like I need to replace every few years as no real way to sharpen blades.  Hope they fix the vacuum in next go round.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very efficient and easily used beard trimmer. It is the best I have had over a period of 40 years of trimming</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  Works great.  Vacuum works.  Replaced my old Norelco and it is improved over that one. Good price too</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for. Keeps beard and sideburns at whatever setting you want; I like both very short. It has the vacuum option so the trimmings don&#x27;t fly. The battery so far has held up nicely and I rarely have to charge it...not like charging is a big deal anyway.</li>
            <li> The window for the hair container was no longer able to be kept closed after about 3 months. The little nib that keeps it closed worn down that quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured okay, that&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;ll just go through the warranty process. The chat agent said the following:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I would like to inform you that QT4070 is not in stock. Hence you will get QT4050.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wanted the cheaper QT4050 - I would have paid less in the first place...&lt;br /&gt;After a bit of convincing, he said that I could opt for a refund. I do wonder how many people have had to settle for the QT4050 as a replacement, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately as I have to post the unit back to US from Canada, the postage fee will chew up most of the refund. So I guess the only thing I&#x27;ve learnt from this situation is to not deal with Phillips again.</li>
            <li> The adapter digs into the skin while trying to get the beard a single length.  My previous Norelco trimmer worked perfectly.  I would have kept it except the motor wore out.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works perfectly. Gives me the exact same size of stubble throughout my beard and charges with no problems. The biggest issue is the compartment when it gathers hair. It is plastic and after continuous use, it has failed and does not stay shut anymore. The plastic lock on it has fallen off and it has only been 4 months since I have had this Norelco. I am disappointed in this product but recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I picked this up to replace an aging Norelco trimmer that had been dropped too many times. This is a much lighter trimmer than my old one and I doubt that I will get the 7 years of service out of it like the last one. But it does a good job and the lighter weight is a plus. I don&#x27;t really need the little LED lights in the handle but since they are all the rage I guess they had to put some in there.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my son for Christmas.  He really liked the way it trimmed his beard, and how the vacuum feature worked.</li>
            <li> This has been a great purchase.  Have used it weekly for some time now- believe it has been two years.  It is great- just dial the length up or down for desired hair length.  Holds a charge for about two weeks and then needs to be recharged.  Make sure to clean it regularly so it does not get clogged with air.  They make replacement trimmer blades as well if it seems to trim less efficiently.  I don&#x27;t have the number handy but it is in the book.  If you want stubble or a nice beard trimmer this is a good buy</li>
            <li> My T980 was stolen so I had to get a new shaver.  This one has cool features like led lights and fast charge with LiIon battery but my old one felt better and had a trimming attachment and a case which this one doesn&#x27;t.  Really Norelco do you think I didn&#x27;t need one?  Oh well, it does shave closer, albeit slightly less comfortably.  I can live with it since the T980 is no longer available.</li>
            <li> Works very well for those who wanna maintain a uniform stubble!&lt;br /&gt;Battery life&#x27;s great, easy to clean, and what not!!</li>
            <li> The charge has lasted more than a week and the vacuum function is great, and keeps my bathroom tidy. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought it after the battery in my old Norelco trimmer (which never lasted for more than a few trims) died completely.  I&#x27;m astonished.  I bought this over six months ago and it is still running dependably on its very first charge.  I hope I can find the charger again when I need it!  It is also a real pleasure to use.  So nice to be able to offer a positive recommendation for a Norelco product.  Philips ownership seems to be good for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with both combs, so I think they&#x27;ve dealt with that issue.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband. He loves the shaver and I love the mess it doesn&#x27;t leave behind. He had another Norelco shaver, but it wasn&#x27;t quite as loud.</li>
            <li> Just as described, works great! Nice and lightweight. Works very well compared to our other trimmers. Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> After trying many trimmers this one has been the best one. I am absolutely satisfied and would recommend it .</li>
            <li> Bought for the vacuum but it barely works.  Still hair everywhere even with shaving just stubble.  Buy a cheaper model that does more.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an electric razor that would allow me to trim facial hair short enough to be considered stubble and maintain it that way. The \\&quot;stubble comb\\&quot; that comes with the razor is crap. It&#x27;s flimsy plastic and bends as you put this against your face, so whatever trim level you&#x27;re trying to achieve is never accurate. You also end up scraping your face if you put it on the lower settings because it places the blade right against your skin. So...there&#x27;s very little protection this device actually offers. There was another comb that came with the set that is supposed to be for longer hair (beards). It worked a little better in protecting my face because the space between the sides of the comb, in which the razor sits, was smaller so there was less of a chance your skin would get nicked. However, whenever I tried to maneuver around angles of any kind (jaw, chin, even around the lip) the gap between the comb would be enough for my skin to make contact with the razor and I&#x27;d get a very close shave. Wanted to return this and get my money back, but neither Amazon nor Philips make it easy to return this for a refund. Oh well, out $50. I ended up going with the Conaire iStubble and loved it. Much easier for maneuvering, better trimmer guard, cuts hair a lot shorter and truer to what I consider real stubble. Far superior device, so I say go for that one and skip the Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/14/14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The return process on this product is not easy. You can&#x27;t return to Amazon because it&#x27;s a personal care product. If you try and return it to Phillips using their \\&quot;45-Day Money Back Guarantee\\&quot; they will first make you wait 3 weeks \\&quot;to make sure all your facial hair grows out\\&quot; and you can fully test the trimmer. Then, I had to do two separate requests for the paperwork to send this back because the first time their customer service team totally forgot. They sent me the return paperwork on the LAST day of the refund deadline. I sent it in anyway, paid my own shipping costs, and haven&#x27;t heard back from them. As if I need to repeat: do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> The best one I have tried. Avoids the mess, the charge last for a week at least, and the cutting length is fully configurable.</li>
            <li> The razor charges quickly and holds its charge.  The vacuum feature also works well.  When my son finally decides to ask for it, I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item since I bought it and It&#x27;s awesome...really like it and if it ever goes out, I will get me an exact new one</li>
            <li> This product has trimming settings that go down to less than 5 mm (stubble), but it does a very poor job of evenly cutting hair at this length.  The final product is patchy and uneven.  I&#x27;ve returned to using my old hair clippers (meant for the hair on the top of your head) for this task. :(</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this trimmer. Very easy to use, sucks the hair right in without having to worry about hair falling all over us. Speed control is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very elegant design, battery life lasts very long, very easy to use, sucks the trimmed hair right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few things I found that could be better are, the flap which holds the collected hair is weak. The more number of times I opened, the latch got weak. Cheap plastic I believe. The trimmers head is good for trimming but if you want to get a clost buzz, you have to work hard to get the angle of the trimmers blade to your face. This is because of the hair vacuum vent on the top creates distance between the trimmer head and face which makes it hard to get a close trim.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t catch all the hairs, but does the job.  Can get a close shave if you take the top off.</li>
            <li> My early bday gift to self was quite a treat.  This thing helps keep my amazing facial hair in line- no joke!  I love the ease of settings and lengths you can set from stubble to grooming a longer beard. Oh yea, no more damn whiskers all over the stupid sink.  If you want to make your face look great and the people you share the bathroom with happy, BUY THIS NOW!</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer several times and it does a decent god trimming my beard.  The receptacle that the vacuum feed to is tiny and once it fills up the hair will cease to be vacuumed and head right for the sink.  In order to keep the sink relatively clean I have to empty it 3 times to complete a bi-weekly trim.  For my money the base model the exact same design minus the vacuum and turbo speed.  These are OK but for a $30 delta I would recommend the base model.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed. Does exactly what it says.  Only one recommendation for future enhancement, hair catcher door needs locking capability.</li>
            <li> I have been using beard trimmers for approximately 25 years and this is the best I have ever used. It does everything  as advertised.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine, no better or worse than your average trimmer. The vacuum is completely worthless. The few hairs it does catch fill up the receptacle immediately.</li>
            <li> works great..hopefully ill last as long as my old norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> Dead after 10 months of using it about twice a week. I also took very good care of it. Cleaned it, never dropped it, etc.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it as now does my 17 year old son. Only 3 stars because the quality in all products today are just not like they used to be.  All in all, well worth your money</li>
            <li> I have had a beard most of my days on this planet and used many different beard trimmers.  This is the best and really does pick up 90 percent of the beard hair.</li>
            <li> this is great it comes with two gides one i trashed and the 2nd i kepted works great even with out the gide on it does not nic you  woould recomend to everyone</li>
            <li> This trimmer meet all of my expectations. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a trimmer who has a full beard.</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because it does exactly what it is described to do, and does it very well. I picked this model for a few reasons. One of them is that it vacuums your beard as you trim. And yes, it does work as described. I do like to use the Turbo setting to make sure. Especially as it fills up more, the Turbo setting becomes more necessary.  I also like how easy it is to change the settings for depth of trim.  The LED is easy to read. And you also get the settings gauge on the side that visually confirms the depth. Very comfortable to use and charges very quickly.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The vacuum on this product takes care of most of the whiskers you chop off.  The door for the debris compartment is a little flimsy, so be careful not to break it.  I replaced my unit when I broke the door.</li>
            <li> So far this trimmer does as advertised. The vacuum is not as good as I&#x27;d hope for but if it means I&#x27;m cleaning up 1/2 as much hair as before that&#x27;s OK. I would recommend this trimmer for beard management!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this razor and has been working well for over a year now.  I use it and so do my sons.  It keeps a charge for many uses.  Vac really helps out on preventing such a mess and keeping hair from trapping in your beard.</li>
            <li> The adjustable guard does not give an even trim. The vacuum is useless, it doesn&#x27;t collect more than but a fraction of hair and is just one more thing to clean out. The unit feels very cheap. I just bought the stainless steel Wahl and an very happy with it.</li>
            <li> battery supposed to last 50, after 3 month of reciving and using it once a week battery dies after compleltly after 10 min. Vacuum doesn&#x27;t  work that well.</li>
            <li> This was a great gift for my husband. He loves it</li>
            <li> disappointing that the latch for the part that catches the hair doesn&#x27;t hold.  Don&#x27;t remember doing anything to break it but it just falls open after having for a short time.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this razor. I am a little disappointed with the life of the charge, but it does trim well! It&#x27;s kind of bulky as well and hard to get under the nose.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, it trims your beard without the mess in the sink or on the floor via the handy vacuum.  I stopped shaving two years ago and maintain a perpetual 1 mm stubble beard.  The trimmer works great and holds charge very well (only charged it once so far and it has been 2 weeks).  I have not had the lip pinching problem with the height shield that came with the trimmer as posted by others.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst trimmer I have ever tried. Do not waste your money!!! You have to trust me!!!</li>
            <li> had to have it replaced 3 times as the trap door busted twice and the sucking action stopped. but works great and it&#x27;s replaced for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this trimmer&#x27;s performance. It trimmed so smoothly and with so little mess that I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working---until I checked my beard and the vacuum chamber and saw how well it was doing. The contour comb is a plus; it works great. Cuts very evenly with one or two passes. I&#x27;m sorry I waited this long to replace my Wahl with this Norelco;  the Wahl now seems like a torture device compared to this Norelco 4070. I watched a good Youtube video review of this 4070 that recommended charging it overnight before you use it for the first time---it&#x27;s a good idea. After that, it charges quickly...in an hour.</li>
            <li> I like using this trimmer. I use it to keep stubble at a manageable length. Before I was using ordinary hair clippers. I think the vacuum works better than most people give it credit for. However, when you remove the hair comb to do edges, this trimmer simply doesn&#x27;t cut it. It doesn&#x27;t create clean edges, it won&#x27;t cut stray hairs... it should do a better job of that because I still have to get my razor out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, happy with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[update dec 2013]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the small plastic tab that keeps the vacuum chamber door closed broke off. I tried super glue, but it doesn&#x27;t work. This is unfortunate and makes using the trimmer a bit annoying as I always have to hold the door closed. I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve mistreated the trimmer at all.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a little over three years ago. I must have been satisfied initially with its operation, because I bought another a few months later for a second home. I must now report that I am not satisfied with their durability. Within a year, the catch on the door of the compartment that collects the clippings broke off in normal use. Since this happened to both of the units, it seems pretty clear that it&#x27;s a design flaw. In addition, they both have become dull rather abruptly.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because I lost my Connair iStubble trimmer and I wanted to see if Philips could outperform my past trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;My purpose was to have a short stubble, but this trimmer does not get that close compared to the iStubble. The lowest setting is 1mm, while the iStubble can go for 0.5mm. I have to admit though that the Philips gets a more even trim than the iStubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum works OK but it&#x27;s far from perfect. Do not expect it to pick up every single hair because it never will. You will still need to clean the sink. For those trying to decide for which trimmer to go for, I&#x27;d recommend this one if you want a not so short stubble, if not, go for the iStubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery works fine. I have just charged it once and used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> After about 1.5 years it just stopped working.  Seems like a short lifespan.  Worked great initially.</li>
            <li> Mediocre trimmer with a joke of a vacuum.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as I expected... Was very loud and the trim guard makes it hard to get the space between your top lip and your nose. The vacuum feature is nice and keeps down on the mess, but other than that there was nothing great about it. Also had a cheap plastic feel to it...</li>
            <li> I was going to get the Braun trimmer which got some rave reviews but then I realized the vacuum function from this is actually quite useful if you plan on trimming hair on your head which otherwise can get quite messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is for beard, you can always use sink to catch the waste though if you&#x27;re not careful, sink can get clogged quickly.  I actually use the cheap Gillete trimmer/shaver for beard because that requires no charging and battery life is quite good.  Of course, having a shaver head makes it easy to get nice lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back to this trimmer.  It is very powerful.  I just shaved my entire head last night with 2mm setting and 1mm on sides.  Looks terrific.  This takes practice by the way but since I was going for military look, it&#x27;s a bit easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lines that I got from this is precise.  I don&#x27;t even need a razor to get rid of the small hairs.  The angle of cutting is a bit tricky and requires practice.  I was a bit worry for a while because nothing was being cut so then I just went from 18mm to 2mm setting and oh yeh, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a downside in that it takes an hour to get a full charge and also charge does not last long, less than the 50 min it claims.  But trimmer works corded and cord is quite long so works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I basically never need to visit the barber shop again!  The trick is to keep trimming now and then because when hair is longer it gets much harder and messier to trim as it was for me last night.  No suction can suck hair that is too long, but trimming at short lengths, the vacuum works as expected and no mess at all which is really only reason that I go to barber shop - to avoid the cleaning.  For now the military look works for me but I&#x27;m pretty sure depending on creativity and practice, I can create better and cooler cuts which my barber can never do because he&#x27;s not me.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. If you are a beard beginner, don&#x27;t expect the in-shaving  comfort of a razor.</li>
            <li> Door for the vacuum broke within 3 moths. Vacuum does not work well.. not worth the $50. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Works mostly as advertised. Vacuum might not suck up every single hair, but gets most of them.</li>
            <li> I own the two previous models. And this one is a great improvement as I can finally trim my beard quickly and properly.</li>
            <li> My man was very pleased with his new trimmer, we were both surprised that this system also has a built in feature that vacuums as they trim.</li>
            <li> Newer models of this beard trimmer DO include the adjustable guide so you won&#x27;t be stabbing yourself as others have complained (note those reviews are always of older versions prior to 2014). BUT, the reason for my 2-star rating is simple, it doesn&#x27;t retain it&#x27;s ability to cut for more than 1 month. I simply went dull and I found myself needing to go over the same area repeatedly, and then it seemed to not cut at all. Also, the lowest level you can cut appears to be around 3mm which while short for a beard is really long for a stubble sort of look.Also, I found that a significant amount of hair never ended up sucked up by the vacuum and would just end up on a counter anyway.    I&#x27;d love some recommendations to try as an alternative to this!</li>
            <li> I purchased to replace a T980 I left in a hotel in Nashville... big mistake. The T980 was a great device and I had zero complaints. The OT4070 is decent and using the optional black trimming head attachment (included) achieves similar results. The stock grey head attachment that came in the original packaging is worthless. I think the majority of the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; reviews came from people trying the OT4070 with the grey attachment. The T980 cut more consistently but the OT4070 definitely does a more than adequate job. The only  negative is the vacuum. The T980 vacuum worked perfectly... rarely leaving any shavings on the counter top. The OT4070 appears to leave about 30% shavings on the counter. Not bad but not very good. Otherwise the OT4070 serves its purpose. Norelco should reissue the T980 or make a better replacement.</li>
            <li> This  trimmer is just perfect, it&#x27;s works really really good and you are never going to be a mess when you use it!</li>
            <li> Really impressed with this and I love the vacuum, it&#x27;s not flawless but it makes clean-up much quicker when I trim the beard.</li>
            <li> Most of the hairs found their way into the chamber and so were easy to dispose. Height setting was so-so.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t understand the idea behind each cone.. One of them did a too short trimming than I set it to, but on the second cone it was decent, but it didn&#x27;t feel like it was cutting right with this cone, maybe because of the vaccuum, which by the way, does a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I&#x27;m a bit disapointed, but maybe I&#x27;m just an idiot that doesn&#x27;t know how to use the product right.</li>
            <li> Does not trim as short as my other trimmer</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this trimmer. It is easy to adjust the lengths, and it does a great job of trimming. The vacuum part works pretty much as well as can be expected. The battery life has been really good, too. I like the lock feature for travel, so I don&#x27;t have to bring the charger on trips.</li>
            <li> Decent product.  Not impressed with design.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would give me a good tight trim, and this wasn&#x27;t it. The vacuum feature did help with cleanup, but the trimmer didn&#x27;t cut close, and took quite a while to actually do the job. When I tried Turbo mode, that helped, but it still wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. Perhaps if you&#x27;re trimming a full beard, then this will work. For what I wanted, it didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight trimmer. The hair vacuum works great. Does not trim as short as I expected.</li>
            <li> Was a good trimmer for a couple of years and then stopped working a month after the warranty expired. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying a Phillips again.</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco trimmer, purchased due to the quality of the previous 2.  This one seems to have the same high quality.  Design seems well thought out with one exception.  It gets a bit tricky to use around the lips due to the large opening for the cutter.</li>
            <li> I ordered the QT 4070 trimmer after having read reviews that it now comes with both blades and it is a great product.  I received the trimmer, however with only the one blade that is poorly designed.  The product still works adequately, however I probably would not have spent as much money if I hadn&#x27;t thought i&#x27;d get both blades.  The one it comes with is uncomfortable.  I called as recommended and after a relatively short wait and easy conversation was told the replacement blade would be in the mail and I would have it in 5-7 business days.  It has now been three weeks.  I called today and was told it is on back order.  You&#x27;ll get it when it comes in.  I asked when it would come in and was informed that they have no idea.  Perhaps this is a problem and so they are tired of these calls, but she didn&#x27;t apologize or act like it was any inconvenience to me.  In fact I was made to feel that I was an inconvenience to her.&lt;br /&gt;It is still a decent razor.  It shaves evenly although with discomfort mostly near the mouth region due to the blade.  The vacuum is a cool idea and feature, however it only sucks up about 70% of the hair, saving you minimal time in cleanup.  I will say it is better than not having it (but you pay for it).  It is frustrating that many are receiving the product with both blades as I&#x27;ve seen photos on boxes and how I expected mine to come.  Yet some of us are stuck calling and waiting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely rate better once I receive and can use the missing the piece.</li>
            <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;1. You can plug it in if the battery runs out mid-trim and get the job finished, something that cannot be done with all brands of cordless trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;1. The combs are very flexible, so if you press it against your face, the teeth will flex and you will end up with a much shorter beard that you had intended. To make it worse, parts of your beard will be shorter and parts longer if you don&#x27;t apply exactly the same pressure against your face everywhere. I ended up with random divots in my beard after the first use. The solution is to always use a light touch, but really? The teeth could not be made out of firmer plastic, or shaped so they will not flex so easily? This is a ridiculous design flaw, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you remove the comb for edging your beard or mustache, the vacuum intake blocks your view of the end of the blade (in the mirror), so there&#x27;s no way to know where you are cutting.&lt;br /&gt;3. On my beard, the vacuum is marginally effective, even at high setting. There&#x27;s still a mess on the sink counter top when I&#x27;m done and then I have to clean out the vacuum too. It&#x27;s a gimmick that just wastes battery charge time.</li>
            <li> Bad trimmer just fancy case but does not improve performance in comparison with my 10 yr old norelco...very dissapoointed from this purchase</li>
            <li> i opened it for the first time and found it doesn&#x27;t work just after i flew back to China last month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend likes me scruffy. I couldn&#x27;t care less, so I wanted a fool-proof easy solution. It&#x27;s rechargeable, super simple to use and never pulls or snags on my beard. The vacuum feature is helpful and catches almost all the clippings, but I still stand in my dry shower and use it before I turn on the water so I don&#x27;t get bits of hair everywhere. This is NOT waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re supposed to keep it plugged in, so sometimes I reach for it and it needs a charge. In about 5-10 minutes, I have enough juice for one thorough trimming.</li>
            <li> This is the worst and most impractical trimmer I have ever owned. Difficult to clean. It&#x27;s digital gauge started showing the wrong reading after the trimmer got wet. Opening the vacuum box is a messy business with hair flying all around. The charger was unimpressive. Two thumbs down.</li>
            <li> A replacement for my 5 year old version.  Gussied up a bit with &amp;#34;digital&amp;#34; readout, instead of small printed numbers in a window,  but other than that pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;Does exactly what I want,  holds a charge for a good long time.  Highly recommend to guys who want to keep their beard in shape or who want to maintain  that 3 day old scuzz look.</li>
            <li> Multiple settings and interchangeable heads along with a hair reservoir makes it a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it could trim right under my nose. Overall it&#x27;s a nice trimmer and holds charge for about 2 weeks when I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> It hardly worked for one month. I used it for hardly 5 times, now its completely not turned off. I have wasted 50$ on it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is nice and the lithium battery lasts for a long time. The only thing I would say is that if you have thick facial hair still expect the mess from shaving. I have a plug in of a similar shaver/beard trimmer that has a vacuum that is much better at maintaining the mess. This shaver is nice but not great if you were looking to have a shaver that has a quality vacuum feature. Nonetheless the led length indicator is really cool and it does work well. Yet if you have a fierce man beard this will cut it, it just won&#x27;t catch much of it in the little vacuum deal it&#x27;s got.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband and he loves it.  Works really well.</li>
            <li> Good Product. I like a very close beard which this product does easily. Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome!  My only complaint is that I had to replace an older one (same model) because the latch on the little vacuum chamber door broke, and the trimmer shuts off when it opens. Until I replaced that one, I didn&#x27;t realize the batteries are lithium ion.  No wonder I never seem to need a recharge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. One must go over the hair numerous times in order to get even results.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a few months now. . no complaints so far. It does what it should, love that it collects the hair and it holds a charge for quite a while.</li>
            <li> While OK, I found it to be cheaply made based on the price I paid.  The plastic roller for changing the height was flimsy at best.  It seems so far to work fine, but hard to get the beard uniform in length.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good and it&#x27;s very usefull.</li>
            <li> Its bulkier than my last trimmer  I still have to use another trimmer for the strai9ght lines as this trimmer is really wide.  The vacuum feature is nice and collects most of the hair.  The best part for me is that I don&#x27;t have to find and change combs all the time to trim up my beard.  Though I do have to get out my other smaller trimmer once a week to get the spots that require a smaller blade.  Not an all in wonder as I hoped but I do like it.  Wish the battery lasted longer than 4 days of use.</li>
            <li> First off, my original prime order, was not marked as delivered until the third day, in which it never actually arrived. I called amazon, bam, told me they would follow up with me the next day, they did and the very next day i had the slightly newer model delivered to me. This trimmer works great. It has 18 settings so i will be using this for my haircuts as well. The turbo button is a plus when needed. The vacuum works ok, better when the cut settings are low because it allows more hair to fall into the vacuum opening. over all great product. Oh and also it actually is not as bulky as it looks, fits very nicely in hand, and pretty light.</li>
            <li> This product was great for the first 8 months or so that I had it. Now, eight months later, the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp and the door to the &#x27;hair catcher compartment&#x27; is broken and opens up which messes up the vacuum aspect and gets hair everywhere. It&#x27;s a decent product, but be prepared to replace it near a year in.</li>
            <li> DOES ITS INTENDED USE VERY WELL...WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE, EVE A CLUTZ LIKE I AM CAN DO WONDERS WITH THIS EASY TO USE DEVICE.</li>
            <li> The trimmer I received was non-functional when received (DoA).  I contacted Philips and they immediately expedited a new one to me.  The new one works great.  Excellent product (once I had one that worked).</li>
            <li> This trimmer performs well at all settings, the battery maintains charge well, and the vacuum feature works way better than expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works as described. The vacuum is an excellent feature that completely eliminates the mess I had to deal with while trimming my beard and mustache with an older trimmer. I would highly recommend this to other buyers.</li>
            <li> I waited to get this on special and finally got it at a great price with free shipping. It only took 2 days to get here and I immediately put it to work on my harsh beard. It&#x27;s easy to set the shaver for the right length and it stays locked while shaving. The unit felt a little &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; which surprised me because most of Phillips&#x27;s razors are heavy. it gave me the feeling that it was a cheap product. I&#x27;ve purchased worse, however, which is why I decided to splurge on a beard trimmer I felt lived up to it&#x27;s name. I really like this product and feel it does a fine job. And the little vacuum feature is a great plus! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a beard trimmer and it lives up to expectations. I am able to find a setting that keeps my beard well trimmed and at a level that I am comfortable with. The vacuum feature is great. I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these ... the first one lasted over 5 years.  I use it hard and it works great.  Easy to use, no mess.  The vacuum works but isn&#x27;t perfect.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands costing much more and they have too many attachments to deal with.  This trimmer has everything you need in one.</li>
            <li> Very nice and the charge stays for a long time. The vacuum does not make it really &amp;#34;mess-free&amp;#34; but it just makes it produce &amp;#34;less mess&amp;#34;. The vacuum definitely catches some trimmed hairs but there are many that are not caught and you still have to clean the sink after you&#x27;re done. The turbo mode is a nice feature but it is also very noisy so I don&#x27;t really use it much.</li>
            <li> Some guys in here really know their stuff about these, so read their reviews for more technical details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I was just looking for something basic to trim a beard back down to shave it off, or to trim sideburns. For those purposes, this was a huge advance over the 10yr/old model I&#x27;d been using. The vacuum feature is what convinced me to go for this one over the one with titanium blades (or whatever), and I&#x27;m really glad I did. Seems like this will save a lot of clogged drains. The blades do a fine job, and by the time they wear out I&#x27;ll just replace the shaver or get a new set (I think I read they can be replaced). The light up numbers are kinda gimmicky, but are sorta nice. And the battery is lasting forever. This combined with the D-Finer Precision Trimmer, and I effectively spent $50 more than planned, but feel like a pro. Trade-offs...</li>
            <li> Died after 8 months, will try to get it repaired through warranty but not hope full.  It was a gift to my son and he liked it while it worked, he liked it enough he wants another one. For $50 I would expect the product to last longer, esp since it was just used to trim a beard once a week.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time and charges fast.  The vacuum feature prevents hair from getting everywhere.  It adjusts to the millimeter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great choice.</li>
            <li> This trimmer performs as expected.  The vacuum built in is handy in keeping MOST of the fine stubble from getting on the counter.  My only two problems are this:  One:  The size is somewhat large for a beard trimmer.  This makes it difficult for getting places like just under the nose.  Not impossibly, but difficult.  This isn&#x27;t a deal breaker.  Two:  The first one I received had a weird issue related to power.  It would work perfectly for about 2 or 3 trims (5 minutes or less each time).  On the next one, it wouldn&#x27;t even power on.  It was as if the battery had drained 100% even though the prior use showed 100% power remaining.  I did an exchange though Amazon and the new one has worked perfectly.  I&#x27;ve charged it once and have used it 5 or 6 times and has 3 of 4 battery indicator bars remaining.  Update after 2 Years: I&#x27;ve had this unit now for almost 2 years.  It trims well and the guard(s) have help up very well.  I still enjoy the ability to adjust easily and that function still works great.  The big issue with this unit, for me, is the battery.  I still have weird battery issues with it.  One example is this past weekend (Christmas 2015) and traveling.  I had about 75% battery left and I decided to let it charge overnight to make sure it would last the 5 days I&#x27;d be on the road.  Well, I packed it but ended up not using it (hello Christmas beard).  When I got home, I went to shave and the unit said the battery was dead.  This is the problem I&#x27;ve always had:  something is either draining the battery or the electronics controlling it are messed up.  Also, recently, the plastic door over the vacuum compartment has failed.  The little clip has simply worn off so now I have to hold it closed with a rubber band.  I enjoy the ease of use with this trimmer, but the weird battery issues make it impossible to travel without packing the charger.</li>
            <li> Light weight. Easy to use. Great range of settings. Replaced older Norelco when I needed sharper blades and the catcher cup broke.</li>
            <li> Really good trimmer. However, the length is pretty &#x27;hit and miss&#x27;. Great trimmer though.</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking I was afraid to buy this trimmer after reading all the confusing reviews, but then I&#x27;ve decided to go for it and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a beard trimmer from braun that lasted for longer than I can remember, but the battery is dead and I was looking for more precise trimming settings, so I thought it&#x27;s time for a change. I took my trimmer out of the box (which btw comes with the contour following comb as well), plugged it in to charge while I read the user manual, and took it for a nice smooth drive.... The results?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vacum:&lt;br /&gt;It sucked 85% or even more. I wasn&#x27;t even interested in such feature, but using it I have to say that I am impressed... Please keep in mind that this vacum is put into such small size - you are not carrying the carpet hover in your hands :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;This thing gives you perfectly EVEN trim everywhere... this was a big issue for me with my old trimmer, and I am more than pleased with this trim... smooth, nice, and even :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contour Following Comb&lt;br /&gt;This is a great addition to your trimmer. I have used it around tricky places such as my neck, and it serves you good... you might need to choose a different trimming length than with the normal comb, especially if you hold your trimmer in a more angled way like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim Length Settings&lt;br /&gt;18 trimming settings that I think are fabulous, you can choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5..., 18 mm with 1mm difference between each setting... Preferably start with long length for the first use and go down step by step - they tell you to do so in the user manual but I was stupid to think it&#x27;s the same settings as my old trimmer, so I ended with shorter beard than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No Pouch?&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with a pouch?! seriously philips, charge me an additional 10$ for a decent quality pouch and I would be more than happy to pay for it... fortunately for me, it fits perfectly in my Braun pouch :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short... For the first time in my life, I had my beard professionally trimmed at the comfort of my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it without any hesitation ;)</li>
            <li> This piece of crap was a waste of my money.  If it gets wet, the trimming length displays the incorrect values.  It woke me up in the middle of the night at the hotel because it started to randomly turn on. I was tempted to throw it off the balcony from the 17th floor but I figured I&#x27;d give it one more chance.  Now this morning it just stopped working all together.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m no longer at the hotel so I can&#x27;t have the pleasure of throwing it from the 17th floor, so I&#x27;ll just have to run over it with my car.  DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> This was getting bashed with 1-star reviews because they weren&#x27;t shipping the contour comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it comes with it, so no complaints.  I doubt you actually need the turbo-boost, so it might be better to save and get the qt4050.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this because it says it can shave to half a millimeter, where the qt4050 can only go down to 1mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people are complaining it can&#x27;t catch their beard hairs.  I&#x27;m like ... seriously?  You think that trap was going to catch shavings over a quarter of an inch long?  The instruction book does explain if you want the vacuum to work you might have to go in two passes, so the shavings are small enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this frequently, so have short trimmings.  It catches almost all of my trimmings.  The trimmings that wind up in my sink are from cleaning them out of the vacuum section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it is virtually impossible to cut yourself with it.  There is a bigger gap at the sides of the bare guard.  I have a couple times managed to smash part of my lip into there, but it just stung for a split second, no bleeding.  So, you may want to be a little careful around your lips if you don&#x27;t have a comb on it.  Normal skin tissue cannot fit into that gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor complaint:  It can&#x27;t charge quite as fast as it spends battery power.  Meaning, it will have to be plugged in for a little longer than it takes you to shave to stay at full battery.  It usually barely doesn&#x27;t get charged all the way from the time it takes me to trim, then clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: It&#x27;s a Lithium-Ion battery, so you should keep it charged full at all times to preserve the battery life.</li>
            <li> Ok ima keep it short and sweet this is a must buy trimmer it has a ton of cutting lengths and captures most the clippings keeping the sink relatively clean works great and the battery last a long time.. and mine was packaged with both heads so if u do get a box without both just call and they will ship u one but it appears that they both are packaged now..</li>
            <li> I have had a beard my entire adult life and have had many trimmers.  My last one (which was a Remington vacuum) gave out on me and I read the reviews on this Norelco with some concern.  However, I have been using the QT4070 now for a couple of months and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month and I&#x27;m very impressed with both the quality and price that I paid for it.  Norelco products have managed to last me a long a while and sure have been reliable.</li>
            <li> The turbo setting allows for a nice clean cut that looks better than my cheaper trimmer.  Not cleaning the sink everyday is a big bonus.</li>
            <li> it is a good shaver but the plastic filter holder should be removable for proper cleaning, over the time the hair and skin dust will ge to the filter... overall is a good shaver/trimmer for a daily use...</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Does what it is supposed to do and does it well. I highly recommend this shaver/trimmer/groomer. You should definitely buy this item.</li>
            <li> very happy with this trimmer works very well i love the led light also very good buy cant go wrong with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many trimmers, razors, and shavers and this one seems to be the best one out there. As you&#x27;ve probably noticed by going through the reviews, the old reviews about the comb stabbing you is no longer an issue because they also provide the contour comb as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first when I started using it, I didn&#x27;t really like it. It seemed as though I had to do more work than I bargained for to get a nice even shave. I played around with the different settings and adjusted the length multiple times only to see that there were still a few rogue strands sticking out. However, after just setting it to the length I hoped would be correct, I just pushed in through the hair to the skin and let it fly and that seemed to do the trick. It seems with this trimmer that being afraid to make some minor mistake is not the way to go if you expect to have a nice even shave, and no you do not have to apply pressure, just let it trim the full length of hair up to your skin. So, with that being said, I will explain the pros and the cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easily switching trimming lengths&lt;br /&gt;I have a goatee and a full beard so I tend to trim them both down to different sizes, so switching easily to different lengths was a big deal for me. This shaver does that with no problem, simply slide the adjuster and keep shaving.&lt;br /&gt;- Turbo mode&lt;br /&gt;I guess this is a pro, as the few times that I have used it I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge improvement in the speed and efficiency of shaving seeing as the regular mode does the job just fine in a timely manor.&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life&lt;br /&gt;I charged it once I received it to full battery and haven&#x27;t charged it since and have been using it almost on a daily basis. (Have owned it for almost two months.)&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum is new to me. In general it&#x27;s great because before I had to deal with cleaning up a lot of hair in the sink and now the cleaning is very minimal. Depending on your beard size and how much you trim, you may have to do multiple empties of the hair trap.&lt;br /&gt;- Precision&lt;br /&gt;This is a major pro for me. If you use it correctly and know the right length to trim everything down to then this trimmer can be very accurate at giving you an even shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum&lt;br /&gt;The hole where the vaccum sucks in the air is somewhat small and can get clogged easily. If you&#x27;re letting your goatee/beard grow out and trim down a decent amount then expect to make many trips to clear out the hair trap and unclog the hole.&lt;br /&gt;- Sans Beard&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this is a trimmer and you can&#x27;t expect to be able to get a full clean shave out of it, but it gets it down to a fairly minimal amount of stubble to be able to easily shave it with a companion device. In hindsight, maybe I didn&#x27;t work at it enough to get a full clean shave as most of my shaves are early in the morning when i&#x27;m rushing out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great trimmer and I would recommend it to anyone who has a beard or goatee. It may take some getting used to until you get that perfect shave down, but once you do you&#x27;ll understand what you need to adjust for the future shaves.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. The vacuum design is a joke. clogs with hair in the first few seconds of use. I find I have to take it apart and clean 4 to 5 times every use. What a waste of money</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable over a wide range&lt;br /&gt;- Battery lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;- Trims without having to go over areas too many times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum system doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> As other users have said, it doesnt really catch most of the hair. It cuts pretty evenly with few strokes. But the fine trimming of lines is a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> the vacuum is great.  prevents a big mess of hair.  it comes with a &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; head which&#x27;s purpose  is not well explained</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd norelco beard trimmer.  QT4070 is a great trimmer with an improved adjustment dial for beard height.  Digital height read out is nice but unnecessary.  The older style norelco accuvac had a much better method for retaining trimmings via a removable basket and vacuumed up more of the trimmings.  This model is more difficult to clean out.  Battery lasts weeks without recharge.  I would buy this product again or consider 1 model up from this one.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good out of the box and I like all the levels of adjustments. The only bad thing that I have found is it takes a few minutes to clean the collection chamber.</li>
            <li> Awesome features, overall good quality, love the vacuum and digital display. But not so good for getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same pair of hair clippers for my head, beard, and body for 15 years, I can&#x27;t believe I never tried one of these. This guy even vacuums up the majority of my mess!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that due to the vacuum feature, when there is no guard, for example when your are trimming up the edges of your beard, it is difficult to see.  Overall this thing is a beast, time will tell it&#x27;s durability.</li>
            <li> A nice little beard trimmer.  I like that it sucks the hair trimmings into a little compartment instead of having them spray all over the place.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband and he loves it!  He can trim his beard easily and evenly in no time at all. Shipping time was great and it was in perfect shape when it arrived</li>
            <li> tried tons. this is the only one that get&#x27;s my beard to the right length. Not too long, but not looking like stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and I have to say I am quite happy with this Norelco, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and handles pretty well, I am sure this trimmer is going to last for years with proper use and storage, the only downside is that some times this trimmer left some untrimmed hairs on my beard, nothing that some good scissors can&#x27;t fix anyway.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer. Came with both combs. Adjusts easily to desired length, works well, follows chin contour, cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I have it.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. Easily adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t get into the top part of mustache, though, because I have a nose.&lt;br /&gt;If you do NOT have a nose, then there won&#x27;t be any problem getting to the top part of the mustache.</li>
            <li> Works great and cleans easily.  Husband used this and loves it.  He highly recommends it and it last for years.  This is his second one of these I have purchased for him.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer. It&#x27;s light weight and keeps the cut hair off your neck and shirt. No problems!</li>
            <li> when shaving, hair does not stay inside plastic container nor does it vaccum it like it says it does..got a color white with black and not blue and white like i orderd it..oh well</li>
            <li> This product is as good as always and even works better than the older model I replaced. A great trimmer and it never leaves any messes as it collects all the hair. The battery lasts a very long time with little need to charge. Great product!</li>
            <li> I gave this razor as a Christmas gift to my friend and he says it&#x27;s the best he has ever used and loves it. Says it vacuums up around 95% of the hair shaved.</li>
            <li> The worst trimmer I have ever had. I should charge it after each use. Vacuum also does not work well - I should still clean surrounding area. Do not waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Works fine for about 6 months, then the blades need replaced, but there are none available.  I actually had to replace the entire unit at $50, just because the blades were dull.  Now they are dull again, and I still can&#x27;t find replacements.  I am done buying these things every 6 months.  This product would get four stars if you could replace the blades.</li>
            <li> Its too new to know how good the batteries are and whether the trimmers will stay sharp for a long time.  It functions now just fine and I really like the vacuum.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very good and advanced... I am saying thanks to Amazon ... Because your reviews help me a lot.. I recommend to buy this product and you definitely enjoy with this.</li>
            <li> Ok Razor, door catch broke in a few days.</li>
            <li> I owned an earlier version of this trimmer which died after 8 years of service.  This newer model has more adjustment&lt;br /&gt;settings available and they lock into position.  The vacuum feature works a little better than the earlier model, but is a&lt;br /&gt;little more difficult to clean.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with the improvements.</li>
            <li> A nice trimmer but I find that I have to go over and over more times to get an even cut than with my old Norelco! I definitely like the vacuum feature as well as my &amp;#34;wife&amp;#34; who now doesn&#x27;t get nearly as upset when I trim my beard. Also, when I remove the trimmer shield for a close cut around the ears, the cutting edge does not extend all the way to the very end so it is difficult to use for this as I did with my old Norelco. The trimmer adjustment is in &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34;clicks now a days for that rough look and this is the definitely the trimmer for those guys. As for myself, I don&#x27;t necessarily need that fine of an adjustment but it is not a hindrance either. I also like the fact you can use it battery operated, which lasts a long time, or if you forget to charge it just plug it in. I have been using Philips Norelco for over 30 years, I wish I could add some old features into this new design and make one heck of a trimmer!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this trimmer.  The high speed option is nice when hitting those extra hairy areas.  My only complaint is that the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to keep a charge between uses.  If the battery had a longer shelf life I would definitely give it that fifth star.</li>
            <li> i had an older version of this about 4 years ago. it burned out so i got this one and this is a really nice upgrade. i would buy this again. very good quality .</li>
            <li> Great unit. Very uniform. ard to get close to your nose though. Otherwise I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer which certainly met my expectations, and the vacuum works well also!  Great adjustability for trimming length and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Description says it&#x27;s also mustache trimming.  This unit is only for beard and stubble.  However, it was easily returned, customer service is good.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. I&#x27;ve noticed people complain about &amp;#34;cutting their lip&amp;#34; I am truly baffled by this. Even with the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; guard, which in all fairness *does* look intimidating when all the way down, I still was unable to cut my lip or cut myself in any way. You would literally have to be &amp;#34;duck facing&amp;#34; while placing the trimmer vertically directly onto your lip. If you are doing this, put your trimmers (and certainly any razor you might own) away and lock them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;stubble guard&amp;#34; (gray) will give a scruffy look, which I personally prefer, and the contour comb guard will give a cleaner feel when grooming your face fur. The vacuum does an okay job but some facial/body hair will still escape and have to be cleaned up. Short of affixing a shop vac to your trimmers you will be hard pressed to find a pair that captures every shaved hair. These trimmers are great they charge super quick and last for a considerable amount of time on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of trimmers and these really are one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> It is good for alot of facial hair and you can trim your hair as you like it.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews, my 4070 came with the contour comb, which is very similar to the one that the T980 used.  Other than a smaller chamber for hair that requires emptying far more frequently, I am very pleased.  This device is doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant as some of the reviews I read were pretty polarizing, but I have not been disappointed.  I keep pretty short hair on my head and during work travels I even use this to give me a quick buzz if I feel like my hair is getting too long and it has worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my beard a bit longer than the hair on my head and the QT4070 allows me to quickly trim my my beard.  My only complaint which existed on the T980 is that I have a hard time trimming right under my nose, I have to remove the guard and carefully trim my moustache area right under my nose, but I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the T980, this will be a change, but I don&#x27;t think it will be as drastic as some reviewers have painted it, as long as you have the right guard, because the alternate guard is horrible.</li>
            <li> I like that it keeps the hair off my counter and he likes that it actually trims his beard successfully.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> My favorite trimmer ever.  Takes a little getting used to aiming for straight edges because of the extra space that the vacuum area encompasses, but you will figure it out.  Mine came with both heads included in the box and I definitely prefer the one that most people on here complain that theirs did not come with.  The main thing missing is a charging base to store it on and keep it charged.  It would be a 5 star with a base.</li>
            <li> I picked this up when my husband asked for a beard/mustache trimmer for his birthday. He&#x27;s always so worried about making a mess in the bathroom, so I thought this vacuum shaver would be a great idea. However, if you don&#x27;t shave everyday, the hairs start getting too heavy to be vacuumed properly, causing the vacuum feature to not be as awesome. Every day is just more than my husband is going to do, so I wish the vacuum was a little stronger. Other than that, the trimmer seems to work fine and my husband has not complained.</li>
            <li> Storage chamber for the hair is very small, other thatn that it is good to use and compact to store for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> Really like this product- I thought the vacuum was not going to work very but it works amazingly well.  I used to go outside to trim my beard with the other trimmer I had [was just a hair trimmer],  thought I would have to do the same with this one to keep from trying to clean up a bazillion little hairs in my bathroom sink, but the vacuum works very well and cleanup is very easy and quick at my sink, as it gets most of the hairs, but not every single one,  Also like the adjustment for length, it is very precise.</li>
            <li> I already own some older Norelco trimmers and they work great. I bought this trimmer specifically for the vacuum feature because cleaning the since up every time I trim is annoying.  When I trim the clippings are always less than a quarter inch, so long hairs do not explain why two thirds of the trimmed beard still ended up in the counter.  Don&#x27;t know if this was a defective trimmer but it did capture about a third of the mess. That&#x27;s not enough to make it worth the money though. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Cordless which is great.  Haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet so holds charge and stream line shape is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I find the product very good. I like the battery life indicator, the digital settings, etc. It does a good job of trimming and the built in vacuum is easy to dump. The only thing I dislike is that it indicated free shipping, but when I used the $5 discount coupon I got charged $6.95 for shipping. Not much of a discount coupon.</li>
            <li> I bought both this and the other &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; based shaver from Remington to test them side by side, and the Phillips wins by a mile.  Great readout of how long you have the clipper set to, the construction just feels sturdier than the Remington, it&#x27;s now in daily use for me.</li>
            <li> Pros: It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do; it did arrive with the second (\\&quot;Contour\\&quot;) trim head; the trimming blades are wide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Too many parts with flimsy construction; needs a small moustache comb; you are limited by few other similar products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears from many, many previous reviews that this trimmer had arrived with only  \\&quot;Stubble\\&quot; trimmer\\&quot;, and not the \\&quot;Contour\\&quot; trimmer.  As is the case with several more recent reviews, my trimmer was thankfully packaged with both (in fact, this was the first thing that I checked).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Norelco QT4070.  I got a good trim the first time I used it, as I was able to apply techniques learned from 10 years experience with the Wahl Trim-n-Vac (the only other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used).  The Norelco arrived with the \\&quot;Stubble\\&quot; trimmer already attached.  I don&#x27;t use this trimmer since I can&#x27;t figure out how it&#x27;s supposed to work.  It has a large gap in the combs across the front of the trimmer blades, which just looks like a disaster waiting to happen.  I immediately removed it and attached the \\&quot;Contour\\&quot; head, which is what I always use now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions state that you should use a moustache comb (or any fine-toothed comb) in preparation before using the trimmer, very good advice which I certainly always follow.  It&#x27;s just that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t come with one.  For the 50 bucks people pay for this thing, one might think Norelco could throw a small moustache comb into the box (fortunately, I retained the one that did come with the Wahl Trim-n-Vac).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very nice feature is that it can work with the cord - you don&#x27;t NEED to charge it.  It also does a very good job of vacuuming beard trimmings.  But one must remember: it will NOT catch every shard of trimmed hair - NO vacuum trimmer out there will!  You WILL still have to clean up afterwards.  Another nice feature is the wide trimming blades, which measure at least 1-1/4 inches.  The Wahl was only 1\\&quot; wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems I have are with flimsy parts.  First, as many reviewers have pointed out, the door holding the beard trimmings is very cheaply constructed.  Both the hinge and the small tab which keeps the door closed seem about to break at any moment.  A better design would be like the Wahl Trim-n-Vac, which used a removable cup to capture trimmings. No small pieces, no moving parts, no chance of failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, as many, MANY other reviewers have stated, the trim head combs are flexible and not rigid.  This means that someone can easily compress the comb, resulting in a trim SHORTER than that set on the unit!  Therefore, you MUST remember to be careful and NOT push too hard as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the \\&quot;Contour\\&quot; head has a weird, overly-complicated design.  It has a flat top which is a separate piece that pivots on a spring-loaded hinge.  This is supposed to move in order to stay in contact with your skin as you move the trimmer around your face, chin and jaw.  As with the other parts I&#x27;ve mentioned, the spring feels very weak and seems prone to break.  A far better design would have been a trim head NOT with a flat, movable top, but with a single-piece, CURVED top, negating the need for moving parts to maintain contact...again, JUST LIKE the Wahl Trim-n-Vac.  I suggest Googling it for pics to see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with the Norelco QT4070.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is provide an even trim for my beard.  It does vacuum much of the trimmings.  It has wide trim blades.  It can be used with or without the cord.  But I have many concerns regarding parts that are at the same time cheap &amp; over-engineered.  And Norelco really should provide the 15 Cent moustache comb its own instructions recommend people use with this product.  Lastly, anyone looking for a vacuum beard trimmer will be hard-pressed for other options, as there just aren&#x27;t that many vacuum trimmers out there.  After doing a lot of web-research, I figuredI&#x27;d take a chance with this one.  So far, it does well, but I do hope this trimmer lasts even a fraction of the 10 years my Wahl Trim-n-Vac lasted.</li>
            <li> This was given to my 37yo son for Christmas and he loves it. I have had one for about 10 years and love it, too.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco T765 stopped charging, so I bought this new model. The T765 was much better at cutting and it was much easier to pop the guard off. Also, the Money-Back Guarantee from Philips is complicated that requires you to chat or call them and then work through a series of emails. You also cover the cost of shipping it insured back to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Philips has not responded since Monday thus dishonoring their money-back guarantee. The great thing about Amazon is that they&#x27;re taking it back for free.</li>
            <li> I also was a huge fan of the older T980, which finally gave out on me after many years of reliable shaving and trimming.  After searching around I went with the QT4070, but am a bit disappointed.  My biggest complaint with the new model is that it does not have the sliding piece below the razors that the T980 had.  Without this, I find that I have to hold the trimmer at a very awkward angle to shave/trim my sideburns and other area.  Previously, the sliding piece would adjust to the angle of my skin and allow for a clean shave.  This model does not do that and I am struggling to find the best angle to obtain a clean shave.  I would not recommend this unit and am disappointed with Philips.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! I got tired of my husband old trimmer that didn&#x27;t really give him a clean look to his beard. I like that this has a built in vacuum. It doesn&#x27;t get all the little bits but I have to say that I&#x27;m cleaning less hairs than normal!</li>
            <li> If you have a beard, and your existing trimmers cant quite get it 100% even,&lt;br /&gt;get this. there is 99% no mess! adjustments are VERY easy, and quick.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about getting this, stop thinking. Buy it</li>
            <li> It is a pretty reasonable trimmer i found. I heard it from my friend and bought it and never regretted the decision.</li>
            <li> Not bad as long as the hair is not too long. The vacuum actually works pretty well. You will need to shave a couple times a week or more to maintain the desired length.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  It catches the hair for you.  It doesn&#x27;t pinch or cut you.  I would buy this again and certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> two stars symply because of speedy delivery and the fact that it actuall works. I&#x27;m not happy with the design. i get a better look with my symple T shaped trimmer made by Andis.</li>
            <li> So let me preface this by saying I&#x27;m a big Norelco fan. I have a 12+ year old norelco shaver (from my pre-beard years) that I still use occasionally and a 5+ year old norelco beard trimmer that&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;as this beard trimmer was meant to replace the existing basic beard trimmer I already have, I&#x27;ll compare this new model to it. note that unit is very basic and probably cost $15 new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I like the battery indicator, so I can easily see if I have enough batter for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;After a 20+ minute marathon trimming where I slowly stepped down the length setting, the battery indicator barely seemed to go down.&lt;br /&gt;the trim length dial was convenient and easy to use, and having the digital length value was a plus, but this was only mildly better than the manual adjustment I have on my existing trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;while I know some people said their battery stopped holding a charge, I of course didn&#x27;t have time to test this in a short time, but the idea of having a lithion ion battery and not having to worry about leaving it on the charger between uses is a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum, and this sadly is a big one, as it was really the only reason I wanted to replace my existing working unit. with this new one. It&#x27;s pretty much a long affair in the shower with my current trimmer, as my stubble just goes everywhere and normally covers the entire bathroom. so it&#x27;s messy and requires a shower right after. while the vacuum on this new trimmer works, in both turbo and non-turbo mode, as someone else mentioned in their review it only really sucks up about 50% of the hair. there was still way too much stubble all over the sink. a little i could handle, but 50% ( and I think that&#x27;s a generous number), it&#x27;s just not worth the premium for this trimmer over the basic one I have. not sure if it&#x27;s due to my bristle beard type or what, but it just didn&#x27;t work well enough.&lt;br /&gt;The new trimmer is about 1&amp;#34; longer than my existing unit, and definitely thicker. I guess that&#x27;s needed for the vacuum, and could be overlooked if the vacuum worked better.&lt;br /&gt;My existing trimmer came with a simple stand and several additional attachments, like a nose hair trimmer. sure I&#x27;ve not used it, but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s there in case of a freak nose hair attack. the new unit came with none of this, so was a little disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s louder than my existing unit. not terrible, and like the size thing, could be overlooked if the vacuum worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, without the vacuum working better, it was just not worth keeping and had to go back. as mentioned earlier, I&#x27;m still a big fan of Norelco, but this one was just a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a similar Norelco beard trimmer.  After using this about a month, I like it.  It replaces the dial to set the length with a digital setting which works well enough.  So far, this one seems to do a better job of capturing the hair trimmings.</li>
            <li> Bought this when my last Philips Norelco trimmer bit the dust after 15-20 years of use and I expect this one will last just as long, Norelco products are build very well and I will stick to this brand. One thing I have to bring up, I did like the old fashion style AC plug and cord on the old one better, this new one has a huge plug that does not plug into the wall socket with the ornamental outlet cover in my bathroom and the cord is cheap.</li>
            <li> My older similar model lasted about 8 years.  Very pleased with this new one.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t rip my skin like other similar products.Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought it last year and did quite a few trimming since then. There were good reviews on it, but a lot of bad ones also, so I wasn&#x27;t sure in that buy at all. Now I can say I did the right thing. It does a nice job on my beard and mustaches. One of the reason I didn&#x27;t experience bad effects could be that I trim shortly (second from the min)  and I press the trimmer to my face until I stop hearing the screeching sound of hair being cut. I can&#x27;t praise enough the vacuuming feature of that trimmer - just love it that I don&#x27;t have to clean much after it. The charge holds for a pretty long time and when it eventually withers connect it to the outlet and finish what you started. Some trimmers require you to charge first. I even shaved the whole head with it once just for curiosity and the result were pretty good. My wife asked why would I let my barber cut my hair that short - didn&#x27;t recognize the rookie job of mine  Nice trimmer for what I need to do and if your requirements are similar you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst item I&#x27;ve ever bought in my entire life. I often don&#x27;t post reviews, but this was so bad I had to. It doesn&#x27;t do anything it should. It doesn&#x27;t trim hair properly - it makes patches. The function to tell you what setting your on broke. The hair catcher doesn&#x27;t catch hair. It doesn&#x27;t charge. Its actually amazing how awful the product is - it fails in every way miserably. I never would&#x27;ve believe something from a legit company could be so bad.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard looking fresh, powerful motor and totally awesome</li>
            <li> Works well.  Excellent battery life.</li>
            <li> Great Beard trimmer when you get Norelco to send you the correct comb. From what I have read it has begun to be shipped with the better comb in box. Whether your using this on standard or turbo this trimmer works well and I enjoy the fact that it catches a lot of the hair (not all, but hey nothing is perfect). The many settings for hair length work great as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality beard trimmer. It might be a little bit more expensive than a normal one you can get, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum sucks up most of the stray hairs from shaving, which is my favorite feature of this model.</li>
            <li> Happy with it, is charged use after use, does what it says (no more hair on bathroom counter from trimming beard/mustache).  Quiet operation.  A good buy.  The only reason not getting 5 stars is you can&#x27;t turn off the vacuum operation to trim hair around ears.</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I have ever had. You can really control the length pretty good, better than most trimmers with different attachments. It&#x27;s fast so it never gets tangled even on long hair.</li>
            <li> I had a Nore3lco beard trimmer before I bought this one. The feature I like is the hair collector, which collects the trimmed hair in a container right below the cutter so almost no cuttings end up in a wash basin or the floor. The cutter works very well,. never had a problem. However, the trimmer motor is somewhat loud so Norelco should do something about this.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer. It does an excellent job of grooming. The adjuster to set the height is easy to use and the different heads come off easy to clean the unit. Charging is simple - the device will power off once it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found 1 Con with this trimmer. The compartment that holds the trimmings breaks easily. There is a tiny plastic piece that holds this door shut, that piece broke. This hasn&#x27;t caused any issues with it&#x27;s performance. It has just caused me to be careful not to allow the door to open up when in use.</li>
            <li> The Norelco QT 4070 reminds me of a unit I owned years ago that went off the market and I could not locate again. A simple setting of the dial to the length I want my beard to be, then run over the beard several times from different directions and boom, its cut neat and to the desired length.  Yes it is not a great mustache trimmer due to its bulk, Norelco makes one of those for less than $10, that is small, lightweight, and easy to trim the mustache with.  A solid value, easy to empty hair trimmings cups, with oh so much less hair falling into the sink than before.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend back in December and he still hasn&#x27;t needed to recharge it (it&#x27;s March).  He uses it probably once a week.  The clean up is so much easier and it cuts much better than his old one, which he says used to grab and pull at the hair sometimes, so he had to go slower with it. He says it&#x27;s the best trimmer he&#x27;s ever had!</li>
            <li> This is not a product I would recommend to others.  I wish the product designers/engineers would live with their &amp;#34;achievements&amp;#34; before vomiting them so readily onto the marketplace.</li>
            <li> the trimmer works great......just wished it had 1 shorter trimming level....the vacuum option makes  for easy beard and hair disposal................but still well worth the buy!!!</li>
            <li> Lives up to the quality reviews already on here! Far more powerful than other trimmers I have tried. The vacuum is a bit of a gimmick but if you don&#x27;t like it just don&#x27;t use that option!</li>
            <li> My last Norelco trimmer died and I purchased the QT4070 and it is better than the older model I had.</li>
            <li> Vacuum function works as promised. Lots of flexibility in cutting length. I use the 2mm setting for short/stubble beard. However, I ended up keeping my old razor for trimming sharp edges. The vacuum protrudes slightly which makes it hard to get a clean sharp line on the edges.</li>
            <li> Working for me very well so far, holds a charge great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband after his last one broke. He uses it all the time and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It&#x27;s a great quality for the price. He said it&#x27;s easy to use and cuts really well. The vacuum is a life saver. :)</li>
            <li> Great trimmer well worth the price, would certainly buy again...</li>
            <li> Works fine. Difficult to find a beard trimmer with the vacuum feature. Wife agreed to pay half to keep the sink clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it he told me that he hardly feels the blades going through his hair and there is no tugging at all he has very very very thick hair and a lot of it! And so this has helped him out quite a bit.  Also, I generally clean the bathroom and the vacuum that the shaver has sucks up a lot of the trimmed hair which helps me out tremendously😉</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is my newest best friend. I got it, plugged it in, charged it for an hour, and proceded to get the most comfortable beard trim in my 30 years of wearing one. I had absolutely none of the problems that so many others have reported on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scissors are history.  Thank you Norelco!</li>
            <li> I originally had purchased the 4050 version of this razor, but it did not cut close enough for me due to the flexible guard design (I know that most people prefer this). Therefore, I ordered the 4070 version and keep a close stubble beard using the lowest setting. I have had it for about a year and have never cut or nicked myself. Vacuum works great and I love the travel lock feature for when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for keeping a short beard or stubble, not sure how it would work for longer beards (which is why it appears people prefer the flexible guard design of the 4050).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for the trimming that I want. I like keeping the length of my facial hair to about 4-5 mm and this trimmer does that job perfectly. The vaccume  on it works good but there&#x27;s, obviously, going to be some fall out. The only drawback of this product is that when comes to mustache trimming, it&#x27;s hard to get an even trim throughout, but  by changing the length and being just a little more careful, you can achieve that too.</li>
            <li> Good product. Does what it should and does it well. I enjoy using it regularly and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This model replaces its predecessor from 2005 which eventually croaked - dead batteries and sluggish trimming (both attributed to long usage).  The new one is &#x27;space aged&#x27; compared to the 2005 model and clearly retains the attributes of a good product.</li>
            <li> Follow up:  Battery only lasted 10 months.  Has to be used while plugged in now.  Comes with a 24 month warranty.  100% died on 25th month.  Nothing you can fix or replace on it.  It&#x27;s a 50$ throw away.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality from a big vendor. The hair compartment lid broke in the second week of use and now it does now close firmly. I&#x27;m really frustrated and mad at these amateurs who wasted my money and my time. Also, the digital indicator for the cut length some times shows larger values than the actual. The minimum length corresponds to value 2 or 3 sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Never again Philips products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Now the battery lasts only for one use pretty much. If you plan to travel, remember to take the charger with you because Philips does not know what long lasting battery is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan. I read some of the negative reviews, but you know what? Don&#x27;t know what those people were talking about. I&#x27;ve got a modest beard going on, and this trimmer (with the adjustable guard) fits the bill. The vacuuming isn&#x27;t 100%, but it gets a LOT of what would fall off otherwise. So my sink is only marginally dirty when I finish trimming. I like the display that shows the length (although it&#x27;s in mm and I&#x27;m solidly on Imperial units). I don&#x27;t really use the super turbo mode (I guess if you have a REALLY burly beard?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this little razor, use it at home or on the road.</li>
            <li> The vacuum system makes it hard to use the blades as an edger around your beard and/or sideburns. But the vacuum works great and it shaves very well.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great.  I use the 3mm setting and I get a very even trim.  The vacuum works great letting very few whiskers fall into the sink.  A single battery charge will last me a couple of months using it twice a week.  The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t trim other areas very close with the depth guard removed.  I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Terrific trimmer. Vacuum really works trapping hairs. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and have been very impressed... worth every penny</li>
            <li> This is a VERY nice product, i was looking for a compatible replacement that will help me clean up after i shave with the my edger. works well on African american hair too, very close shave. clean and very smooth when done. Feels like you used a razor! great for the man who does his own beard.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love the QT4070.  My wife is always getting on to me when I shave and leave little hairs everywhere.  Unfortunately I ordered this Jan 5th.  And by March 25th it was no longer working.  The Amazon return window ended on Feb 8th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue is the battery will not charge.  I plug it in.  It appears to charge. I will check on it multiple times before going to bed.  In the morning I unplug and it gives the red icon that the battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 2 stars since I can use it with the cord.</li>
            <li> Makes the task of shaving much easier then getting out the cream and the Gillette. The vacuum is my favorite feature I can shave in my big mirror in my bedroom even in my car when I am late for work. I&#x27;d say it catches all but 5%-10% of the hair, holds a charge for a long time. Very comfortable shaver I haven&#x27;t cut myself at all since I bought it. Great Product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now so I guess I can make an objective review on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I love this trimmer, but it&#x27;s not without its flaws. I have a messy beard so I like to trim it without paying too much attention to detail. Overall, I like the messy look of a short trimmed beard and the QT4070 nails it on this regard. It is, however, a nightmare for those who are looking for a product capable of doing intricate beard designs and so on. This is a kind of messy look / on the go product. Oftentimes you&#x27;ll want to finish the trimming with a simple razor, maybe to get some hairs on the cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design is hit and miss. Philips didn&#x27;t use to provide the QT4070 with the contour-following comb, but this is no longer a problem, so kudos for them. This comb feels very comfortable on your face and it is the only one you&#x27;ll ever need (the other one is garbage), but you&#x27;ll need to remove it later on if you want to get to those hard to reach places, like under your nose. I found myself using the comb on the lowest millimeter setting and finishing my entire beard after removing it just to be safe. It is, again, not a very precise product, but this method works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the vaccuum system, It does its job capturing about 90% of the hair inside the handle. But the little plastic \\&quot;door\\&quot; which houses the captured hair is very cheap and it&#x27;ll become loose overtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much everything else works as expected. I love the battery life and the fact that it is maintenance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that will leave you with that messy 3 o&#x27;clock look, this is the product for you. However, for anything more than that, it is pretty much worthless. Luckily it is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves his trimmer and really enjoys it. It was a great purchase and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the many features provided by this efficient and easy to use and clean beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Philips Norelco&#x27;s older vacuum model, which could not do a stubble beard.  I&#x27;ve tried the Cruzer 6, which did not cut well nor did it have enough precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing has the precision, can handle a stubble beard, cuts amazingly well so I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times, and the vacuum feature makes it so I don&#x27;t make a mess all over the sink when I trim.  Plus, it&#x27;s very easy to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and of course the 1 hour charge is super convenient and the digital display that shows the cut length is very easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job, Norelco!</li>
            <li> Very good product, very easy to use and great results. It is very clean and charges very quickly. Recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> It works well. The adjustment is easy, no separate heads to deal with. The vacuum works, and is easy to clean. It charges quickly and seems to hold the charge well. The unit costs more than some of the others, but what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> After reading all the negative reviews here on Amazon for this Phillips 4070 (cut lip after cut lip!), I was hesitant...? Many seemed dated a little older, and aimed specifically around the stubble comb attachment (newer reviews mention the dual combs now included and no problems).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the new positive reviews from the last 6 montys,  I too have found the effects of this razor very nice, and it&#x27;s easy to use! A tad on the cheap plastic-ee side (but what isn&#x27;t nowadays), but unit and parts are tight when assembled gently and work very well for an under $50 clipper. The digital display for the length selected and the current charge leaves no doubt about current status. I have been wanting a razor for a shorter stubble beard, but since I am light BLOND, it needs to be a little longer to give the same effect many guys with darker hair can have with even a single day&#x27;s shadow. I need around 4mm, and this 4070 make this a breeze to keep my blond shadow beard at the current perfect length (and if I get fickle and want it longer, a few clicks of a dial and I am there, and with digital length confirmation to boot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature works great, and keeps things nice and neat. The cut hair storage compartment opens easily, making throwing out the hair a breeze (though the enclosed brush or a Q-tip make it much easier and thorough). Taking the clipper apart to clean the cutting mechanism is also very easy to do (not so with many other under $100 clippers!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the negative gripes were about the stubble comb, but I have used both the stubble and the curving comb, and both work fine, though I prefer the stubble comb with my shorter beard. I don&#x27;t think I could cut my lip if I tried...!</li>
            <li> I like everything about this trimmer!  It has more settings for beard length so I find that perfect area instead of being too much or too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacume works great and I don&#x27;t even have to use the turbo switch for it to vacume the clippings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trim my beard and there is no hair around the sink!  I love this trimmer and I am so glad I got it!</li>
            <li> Beware buyers of this item in Amazon.  The description says it&#x27;s a mustache trimmer, but it&#x27;s not.  Even though Amazon&#x27;s description of this product boasts a mustache trimmer, there is no mustache trimmer attachments and the product description on the package says nothing about mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> I had owned a beard trimmer before which I had used for 15 Years.  It does everything I wanted it to and more.  My wife commented that my beard never looked so good.</li>
            <li> good product based on paid value..</li>
            <li> I have a goatee and this trimmer has been great since day one.  I rarely charge it and it keeps going on.  It&#x27;s very portable and fits quite nicely with the rest of my stuff when I am traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it, have not found a single fault.</li>
            <li> To start off, I HATE trimming my beard. Clean up is the reason that I hate trimming my beard. The trimmings are always too much to simply wash down the sink. When a friend told me that he has a vacuum trimmer that actually works, I was intrigued. When I searched online and saw the relatively low price, I was ready to purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some older reviews say that you get one trimmer guard that pokes and causes un-even trimming, but rest assured, that is not the case any longer. There are two guards, and I personally use the spring loaded one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me:&lt;br /&gt;- I do have a full beard 365 days a year, so I trim my beard often.&lt;br /&gt;- I trim my beard 1-2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;- I have a coarse beard&lt;br /&gt;- I use guard setting 3, which is fairly short.&lt;br /&gt;- I am not sure how it works on hair other than facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort:&lt;br /&gt;- I find that the trim is comfortable&lt;br /&gt;- There is no hair pulling like some other trimmers that I have used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim:&lt;br /&gt;- I have professional hair clippers that I used to use, and I feel that they did a better job, but that is an unfair comparison&lt;br /&gt;- The trim head is wide enough that trims do not take a super long time&lt;br /&gt;- I have noticed that I have to make 2-3 passes around my jaw line. I hope this will get better as I learn to use it differently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up (the best part):&lt;br /&gt;- If you expect to not have to clean up any hair, this is not the product for you&lt;br /&gt;- The vacuum picks up between 80-90 percent of my weekly trims, which is impressive&lt;br /&gt;- Clean up has now been reduced to simply washing the missed trimmings down the sink, and dumping the trimming compartment&lt;br /&gt;- The trimming compartment fills up with one shave, so some people may need to empty the compartment more than once in a shave&lt;br /&gt;- I do not use the turbo mode, which could catch more hair, I am not sure&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning brush that is included is one of the best ones that I have used. There is a firm side and a lessfirm side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging:&lt;br /&gt;- I have shaved 8 times so far, and it still has over half of a charge&lt;br /&gt;- If you travel outside the US often, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about charging this unless you are gone for more than 2 months or trim more than 1-2 times a week. (but you probably have a converter anyway ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who needs to trim hair often.</li>
            <li> The popular Philips Norelco did not even last a year. Constantly charging it before every use. would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> first off the trimmer does a good job and the vacuum feature is pretty cool. it doesn&#x27;t catch every single hair so you&#x27;ll still have some hairs in the sink/on the counter but it is significantly less than the all the other trimmers that don&#x27;t have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as the actual trimming, while it does an overall good job, I found it difficult to get to the moustache hairs under my nose and the beard hairs close to my ears. I&#x27;m not a hairy sasquatch you understand, but rather the trimmer head is a bit bulky and I found not as effective in reaching &amp; trimming these &#x27;nook &amp; cranny&#x27; type areas of my face. I ended up trading it in for this one which while lacking the vacuum feature I have found more adept at getting to these hard to reach areas. http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ARF44O6/ref&#x3D;nosim/6688506-rg1112-0020-20?s&#x3D;merchant</li>
            <li> I love this beard trimmer - cordless, charges quickly, and even has an electronic lock for traveling so you don&#x27;t *need* to bring your charger. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the hair clippings door: the door clips shut with a tiny stub of plastic so packing the trimmer in a suitcase or quickly closing the door can snap off the plastic leaving it free to open while in use or storage. This was the SAME design complaint I had on my previous one from 8 years ago. Sad to see Norelco hasn&#x27;t changed the design, otherwise it&#x27;s a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works ok. Still lets hair fall. Does not trim soft hair very well.</li>
            <li> it did what i needed it to do</li>
            <li> My husband has full beard and mustache and loved it!</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum. My old trimmer made a huge mess in the sink every time I used it. That said, it also cut way better and more consistently. This does a decent job, but I was looking for more of a stubble trimmer. This is not that.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make a 0&amp;#34; on my face hare</li>
            <li> The battery on this thing is freakin amazing, I never do reviews but had to submit a review just because of the battery. I bought this months ago and I&#x27;ve only charged it like twice and I use it all the time. This battery could probably power a Tesla for a day. Other than that it&#x27;s okay, for a beard trimmer it has way to many length settings. It goes up to like 16 but you only need the first 3 for a stubble 2 is too short and 3 is too long they should make it more adjustable. The vacuum works okay, you&#x27;ll still find hair in the sink.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer. The vacuum is not 100% effective and hair still gets all over the place. The guard locks in place at whatever length you desire, this is great to avoid slippage and surprisingly not standard with all trimmers.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo230YS073I4DNL]]The Norelco Beard Trimmer provides men the ability to maintain clean facial hair whether it&#x27;s a stubble, goatee, or full beard.  The precision of the trimmer is incredible.  The trimmer has settings that allow you to trim from 1mm up to 18mm.  Changing is as simple as rotating the controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also has a vacuum which eliminates the mess created from trimming.  It has a convenient slot to empty out the trimmed hair.  The trimmer includes a lithium ion battery which means you can charger it via an outlet and it will hold that charge for quite a while during cordless use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco Beard Trimmer retails at 49.99 and provides an efficient and fast trim.  If you maintain a beard or stubble, you need to trim it everyday and the norelco is the perfect tool for the job.  Overall the trimmer is constructed really well and feels efficient to use.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with poorly designed trimmers, the norelco is your best choice.  View the full video review here: http://bit.ly/AmazonNorelcoReview</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for a Wahl trimmer I was using although it doesn&#x27;t trim as fine as the Wahl it is much easier to use and keep charged.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well. I have a Remington that I got from Amazon that works way better. Much more even shave. I do a closer shave (between 4-6) and for me this razor was not very good.</li>
            <li> Used the Philips Norelco T980 Beard Trimmer w/ Vacuum for years and loved it.  Used it to trim my beard and, since I like a stubble cut on my noggin&#x27;, I used it to mow my head.  Didn&#x27;t take real good care of it, so after a few years the door to the clippings holder broke and the battery degraded to where it need to be charged prior to every use..  Bought the QT4070 thinking it was just an updated version of the T980.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still cuts pretty good but the suction on the vacuum is far, FAR inferior.  This model clogs every, single time I use it, I have to continually tap the clippings down into the compartment, and clippings still get everywhere.  I have a pretty tough beard and the vacuum is not strong enough to keep the hair from flying everywhere when cutting my beard.  It&#x27;s almost unusable on my melon, because when I turn it upside down to do the top of my head, the suction is barely enough to keep any stubble in the catch compartment and it clogs almost instantly.  The T980 never did this.  I&#x27;ve run the 2 units side by side, both fully charged, and suction difference of the vacuums can be clearly heard.  Oh, and the new design on the door on the 4070 is lousy too, it quit staying closed the 1st month I owned it, had to put a rubber band on it to keep it closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing has a lot of good reviews, I just wonder if anyone giving it 5 stars has ever used the older model.  They don&#x27;t know what they missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just recently, did a patch job on the old T980 catch compartment (duct tape and a big rubber band) door and have resigned myself to charging every time before use.  I&#x27;ve kept the 4070 as a back up...</li>
            <li> First one sent was DOA.  Amazon replaced it in a timely fashion, and second one works very well.  Vacuum feature helped minimize mess.  Comfortable and adjustable.</li>
            <li> Does everything the description says it will do, neat features so far no complaints.  Really like this product would recommend</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer to give myself a close haircut. Very nice and quick. My hair is always combed. lo</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an old Remington unit.&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is stylish and holds a charge adequately.&lt;br /&gt;I found it a little awkward to use but it seems to do the job. Takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> After using its previous model for 10 years, I finally upgraded to this one. So far, the shave has been closer. The battery holds a longer charge and hopefully I get 10 years out of this model too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is the hair trap. The previous model you were able to remove it completely making cleaning the device far easier; but this one just has a flap that you open to dump out the trimmings, which is a bit inconvenient, that&#x27;s why it got four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard/mustache for many years using lots of different trimmers but the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 7300, vacuum is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  Very easy to use and the vacuum works great. No problems.</li>
            <li> It does an okay job. From the reviews I expected more. I end up with just as much hair in the sink when I shave as I do in the vacuum container. I really wish it was as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> its very noisy, my wife couldn&#x27;t bear sound its making even from other rooms when I am using it in bathroom. Suction is okay, you still have mess to clean. It all plastic doesn&#x27;t look strong. Returning after 2 uses and will try QT4014/42.</li>
            <li> I have not had problems with the guides sticking me as other reviewers have reported. I really enjoy the addition of the 2-speed vacuum accessory as it catches most of the trimmings.</li>
            <li> After many years of using a different brand, which did not trim evenly and could not hold a charge for even 24 hours, I am extremely happy with my new Norelco.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer. Replaced my older model. Has all the bells and whistles I wanted. The travel lock is good.</li>
            <li> I had one of the early models of this type of razor and this one is definitely smaller and sleeker. These vacuum beard trimmers do work somewhat, but in no way eliminate the mess that is made trimming your beard. At best, it might be a 50% reduction in mess, but more likely it is somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 - 30% less hair falling to the sink/floor/whatever. Still, every little bit helps.</li>
            <li> takes up about 70% of my of my hair</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with the guard. I personally use this machine for groin areas and it works perfectly, now you might ask why I use this for that and I will say I like a trimmed bush if you get my drift. I use it for my stubble as well it it works wonders.</li>
            <li> All the bad ratings may be due to the comb, and I get it, without the contour comb this will be down to 1 or 2 stars at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has no problem with my long beard, altough the vacuum could be better it does get a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem for me is that for trimming my long beard I have to use an extra comb, but to be fair a 5 inch beard is a challenge for any trimmer and this one make it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly you have to give every trimmer a chance, get just to it and then judge it. You just cant expect the best result from the first try.</li>
            <li> altho he hasn&#x27;t used it yet , this beard and mustache trimmer was the perfect choice w/ it&#x27;s vacuum feature it should be easy to keep the bathroom clean!</li>
            <li> This is a great beard trimmer.  However, I like to keep mine very short, and the minimum length allowable is not as short as I would like it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love the vacuum cleaner. Wish that it could be used in the shower too. Then I would have it made.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Still using mine after several years. Durable and flexible; nice that you can charge it or use it plugged in. Hasn&#x27;t lost its cutting ability since it came out of the box</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of other trimmers and never been satisfied, but finally the QT4070 has come along. My only complaint about it is that it is very loud, but I think this is a side effect of it having plenty of power and a built-in vacuum. It cuts cleanly, doesn&#x27;t leave a mess, feels very well made, is adjustable to a very precise degree, charges quickly, and just plain gets the job done. I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After 6 months, I ended up moving to a wired trimmer and haven&#x27;t looked back; in retrospect I find that I didn&#x27;t realize the power I was missing until I had it.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s wanted an adjustable trimmer for a long time. I looked everywhere and finally found this one. Norelco is a trusted name in razors and maybe it was just he didn&#x27;t know how to adjust the settings, but it ate his beard to where he had to cut it off. I don&#x27;t know if it was him or the razor, still, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> not convinient to clean. previouse model was much better. I recomend it only if you can&#x27;t find any other type with vacuum</li>
            <li> I had been looking at reviews for some time and settled on the Conair Men i-Stubble Trimmer GMT900R because that trimmer was all the rave.  I returned that trimmer because of some things I didn&#x27;t like about it and then bought this one; I like this one a lot more.  I agree with the a review under mine about the moisture.  I keep mine in my dopp kit so it&#x27;s not an issue, but whatever you do...keep it away from water!  The Conair looked really nice and felt nice in hand (felt better than this Norelco), but it was awkward on the face.  I have a Philips Norelco 3D shaver that is excellent and I have a cheaper all in one trimmer that is also a Philips, so that swayed me in favor of this trimmer and away from the bad reviews.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  The only reason that it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it could cut a bit faster and I can&#x27;t clean it with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing...I have no idea how anybody can cut themselves with this Norelco.  There&#x27;s a guard on it and it works perfectly.  Even for body grooming (I use my cheaper all-in-one for that, but...), I still don&#x27;t see how you can pick up nicks.</li>
            <li> trims very well, but the item i received is not the design of the one in the first picture, it is however the same as the pic further in the album. I thought i was buying the one pictured.</li>
            <li> Not the best one I have ever had, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Razor better than advertised.  This trimmer does all that the ad said and it is done much easier than the ad leaves us to believe.  The adjustments are very straight forward and easy.  The vacuum strength is much greater than I expected and the blades are very sharp.  I don&#x27;t think you could find a better trimmer at any price.</li>
            <li> So many features to like. Length selection w/o swapping guards, vacuum,  long battery life. Best trimmer I&#x27;ve had in a long time</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great!&lt;br /&gt;Digital readout relates to the OCD in me.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came with a &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34;, hate laying appliances down on the sink.</li>
            <li> Husband has an easier time trimming his beard now and it doesn&#x27;t look like a weird hack job anymore.  He looks very well groomed now and on Christmas Eve he was looking at another one at a store we were at and I had to tell him not to get anyting until Christmas was over, thank goodness he listened for once!</li>
            <li> I had never had a legitimate trimmer before, I had my hesitations that this was going to be any better than the previous pieces of garbage I had ordered. It was awesome. The vacuum capability works incredibly well, cleaning up is not a hassle.</li>
            <li> good product only thing lacking is precision shaving.</li>
            <li> I have always used Wahl trimmers for my goatee, this the first Norelco trimmer I have ever owned, and the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned....</li>
            <li> Lots of hairs still go in the sink maybe about the same amount a the qt4050, and motor is louder at normal than it so turbo is even louder. but it does a decent job of trimming beards and when removed the guard it works great down to 0.5mm for that 5oclock shadow look. great to see how much battery is left too, just twist the wheel or remove the guard and it lights up the lcd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the rest is identical to it, so save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service of this vendor i top notch. thanks.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk broke after one year.  Will not take any kind of charge and cannot even use while plugged in. Charged for three hours, and nothing. Worked fine last spring, but took it out to trim my new winter beard, and DEAD.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer! Battery lasts forever an easy to adjust the height.  The power boost button is nice.  I have no issues at all with this product.</li>
            <li> Most trimmers I&#x27;ve tried get around 20% of the hairs on each pass.  This one does far better and the vacuum feature is a bonus.</li>
            <li> The first one was DOA. Philips Norelco sent a new one, no questions asked. It does a nice job, better than the Sharper Image model I previously used until its battery died.</li>
            <li> I read some other post that said the poor trimming comb design had been rectified. It hasn&#x27;t. To think that $100 000&#x27;s of dollars must go into R&amp;D only for a customer to notice the flaw within seconds of purchase and still roll it production is mind boggling. Read other reviews for an adequate description as to why it&#x27;s poor. It has not been corrected. One turn at the wrong angle and your 3m beard becomes 1m. Worthless.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but you can&#x27;t use it while you walk around your house, for ex, because a part of the hairs will fall on the floor.</li>
            <li> Works well like the two different combs heads.  The battery last a along time .</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a wonderful job.  You don&#x27;t need to worry recharging the battery as you could plug in the trimmer and use it.  The vacuum  system was a brilliant idea to create.  However, you still need to clean up the sink as: 1) the chamber is small and fills up quickly.  This leads to cleaning the chamber very often. 2) The vacuum still doesn&#x27;t suck in all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of that, I still recommended anyone to buy this device.</li>
            <li> The only thing this does better is leaving behind less mess because of the built-in vacuum. However, other electric trimmers are better based on my experience.</li>
            <li> works great good good good good good good good good good it works fine they require me to put more wording don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> This kit works amazingly well. It definitely gets the job done. The main concern with this is that without the guard, it doesn&#x27;t cut very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco beard trimmer. The first one I had a few years ago, and it became faulty within around 2 months of usage. It was still usable, but the hair collector door had broken with normal use, the vacuum was completely gone, and it would keep jamming up no matter how carefully I cleaned it. I put up with it for a couple of years, thinking that maybe I&#x27;d just gotten a bad one or that I had mistreated it somehow (can&#x27;t think how).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So recently I saw this \\&quot;updated\\&quot; model on sale and figured that maybe they&#x27;d improved the design, or that I&#x27;d just make doubly sure to treat this one with kid gloves. Well, a couple of months later and I&#x27;m back in the same boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen to the other reviews where they say this scrapes and nicks your skin - it does. The edges are sharp and it&#x27;s not a smooth, comfortable experience at all. So right away, it&#x27;s actually WORSE than the previous model. But that&#x27;s not all. Already, it&#x27;s developed the same problems as my old one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The door to the hair collector refuses to click shut. On the old model, it was completely removable, except the fastening tabs were so fragile they broke within weeks. On this model, they&#x27;ve added a hinged door, but the fastener no longer works. I have to keep it closed with my thumb while using the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The vacuum stopped working very quickly. It works a little, but after shaving my sink is literally covered in hair. The vacuum is so weak it might as well not be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; setting constantly jams. It will work for about 3 seconds and then stop, showing an \\&quot;Error\\&quot; message on the LCD display. I regularly clean the thing of hair with the brush, so I just don&#x27;t see how you stop this happening with normal use. I&#x27;m reduced to using it on the oh-so-slow \\&quot;normal\\&quot; setting and it takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really annoyed that I threw away more good money on this piece of junk. The worst part of it is that many retailers are dominated by Norelcowhen it comes to shaving and beard trimming products, so there isn&#x27;t a lot of choice. I will however be looking around for a quality beard trimmer from now on. Don&#x27;t listen to the good reviews written here - I suspect that many of them are based upon the reviewers&#x27; initial thoughts, and not based upon their long term experience with the device.</li>
            <li> I can admit that at first I was skeptical about ordering this razor. I saw the bad reviews, and I thought they must be on to something. But after reading about how much better the contour comb was, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, I used the comb that came installed. After this, I decided to try the contour one. All I can say is &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;. This gives me the most even shave I have ever gotten. It makes shaving around the jaw line so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitant because of the bad reviews, ignore them. Phillips has corrected the issues and created a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about 4 weeks ago and am impressed with the quality of its&#x27; manufacture.  It gives a quick and easy trim and seems to have plenty of power and battery life.  I only wish that it would have the ability to give a clean shave too, rather than just a close trim leaving stubble.</li>
            <li> Check first to make sure the rechargeable battery can be replaced.  The one I have cannot, and the whole thing had to be thrown away. This is environmentally horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star is for the trimming capability which was fine until the battery died. I will always contact the manufacturer in the future to make sure the battery can be replaced, and if it can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer with vacum.</li>
            <li> The plastic hair chamber door clip is flimsy.  Broke and now stubble shavings fall out.  The cut is fine, but now the broken door clip has made me go look for a replacement.  Wish they did not use so much cheap plastic on this unit, otherwise it would be just fine for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer in hopes of cleaning up my bathroom more than my beard. While this does a great job as a shaver the implementation of the vacuum is flawed. Still having to clean my sink after every mornings touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. There are plenty of nice adjustable trimmers out there for half this price. While they may not have a vacuum to clean up the trimmings, they wont leave you wishing that the vacuum they did have was doing more then just blowing hot air!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 out of 5 stars</li>
            <li> The fan isn&#x27;t great. I still find a lot of hair ends up in the sink, enough that it makes it pretty pointless.</li>
            <li> A solid replacement for my cheaper Norelco beard trimmer. The flex head is a nice touch. Plenty of power and no problems so far. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t get all of the trimmings, but it gets most of them.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is way over priced. I owned previous breard trimmers from Norelco that were excellent and much more reliable. This unit could not hold a charge (while off) overnight which is a far cry from 50 minutes of run time Norelco advertised. I&#x27;m returning this trimmer for a refund not a replacement. I am done with Norelco. They are so over priced it is not worth it. I hate having to travel because a a rotten product but now I HAVE to go to the UPS Store to return this brick of a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have used the BG2020 for years.  THis product is great as it has the dual trimmers as opposed to the combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head is a great part of the shaver as it makes trimming some areas much easier.  The trimmer with length guide is better than the combs and will help the overall performance of the unit as a whole.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how anyone could rate this 5 stars. The design is terrible. The vacuum, though a nice concept, is positioned so that you can&#x27;t use the blade to outline your mustache, sideburns, etc... The vacuum sticks out about 1/4\\&quot;\\&quot; from the blade which gets in the way of trying to trim. In terms of those who originally thought the new attachment was terrible, it looks like the product now ships with the old attachment and the new attachment. Nevertheless, it is a terrible design.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well. The only issue I ran into was that the removal of the attachments is not explained clearly in the instructions. Further  it seems a bit awkward to take them off and reset them properly on the depth scale mechanism. Pushing in on a small  channel indentation on the back releases the comb accessories but it appears there  could be a necessary depth setting to facilitate the attachment process.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews discussing the type of clipper guard this came with, so I was pleased when I got mine and it had two kinds of clipper guards. One is the stabby kind like people mentioned, but it does a good job getting closer. I use it for that close stubble trim. The other is spring loaded and works contours of your face better. I use that one for beard trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum is nice. I&#x27;ve never used an electric trimmer before, so while I know how messy they can be, I haven&#x27;t experience it. This vacuum will by no means catch everything, and you&#x27;ll still end up wiping down the counter when you&#x27;re done, but it seems to catch the majority of falling whiskers. I don&#x27;t ever use turbo because I just don&#x27;t consider my facial hair to be thick enough to be worthy of it, but I may try using it more in the future for the vacuum boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts so long that it&#x27;s hard for me to actually say exactly how long it lasts. A month or two of 3-4 uses a week pretty easily I&#x27;d say. If you&#x27;re the kind of person that needs trimming daily, I&#x27;d expect you could still get a month or at least a few weeks out of each charge, and the charging is fast when it is needed.</li>
            <li> It got the job done for about 6 months. But the product ultimately failed due to a seemingly mal-engineered weak spot. The small clip that holds the cover over the vaccuum chamber snapped off. I&#x27;m still using the device, but I have had to wrap a trashy rubber band around it to hold the vaccuum chamber cover in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem, albeit minor, is that it the vaccuum chamber cannot be rinsed per the instructions. I lightly rinsed it anyways, and it survived. If you elect to clean it with water, I would advise being careful not to let water drop through the screen that leads into the vaccuum mechanism itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, there&#x27;s a 1 year warranty but...who cares? It wasn&#x27;t that expensive and I don&#x27;t want to have to deal with the hassle of trying to get a repair. Who keeps receipts and UPC cutouts for stuff like this for that long?</li>
            <li> High quality product. I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without a vacum system.</li>
            <li> Item as described Rocket fuel shipping can&#x27;t wait for the drones(:</li>
            <li> Works very well. My first electric shaver. I have a very coarse beard and it cruises right through it and the vacuum works great at keeping mess to a minimum.Took me a shave or two to get the hang of keeping things even (otherwise I would have given 5 stars) but once you do, it&#x27;s great. Very light, battery life is very good.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever owned (owned 4 in the past different brands). Seems like Norelco thought of everything with this item!</li>
            <li> This is my first trimming tool, the vaccume is great at greatly reducing the amount of hair that drops out. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  I use it to shave my head and it never leaves hair except in the catch cup.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of trimmers over the pst four decades - this one is the best. I love the readout showing the millimeter setting - makes it easy to read and reliably accurate. The device is simple, easy to use and does an great job. Blades are sharp, cuts cleanly without catching or pulling. Excellent buy - couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Best ever!! Purchased four of these as gifts-  all family members say it is the best razor they have ever owned! :)</li>
            <li> very very good product till now i use it without any problem. its vacuum not suck 100% hair but other all things are good.</li>
            <li> Have to go over the trimming area repeatedly (a lot) so it kinda gets frustrating.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s quality is awesome. But there was only US adaptor as a unit.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> the vaccum can get 75% of the hair. Still it is very cleaner than a normal razor. Battery recharges fast (1h like advertised).</li>
            <li> not too bad. i like it</li>
            <li> I am mystified at the many 5 star review this item has received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QT4070 Beard Trimmer has an incredibly stupid design. Whoever came up with it should be fired. The problem is with the placement of the vacuum air intake. They placed it in front of the cutting head. This means that the cutting head is set back from the front of the contour comb with the result that you cannot cut within 3/8-1/2&amp;#34; from any object that restricts the forward motion of the trimmer...like your nose. Result? You can&#x27;t trim the top of your mustache!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other flaws:&lt;br /&gt;-- the vacuum attachment is loud.&lt;br /&gt;-- poor comb design. It has a sharply angled leading edge which is uncomfortable as you run the trimmer over your face&lt;br /&gt;-- limited functionality, Again, due to the placement of the vacuum intake, you can&#x27;t take off the contour comb and use the trimmer to, er, trim sideburns, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-- ergonomics. The vacuum feature bulks up the overall size of the trimmer. I find it significantly harder to maneuver this unit than other s I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;-- expense. This is one of the more expensive trimmers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT recommended.</li>
            <li> Trimmer looks different than in the photo. An ugly wide red band across the middle is the adjuster, it&#x27;s RED, not black like in the photo. The vacuum is Loud compared to other Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve owned. And there&#x27;s a flimsy cover for the poorly designed too small collection chamber...not the proper filter suction. Used to judge the quality and amount of beard trim by the sound it makes when cutting the coarse hair...but this trimmer is too loud to notice that. Don&#x27;t like the design changes except for the IMPROVED BATTERY.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises and mows your face just fine.  It does a great job at catching a good amount of shaved whiskers in it&#x27;s little vacuum cleaner compartment.  My only real problem with it is that the door broke after about two weeks and now will not stay shut. It&#x27;s easy enough to hold closed, but should you slip or forget it could mean quite a mess.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting height is controlled by a rotating wheel with a digital readout.  Some trimmers I&#x27;ve had made it too easy to start cutting with an incorrect setting, which could really make a mess.  This one is a lot more fool-proof.  This is the most important feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the trimmings are captured in a reservoir, so there is much less mess. This works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is excellent and the noise is low.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Great product. Could use a bigger cleaning brush, some oil, and a travel case.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work too well under the nose due to the bulk.  Keeps most of the mess contained, but not all.  Not bad, but I wish it was better.</li>
            <li> Does the job it was made to do, excellent</li>
            <li> perfect trimmer for what do</li>
            <li> Unfortunate design on the stubble compartment has doomed the last two of these trimmers I have purchased. Luckily, Norelco&#x27;s warranty policy has provided me with two replacements. I really like the trimmer- the cut is exceptional, the battery life is good, the trimmer does its job exceptionally well, I just wish they had designed the door on the whisker compartment better.</li>
            <li> Used a total of four times. Began to make an odd humming noise while charging, and stopped functioning after 31 days. I would not recommend this product for a number of reasons: the construction appears shoddy, it is bulkier than advertised, and the quality control appears to be less than average.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Norelco beard trimmer (can&#x27;t replace the batteries economically in Norelco trimmers) and it is simply adequate.  For many reasons I preferred the \\&quot;dead\\&quot; one it replaces.  For example, the last one had a little sliding \\&quot;basket\\&quot; to catch the vacuumed clippings and thus I could slide it out and tap it on the sink to empty it.  This one has a non-removable catch area with a depression behind a \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; door and must be cleaned with a brush each time.  Why did the designers think that would be viewed as a blessing by guys in a hurry? Also, the last one was smoother in operation and never \\&quot;snagged\\&quot; whiskers as this one sometimes does.  It is noisier than any of my previous Norelco trimmers too.  On the plus(?) side it uses lithium batteries so it goes full power until it stops unlike Nicad batteries which warn you by slowing down a little one or two shaves before stopping.  I hope this never stops dead when I am running late for an important appointment.  The regular speed and vacuum power is really more than enough, so I am wondering why they gave it a \\&quot;turbo boost\\&quot; setting.  I tested it out of curiosity and my ears actually hurt when I shaved near them.  I can&#x27;t imagine turning on turbo it in real life use.&lt;br /&gt;Update of 4/23/13&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried to see if the two \\&quot;blade heads\\&quot; on my last Norelco fit this razor and they did.  Using the old blades improved the experience significantly and one of the blades was a special blade for close fine trimming which was not part of this new razor.  While I am now happier I am not changing the rating since the improvements didn&#x27;t ship as part of this razor package.  The point is to recommend you see if any earlier Norelco blades you may have on an old razor will fit on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Update of 11/11/13&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;difficult door\\&quot; retaining the clippings (mentioned above) no longer works since the catch no longer holds it closed.  A little plastic nub disappeared and now it requires a rubber band around it tokeep clippings from being blown around the room...they need to rethink designs.</li>
            <li> Have used the trimmer for a while now. I like that it holds a charge for a l long time. The vacuum feature is neat and works pretty well. I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a little harder to do precision trimming because of the thickness of the end. That&#x27;s not a big issue. It still works for me. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had a stubble trimmer from Norelco and I absolutely loved it, the problem with my old one was that it didn&#x27;t hold a charge after a few months of usage, and now it doesn&#x27;t even work well if its plugged in.  So I purchased this product, and even at the lowest setting it doesn&#x27;t have the same control as the previous trimmer I was using.  This is the old one for reference:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-QT4021-Stubble-Trimmer/dp/B0039UM90C/ref&#x3D;sr_1_29?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361831500&amp;sr&#x3D;8-29&amp;keywords&#x3D;norelco+beard+trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it held a proper charge I would give the old one a 6 star rating, it was absolutely amazing.  p.s. I didn&#x27;t pay 100 for it, I&#x27;m assuming they upped the price because norelco discontinued it or something.</li>
            <li> I have for years old model Norelco beard trimmer and it&#x27;s still working. I&#x27;ve purchased this one because of vacuum feature but it turns out it&#x27;s useless comparing to previous model.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;* Easy and precise adjustment&lt;br /&gt;* Vacuum prevents hair going everywhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;* Like others said, if you angle the Stock trimmer head a certain direction it can jab you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This My First trimmer so I have little to compare to.</li>
            <li> Product works as described by others.  As others have said the vacuum system isn&#x27;t perfect but better than nothing.  The latest iteration which has a part number QT4070/41 comes with both head attachments... the one which people originally complained about as beling sharp our pointy is not very good at the longer trim lengths because it could be pokey... and because it&#x27;s too flexible so it&#x27;s not very consistent due to the tines flexibility, but if you want the shortest possible stubble you need to use that attachment so i think it&#x27;s worth having if it&#x27;s super short stubble that you&#x27;re after... (which is probably why they included it in the first place.  I want slightly longer stuble so i use the &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; less pointy head which is better suited to the long lengths as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least a REALLY cool feature of this trimmer is it&#x27;s travel worthiness becuase it isn&#x27;t just that it&#x27;ll trim while it charges, but it&#x27;ll run on any voltage just like pretty much all cell phone and laptop power supplies.  The reason i ended up on the market for shaver was becuase i blew up my last shaver in europe plugging it into an average 220V socket with a plug adapter.  It obviously runs on the USA 120V, and you can run it on 220V in europe (with just a basic plug adapter) so you can plug it into anything without owrries... and don&#x27;t have to use any fancy power voltage converters to use this anywhere.</li>
            <li> not as close a shave as i would have liked.</li>
            <li> good so far, it does not get close enough without the guard to do my head as I would like.</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s a little loud, but it trims well. It doesn&#x27;t catch 100% of the trimmimgs, but it catches alot. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this. It gives him a nice even trim. He has a thick beard but the trimmer does a good job. He says the vacuum is pretty effective too.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver. Love the dialing in of the mm length. Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> I was using a Phillips Norelco beard trimmer, and really liked it.  So immediately bought this model as it looks similar to my older model, with the exception of the display. I&#x27;m a bit unhappy after receiving this model.  With the comb removed, it doesn&#x27;t seem to trim close enough, so you can define the line between beard and face.  The biggest issue, is that this model only has a screen at the bottom of the compartment, so it quickly clogs of beard trimmings, and no longer vacuums them.  The older unit had a little basket that pulled out, which also had screens on the side of the basket, keeping the airflow going, so it would vaccuum effectively until full.  They appear to have cost reduced the feature to the point where it no longer really works.  Too much hassle to return.  Will look elsewhere when the battery on this one finally dies.</li>
            <li> Like many I got this as a replacement to the T980 model which I had for years. They are basically they same, although I got more with my T980 which I also paid less for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main missing element is the detail blade. The T980 came with two blades, a wide blade that was used with the contour comb and was good for trimming your beard. And a narrower blade, which was used without a guide to detail the edge of your moustache or beard etc. I used both every time I trimmed my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model, only comes with the wide blade, no narrower detailing blade. To me this is is a massive draw back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other missing element is the travel pouch which was nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the vacuum system, it never really worked well with my T980 and it seems to work no better with this model. Sink clean up is still very much required. So if thats your motivating factor for purchasing this model, I would think again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that this model is apparently less prone to turning on unintentionally in travel - I haven&#x27;t road tested this claim out yet, but that was an issue with the T980.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think they could have done better improving what I think is a good product but this will do.</li>
            <li> Previous reviewers have stated the same in regards to how the beard guard does not really work due to it not covering the top of the unit completely.  They have also stated that you can buy a replacement guard that should resolve the problem.  I have not done this but, it is an inferior model compared to the Philips Norelco® T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.  I had this model and it felt like a better built unit in every aspect.  Skip this one, and if you can find one, get it the T980 over this one.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son-in-law for Christmas and he loved it.  The vacuumed feature was what made me pick is one.  For the money it was a good product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was really sharp right after I had purchased it. It already came with the special guide mentioned by some other reviewers. However, after about 8 or 9 months, the vacuum feature started missing some. Eventually it got to the point where it hardly sucked up any hair at all. After approximately 24 months of use, I have decided to retire it and purchase something else. I was looking for a well-rounded trimmer, one that I could use without hassle. This one was not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The vacuum feature eventually &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34; up.&lt;br /&gt;(2) I had to go over my face, A LOT, to get all the straggling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;(3) A single charge might keep for a while but it only lasts me for one, maybe two trims of my beard. It worked better when I only had a goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only plan to use this for a year, it&#x27;s fine. If you&#x27;re looking for something to last until the cows come home, keep looking.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product, better than any other vacuum clipper on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how other guys have been stabbing themselves with this trimmer; I had no such trouble.  I got the best, fastest, neatest trim I&#x27;ve ever given myself in 20 years of having a beard.  The only complaint I had was that when I tried it corded the cord dropped out.  Otherwise, perfect!  Even the trouble areas of my face where my hair seems to grow in all directions wasn&#x27;t a problem.  I had to attack from each different direction but once or twice each way was enough.  I&#x27;ve never been able to trim that area so easily.  The vacuum is awesome as well.  No, it doesn&#x27;t get every whisker but it was so much better than no vacuum and worked at least as well as is reasonable to expect.  The only thing I can&#x27;t speak to is durability, specifically battery life.  Obviously, hoping that satisfies as well.  Update: I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for almost three years now. I&#x27;m still happy with it and the battery is holding up well! That&#x27;s a vast improvement from the horrible battery life of my last trimmer, an Andis.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  The comb is flexible so dont push it against your skin \\&quot;to make sure you get an even trim\\&quot; because it ill just cut it shorter than desired.  Also the comb is past the guard which can make you shave closer than desired if you slightly tilt it.  Now i have to shave my whole face because one side has a .5 mm trim and the other a 2mm trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the amount of hair it left on my face in the 1mm setting, and i like the feel of the hair a this setting. I did not use the turbo option; while trimming was not a problem the vacuum did let some hair fall into the sink. it wasnt much, and it seemed like the hair did not fall far from the sink so the mess was diminished.  Maybe if i used turbo it would not let the hair slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is a little rought, i remembered people complaining that they cut their lip so i was careful but still quite quick with it.  I didnt get cut but if i was carelless with it, it might happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It good all my hairs even, except in the mustache area which it left them a little longer, but withing acceptable and understandable limits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 2-3 weeks into using this trimmer, and it is exactly as described.  I have not even had to re-charge it once yet.  The adjustable trim length is very functional and works very well.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product but cleaning trimmer was little difficult.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Long lasting battery and gone are the days where I have to clean up the sink when I&#x27;m done shaving/trimming.  I&#x27;ve used tons of 20-40$ Wahl and even other Norelco trimmers and they don&#x27;t even come close to this.  Definitely worth the small increase in price.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool but the vacuum only captures about 75% of the trimmings on turbo mode. The digital screen is nice and the battery display is a must have. Seriously there&#x27;s nothing worse than your razor dying when you&#x27;re getting ready for work and you&#x27;ve only shaved half your face. The battery life is extensive if I had to guess I&#x27;d say I only had to charge it once every 10 times I trim my beard, maybe more.</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  All the hair collects in an enclosed vacum area.</li>
            <li> as much as I hate shaving with Philips Norelco everything its much cleaner and easyer to do.  love the vacume suction function</li>
            <li> I almost skipped that one because of the vacuum feature.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that its just a gimmik and I&#x27;ll be getting an overall lower quality trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When shaving it gets around 70-80% of the hair like other people said, which is ok.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to trim my hair and it gets pretty much all of it, really mess free.&lt;br /&gt;I dont even have to swipe the floor after I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;The cut is as good as my wahl corded monster of a trimmer, which really surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the &amp;#34; &amp;#34;contour following comb&amp;#34;&amp;#34;, as the other one is pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with it is the close shave, it isnt as good as Remington MB4040.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a price I&#x27;m willing to pay since I can use it both on my head and beard, and not leave a mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer over a year ago and am very happy with it. I use it on a full beard, the contour comb set to 3 mm. It is as sharp as it was when I bought it, and the contour comb is easy to set and gives a consistent cut. The comb pulls off to trim your mustache or hairline without changing your setting. The vacuum does prevent a mess in the sink and surrounding counter. The trimmer is easy to clean with the included brush. I was initially put off by the fact that it does not come with a charging stand, but I quickly found out that it does not need one. The charging cycle is so long (use &#x3D; 2-3 x per week), that I don’t know how many MONTHS it goes between charges. So the charging stand stays in a drawer not taking up counter space or drawing a phantom current. I have charged this thing only a few times since I bought it well over a year ago! It is a well designed trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco QT4070 in February 2014 as a replacement for a failing Norelco QT4022, which was purchased in 2011. Shaving closely with a razor or electric shaver causes my skin to break out. I primarily use the QT4070 to maintain a 1 mm &amp;#34;designer stubble&amp;#34; look.The vacuum feature is more than just a gimmick. Although it doesn&#x27;t totally eliminate hair in your sink when shaving, it does dramatically reduce the amount. The battery lasts for over a month at a rate of 3 full face shaves per week. The unit charges quickly and has a useful digital battery indicator. The large plastic guard does make it challenging to trim directly under your nose and line up my sideburns, but it is doable by using the unit and specific angles. The one downside I found is that after about 4 months of use, the plastic vacuum container door latch broke. I contacted Philips and they replaced the unit. I am happy with the product and manufacturer&#x27;s policies regarding their product. I&#x27;m confident that you will be happy with this product should you choose to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Does not cut as close as i thought, does leave an after shave shadow, you will have to shave with a razor after to achieve a clean look. Other than that, great product, works great and doesnt pull your hair when shaving like others razors. Great for manscaping too! ;)</li>
            <li> i am very please no mess with the vacuum and really does the job Better than the Wahl i owned this is so good</li>
            <li> first of all i got to say that its a good beard trimming pruduct. the cutting is fine, it gets to small place.&lt;br /&gt;the vacum works well, it doesnt vacum all of the hair and i really didnt think it would, but it saves me a lot of mess.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing that i have to say is that the battery runs out if u dont use it.i used it for 10 minutes the first time and after 2 weeks the battery was empty.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the model it replaced but better than anything else on the market...hint bring back the old one!!!</li>
            <li> Works great until the door that holds in hair slowly chips away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several beard trimmers, but none that have done as great of a job. The ability to adjust length right on the trimmer, without all the attachments, is awesome. It does a great job at evenly trimming. The suction could be a little better, but it definitely helps keep things cleaner.</li>
            <li> Great battery life and love the vacuum system.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I just got this and used it...and it works awesome. I tried using it with the Plastic Comb Guard that comes with it since I read some reviews of people cutting their lip or whatever; since it&#x27;s my first time using an electric trimmer I wasn&#x27;t going to take chances and it worked alright. I decided to take it off, because it was taking a while and after i did it worked amazing. Not sure how people got hurt using this thing to be honest. Any ways If you want the stubble look GET THIS! It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great machine and gives you better control over the trim level. Charged only twice in the last 6 months (used about once or twice/week).</li>
            <li> Not as powerful a suction as what Wayne experienced, but unlike what Garth would rate it, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately now this newer version of the Norelco trimmer is Crap! A waste of my time and energy. While the pictures look nice, it&#x27;s made as cheaply as possible out of plastic. Less trim blades than the previous model, importantly, and the reason for return, the new super battery does not hold a charge... Amazing when you think about it. How long has Norelco been in business? In all those years they can&#x27;t stay on top of their design, manufacturing and quality control systems? Norelco, runs as efficiently as the US government in all respects.</li>
            <li> I read quite a few of the reviews for this product before purchasing it, both positive and negative. The black/clear pivot comb everyone is concerned about actually came in my package. Even if it had not come with it I had already called Phillips(before I purchased) to double check that they would send me one, Which they said they would. To my surprise it was in the box.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is great I have only charged it once in the past month and I still have plenty of battery. The vacuum works good but remember you are buying a trimmer with a vacuum not a Hoover with a trimmer. The vacuum captures about 90% of the hair if you trim every couple days. But if you are trimming a longer length off it does not vacuum as well. This is the most expensive trimmer I have ever bought but I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The design makes it very easy to maintain a beard and keep it neat while the vacuum feature prevents a mess all over the bathroom. A game changer if you&#x27;re finding beard grooming inconvenient or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I am getting the results that I was looking for with this trimmer. What made me choose this item over others was its vacuum feature which had a plastic &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; where you could see the &amp;#34;trimmings&amp;#34; as well as being able to open this window to dispose of the trimmings. Even though few trimmings are not collected into the vacuum chamber, they are few enough that they are easily wiped out &amp; drained into the sink. I do not know if it is due to my thick beard growth but I need to use this trimmer on its maximum setting but it works for me. I would like to alert prospective users of this product that its electrical cord if one chooses not to use its battery feature that one ascertains that the plug that goes into the trimmer be well pressed into it so it does not get unplugged as it happened to me on my first two uses of this trimmer, fortunately it has not happened afterwards. Another observation is that my moustache is harder to trim than my beard even though it is not thicker than the latter, perhaps it is related to the nature of my own anatomy than to this product in order to give the benefit of the doubt to the latter. Bottom line I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son, and I have gotten no complaints.  Considering he is very opinionated on everything I buy, this is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my hubs to replace the one that couldn&#x27;t hold a charge for too long anymore...&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure he likes it-- ESP. B/c it came with an attachment that &#x27;catches&#x27; the beard hairs while he is trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Better price on amazon than in the stores-- and the convenience of shopping online with free shipping makes me smile... :)</li>
            <li> It seems like most beard trimmers rip out more hairs than they cut, and many times, you find yourself going over the same spot multiple times because they just won&#x27;t cut certain hairs. I just used my QT4070 for the first time, and I was kind of impressed. It cut quickly, easily, and evenly. I doubted the vacuum would be of much worth, but it actually caught about 90% of the hair. The main reason I bought the unit was for the adjustable length setting, which turned out to be very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak about the longevity or reliability of the product, but so far, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works as stated but vacuum not the best</li>
            <li> This is an amazing device.  If I was on survivor I&#x27;d bring a swiss knife a compass and this...  It holds a charge longer than an ex-girlfriend holds a grudge and it sucks those hairs up like the government sucks up our tax dollars...  Doesn&#x27;t bite the lip like some of the other whiners say as I&#x27;ve used it with the guide off and on.  It&#x27;s perfect.  Not too loud but then again with that kind of power you want it to be silent.  REALLY?  get real people... Barbarians weren&#x27;t quiet so deal with it...  But yes I&#x27;d say this was a very fantastic buy and I&#x27;d buy 6 more and use them for each day of the week but then the others would get jealous and start fighting with each other.  So for now one will do... Thanks Phillips and thanks Amazon for allowing me to purchase one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a setting to shave to your face.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this trimmer I just wandered around like a grizzled homeless man with no direction, now I&#x27;m sleek and trim living life to the fullest. Needless to say This trimmer is life changing!</li>
            <li> love it ! works great i use this save tons of razors</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend with a short beard and it is really nice! A ton of settings to trim those fly aways and just make his beard look more clean/put together. The trap for the hairs really works and has saved a lot of cleaning time on the bathroom counter! Recommend.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent beard trimmer which works exactly as described but may have a design flaw. The door that collects the beard shavings is kept closed by a little plastic lip. After only 3 months of use twice per week, the plastic lip broke off and thus the door does not stay closed. So, I had to put a rubber band around to keep it closed as per the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Philips and the customer rep said this should not happened and immediately agreed to send a replacement free of charge. This is terrific customer service! I may have a defective unit and will update after a few more months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/23/15 UPDATE: The above was written in mid-March 2015 and the razor performed flawlessly for another 3 months. Last week, the little plastic lip on the door (that keeps the beard shavings) broke again! Given my previous experience, I have been very gentle with this unit and especially careful every time that I opened the door. So, I have to judge the unit unacceptable now, which is too bad as it is a great beard trimmer. But, it breaks every 3 months even with very light use!</li>
            <li> had about a 5 inch long beard and this trimmer could barley cut 20 strands of hair at a time with out me having to clean the blades. not happy...</li>
            <li> My old remington beard trimmer finally stopped charging a couple of months ago so I began the exhausting task of finding a replacement. I settled on the trimmer I am reviewing. The trimmer does what it says it does. It trims my mustache, goat tee, and beard lines without any tugging or pulling. However, the turbo vacuum does not work that well. I would say around 30% of my hair still falls in the sink. The actual device feels cheaply made. My older trimmer was wrapped in rubber and felt heavier. Maybe cause I work out and lift weights frequently, I like heavier things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was a 3.5 I would give this trimmer a 3.5. I dont think it deserves a 4 so that is why I gave it a 3.</li>
            <li> This apparently now comes with both of the heads that many people said Panasonic should have included.  I really like this but I have to get used to the height adjustment apparently.  The height adjusts easily, and the readout is great, but you have to make sure it is set to what you want by checking the readout since the way the head adjusts isn&#x27;t as obvious as my last trimmer just by looking at it.</li>
            <li> I have trimmed my beard and moustaches with high quality barber scissors since about 1977.  I finally decided to give electricity and technology a chance.  I still use the scissors to &amp;#34;fine tune&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;rogue hairs&amp;#34; that manage to evade the electric trimmer, but I like the ability to plow through all the whiskers quickly and evenly.  The learning curve was quick and the results were excellent.  The vacuum &amp;#34;hopper&amp;#34; sucking up all the trimmings has made my bathroom far more tidy.  My beard is heavy - though not as heavy as some so I imagine the techniques I have learned are individual for me.  I encourage you to give it a try and experiment a little to find your own technique to deliver the results you want.</li>
            <li> The vacuum does not work and spills hair all over the place.  This did not meet expectations.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco trimmer died after years of service.When I started looking for another.I found out it wes discotinued.I found this one,it was almost like my other one.I only hope it last as long as my other.</li>
            <li> Perfect, precise, powerful, safe and the head is easy to remove and put back (no fighting involved)</li>
            <li> I owned the version without the vacuum and it cut much closer. I&#x27;m disappointed with this shaver</li>
            <li> Purchased for spouse.  Vacuum works really well.</li>
            <li> Tidys up the beard maintenance experience but have yet to experience a trimmer with vacuum that is as effective as those that just trim.</li>
            <li> I used Norelco for years. This works just as the model before it, which I own as well. However, I&#x27;ve had several occasions when a full battery is immediately drained, simply by pushing the power button. Haven&#x27;t returned because frankly it&#x27;s not worth the hassle for me. Shaving still preforms great for shaving, but there&#x27;s obviously a wiring/charging issue with this unit.</li>
            <li> Its good, and the vaccum is a good function. Still, after you trim your beard to your desired stubble, even the minimum length setting is too high for mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> The charge is long and the turbo is nice. Doesn&#x27;t vacuum everything up, so you will still need to clean up afterwards.  The reason for the 4 stars, is the head of the trimmer is too fat to get right under my nose without taking the guard off completely. It&#x27;s also not the best of you have a curly beard, as the guard misses hairs.</li>
            <li> This is a really good beard trimmer , the blades are sharp yet surprisingly don&#x27;t cut the skin . The adjustment system works nicely and the vacuum catches most of the trimmings so it keeps things much cleaner . It would get 5 stars except for the little compartment holding the beard trimmings has broken so it doesn&#x27;t attach well anymore . Aside from that I would recommend this item .</li>
            <li> works great. trims beard and mustache easily and the vacuum works. i now also use it to trim my hair on my head. works great for that too</li>
            <li> W O W!!!! Love this clipper. Has plenty of power. Even without the boost! Love love love the vacuum design. Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this machine adn i like better than before, its has you see in the pictures, has his lcd to see the level of the battery, and has several levles for the beard</li>
            <li> Before I bought this trimmer I used the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Philips G370, which would leave uneven patches if I used it on the shortest setting. It broke after about 4 months of normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wahl 9918-6171, which pulled out more hairs than a rusty safety razor and was useless for maintaining stubble. I threw it in the garbage out of frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QT4070 hasn&#x27;t pulled a single hair, and gives an even trim even on the shortest (1mm) setting. The vacuum feature didn&#x27;t factor in my decision to buy this trimmer, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it I don&#x27;t think I can go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice if it came with a carrying case.</li>
            <li> Really like the vacuum system and trims beard great.</li>
            <li> Works really well with good consistency.  It is pretty quiet and the battery life is very good as well.  Will recommend for any person who is looking for good grooming device.</li>
            <li> Good quality trimmer, other than one part:  The door to the hair compartment no longer stays latched on mine (after less than a year of use), but the way I hold it while using the trimmer keeps it closed anyway.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m definitely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works as promised.  I understand why it&#x27;s rated the number one trimmer.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the whole point of a beard trimmer is to get all of your hair trimmed neatly to the same length.  If you share this opinion, you may want to look more closely at your other options.  Every time I use this trimmer it leaves a lot of hairs without being cut no matter how many times you retread at different angles.  An even bigger complaint for me, since I like my beard trimmed close and clean, is that the vacuum is a thick piece in front of the cutting blade and gets in the way of being able to do precision trimming around your nose and lips.  I received both head attachments and neither one works well for me; even the nicer spring loaded one tends to catch my lip while I attempt to trim up close near my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Philips/Norelco trimmers for over 14 years and this is trimmer is the most expensive one I&#x27;ve ever purchased; and it is by far the biggest disappointment.  I will be looking for a new trimmer to replace this one soon and this one will be going to the thrift store.</li>
            <li> I was floored by how powerful and clean this cut after using it for the first time.  I was very hesitant to try it since my old one worked great for years but just couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  It did the work in 1/3 the time!  Once i turned on turbo it was incredible.  The one function i thought wouldn&#x27;t work at all and was a sham would be the vacuum but after once use i looked down at the sink and there was maybe three or four that didn&#x27;t get pulled into the trimmer.  Not only powerful but clean up is perfect!!  Would buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> works great, has compartment that catches 95% of shaved hairs (beard, moustache) and easy to clean the compartment, many different shave levels, 2 speeds, comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace a Norelco I bought in... wait for it... 1999. It lasted so long because I replaced the internal NiCad battery 2-3 times.  I&#x27;ve retired it only because it needs another battery and I&#x27;m sure the clipper&#x27;s blades are worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on this experience and ratings here on Amazon.com, I selected this product.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+  Incredibly long-lasting Lithium battery has meant I&#x27;ve needed to charge it only after a whole month of use&lt;br /&gt;+  Vacuum feature captures about 95% of cut hair, keeping my bathroom counter and sink area cleaning&lt;br /&gt;+  Sharp blades make it unnecessary to cut again and again to catch long hairs&lt;br /&gt;+  Digital length indicator makes it easy to set and verify length, even without my reading glasses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  I found this to be a very disappointing choice for detail work.  It is designed such that the vacuum&#x27;s &amp;#34;scoop&amp;#34; prevents seeing the cutter when you are using it without the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34;.  This means I cannot see what I&#x27;m doing when I trim my sideburns or mustache to length, which is frustrating.  I did not have this problem with my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;-  The two &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; are harder to reinstall then the old Norelco.  It usually take 2-3 attempts to get everything aligned so the comb can slide down.&lt;br /&gt;-  Norelco also changed the design of the cutter head such that the head itself must be completely removed for cleaning.  This also creates a reinstall issue.  My old Norelco had the head attached with a hinge, which made it easy to clean but also completely removable if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the way I use a trimmer, I would not purchase this model again.  The obstructive view is the deal breaker.</li>
            <li> So far works very well and trimming is very easy.</li>
            <li> Its a really good trimmer, but like many other wrote the door to the vaccum chamber broke after a few months so that feature is gone. Shame really. Also it is hard to trim the mustache area because of the inset way the trimmer is set up.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Bought to replace an earlier model in which the rechargeable battery died. This one is working well so far.</li>
            <li> This product looks great, works great, and the vacuum feature is a fantastic feature. It&#x27;s not perfect, meaning you will still launch little hairs in every which direction, but it does capture the vast majority of your shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this product, it came with two guards - the stubble and the contour. Be warned - ALWAYS USE A GUARD. If you try to use this to trim your pubic region, you will probably cut yourself if you don&#x27;t use the guard because the blades are VERY sharp. I learned this the hard way. Always thoroughly clean the device if you use it on more than one location on your body.</li>
            <li> The variable trim settings are great--just take some experimenting to get the right length/look.  The vacuum doesn&#x27;t seem to catch too much--still end up with hairs all over the sink.</li>
            <li> When my trusty and much beloved Philips T980 recently gave up the ghost, I was a bit worried about replacing it with the new QT4070 due in large part to some of the adverse reviews I&#x27;d seen on Amazon. But, when it came to a vacuum beard trimmer, the QT4070 is just about the only bar in town so I got one. I was very pleasantly surprised at what the device turned out to be... it&#x27;s essentially the old T980 in a new shape with an upgraded Li-ion battery and some fancy new display technology. All the things that I loved about the T980 were still there in the QT unit. In fact the cutting mechanism is essentially identical so I was actually able to use the T980&#x27;s mustache trimmer on the QT4070 (the parts were interchangeable). As far as the QT&#x27;s being a replacement for my poor departed T980... it was an exact match.  In fact the only down side is that the new trimmer does not come with a narrow mustache blade and it also arrived sans case. However, as I said before, the T980&#x27;s trimmer works just fine on the QT and, of course, the QT fits in the T980&#x27;s case. Punch line: If you&#x27;re looking to replace a T980 don&#x27;t hesitate to buy the QT4070. For all intents and purposes they&#x27;re the same unit.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works great. Combs need some redesign so that they will do a better job of lifting hair and guiding it into the cutter. As it is, there are quite a few long hairs that it misses.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for a Norelco T980. Very pleased with this trimmer as it is very similar to the T980. Vacuum works well.</li>
            <li> Somewhat inconsistent cuttingâ€”I find beard hairs not cut and just kind of bent. The vacuum feature reduces the mess, but there are still clippings that escape. Overall, worth it despite shortcomings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a month now and it&#x27;d like to cut straight to the small things that have stuck out to me rather than do a full review  Pros -Charged it once since the day I got it and it&#x27;s still carrying a a 4 out of 4 bar charge now a month later -Came with the interchangeable form following head -Only extra pieces are the other head it came with, a cleaning brush, and the A/C adaptor which is great compared to my old multipiece trimmer.  Cons -The vacuum to pick up hair isn&#x27;t the greatest and sometimes the area that sucks hair in will get clogged, but it&#x27;s an easy fix.  Even with the vacuum not being the best I still give this five stars because it simply makes beard trimming a snap and it has great battery life which used to annoy me with my old cadmium powered shaver. Pick this trimmer up if you&#x27;re in the market. You won&#x27;t regret the decision.</li>
            <li> vacuums up the mess as you trim.  can&#x27;t ask for more than that! second time I have bought this one and it does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. It arrives at described.</li>
            <li> As my older Norelco T980 finally started to show its wear after its remarkably long life, I decided to upgrade to its replacement top-of-the-line trimmer. After studying many wildly-mixed reviews, I had some concerns with the newer razor. However, considering how happy I had been with the performance of the T980, and my intended use of the trimmer for achieving stubble, I dismissed the negative reviews about trimming longer hair and purchased the trimmer anyway. Initial impressions were very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QT4070 looks very sleek. It feels much ligher than the T980 while offering a seemingly larger hair chamber and the LCD display, which deserves its obligatory mention. It&#x27;s ability to use both corded and cordless is also an excellent feature; my battery arrived drained, but plugging it in allowed immediate use. It also does away with the spring-loaded vacuum \\&quot;chute\\&quot; that forever frustrated my use of the T980; it replaces it instead with a solid-plastic chute that extends all the way to the clippers. Unfortunately, my excitement was curtailed when repeated uses of the trimmer all left hair covering the counter top. I&#x27;m not sure if the defectiveness is due to this change, or a new, weaker vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My trimmer arrived with both of the described heads - a fixed \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; head, and a spring-loaded \\&quot;comb\\&quot; similar to the T980. The stubble head differs from the comb in two main ways: it has no spring-loaded tail; instead resembling a single, flat, solid unit atop the trimmer; and it has the \\&quot;guard\\&quot; teeth in front of the razors removed. The latter point seems to be a huge design flaw, leaving the razors entirely exposed and ultimately shearing skin twice in the first use before I resigned to using the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; head. The comb head, while much safer, also seems to perform poorly. Both the comb and the guard teeth seem much flimsier than the older T980, allowing the distance between the skin and the razors to vary depending on the pressure applied. This seems likeanother major design flaw, as it&#x27;s extremely difficult to hold the razor at the same angle, with the same pressure all over the face. The result is needing to re-trim areas of my face several times in a futile attempt to achieve consistency before ultimately accepting the uneven trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m left with the impression that the QT4070 is trying really, really hard to distinguish itself from the older T980. While the trimmer makes several significant steps forward in design; it falters on functionality, offering inferior performance with its vacuum and dangerous or uneven trims with the stubble and comb heads. If these issues were resolved, the trimmer would easily warrant a 5-star review. Unfortunately, in its current incarnation, I must reluctantly retire its use and return to my worn-out T980.</li>
            <li> I returned this product after trying it for a week because the vacuum is kinda gimmicky. I don&#x27;t have very thick beard hair and it just didn&#x27;t do a good job of sucking up the hair...I imagine it would be even worse for someone who produces a 5&#x27;oclock shadow. That aside the product was sturdy and came with a travel bag which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Had to replace my Phillips Norelco Vacuum trimmer that was about four plus years old, and falling apart.  This new one is so much better. It works fast, feels good in my hand, and trims just as I want.  My beard is slightly longer than Wolf Blitzer on CNN. I use the rigid guide, and set the trimmer at 6mm, for a perfect beard.  I remove the guide to trim my mustache, which I like natural length, just trimmed above my mouth, unlike Wolf, who looks like he runs the trimmer flat over his mustache.  The trimmer is easy to clean, and tells you how much charge is left.  The old one simply slowed down, when it needed a recharge, and then it took ten hours to recharge.  This one charges in an hour</li>
            <li> Decent enough trimmer, but after 6 weeks of ownership, it no longer holds a charge.&lt;br /&gt;After fully charging the unit, it&#x27;s good for no more than 3 trims - that&#x27;s less than 10 minutes of actual usage.&lt;br /&gt;I informed Norelco customer service of the issue.&lt;br /&gt;That was a positive experience since they made a no-hassle warranty replacement of the unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for a long time and I generally get a new trimmer every 3 years. At least, that&#x27;s been the average life of the trimmers  I&#x27;ve had. I bought this Phillips Vacuum trimmer after reading reviews online and determining which would suit me best. My previous trimmer was a Wahl Lithium battery unit, which I was quite fond of but bit the dust after 3 years. Most of my comparison will be to the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like best about this Phillips trimmers is its design and ergonomics. It has the same tactile rubbery plastic that my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush has, though with a black face for masculinity. It fits well in my hand and feels substantial and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the adjustable length guide and the digital display. My biggest downside with my previous trimmer was that I had over a dozen attachments to keep track of. Also unlike my old razor, this Phillips does not require oil. It trims my beard very well and its easy to dial in the perfect length. Previously, Id trim on the short side and let it grow in. Not so with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big selling point of this trimmer is obviously the vacuum. It does work very well. I&#x27;d say it traps about 70% of the trimmings and the rest land in the sink. You would need to empty the chamber multiple times if you&#x27;re doing serious trimming duty, as it is pretty small. The vacuum is ideal for the lady friend because girls hate hair in the sink. At least that&#x27;s been my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My most prominent difficulty with this trimmer is that it is quite imprecise for edging. Because the vacuum surrounds the blades, it&#x27;s difficult to see where you&#x27;re going. I&#x27;m getting used to it, but my previous trimmer was much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also lacks power compared to my previous one. I always use &#x27;turbo mode&#x27; because regular just doesn&#x27;t have the speed and vacuum power that is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to edging difficultiesand lack of power, the blades are much larger than previous trimmers I&#x27;ve had. This means that its difficult to get close on cheeks and for neck shaving. It gets it down to a fine stubble, but for a smooth neck you&#x27;ll need an additional razor. Luckily, stubble is in fashion. So, i just let it be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the battery is good for about two weeks with daily use. My Wahl went about 6 months on its first charge and it was much more powerful. The Phillips redeems itself by having the fastest charging time I&#x27;ve seen with a digital display of battery life. I charge it with a similar cycle to my Sonicare. The downside of the low life is that I have bring the charger with me if I travel, and a travel case was not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Verdict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this trimmer. If they can address the issues I pointed out, it&#x27;ll be perfect. It&#x27;s great for beard trimming but bad for edging and neck shaving. I&#x27;m getting used to it and can tolerate its shortcomings because it does everything else so well.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FIRST USE OF A BEARD TRIMMER .I CHOSE THIS MODEL AFTER REVIEWING NUMEROUS BEARD TRIMMERS OFFERED THROUGH AMAZON .THE EASE OF A SINGLE, MULTIPLE LENGTH SETTING , WITHOUT HAVING TO ATTACH VARIOUS COMBS , AND THE VACUUM SYSTEM SOLD ME. NO LUBRICATION/MAINTENANCE WAS THE OTHER SELLING POINT. I BOUGHT THE TRIMMER VIA AMAZON AND IT CAME 2 DAYS EARLY ON STANDARD SHIPPING . BUT THE REAL TEST WAS HOW IT WORKED .IT TRIMMED MY HALF INCH BEARD DOWN TO 1/8TH INCH - WHICH I SET IT TO -IN LESS THAN 3 MINUTES. NO PULLING EVEN GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ,A VERY PRECISE AN COMFORTABLE TRIM WITH NO MESS. A SUPERB PRODUCT!  JIM G.</li>
            <li> I got this product after trying its lesser model, the QT4050. I was not impressed with the weak vacuum in the QT4050, and promptly returned it. After looking through the reviews, I decided to get the QT4070 to give it one last shot before I gave up and stuck with my trusty Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum on this model appears to be more powerful, picking up all my shorter hairs, and only having a bit of trouble with longer hairs. I found when I tried to go fast over longer areas I lost a lot of hair to the floor. A fix for this was to simply go slow when long hairs were concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big plus for this model is the removable guard. I have ridiculously sensitive skin. Sensitive enough that I tear with even the gentlest of razors, so I&#x27;m forced to rely on trimmers such as this one for day to day shaving. The static guard on the QT4050 meant I could never get anywhere near a close trim with it, always leaving me with a decent amount of stubble. The QT4070 allows me to remove the guard entirely, leaving me with as close a trim as possible. (I did not check if this was possible on the QT4050, so I may be wrong)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t on the description, but I did get the \\&quot;contour\\&quot; guard alongside the non-contour guard. For those of you that keep a beard, it&#x27;ll be nice to have. Unfortunately, I do not know if it is just a fluke that it was included with mine, so be ready to take a gamble on it if you need it. That being said, I expect the pro model to have everything the standard model has, and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After reading through the reviews, I came across this review that mentions the status of the contour comb guard thingy http://www.amazon.com/review/RYVNB0DI05PLJ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B003U8ESI4&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some negative reviews about the hair bay. To be honest, I don&#x27;t see the issue. The bay is easily accessed, if not slightly difficult to open without fingernails. I consider that to be a positive thing though, as an easy open hatch would be prone to opening by mistake. My advice if you&#x27;re worried is to open it over the trash barrel. You&#x27;re going there anyways, might as well be diligent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with it is the lack of any type of stand or case. When traveling, I don&#x27;t like leaving things like this loose. I&#x27;ll just get a cheap split leather pouch for it, but I really shouldn&#x27;t have to. As for the stand, It&#x27;s not a big deal, but I still shouldn&#x27;t have to do without.</li>
            <li> I use it 3 times per week. And I love it. I have never used better beard trimmer in my life!</li>
            <li> Could be better; A good tool to have</li>
            <li> Honestly, if it wasn&#x27;t for the vacuum (which only picks up 50-70%) I would return this.  Does NOT cut well.  Hard to trim mustache area, and most importantly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery drains within minutes after just a month or two of use.  I literally must bring the charger with me if I go anywhere.</li>
            <li> Excellent trims with no mess.</li>
            <li> up until i got this i was using a conair hair cutting kit to trim my beard. im happy i found this through dappered.com</li>
            <li> Good trimmer though it was kind of bulky!  Much larger than what is convenient in a beard/moustache trimmer.  The vacuum function was nice but it did not keep all whiskers from ending up in the sink. Overall I could not get used to the size and ended up returning it...</li>
            <li> i get the item its a vary good shaver . i like it</li>
            <li> Effective and precise. Battery doesn&#x27;t last very much if using the turbo function. Other than that, quite happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance, I would have loved it except they didn&#x27;t even package the charger or the different style options.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid so far. Takes a bit of time to get use to the length of the guard since you don&#x27;t immediately see how much you are trimming due to the&lt;br /&gt;vacuum system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better power than my previous Philips Norelco and battery life is as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with it,but wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a 5 Star trimmer.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Keeps my stubble just the length at which I like it.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any competitive product.</li>
            <li> I am new to trimmers and found this one easy to use and effective. There is still &amp;#34;spillage&amp;#34; of hair in the sink but much less than using scissors. Sufficient power and battery life. Light and small for travel.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Norelco T980 that I had used for 7 years with this new model Norelco QT4070. I had put off replacing the old one for a few years as I read reviews that gave problems. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this new model. It works much better than the old model, looks nicer, and has the lighted digital reading of what length you have it set at. Also the Quick Charge is better/great. I find no problem whatsoever with it.</li>
            <li> Item is excellent!  Easy to use and long battery life.  Love the compartment that vacuums hair for no mess trimming</li>
            <li> Title says it all. It&#x27;s a great trimmer, does not cut when used without the head. Trims well and the hoover suction is brilliant. I have noticed though, there will always be one patch in a random area that I need to go over a couple extra times to get the same length as the rest of my face. No biggie though. An extra 20 seconds doesn&#x27;t kill.</li>
            <li> My previous version of this item finally died (not even corded would work...the motor must have busted) and I liked how it vacuumed up stray hair so much I bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how the stupid little door clasp/hinge could break, but so far mine is holding up. The container on the previous version was a much better option. This one is harder to clean too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least it looks more streamlined, and functions more or less identically. There is an LED for the mm you are trimming at, in case you care about such things. The block shape keeps it from rolling around so much as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> The battery has already lost it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge. It has to be plugged in at all times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I had an older similar older Norelco I liked better.</li>
            <li> Trimmer cuts fine but vacuum function doesn&#x27;t work well. Catches about half what it cuts, so you still have to clean up. Turbo mode doesn&#x27;t help much either. Battery lasts a long time. I would just buy the cheaper model without the vacuum part.</li>
            <li> A beard trimmer that actually collects the trimmings! Before I justed used normal hair clippers to trim my facial hair and my bathroom would look like I killed a yeti in there. The Philips beard trimmer has a little vacuum that sucks the trimmings into a little internal bay which you just open and tip out into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Love the big internal dial that adjusts the length of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;  Small recharging plug, not one of those big bricks that suck up two power plug spaces&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can&#x27;t really use it for trimming your head hair due to the design of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep trying to give Philips a chance with these trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum in this trimmer is totally useless, adds unnecessary bulk, and creates unnecessary noise. The hair guard is pretty decent, and gives you loads of options, so big plus there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the overall shave, it&#x27;s pretty inconsistent. My beard isn&#x27;t particularly coarse, and doesn&#x27;t grow in a bunch of crazy directions, yet it&#x27;s still a bit of a chore to get an even shave with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you never used the older Philips T series from the late 90&#x27;s, you&#x27;d never know what you&#x27;re missing. On the other hand, if you have, this is further proof that you can&#x27;t go home again.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my son&#x27;s birthday. It works perfect and he is very happy.</li>
            <li> Amazing beard trimmer. I had a older model of the same trimmer and this replaces it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Has many different sizes 1-10 that lights up in a nice big red LED number.&lt;br /&gt;Trims my beard great. I trim it with the 3 setting.&lt;br /&gt;The turbo button is nice and I always have it on so it has enough power to suck the trimmings up.&lt;br /&gt;I will always stick with Norelco beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> IN APPROX 2.5 YEARS THE TRIMMER STOPPED WORKING (BATTERY) YOU CAN NOT OPEN TO CHANGE IT. I LIKE TO BYU ONCE FOR A LONG TIME. 7300 WAS THE BEST TRIMMER OF THE YEAR. ONE STAR NOW.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought it and I have the stubble look all the time. I don&#x27;t shave with a razor anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I shave my head, I use my norelco for that too.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and neat, powerful, and precise.&lt;br /&gt;Although the vacuum doesn&#x27;t really work that well so don&#x27;t count on it vacuuming or you&#x27;ll end up with hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected good quality ear trimmer with the  vacuum</li>
            <li> If your a guy that likes to manage your beard and you hate having to clean up the mess afterwards then this is then beard trimmer for you. Im really impressed with the battery life and the precision length adjustments. The trimmer vacuum collects a majority of the trimmed hairs and clean up is a breeze would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve own so far.  I&#x27;m glad it now comes with the contour head other wise I don&#x27;t think I would have got it. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and use it for daily trimming, which is what I recommend it for.  If you want to cut an inch off your bread this isn&#x27;t the tool for the job.  But it has done a nice job on keeping my beard nice and trimmed.  The vacuum system is nice giving me less to clean up than my old trimmer.  The trimmer is a good size doesn&#x27;t feel too small or big and it has a good weight.  It also looks and feels solidly made. I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once so far and taken it on a 3 day business trip. It&#x27;s good for trips once you know which attachment of the two you like you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem so far is the brush, It&#x27;s about and inch long and quarter inch wide. The brush doesn&#x27;t fit anywhere so it just sit off to the side and I&#x27;m afraid i&#x27;ll loose it one of these days cause it just so small. So Philips if you&#x27;re ready this find a way to put the brush in the handle of the trimmer like have a little spot that you could snap it in and out, and it would near perfect.  The price is also up there, this probably the most I would spend on a trimmer but I&#x27;m still very please with my purchase and would say it&#x27;s worth the $52.40 I paid on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;feels good&lt;br /&gt;well made&lt;br /&gt;now has contour attachment&lt;br /&gt;vacuum system is nice&lt;br /&gt;good battery life&lt;br /&gt;few head attachments (2 to be exact)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;small brush and nowhere to put it&lt;br /&gt;price (the most expensive trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased but I&#x27;m still very happy with it)</li>
            <li> Works fine, but I&#x27;ve had problems: (1) it seems that you can accidentally trim closer than the setpoint by tipping the trimmer at just the right angle; (2) the battery is starting to get weak, after only 6 months; (3) the door latch on the hair bin broke, so I sort of have to hold it shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it works OK but I&#x27;m unimpressed with the durability after 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it catches about 80% of trimmed hair. Make sure to clean out the space that &amp;#34;holds&amp;#34; the caught hair - sometimes I have to dump it out halfway through a trim to keep the suction power at max. Battery lasts a long time, charges quickly. The locking function is wonderful, I can lock it and toss it in my luggage for international flights, and it never turns on unexpectedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Now comes with a crappy looking RED dial, not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace my old T-970. Whatever problems there were with the combs or whatever else, I found nothing whatsoever lacking with the QT4070. Versatile, includes both combs, and performs up to and above expectations.</li>
            <li> I am still shocked by the battery life: 2 months I have been using it, and I still have not put it on charge... I have started wondering if there&#x27;s something wrong with it. I doubt Philips would accept to take it back though. Too bad then I am forced to continue using the most awesome beard trimmer I have had in 15 years of beard trimming.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cut very short as advertised</li>
            <li> the vacuum thing on it doesn&#x27;t work all that great but cuts okay. This was a husband gift and he kinda likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually never owned any other trimmer/shaver before.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews on other trimmers and made the decision to buy this trimmer a few days ago.  The trimmer 4070/4071 does indeed come with both combs, which has the contour following comb(which apparently wasn&#x27;t included in original release)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like being able to charge it in one hour out of the box, and being able to use it up to 50 minutes.  The different length settings up to 18mm, was the main factor. I wanted to be able to maintain a longer length and not be contained to shorter lengths only for my beard.  The vacuum portion has helped keep less hairs in the sink when trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, The price was a factor when I went ahead and bought this trimmer.  I thought to myself, I don&#x27;t want to waste $20-30 dollars on a cheaper trimmer and find out that I don&#x27;t really like it, because I was too cheap to buy a more expensive trimmer with features I wanted. I would then have to buy another trimmer, after losing money on a trimmer with less functionality. I consider this an investment in my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in a few months down the road, with a better overall opinion compared to this first impression of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have had. It gives a close shave and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it and his beard looks great.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has two major faults.  There is no separate mustache guard which makes it very difficult to use on the mustache area as it is far too wide.  The vacuum is completely useless as most of the hair still falls to whatever surface is below your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is very good and the battery/length indicator works well.  The beard guard works effectively on non-mustache areas of the face.</li>
            <li> After reading other review complaining about the gap in the comb and uneven shaving I was hesitant but I bought it anyway. I&#x27;m glad I did. It seems Phillips heeds customer complaints because mine came with both combs (the one pictured as well as the Contour Following Comb). I immediatley removed the attached comb and put on the countour comb and I have to say its the best trimmer I have owned. I use the stubble setting and I get a nice even shave all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use it in &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; fan mode and the vaccum sucks up about 90% of the hairs which is fantastic. The battery life is amazing. I use it for about 30 minutes at a time and it lasts me about 5 uses (I use it once a week so that 5 weeks). The hight adjustment have a positive click to them and they lock in place, much better than my previouse Norelco Beard Trimmer. This one doesn&#x27;t lose its hight setting. Ive used this for about 2 month now, thats about 10 shaves, and have not a single problem. The door has not broken off as other people claim in their reviews. I suppose if you manhandle it you could break it but it&#x27;s not as flimsy as some of the reviewrs claim it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone in a heart beat. Can&#x27;t be beat for the price. It works like a champ!</li>
            <li> My T980 has finally bit the dust after many years of reliable servers - the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold charge, and even running plugged in would barely crank the motor. So I ordered this as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news:&lt;br /&gt;- contour following comb was included in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news:&lt;br /&gt;- everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- vacuum performs much worse than T980 - I have to clean up far more after even a casual trim. Lots of stubble in the sink everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;- the shape of the trimmer is far less ergonomic than T980, less convenient to hold&lt;br /&gt;- the motor is louder and higher pitched. Trimming the sideburns with the noise right in your ear is rather unpleasant&lt;br /&gt;- the blade mechanism functions slightly differently (no dropping shutter on the trimmer), and cleaning it out is less convenient&lt;br /&gt;- no carrying case&lt;br /&gt;- after just two months of moderate use the battery would not hold charge any more. Unfortunately I&#x27;m out of the return window with Amazon, so I will have to take with Norelco and try to get the warranty replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This was so easy to use.  And to have the vacuum built in so that all the hairs are easy to dispose of when you are done shaving and trimming.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Philips Norelco G390 beard &amp; mustache trimmer which I&#x27;ve had over 4 years so there were no doubts in my mind that Philips Norelco was a good brand to go with especially the QT4070. Despite the 1-3 star reviews I went ahead and bought the machine and it seems that Philips Norelco has decided to ship the beard guide which comes with the QT4050 model as an additional attachment apart from the one that comes as a standard with the QT4070 model. I guess they read the 1-3 star reviews and found that a majority of them expressed dissatisfaction with the beard guide and the effect of the trimmer blades, which are indeed over exposed on the beard guide, cutting lips or stabbing faces so they decided to include the additional comb/guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from this the trimmer is well made and the designed thought out with a stylish touch to it with the LCD which indicates the battery level and trimmer size setting once adjusted. If you are an avid eletric beard trimmer user then you would see that the guiding comb (both of them) comes in handy and can be used over several application. I like the fact that the trimmer takes a minimum of an hour to charge for full use and they (Philips Norelco) experimented with a vacuum to catch the hair in a compartment which could work as an advantage (for users with short beards) or disadvantage (for users with long beards). Maybe next time they can just eliminate the vacuum compartment...since not all of the hair will get caught...and use the space for a bigger lithium-ion battery so that would add to customer advantage of longer batter life (just a personal suggestion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product does stand out for me and gives me one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had and this is solely gauging from my previous PN product and based on this I would recommend this to person&#x27;s looking for a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t break the bank and offers a quality shave.</li>
            <li> I got it last week and up to now works great. The only issue i had was the battery indicator not being very accurate. Vacuum works  great and is very easy to use</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Cuts closer and some areas of face than others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a beard trimmer for several years to replace my old Norelco and this is it. It cuts clean and has pretty decent suction. I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s compact and easy to use. For people like me whose facial hair tends to grown in one direction, the flat blade (as opposed to the circular types) makes it easier to get my hair length to what I want it to be. People have said the product is noisy but I don&#x27;t feel that way. If you put it in Turbo mode, then it&#x27;s a bit noisy but not so much. The positive attributes are the comb, which directs the hair in a particular way if you wish to have a longer length; and the adjustable hair lengths is the other positive attribute. The best part is the vacuum feature where I have not had to clean up a single mess. Plus, the product comes with a tiny brush to clean up the hair.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be unsatisfactory in many ways and sent it back for a refund after a couple of trials. The three biggest problems were that the trimmer pulled, rather than trimming, my hairs. It was very uncomfortable to use and, because of the pulling, did not result in an even trim. Second, the vacuum feature did not work to pull the trimmed hairs into the device; instead, it seemed to scatter the hairs all over the sink and the surrounding area to a much greater extent than my previous trimmer, that did not have a built-in vacuum. Lastly, while the unit claimed to be able to hold an extra-long charge, in the two instances that I used it, the charge was completely gone after single and relatively brief beard trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I replaced this product with the Norelco Multigroom 3100, which I have found to be completely satisfactory. It does not have a vacuum, but it does not broadcast the hairs during trimming. It also does not pull my hair and has a charge that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I have been a loyal Norelco user and was glad to be able to replace the inadequate trimmer with one which measures up to the quality I expect from the company.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  The little Norelco beard trimmers keep getting better &amp; better!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! After many different purchases that were not satisfactory, this razor hits the spot. My husband finds it delivers everything it promised.</li>
            <li> Loved it initially. It was exactly what I was looking for, sleek, easy to read number system. Even came with a blade guard attachment that you could use for your more sensitive bits. Then the problems started. First it was the LED number system no longer read the correct height. I would just stay on three no matter the height. I could have lived with that since I&#x27;m not an idiot and can figure out which one it&#x27;s on. But the real kicker was when the battery died. The unit just started blinking orangish unless it&#x27;s plugged in then it works. This was after 3 or 4 uses. So much for cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I was a little sad that this happened. I had high hopes for this unit, but in the end I&#x27;m just returning it.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great. It&#x27;s a good replacement for my old Norelco T-770 that is dying a slow death. My QT4070 came in a different color than pictured-red trim-, but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me. Mine also came with the Contour Comb. Some reviewers complain that it was missing in theirs.</li>
            <li> I love the precision of this trimmer.  If you hit your lip with it your are not doing it right.  I did hit my lip, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.  The vacuum feature works great.  I would like to see the nose and ear trimmer like this.</li>
            <li> When I first got this it worked very well for about 3 months then it broke.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this, said to be very good and easy to clean</li>
            <li> I recently decided to grow facial hair and I bought this trimmer based on reviews I read.  I don&#x27;t have experiences with other trimmers, but I can say I am perfectly happy with this trimmer.  I have had it for a couple months now and I do not have any complaints.  It does a nice job trimming and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; my hair instead of cutting it.  The trimmer is very simple to adjust for the length you desire and cleaning is a breeze.  The battery seems to last quite a while as well.  I can go through an entire week of trimming (ever other day) without having to worry about plugging in the trimmer.  Also, if you travel a lot, this trimmer has the ability to lock the power button so it isn&#x27;t accidently turned on in your travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note, I maintain short facial hair (3-5mm range).  I haven&#x27;t tried these trimmers with longer facial hair.</li>
            <li> Great job keeping those peaky whiskers in control.  Works great on my husbands very thick roughage.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer.  While better than my previous, the vacuum catches about 85% of the trimmings (even on the turbo setting) so it is not perfect.  It has great battery life and a powerful motor so it doesn&#x27;t pull whiskers. The power adapter is rated from 110 to 240v so it works for overseas travel.  (Worked for me Shanghai.  Most outlets in China have the universal adapter face built-in already.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one &amp; ONLY gripe: this thing REALLY needs a travel pouch!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price/features ratio made this one the best choice for me.  So yes, if I lost it or left it in a hotel room, I would buy another just like it.</li>
            <li> Vacuum system work very poor. It wont be wrong to say that it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Battery life is just 30 mins as opposed to 50 state din the item description. extremely dissappojnted</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer. I thought that the contour trimming comb works pretty well. It does help giving an even stubble beard. The vacuum does work, somewhat (you can expect a few pieces to fall off from the trimmer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few concerns though with the vacuum design: the vacuum container seems a bit too small (fills up quickly with the trimmed hair). The door to remove the accumulated hair is a little fragile (could easily break). The blades were on the same height as the vacuum entrance. So, if you are trying to give a close trim without the comb, you might need to use a different shaver/trimmer.</li>
            <li> I like it, works so good &amp; it work wile charging.</li>
            <li> great all around ,no complaints</li>
            <li> I received my new trimmer last week and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time to shave my thick beard and it worked fine, just as expected.&lt;br /&gt;It is really easy to be used and so smooth, you will certainly love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for you guys !&lt;br /&gt;I have attached a picture of the trimmer that I have received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:The color that I have received is black and white, I was expecting to get the other color shown on the first picture but this issue is not a big deal.</li>
            <li> HE loves it as much as I do..... not as much mess and easy to empty and  clean!  Cuts great!  The battery doesn&#x27;t last long but otherwise its awesome!</li>
            <li> Works great! Ordered another one...</li>
            <li> I previously had a Philips Norelco beard trimmer that was pretty good. Finally decided to replace it when it was about 5 years old, because it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge. This one&#x27;s 6 months old. The catch that holds the door closed on the  collection compartment is broken and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 2 uses.</li>
            <li> This was purchased in an attempt to stop the &amp;#34;you left hair all over our sink&amp;#34; arguments with my wife. It has certainly helped. I keep my beard short, nearly stubble, and this trimmer works quick and with no pull. I do wish the vacuum was a bit stronger but honestly, I have nothing to compare it to and it DOES catch a good portion of the hair. This thing also holds a charge. I mean it HOLDS a charge. I use it 2 - 3 times a week and I&#x27;ve charged it maybe 3 times in a little over 2 months. The digital display is a nice touch and clearly tells you what setting it&#x27;s on and how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer as a replacement for the earlier model (given to me as a gift). I really like how it trims my beard, the vacuum feature, and its ability to hold a charge. The vacuum feature makes a big difference in terms of cleaning up the sink and counter after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this newer model because the beard trimmings door latch broke. I can still use the old one by using masking tape to replace the latch, but this makes cleanup a lot more trouble (beard trimmings stick to the tape too). I&#x27;d traveled a bit with the older trimmer, so I figured that it must&#x27;ve reacted poorly to packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model arrived. More power, better vacuum feature, ability to use it plugged in if battery is low (older model didn&#x27;t allow that). Nice! Really nice to have the trimmings door latch working again... but not for long!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only 7 - 8 months of weekly use and used only at home (so it wasn&#x27;t banged up in luggage), guess what stopped working? Yup, the trimmings door latch. REALLY? I babied this trimmer, and it just stopped latching again. Wow... back to the tape trick (escaping from that was my main motivation behind ordering this newer model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That just sucks.</li>
            <li> Sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;Not able to do closer trimming and in smaller areas.</li>
            <li> Works great to clean up my beard when I let it get too long.</li>
            <li> Have used several times and found this product has good battery life. The digital cutting length is a very nice feature. Seems to have more suction than previous models. The door for chamber seems more substantial than prior model. Very pleased with trimmer.</li>
            <li> Pros - holds a charge and charges fast, neat display, vac actually works, you can use it plugged in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - I use it on my neck and cheeks with a full beard. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my old Panasonic did. It also doesn&#x27;t cut as long. The door that collects the clippings broke after a couple weeks and doesn&#x27;t click closed anymore.</li>
            <li> Received in good order. Works great.</li>
            <li> This is intended to not be comprehensive, a lot of folks have done an awesome job with the pros and cons, I don&#x27;t see a need to rehash all that information.  I have used Norelco trimmers for ages and have loved some and hated some, but I always expected two basic things.  The ability to set a height for beard/mustache/eyebrow/whatever trimming and then the ability to take the comb off and trim up close and personal.  This trimmer delivers famously on the first one.  Unfortunately, the nature of the vacuum intake makes the second one impossible.  Once you pop off the comb, you just can&#x27;t get close enough to do that fine tuning you would expect from a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Does the job, I wish it had more power</li>
            <li> Excellent Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> Does part of the job, but could work better... still lots of hair on the sink.</li>
            <li> used for about one year and love it. trims easily and evenly.</li>
            <li> works great, the vacuum system is a must have.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace an earlier model where the battery burned out.  This new model has a better design, is more comfortable, comes with two heads to guide the trimming process.  The trimmer has more minute legnths for trimming.  It is quite, accurate  and does the job.  It can be switched off so the trimmer does not start buzzing in your luggage when travelling.  There were a few mixed reviews on this model but I took the risk based on my prior model.  I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with its design and how well it works.</li>
            <li> This thing works great. Catches probably around 90% of the hair. I can see why some people have had problems with the shavings door, but as long as you&#x27;re mindful of that when opening it you shouldn&#x27;t break it.</li>
            <li> Works as described, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. Works great! would but again.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great in allowing me to grow a standard beard/mustache that will go well with my nazi youth haircut and black V neck sweater accented by a plaid collared checkered shirt as I sip on and pretend to know all there is to know about coffee and/or craft beer while discussing the unfairness imposed on poor people.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! It allows me to maintain permastubble.</li>
            <li> Easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Pay attention to more recent reviews, the unit now comes with two different guides.  I personally prefer the fixed guide, since I trim my beard very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main advantage, the vacuum feature is awesome, especially on high speed.  Still a little hair to rinse away, but it catches the vast majority of trimmings.</li>
            <li> I was hestiant to purchase this product based on some of the negative reviews I read.  However, since I&#x27;ve owned 2 previous Norelco beard shavers with vacuum, I decided to ignore the bad reviews.  Glad I did.  No problems.  It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The main reasons for my purchase was the vacuum system that captures hair inside the trimmer handle as you cut. The door broke after less than 2-months... hair all over the place. I now have a rubber band around it, which can cause the adjustment to move. It is either a poor design or a cheap plastic part. Before this problem I was ready to purchase one for a friend.</li>
            <li> Just dont ever rinse the head off.  Took me a while to realize that you could disassemble it to clean it out. :P</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Battery life is good. Looks slick and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a trimmer Pro!  Love the vacuum! No more hairy sinks!&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to be a pro to use.</li>
            <li> Great none better take from a guy who has had a beard for 45 years</li>
            <li> HAD TO RETURN WAS IRRITATING MY SKIN....NOT GOOD FOR ME...THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER...</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer itself, it is really great. Yeah, some of the hair still falls, what can you do. Cleanup takes a bit of time as well. But for what it is designed to do I think it is really good. BUT - I am on my 3rd unit after only 5 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first unit broke when the latch to the little door broke off. It renders the entire unit useless because the door is integral and cannot be replaced, nor is it easy or convenient to use it with the door opening while you shave - it makes a mess. So, after some trouble with customer service (they wanted to send me the QT4050 as a replacement - why would I want a cheaper unit?) I got a replacement. Things were going well until one morning - NADA. the unit wouldn&#x27;t turn on, power, charge or function in any way. Customer service was better this time - sending me a new unit no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will see how this one does, but my expectations are low at this point. So just make sure you register it because you may be talking to customer service a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;NOW ON MY 6th UNIT! The door latch only seems to last about 5-6 months no matter how gentle you treat it. I lowered my rating to 2 stars as I cannot recommend a product that breaks this often.</li>
            <li> Vacuum isn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped, but it provides a great shave and I love the digital display.</li>
            <li> ETA. The replacement unit had the same problem as the original, the latch failed after 20 or so uses. I am using a rubber band now to keep the hatch closed, as I frankly don&#x27;t have the time to go through the return process again. Other than that, it is a great trimmer. Now updated down to three star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great trimmer for the &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock&amp;#34; look. The vacuum system works really well, very few whiskers in the sink. *however*, as other have stated, the latch on the unit to release the cut whiskers does break. First time, Philips replaced it for me, no problems asked (hence 4 star review). In fact, Philips support was probably the best I have ever experienced. When a gold box sale came up for another, I picked up another one.,spare. I think I could use a rubber band to secure the hatch, if the latch breaks. This thing works too well, so I give the latch a break.</li>
            <li> Does a great job trimming.  Seen other comments suggesting that it cuts an uneven length due to hinged comb-head not following facial contours.  Well I have not found this at all.  I have used both the hinged and fixed comb-heads and find both work perfectly.  I prefer the fixed head because I find it easier to manipulate but not by much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down side is that it is not as good at catching all the cuts hairs as perhaps I would like.  But it does a pretty good job.  You just have to keep emptying the little catcher, and expect to do a tiny bit of clean-up when you have finished.  But it is much better than just dropping cut hairs everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I would highly recommend this unit for keeping a beard smartly trimmed.</li>
            <li> One of the best around according to my husband.</li>
            <li> Good function and easy to use. Appears to also hold the charge well.</li>
            <li> I originally got this because I had a nice beard going... now I just use safety razor to shave. As for this product? Yeah, I use to trim my ball hair.</li>
            <li> I had one of the older styles of Norelco trimmers that I wore out.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one and it works so much better, the turbo vac&lt;br /&gt;system is great. I use this both on my head and beard.</li>
            <li> this product is recommended to me and it performs exactly is it was supposed to. Very easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace the older version of the same product. My man and I love this trimmer and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Works great for me. I&#x27;ve had it a couple weeks trims as well as i would want a trimmer to!</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer/vac, but is missing some of the things that would make it an outstanding one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the good bits. It cuts hair easily and effectively unlike some that make the right noises, but no noticeable difference to your beard. The vacuum is, I would guess, about 90% effective at capturing the hair, and the attachments are both easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the not so good. The battery life is not as good as my Norelco shaver. After a week of light use (4 times for about 2 mins each time), I set the travel lock and made a trip to New York State. When I broke it out to use it there it was dead... My shaver went strong for the next two weeks of daily use! I know it&#x27;s new and I should have charged it again, but come on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other bug bear is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel case (unlike a Norelco shaver). A small detail I know, but that would make this $50 shaver great value.</li>
            <li> Job well done&lt;br /&gt;Trimming is great and fast. the vacuum is not 100% accurate but like 95% .&lt;br /&gt;the colors are very bad black vs white vs ...&lt;br /&gt;the design is very great (easy to handle and light).&lt;br /&gt;But between this and the new generation philips 5100 ( I tried both of them) the last is easier to handle and to use. also it has a precision trimmer which is great. but it&#x27;s slower than this 1 in trimming (no turbo). so if you don&#x27;t want the vacuum go with 5100 or 9100.</li>
            <li> I had been through a few of these trying to replace an old Remington.  I finally tried this one and it&#x27;s been great for over 2 years.  Seldom needs charging, gets through my beard with ease.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Got this based on the reviews and am very pleased.  As other reviewers have pointed out the contour head works best and I guess Norelco heard the complaints and now supply both.  It&#x27;s a very nice product my only suggestion for improvement would be to make it quieter.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has a vacuum but the thing is it doesn&#x27;t really vacuum all&lt;br /&gt;of the trimmed hair. As a trimmer alone it is well worth the price. The vacuum also&lt;br /&gt;works, just not perfect.</li>
            <li> HAS THE POWER I NEED BUT TAKES COUPLE PASSES TO CUT .OK.TURBO FUNCTION GOOD BUT STILL LEAVES STUBBLE IN FUNELL</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips trimmer. My first one lasted 2 1/2 years before the battery went bad. This trimmer works awesome. It captures about 50% of the trimmings, which I guess is better than none but you still will have a little mess to clean up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my norelco beard trimmer for almost 14 years and loved it. The trimmer finally started to wear out, so it was time to shop for a new one. I did my homework on the new model norelco, but had concerns over some reviews I read concerning the&lt;br /&gt;adjustable blade guard being sharp edged and nicking users. I will tell you this problem was more the fixed. It trims better than my old one and is faster as well. I highly recommend this trimmer. I also include a fresh bottle of Wahl clipper oil which is a must to maintain your trimmer.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use without the guard as the vacuum part of it gets in the way. Meh</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome but has one major flaw...It doesn&#x27;t come with a smaller detailing blade for the stash.</li>
            <li> Very good quality build.  I did break the latch for the hair storage area door, but have been able to keep using by holding it shut while in use.  Buyers beware that the door latch is a bit cheap so be careful when opening and closing as well as when tapping the hair out.  Other than that very good device.  Love the turbo mode!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I had hoped for great beard trimmer</li>
            <li> If James Bond had a beard, he&#x27;d trim it with one of these. More precise and better feel than the Conair.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my husband in December and it broke already in March. When I say it broke I mean that it randomly turns on (both when its plugged into the wall charging and when it is unpluged) and you can&#x27;t remove the battery so it is a fire hazard as it will become warm after being on for a period of time. It worked well in terms of the shave but after only having it for a 3 months it started turing itself on randomly. We are very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This does not meet my expectations.  It is poorly designed and cheaply constructed.  The &amp;#34;depth head&amp;#34; is uncomfortable moving across your beard or face.  The cutting &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; are very difficult to use for trimming: difficult to see in the mirror, first of all, because of the design, and difficult to just use because of how they sit in the housing.  The cheap construction has not made an impact, but it will.  The touted &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; of shaven hair might be mildly useful, if it actually worked.  About 1/3 of the hair does not get pulled into the collection area.  If have to clean the sink of hair anyway, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s three times as much.  So why did I give it 2 stars instead of one?  Well, it is usable, if you work at it.  Hairs will be cut, and they might even be cut the length you want (if you work at it).</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for almost 3+ months. Initially i loved it as it replaced my aged trimmer which was not doing a good job. But after a few weeks i have second thoughts of this trimmer. Background : i keep a 3-4 mm beard in general with occasional 2mm cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum is a little effective with pulling in next to 70-80% hair in the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- holds good charge and overall does a decent job trimming&lt;br /&gt;- no pulling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Loud has hell ( wife hates it)&lt;br /&gt;- not washable which i think is a deal breaker as it is tricky to clean after use. there is a dingy brush which i lost already.&lt;br /&gt;- there are times when one may feel it trims unevenly&lt;br /&gt;- cant get hard to reach areas ( under nose etc) or do a precision cut with blade on. My old trimmer did it will as the settings were without comb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me the return window is long gone so i ended up buying another trimmer after 3 months of this use. For what its worth, try another trimmer and dont go for vacuum marketing it is a OK feature coz you still need to clean 20% of the dirty sink, might as well clean 100%. My 2 cents, get a trimmer which is quieter and can atleast be washed under running water. For me it makes a lot of difference. I ended up buying Conair for Men® i-Stubble®  (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PXIR1W/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) . I havent used it yet but this one will be shelved.</li>
            <li> I have very thick whiskers and sensitive skin. I used to shave using the fusion pro glide and would eat through a cartridge in 2 weeks. This is an awesome product. The vacuum picks up about half the hair on normal, and maybe 80 percent on turbo mode. Easy to clean out, I use a fingernail brush, and just takes a quick swipe. I regularly apply a small amount of vegetable oil to blades as well, and the trimmer hasn&#x27;t bit me yet, even unguarded (just be slow and steady). Can use it daily, and in combination with some trimmers, I can be done in 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and would recommend to another.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this thing. I take very good care of my stuff. I&#x27;ve had this thing for around a week. When I was shaving at (I think 3mm) I noticed in the mirror the LED length display was flashing between 3 and 4mm. so I stopped and made sure that it was locked into place and everything seemed OK and the screen quit flashing. Well to make a long story short the calibration of the LED screen to the plastic guard was thrown off somehow. When I clicked the guard as low as it could go it read &amp;#34;2MM&amp;#34; on the LED screen, but was actually in the 1MM slot. I could not get it to click down to say &amp;#34;1MM&amp;#34; After playing with it for 10 minutes I moved the guard out as far as it could go (to the 18MM or whatever mark) and all the way back down, and sure enough I was back at 1 frickin MM on the display. Not sure exactly when everything was thrown off but my scruff looks like garbage right now, and the length is so low I cant fade it or anything. After playing with it for a little while more I noticed the guard does bend a little bit when you put pressure on it too. The vacuum didnt pick up a whole lot either. It actually takes longer to clean with the vacuum because I have to detail the vacuum chamber with a small brush on top of just swishing some water around in the sink and using a piece of toilet paper to mop up any hairs around the sink. Rumor has it the vacuum chamber door breaks after a while too. The blades on this thing are cheap, which I tried to overlook, but my little Wahl Lithium ION has way nicer blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about you dump the gimmicks, such as the LED display, Vacuum, and Turbo Button and just make a nice shaver that works? Quality Blade? Quality Guard? Etc?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Wahl lithium Ion groomsman as well and it is great, except when I try to use it for scruff the guard comb just rips hair out of my face, however I think I saw a WAHL stubble trimmer and I might just buy one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought 100 things off of amazon and this is the first thing that has actually made me angry</li>
            <li> Best Beard trimmer ever! Nice Norelco design.&lt;br /&gt;Great price on Amazon - I know I did a lot of research.</li>
            <li> Loved this. Gave it as a gift for Christmas but has stopped charging. Tried a similar charger from his old one. No more charging after 3 months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;m on line to replace this unit I bought about 1 year ago.  I read reviews before purchasing but thought it would not happen to me.  But the clasp for the trim container did break and I am now using a rubberband to keep it shut.  For some reason after charging it also drains out and I still have to use the cord to trim with.  I&#x27;m back to Remington!</li>
            <li> I tried this on numerous occasions and it consitently missed hairs or left whole areas much longer or much shorter than everywhere else.  I tried repeatedly going over and over the same spots from different directions.  After my face was rubbed raw from these attempts I gave up and returned it.  I need something that trims my beard and despite it&#x27;s name, this failed to do that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:  Vacuum collected most (not all) of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:  The contour following guide has a gap in the middle so it stabs you and allows certain areas to trim too closely.  The vacuum puts a gap between the blade and the guard so it is a little awkward/unusable trying to get a close/accurate trim from that direction.</li>
            <li> The adjustable head on this beard trimmer was exactly what I was looking for. I didn&#x27;t want to carry around multiple clips that I would have to attach to the clippers. The cut is really good, and the contour attachment makes cutting under my chin a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed in the vacuum capabilities of this trimmer. While it does catch a lot of hair, there is still a good amount that falls in the sink, and the way the head is designed, the hair keeps getting caught where the vacuum sucks the hair in. This blocks the clipper and you have to remove the hair before you can keep cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the trimmer works well, and I highly recommend for travel!</li>
