            <li>This is the best Magnesium Oil for foot soaks.</li>
            <li>This brand was reccommended to me by a very good source.</li>
            <li>I slept great</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully for me, so nice to be pain-free.</li>
            <li>Good product....</li>
            <li>better then taking a magnesium vitamin and a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li>and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>This is just amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product! :-)</li>
            <li>I love putting it on as it softens my skin although that is not my purpose for this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed it on my sore toe and sore hand and immediately these places felt better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and hope that anyone suffering from RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome) will give it a try.  </li>
            <li>She has gone through most of the medications recommended, was up to 11-13 pills a day, nothing was working</li>
            <li>Maybe with our food stripped of so many nutrients these days we are all deprived of magnesium.  </li>
            <li>A miracle product, for sure.</li>
            <li>but no one is sure</li>
            <li>I chose this particular brand for the best, most pure one to use.</li>
            <li>You have to remind yourself with products like this that if was really any good everyone would be talking about it.</li>
            <li>This spray is easy to use…..and my leg cramps disappear after a couple applications.  </li>
            <li>Also the fact that it is lab tested and certified at the source for purity and consistency is important to me.</li>
            <li>and so it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I suffer from metabolic syndrome and all the fun stuff that comes with it</li>
            <li>I rarely have this type of issue.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey compared to most other transdermal, but I have tried all the others offered on Amazon to try to save money and this worked the best for me</li>
            <li>A really remarkable product - stops pain dead in its tracks in the muscles of my legs and also the joints in my hands.</li>
            <li>I use it at night, after my shower, thinking it may be absorbed better when my pores are open.</li>
            <li>This is better than taking pills or capsules because it soaks right into your body and provides almost instant relief.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m telling you, amazonites, this stuff virtually erased several symptoms from my life--the number one and most debilitating being insomnia.</li>
            <li>Magnesium is critical to good health but can&#x27;t be added in bulk to multivitamins cause it would make the pill too big.  </li>
            <li>I was able to do a long hike without pain.</li>
            <li>I used really ache when it rained, but that stopped too.</li>
            <li>taken orally can prevent or stop episodes, but the amount you have to take is too much for your gastrointestinal tract to take.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for cramps.</li>
            <li>This product is an absolute lifesaver for me.  </li>
            <li>how much.</li>
            <li>DermaMag has helped me so much.</li>
            <li>It very well could have been that I had a deficiency in magnesium.</li>
            <li>She was diagnosed in 1984 back when even doctors weren&#x27;t familiar with it.  </li>
            <li>Magnesium is very hard for the body to absorb in any other form……this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>new healthcare practitioner suggested I try magnesium spray (she recommended DermaMag because of its purity and said spray was essential--magnesium supplements wouldn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews (who has time for jam like that??), but when I saw that this product only has 2 stars, I felt it was my civic duty to inform consumers that this stuff is AMAZING</li>
            <li>I use this in my busy massage practice.  </li>
            <li>tried applying it directly to my skin</li>
            <li>Natural Bengay ointment</li>
            <li>My Naturapath recommended this as a natural aid in lowering my blood pressure.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I used it every night for the first month and now I&#x27;m down to once every couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spent a peaceful night, cancelled my prescription the next day and haven&#x27;t looked back.  </li>

            <li> I used it every night for the first month and now I&#x27;m down to once every couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent a peaceful night, cancelled my prescription the next day and haven&#x27;t looked back.  </li>
            <li> I started taking this because I suffered from severe migraines, and also have trouble sleeping at night and muscle aches due to a old back injury.</li>
            <li> Since it stings a little I spray on less sensitive areas such as backside of body.&lt;br /&gt;You can not overdose on this as the body needs magnesium</li>
            <li> I spray on my thighs, rub it in, and allow 10 minutes without&lt;br /&gt;touching clothing for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> So i take a magnesium supplement (usually with potassium) but for larger doses, i supplement with a topical magnesium spray.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use by simply spraying on the painful area</li>
            <li> It did soften my rough elbows though.</li>
            <li> We take magnesium supplements anyway, and they&#x27;re a lot easier; maybe the supplements help and maybe they don&#x27;t - no real opinion on them either.</li>
            <li> My legs and feet cramp badly wIthout enough magnesium in my system, but spraying Derma Mag on them provides quick relief.  </li>
            <li> I started seeing results in my sleeping immediantly, my headaches got less severe  </li>
            <li> If it feels too sticky just use less.</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t cause irritation, but if it does, dilute with water or use less.  </li>
            <li> This is a woman that had been unable to sit still long enough to go to a movie, travel was a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> You just squirt some in a lukewarm foot bath and soak for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium</li>
            <li> This product changed my life and between this and taking Raw D, I have never experienced any supplements that have made a bigger difference in my life.</li>
            <li> I also rug in on my feet and notice they don&#x27;t ache as bad when I first walk on them in the morning.  </li>
            <li> This small bottle lasts me 6-8 months.</li>
            <li> I tried using it for a few weeks and honestly never saw any difference in how I felt at all!  </li>
            <li> Would like a less expensive price</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was told that it had pain-relieving properties; that sounded hopeful in relieving serious muscle stiffness and ongoing pain from fibromyalgia.  </li>
            <li> also there was not bounce back bad effect.</li>
            <li> I use a spray bottle, cutting the magnesium by about half.</li>
            <li> I was very tired, had no energy, was not sleeping as well, my body hurt again and my head had a dull ache like a headache</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this did NOTHING for my fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> Unable to determine effectiveness of product.</li>
            <li> I ordered it but was afraid to use anything but my medication because I didn&#x27;t want to go through a night without it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love putting it on as it softens my skin although that is not my purpose for this purchase.  Magnesium is critical to good health but can&#x27;t be added in bulk to multivitamins cause it would make the pill too big.  So i take a magnesium supplement (usually with potassium) but for larger doses, i supplement with a topical magnesium spray.  It feels wonderful going on and no residue.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I started taking this because I suffered from severe migraines, and also have trouble sleeping at night and muscle aches due to a old back injury. I started seeing results in my sleeping immediantly, my headaches got less severe  then after a month I did not get them. I used really ache when it rained, but that stopped too. It was not until recently I relized how beneficial it was when I decided to take a suppliment pills with 360mg and I reduced Derma Mag to just one treatment a day (of 400mg). I was very tired, had no energy, was not sleeping as well, my body hurt again and my head had a dull ache like a headache was going to come on but never did. I stopped taking the pills and went back to 800mg total a day and my energy came back I slept great and my headache went away. It is a little pricey compared to most other transdermal, but I have tried all the others offered on Amazon to try to save money and this worked the best for me and so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this in my busy massage practice.  It WORKS.</li>
            <li> This is the best Magnesium Oil for foot soaks. If you have A-fib or PSVT, or some heart irregularity like that, soaking in Magnesium oil can stop an episode. You just squirt some in a lukewarm foot bath and soak for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium taken orally can prevent or stop episodes, but the amount you have to take is too much for your gastrointestinal tract to take. Foot soaking allows you to absorb larger amounts of magnesium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried applying it directly to my skin and it was too itchy.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for cramps. I purchased it for my mom for the cramps she was getting in her legs. My husband uses it all of the time before he goes to bed he rubs on his legs and arms. If it feels too sticky just use less. Magnesium is something everyone needs and because of the lack of nutrients in our soils, we are not getting the proper amount for our body. This is better than taking pills or capsules because it soaks right into your body and provides almost instant relief. I would recommend this to my family and friends, especially if you are experiencing cramps at night.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this did NOTHING for my fibromyalgia. It did soften my rough elbows though. I am always looking for something to help the pain but this wasn&#x27;t it for me.</li>
            <li> This has taken away a lot of the pain I have in my hands from all the abuse they get from work.  I also rug in on my feet and notice they don&#x27;t ache as bad when I first walk on them in the morning.  This brand was reccommended to me by a very good source.</li>
            <li> Made my arms sting...I have very sensitive skin though. There&#x27;s a warning on it about that though so don&#x27;t ignore that.</li>
            <li> Great product. Natural Bengay ointment</li>
            <li> Product is part of my health regimen... Good product.... Would like a less expensive price, please consider lowering the prices....</li>
            <li> Easy to use by simply spraying on the painful area and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. I sprayed it on my sore toe and sore hand and immediately these places felt better. I was able to do a long hike without pain. also there was not bounce back bad effect. I highly recommend this.Also the fact that it is lab tested and certified at the source for purity and consistency is important to me.</li>
            <li> You have to remind yourself with products like this that if was really any good everyone would be talking about it. It ain&#x27;t being talked about!</li>
            <li> A really remarkable product - stops pain dead in its tracks in the muscles of my legs and also the joints in my hands. I use it at night, after my shower, thinking it may be absorbed better when my pores are open. I use a spray bottle, cutting the magnesium by about half. Works beautifully for me, so nice to be pain-free.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and hope that anyone suffering from RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome) will give it a try.  I was diagnosed in 2002, tried a couple of medications before finding something that worked for me.  The cost ($252.00/month) was astronomical but anyone who has tried to get through a night with RLS will understand when I say it kept me sane.  RLS medications mask the symptoms for a time and eventually they will quit working.  I was at maximum dose and it was no longer working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new healthcare practitioner suggested I try magnesium spray (she recommended DermaMag because of its purity and said spray was essential--magnesium supplements wouldn&#x27;t work). I ordered it but was afraid to use anything but my medication because I didn&#x27;t want to go through a night without it.  Last May my pharmacy couldn&#x27;t get my medication till the next day so I was facing the night from hell.  I remembered the spray and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt so for an hour before going to bed I sprayed my legs anytime there was an urge to move.  I spent a peaceful night, cancelled my prescription the next day and haven&#x27;t looked back.  This stuff is incredible--I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  I used it every night for the first month and now I&#x27;m down to once every couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggested my sister try it.  She was diagnosed in 1984 back when even doctors weren&#x27;t familiar with it.  She has gone through most of the medications recommended, was up to 11-13 pills a day, nothing was working and her neurologist was trying to come up with a combination that would give her some relief.  She started using the DermaMag in September and is now off everything. This is a woman that had been unable to sit still long enough to go to a movie, travel was a nightmare.  It is a miracle for her.  Can&#x27;t wait to hear about her next trip to the neurologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why something this simple works so well.  Maybe with our food stripped of so many nutrients these days we are all deprived of magnesium.  All I know is I sleep now, I don&#x27;t have to put drugs in my body and its a lot cheaper.  This small bottle lasts me 6-8 months. This is just amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute lifesaver for me.  My legs and feet cramp badly wIthout enough magnesium in my system, but spraying Derma Mag on them provides quick relief.  It shouldn&#x27;t cause irritation, but if it does, dilute with water or use less.  It lasts a long time and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This spray is easy to use…..and my leg cramps disappear after a couple applications.  Magnesium is very hard for the body to absorb in any other form……this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews (who has time for jam like that??), but when I saw that this product only has 2 stars, I felt it was my civic duty to inform consumers that this stuff is AMAZING and it would be a crime not to let people know what a difference it has made in my life. I suffer from metabolic syndrome and all the fun stuff that comes with it and I&#x27;m telling you, amazonites, this stuff virtually erased several symptoms from my life--the number one and most debilitating being insomnia. This product changed my life and between this and taking Raw D, I have never experienced any supplements that have made a bigger difference in my life. A miracle product, for sure.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out within two days of use. Unable to determine effectiveness of product. I rarely have this type of issue.</li>
            <li> Use this every night before bed. Since it stings a little I spray on less sensitive areas such as backside of body.&lt;br /&gt;You can not overdose on this as the body needs magnesium but no one is sure how much. Your body doesn&#x27;t use what it doesn&#x27;t need ...better then taking a magnesium vitamin and a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was told that it had pain-relieving properties; that sounded hopeful in relieving serious muscle stiffness and ongoing pain from fibromyalgia.

            <li> DermaMag has helped me so much. Love this product! :-)</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me to use magnesium for my Plantar Fasciltis  and I have been using this product for the last couple of months and have found this to help with this issue! I have only had to &amp;#34;ice it&amp;#34; twice in the last 2 months and NO IBUPROFEN!!! It very well could have been that I had a deficiency in magnesium. I would recommend this product for any issues that may be a result of a deficiency in magnesium. I chose this particular brand for the best, most pure one to use.</li>
            <li> My Naturapath recommended this as a natural aid in lowering my blood pressure.  I spray on my thighs, rub it in, and allow 10 minutes without&lt;br /&gt;touching clothing for it to dry.  Use it every morning, and it has helped in controlling my pressure.</li>
