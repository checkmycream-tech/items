            <li>Hot Sets is a great tool for hair control and styling.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with product and delivery.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and have not found a substitute.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I do not buy their claim as this being an authentic Redken product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t order from this company again unless they can come up with a better packaging method.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do without this fabulous product!  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this product, which I have been using for years</li>
            <li>I was pleased by the price.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find another&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li>I apply it to the top of my hair at the root when it is still damp.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, couldn&#x27;t do my hair without it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>bottle that I find very useful when I travel--just buy it once and fill it up!  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and Redken Hots Sets 22</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.  </li>
            <li>next best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>I could spray, curl, allow to cool, then even comb through a bit, backtease, and set with hairspray and go.  </li>
            <li>most intense hairspray ever.</li>
            <li>After trying several thermal setting sprays, the one that works best for me so far is Kenra Platinum Hot Spray.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Really seals a curl or a flat-ironed tress, and then brushes out so easily while the style remains.</li>
            <li>I have perfectly straight fine hair and it won&#x27;t hold curl.  </li>
            <li>It works very well with my extremely fine hair.</li>
            <li>This refill size is economical.</li>
            <li>As ordered, quick and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I use this in my shop for weddings and proms, will hold hair perfect as long as it doesn&#x27;t get wet.</li>
            <li>I live in Flordia, there is no such thing as a good hair day until I found this product.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>October 13, 2014 I have been using Redken Hot Sets for years and years and loved how it made my extremely fine, straight hair appear thick and curly.  </li>
            <li>i still use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>my regret with my order was that the only had one in stock.&lt;br /&gt;anybody have more, let meknow</li>
            <li>When using this product with hot rollers...</li>
            <li>It works with a curling iron or hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>the first thing I saw was that water is now the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>(The seller from whom I purchased it was stellar and issued a prompt</li>
            <li>, that just does not want to do anything unless I use the Hot Sets.  </li>
            <li>it really really works!</li>
            <li>I will not ever buy anymore Redken Hot Sets.</li>
            <li>No other product I have tried is able to hold a curl nearly as well as this one.</li>
            <li>Works great on my thin hair.</li>
            <li>This was delivered promptly and I&#x27;m as usual very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel fuller and holds the curls better than any other product.</li>
            <li>Buying the refill is a whole lot cheaper than getting a new sprayer every time at the hairdresser&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping your product really was the old formula that I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Expensive but a great product</li>
            <li>It is essential to anyone with straight hair who wants manageability!  </li>
            <li>the shipment was Redken&#x27;s new formula...</li>
            <li>This NEW FORMULA does not perform at all.  </li>
            <li>This new formula has NO holding power.  </li>
            <li>This new formula does not hold.</li>
            <li>Quantity lasts a long time so it is economical.</li>
            <li>I have used Redken Hot Sets 22 for several years and I won&#x27;t be without it.  </li>
            <li>I compared the ingredients on the new bottle with the ingredients on an old bottle I had, and</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because the picture is how their old formula was packaged.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years with complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and difficult to find.  </li>
            <li>Good product that is difficult to find in the retail market.</li>
            <li>In the past several months, Redken has changed the formula from a clear, just right thermal setting lotion to a milky, sticky mixture that leaves my hair straight and sticky, even after using hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I use it with my hot rolls and my curls last all day long.  </li>
            <li>Not at all like the original clear thick formula.</li>
            <li>I want the old formula back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how long Hot Sets has been around, but I have used it faithfully since it was first introduced.  </li>
            <li>If too much is used it can become &#x27;gummy&#x27; - be careful in rain - same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I paid about the same for the large bottle as I normally do for the small spray bottle.</li>
            <li>and then spray a little of the Redken Hot Sets through it following up with my curling iron.  </li>
            <li>My wife has thick, healthy and flowing hair, unlike me who has little, if any.</li>

            <li> My wife has thick, healthy and flowing hair, unlike me who has little, if any.</li>
            <li> Product is very sticky so you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> This product gives lift to my otherwise flat hair.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my short hair.  </li>
            <li> It holds your hair with the curl for a long time.</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> (I also suggest letting the product dry before curling)</li>
            <li> ANd this product works well, and it is getting harder and harder to find,  </li>
            <li> and I think the cap is also pink, as well as the bottle....</li>
            <li> After it is wet it will mat and paste hair and must be washed out.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this product because I do not use Hot Rollers or a Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li> There are other changes as well.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> the product was different from what I usually buy at the store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years whereas other hair products are hit and miss.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair using a round brush to style it</li>
            <li> Finally a product that gives lift but doesn&#x27;t dull your hair</li>
            <li> but when I opened the package almost half of it had leaked out all over the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Kenra&#x27;s Thermal Styling Spray Firm Hold No. 19</li>
            <li> Works well for Thermal sets, hold curls well without being stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a small spray bottle to pour it in.</li>
            <li> Also, they sell a small 2 oz.</li>
            <li> and it is definitely thick and heavy, but curls will stay all day if sprayed on before curling.</li>
            <li> It was gummy and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> hard to find without chasing all over.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s too late to return.</li>
            <li> Girls, if your hair has a hard time holding curl, I suggest this product!</li>
            <li> refund.)&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  (October 2, 2015)  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hate it.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If use this or mouse it don&#x27;t make a difference</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because the picture is how their old formula was packaged.  Redken changed their formula and it does not work for my hair.  I was hoping your product really was the old formula that I was looking for.  However, when I received my shipment, the bottles were not what is shown in your picture....the shipment was Redken&#x27;s new formula...and I think the cap is also pink, as well as the bottle....</li>
            <li> Finally a product that gives lift but doesn&#x27;t dull your hair</li>
            <li> Used this product for decades.  Great product from a great seller.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this and came on time</li>
            <li> Expensive but a great product</li>
            <li> Works great on my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores! Got it in bulk here and am a happy customer :)</li>
            <li> great for use with curling irons.</li>
            <li> I live in Flordia, there is no such thing as a good hair day until I found this product.  I use it with my hot rolls and my curls last all day long.  No matter how hat and sticky it gets.</li>
            <li> Very good styling product for holding your hair in place. Adds lift at the roots. Quantity lasts a long time so it is economical.</li>
            <li> Great product! Perfect for spraying pieces of hair before rolling. Awesome for pageants!</li>
            <li> Good product for my needs.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff.  I was skeptical when I bought this product because I do not use Hot Rollers or a Curling Iron.  I blow dry my short hair.  It is a bit sticky but that goes away.  It is great for just blow drying. I got great volume and texture.  Will buy again and will recommend.</li>
            <li> Pleased with product and delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for using with a curling iron.  It just does it&#x27;s job perfectly.  I have used this for many years and have not found a substitute.  It just can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> wonderful product.I use this in my shop for weddings and proms, will hold hair perfect as long as it doesn&#x27;t get wet.After it is wet it will mat and paste hair and must be washed out.</li>
            <li> Not as good as spray starch that they stopped making but next best thing I&#x27;ve found so far. Love the product; it&#x27;s great for smoothing and curling.</li>
            <li> Redken has changed the formula and it is sticky and I hate it. I want the old formula back.Ive used it for years.</li>
            <li> When using this product with hot rollers...it&#x27;s outstanding.  Actually, I can&#x27;t do without it. It makes my hair feel fuller and holds the curls better than any other product.</li>
            <li> This product does not produce the same results as the product I purchase in the salon. I do not buy their claim as this being an authentic Redken product.</li>
            <li> great product my hairdresser used it at the salon, and decided to order arrived quickly and is a great product</li>
            <li> I have used Redken Hot Sets 22 for several years and I won&#x27;t be without it.  I have perfectly straight fine hair and it won&#x27;t hold curl.  This product handles that problem for me. It works with a curling iron or hot rollers.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years but when I opened the package almost half of it had leaked out all over the packaging.  I probably won&#x27;t order from this company again unless they can come up with a better packaging method.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I was introduced to it by my (then) hair stylist. It works very well with my extremely fine hair. No other product I have tried is able to hold a curl nearly as well as this one. An excellent product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without this fabulous product!  It is essential to anyone with straight hair who wants manageability!  Has made all the difference to my required appearance at work.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Product is very sticky so you only need a small amount. I only wish the product would of come with a spray nozzle. I had to buy a small spray bottle to pour it in. It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years with complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This NEW FORMULA does not perform at all.  I&#x27;m not sure how long Hot Sets has been around, but I have used it faithfully since it was first introduced.  (It seems like my entire marriage, which is 20 years.)  The old formula worked perfectly for me.  I could spray, curl, allow to cool, then even comb through a bit, backtease, and set with hairspray and go.  It would last all day. This new formula has NO holding power.  It is like cloudy water (the old formula was thicker and mainly clear) AND it makes my hair oily and heavy.  I compared the ingredients on the new bottle with the ingredients on an old bottle I had, and the first thing I saw was that water is now the first ingredient. There are other changes as well. (The seller from whom I purchased it was stellar and issued a prompt refund.)&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  (October 2, 2015)  After trying several thermal setting sprays, the one that works best for me so far is Kenra Platinum Hot Spray.  Kenra&#x27;s Thermal Styling Spray Firm Hold No. 19 DID NOT work for me at all, so I am grateful for this Platinum formula.  Also, they sell a small 2 oz. bottle that I find very useful when I travel--just buy it once and fill it up!  I hope this helps someone!</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews. This new formula does not hold. It is not the same. It is cloudy and white. Not at all like the original clear thick formula. When I needed to refill my spray bottle I discovered this. Now it&#x27;s too late to return.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product, which I have been using for years and I will use from now on. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> This is a good product and difficult to find.  For those of us who use electric rollers and curling irons this product is great.  I have wire-type hair, that just does not want to do anything unless I use the Hot Sets.  If too much is used it can become &#x27;gummy&#x27; - be careful in rain - same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it and have purchased it for others - they&#x27;ve had good to great results.  Also, the company that sends it does a good job with packaging.</li>
            <li> Very good product my hair dresser uses this faithfully</li>
            <li> the product was different from what I usually buy at the store.  It was gummy and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> No problem. Great buy.</li>
            <li> keeps wife happy. hard to find without chasing all over.</li>
            <li> I use this product all of the time!!  Holds the hair in place securely!!  I believe, that this bottle is a refill, to go in your pump bottle, that you already have....</li>
            <li> This product is a lifesaver in humid Wisconsin summers--it&#x27;s the only thing that holds a hair style without using actual hairspray.</li>
            <li> Good product that is difficult to find in the retail market. Hopefully it will not age.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  I always use it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years whereas other hair products are hit and miss. This was delivered promptly and I&#x27;m as usual very satisfied.</li>
            <li> most intense hairspray ever. it really really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product ever since Redken put it on the market. It&#x27;s not just a heat-protector; it&#x27;s a great setting product. Really seals a curl or a flat-ironed tress, and then brushes out so easily while the style remains.This refill size is economical. I just refill my smaller spray bottles. I keep one upstairs and one in my studio so that I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly so I knrw what to expect.  I was pleased by the price.  I paid about the same for the large bottle as I normally do for the small spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works so good on my hair.  Haven&#x27;t been able to find another&lt;br /&gt;product to take it&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Works well for Thermal sets, hold curls well without being stiff or sticky. Just spray comb through and use hot rollers, or curling iron Works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I dry my hair using a round brush to style it and then spray a little of the Redken Hot Sets through it following up with my curling iron.  Then it keeps the style even if the wind blow or the fog comes in.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and Redken Hots Sets 22 helps hold the curl perfectly for me. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific!  Buying the refill is a whole lot cheaper than getting a new sprayer every time at the hairdresser&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I apply it to the top of my hair at the root when it is still damp.  Then I blow dry.  This product gives lift to my otherwise flat hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It holds your hair with the curl for a long time. It is sticky but works well. se it with each washing.</li>
            <li> redken must have changed the formula for this product, it doesn&#x27;t look the same, diffinately feel the same on my hair, I&#x27;m going to write redken, I&#x27;ve been using the product for years. so i&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> October 13, 2014 I have been using Redken Hot Sets for years and years and loved how it made my extremely fine, straight hair appear thick and curly.  In the past several months, Redken has changed the formula from a clear, just right thermal setting lotion to a milky, sticky mixture that leaves my hair straight and sticky, even after using hot rollers.  I am so disappointed. After all these years I am now looking for another thermal setting lotion.  I will not ever buy anymore Redken Hot Sets.</li>
            <li> Girls, if your hair has a hard time holding curl, I suggest this product! It&#x27;s spray on starch and it is definitely thick and heavy, but curls will stay all day if sprayed on before curling. (I also suggest letting the product dry before curling)</li>
            <li> My wife has thick, healthy and flowing hair, unlike me who has little, if any. Hot Sets is a great tool for hair control and styling.  About the only think I can find for it is as a &#x27;non-skid&#x27; coating. If you can use it, buy it.</li>
            <li> Perfect. As ordered, quick and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love this product, couldn&#x27;t do my hair without it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and never tire of it.  I protects my hair from daily curling iron damage.  Love it.</li>
