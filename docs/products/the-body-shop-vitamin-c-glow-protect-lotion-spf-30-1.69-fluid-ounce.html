            <li>Maybe my skin got used to it, but now the moisture settles in and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>I have used over 6 months with one package and it&#x27;s just wonderful experience.  </li>

            <li>Smell is very good.</li>
            <li>was great.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer blends well into the skin, and smells great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 year now and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>This lotion does smell great, but it was too oily for my skin.</li>
            <li>so thought this would be great for my skin.</li>
            <li>guess my advice would be to know that you are sure about this product before you order!!</li>
            <li>I use all Body Shop products and have been very happy with them for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>Great for those that want their own skin to shine thru but</li>
            <li>I used it before and loved it though.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>This formula is extremely light and the perfect consistency for under your make-up.</li>
            <li>Good for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>Body shop Vitamin C cream is a good cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, smells great, and is very light weight on your skin.</li>
            <li>just right and smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li>It feels much more like a moisturizer than sun block, AND it contains antioxidants, AND it smells great - giving you the added bonus of a nice citrusy aromatherapy boost in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is a nice moisturizer and skin brightener, though it does leave my face a tad shiny.</li>
            <li>THEN my face got drier, and drier and it was great because I have super oily skin and to not be oily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great travel companion and it absorbs quickly into skin.</li>
            <li>Better yet, the effects lasted AFTER I had washed my face (nice glowy skin).</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I use this for 3 years love it</li>
            <li>I love Body Shop stuff</li>
            <li>I was glad to,find this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love that cream</li>
            <li>I love that it has vitamin c.</li>
            <li>I love this product from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m just making sure to get SPF as I run out the door.</li>
            <li>I love the smell it reminds me of orange candy.</li>
            <li>It softens your skins and gives you a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I love using this product every morning.  </li>
            <li>sure to try the Vita E line.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this sunscreen for 2 years and simply love it.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and I can apply foundation on top of it when I go out</li>
            <li>At first I loved this thing.</li>
            <li>Great Moisture, Great Smell, sometimes when daily lotions have SPF 30 in them you can smell that certain sunscreen smell but not with this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive that experimenting with new products can be risky, but again, I heard good things about this product, but wasn&#x27;t so great for me.  </li>
            <li>If you can, order directly from TBS, they have excellent sales and you can get it for much cheaper than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m attracted to the orange scent, but also its a bit strong</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give this cream 5 stars because of a major problem I experienced.</li>
            <li>Plus this one is pretty affordable compared to  many skin care products (and you can aways go try it out if you aren&#x27;t sure, at either Body Shop or Sephora).</li>
            <li>I use another product with HA serum underneath and the combination is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite first layer of skin care routine.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t like it, because I thought it was too greasy, but now I love it.</li>
            <li>It might be heavy for humid areas but works great here and leaves my skin feel better than before I put it on.</li>
            <li>but I prefer this product to the PTR facial moisturizer with SPF - and that is saying a lot coming from a loyal PTR customer!!!  </li>
            <li>it feels so fresh and light it moisturizes very well</li>
            <li>I have to watch how I smile because my skin will flake all around my chin and cheeks when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, honestly, nothing but their facial products have worked on my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Am over 50 years old and needed something very moist and this is it!!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Started out nice, smells great and a little goes a long way, but I don&#x27;t know, it has too much acid in it, or alcohol.</li>
            <li>It is good for typical work days</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been looking for a higher SPF (higher then 15) Vitamin C cream</li>
            <li>I love this facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It would get so shiny that I would have people asking me if I was too hot (i.e sweating).</li>
            <li>I love this facial lotion.</li>
            <li>I first tried the Body Shop Vitamin E lotion from my sis.</li>
            <li>It goes on well and smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a white out ghost and protects with a 30 SPF.</li>
            <li>and you dont need too much per use</li>
            <li>but you might need a stronger SPF if you plan to spend too much time out in the sun.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very creamy and moist.  </li>
            <li>Then in the second week, I had an acne breakout, which is fine and dandy because it takes a while for your skin to acclimate to new products.</li>
            <li>Great for us mid life folks that have abused our skin in the past.  </li>
            <li>I have spent many years and MANY dollars trying facial moisturizers with SPF - and this one is the only one I have stayed with.  </li>
            <li>in the South and being older....</li>
            <li>We went back and forth with me explaining that I understood the policy that they can&#x27;t take the opened item back, but that I&#x27;m sure they could still give me a refund.</li>
            <li>Pricey but a decent product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, and I already noticed my skin feels hydrated, and perfectly moisturized - not too much, not too little.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>normally use Peter Thomas Roth products for all of my skin care -</li>
            <li>I love this line of products but recently purchased this and received an empty package.</li>
            <li>Will use it when I get a super dry make up that keeps me matte.</li>
            <li>Moved away from them after the At Home Division closed and many of our local stores were gone...</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this product does not irritate it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I use it with their other line of Vitamin E products, could not find a daily moisturizer in the Vitamin E line with SPF</li>
            <li>I use this as my sunscreen for the hot dry high altitude climate in Colorado.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if its going to make a difference to my skin.</li>
            <li>Occasionally my girlfriends convince me to try one of their new products ( they are aesthetic reps) and I experience breakouts and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>It cut the oil from my face for the first week, I noticed it tingled/slightly burned when I used it, but I&#x27;ve had that experience with other products and haven&#x27;t had a problem yet.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it too thick, as so many other reviewers did.</li>
            <li>Not too much oil not too less,</li>
            <li>Shipping is super slow with this company, though they do warn you of that.</li>

            <li> Shipping is super slow with this company, though they do warn you of that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to their Vitamin C products as they have a little SPF mixed in - and are so soothing for my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> It is a case of extremes; do I prefer dry peeling skin to shiny greasy skin?</li>
            <li> If I have a dry spot this will cure it with one use.  </li>
            <li> I have a dry complexion</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels very thick and leaves my skin very greasy.</li>
            <li> Again, that might be due to how dry my skin is and that I used it in the winter</li>
            <li> It brightens skin and sinks in well.  </li>
            <li> so I wonder if other people can smell it?</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and have to deal with skin dullness after a few hours of wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Whereas before my face was too dry to glow, a few hours after using the cream my face went from glowing to shiny.</li>
            <li> but it is still too thick and sticky for a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it was still making me break out when I wasn&#x27;t having this problem with a previous lotion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have very sensitive skin and this lotion was not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to take to blotting my face heavily with powder after application of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion is a bit on the heavy side, but does not make my skin feel greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for oily skin, it could be too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will continue using the product.</li>
            <li> So when I read this moisturizer thick and it brightened the skin, I figured it was what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too thick for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Something has some serious drying power in this thing.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> But then my chin and cheeks broke out into a horrendous painful rash.</li>
            <li> This product made me break out terribly.  </li>

            <li> I love Body Shop stuff and I&#x27;ve been looking for a higher SPF (higher then 15) Vitamin C cream and I found it. It goes on well and smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a white out ghost and protects with a 30 SPF. Great for us mid life folks that have abused our skin in the past.  Mix in a darker foundation (2 shades darker then your skin color) and you&#x27;ve got VIOLA!  --a tinted moisturizer.  Great for those that want their own skin to shine thru but gives you the protection you need.</li>
            <li> I love this line of products but recently purchased this and received an empty package. Needless to say I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Always used Thai&lt;br /&gt;S. the BodynShop near me closed. I was glad to,find this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for several years....in all seasons</li>

            <li> I love this facial moisturizer. It&#x27;s not greasy, smells great, and is very light weight on your skin. Plus it has a SPF of 30.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for years. Won&#x27;t use anything else. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love that cream it feels so fresh and light it moisturizes very well and you dont need too much per use</li>
            <li> I still have this.  It&#x27;s too greasy with the make up I have.  Makes me look shinny and Oily. Will use it when I get a super dry make up that keeps me matte.I used it before and loved it though. I love that it has vitamin c.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and have to deal with skin dullness after a few hours of wearing makeup. So when I read this moisturizer thick and it brightened the skin, I figured it was what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My views after 3 months of using it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I didn&#x27;t find it too thick, as so many other reviewers did. Again, that might be due to how dry my skin is and that I used it in the winter period.&lt;br /&gt;2. It definitely brightened my skin. Better yet, the effects lasted AFTER I had washed my face (nice glowy skin). And the effects were instantaneous. I didn&#x27;t have to wait 2 days or a week to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I didn&#x27;t give this cream 5 stars because of a major problem I experienced. Whereas before my face was too dry to glow, a few hours after using the cream my face went from glowing to shiny. It would get so shiny that I would have people asking me if I was too hot (i.e sweating). I had to take to blotting my face heavily with powder after application of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am not sure if I will continue using the product. It is a case of extremes; do I prefer dry peeling skin to shiny greasy skin? I don&#x27;t know. But the moisturizer did work as advertised...if just a bit too well.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Non greasy. Love it! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, and I already noticed my skin feels hydrated, and perfectly moisturized - not too much, not too little.</li>
            <li> Product is as described</li>
            <li> I love this product from The Body Shop. This is my second bottle, now. The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t like it, because I thought it was too greasy, but now I love it. Maybe my skin got used to it, but now the moisture settles in and my skin looks great! Shipping is super slow with this company, though they do warn you of that. If you can, order directly from TBS, they have excellent sales and you can get it for much cheaper than this. They were sold out at the time, so I resorted to this method.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a larger tube.&lt;br /&gt;This is vitamin C AND sunblock for your face.&lt;br /&gt;Living in the South and being older....I love this facial lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have used over 6 months with one package and it&#x27;s just wonderful experience.  Am over 50 years old and needed something very moist and this is it!!!!  Not too much oil not too less, just right and smells wonderful!  Plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> Not too thick for my oily skin. I&#x27;m attracted to the orange scent, but also its a bit strong so I wonder if other people can smell it? I save this one for saturday&#x27;s when i&#x27;m skipping makeup and i&#x27;m just making sure to get SPF as I run out the door.</li>
            <li> I use this as my sunscreen for the hot dry high altitude climate in Colorado. It might be heavy for humid areas but works great here and leaves my skin feel better than before I put it on. The vitamin C is healing and soothing.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this thing. It cut the oil from my face for the first week, I noticed it tingled/slightly burned when I used it, but I&#x27;ve had that experience with other products and haven&#x27;t had a problem yet. Then in the second week, I had an acne breakout, which is fine and dandy because it takes a while for your skin to acclimate to new products. THEN my face got drier, and drier and it was great because I have super oily skin and to not be oily was great. But then my chin and cheeks broke out into a horrendous painful rash. I&#x27;ve had this rash for two weeks now, and it just started peeling. Nothing helps the burn, except being distracted by work/tv. Not lotion, not oil, and nothing moisturizes my chin or cheeks anymore. I have to watch how I smile because my skin will flake all around my chin and cheeks when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started out nice, smells great and a little goes a long way, but I don&#x27;t know, it has too much acid in it, or alcohol. Something has some serious drying power in this thing.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer blends well into the skin, and smells great. I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 year now and my skin looks great. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, easy to apply. Too early to tell if its going to make a difference to my skin.</li>
            <li> I like that this has SPF in it but it is still too thick and sticky for a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and it works well for me. My skin is very sensitive and this product does not irritate it.  I love the smell it reminds me of orange candy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily moisturizer for years. Occasionally my girlfriends convince me to try one of their new products ( they are aesthetic reps) and I experience breakouts and blemishes.  This formula is extremely light and the perfect consistency for under your make-up. I use it in the morning and night along with my eye creams. It softens your skins and gives you a healthy glow. Definitely give this one a try!</li>
            <li> This lotion does smell great, but it was too oily for my skin. I tried it for a about a month and it was still making me break out when I wasn&#x27;t having this problem with a previous lotion. Unfortunately I have very sensitive skin and this lotion was not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I explained the situation to the company, they would not give me a refund. They said it was \\&quot;against Amazon policy\\&quot; to take back the product and give me a refund. What????? We went back and forth with me explaining that I understood the policy that they can&#x27;t take the opened item back, but that I&#x27;m sure they could still give me a refund. Nope. They said only if the item is damaged or defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my advice would be to know that you are sure about this product before you order!! Otherwise you will be out of $30 and stuck with a lotion for which you have no use!!!</li>
            <li> Great Moisture, Great Smell, sometimes when daily lotions have SPF 30 in them you can smell that certain sunscreen smell but not with this product. Love this stuff, I use it with their other line of Vitamin E products, could not find a daily moisturizer in the Vitamin E line with SPF so I went to the vitamin C line for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like both their vitamin E and C lines of product!! Try it I think you will too!!</li>
            <li> This product made me break out terribly.  My skin is so sensitive that experimenting with new products can be risky, but again, I heard good things about this product, but wasn&#x27;t so great for me.  I will never buy this or any Body SHop Vitamin moisturizers  again.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I love using this product every morning.  The wonderful citrus scent makes me wake up!  The lotion is a bit on the heavy side, but does not make my skin feel greasy at all.  I like the fact that it contains 30 SPF so I get my daily dose of sunscreen in my moisturizer.  I</li>
            <li> I will always have this moisturizer in my bathroom.  It brightens skin and sinks in well.  I would not recommend it for oily skin, it could be too heavy.  If I have a dry spot this will cure it with one use.  I use all Body Shop products and have been very happy with them for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to try the Vita E line.  Good for all skin types.  Oily skin types should try their Tea tree line. Does wonders for blemished skin.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Body Shop Vitamin E lotion from my sis. I got hooked. The Vit C daily moisturizer does the same effect. It&#x27;s a great travel companion and it absorbs quickly into skin. I use it before applying make up. The smell is not as noticeable. Helps with my skin - especially on my forehead and chin area. I would repurchase it again.</li>
            <li> Body shop Vitamin C cream is a good cream. Smell is very good. I dont have any problem to recommend it. thank you.</li>
            <li> I used to work for the Body Shop at Home division and used their products faithfully.  Moved away from them after the At Home Division closed and many of our local stores were gone... But, honestly, nothing but their facial products have worked on my aging skin.  I&#x27;ve gone back to their Vitamin C products as they have a little SPF mixed in - and are so soothing for my face and neck.  I use another product with HA serum underneath and the combination is fabulous.  The company is called OZ Naturals...</li>
            <li> Pricey but a decent product. It is a nice moisturizer and skin brightener, though it does leave my face a tad shiny.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels very thick and leaves my skin very greasy. I have a dry complexion so thought this would be great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for 2 years and simply love it. It is non-greasy and I can apply foundation on top of it when I go out and it does not make my face look too oily. It is good for typical work days but you might need a stronger SPF if you plan to spend too much time out in the sun.</li>
            <li> No problems with my order.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very creamy and moist.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I like this product b/c it is a Vitamin C moisturizer and it includes SPF 30. I wear this under makeup during the day.  It is not greasy; yet it keeps my face moisturized.</li>
