            <li>Amazon please tape the top.</li>

            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love the size too as you get a lot for the cost.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get along well with many, many fragrances, and</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bubble bath from Village Naturals.</li>
            <li>Better than all the others that claim to be a bubble bath</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pick up at CVS and tons more relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother in law for christmas, she love the smell of it</li>
            <li>smells great and makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It smells lightly of jasmine which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>Said it left her skin smooth and smelled great.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great mixed with sesame bath oil.</li>
            <li>I really just wanted something fragrant, soothing, and nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, it gives a lot of bubbles that last a long time, it smells great, and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only did my skin not freak out - it liked it!  </li>
            <li>Just great and the 28 oz bottle lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li>Works itself into a good foam with a standard bath and a huge mountain of foam and froth with a jacuzzi.</li>
            <li>Everything I wanted in a bubble bath: lotsa bubbles, a light pleasant fragrance, pampers my skin (I have extremely dry skin), &amp; it&#x27;s affordable.  </li>
            <li>I love the aroma-therapy aspects, the scents aren&#x27;t too over bearing either and really help moisturize.</li>
            <li>It  smelled wonderful and was definitely not the same thing that&#x27;s in  this bottle.  </li>
            <li>Is your wife pregnant?</li>
            <li>Very easy on the skin as well if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I first found this product in the bath oil version, which I understand is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell - strong but not overpowering.    </li>
            <li>$6 is still a good deal for what you are getting, but I&#x27;ve been buying the exact same product (28 fl oz) for $3.22 from WalMart.    </li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, so if you are sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>Really like Village Naturals Bath products and hope they continue to be available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It has a very pleasing scent that is light, and it gives tons of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>you enjoy it just as much.</li>
            <li>I wish this product was more readily available in local stores.</li>
            <li>Most of what you smell in these products  is in the &amp;#34;fragrance,&amp;#34; ingredient which may be natural or not.</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely fantastic, really soaps up and leaves you very clean leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>The bubbles were just right as it is a \\&quot;bath milk\\&quot; and not a \\&quot;bubble bath\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I was expecting so much more  bubles as i read in other reviews, just fine but no a &amp;#34;pretty woman&amp;#34; like buble bath.</li>
            <li>It foams up a bit and leaves your skin really silky!</li>
            <li>this product is better and it leaves a lasting smell and softness even to the rugiest looking guy..</li>
            <li>The products all had mostly the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This milk bath leaves my skin soft and lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>Safe for lactose-intollerant people such as myself to use.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>said she cant wait to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and frequently have trouble with bubble baths however this one is kind to my skin and makes for a nice relaxing tub.</li>
            <li>mild scent, bubbles and the water is soft, just add a cap or two</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just saying buyer beware on this particular product!</li>
            <li>so I do not recommend using with jets on high!</li>
            <li>and it smells like a cheap  cleaning fluid sort of smell....</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and lasted as well.</li>
            <li>This product is very versatile.  </li>
            <li>I like to take a bath before going to sleep - this induces a very comforting sleep experience.</li>
            <li>It smelled strong, fake, and like the kind of things that so often sets me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bubbles were nice and relaxing, but they weren&#x27;t my primary objective, so I&#x27;ve found a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Only the kidde-type bubble bath is available locally.</li>
            <li>I have a huge tub, and I find I use less of this product and still get my sky high pile of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>This milk bath makes my skin feel incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>The bubbles last, it smells pleasant, and it&#x27;s big enough to last awhile for my extra bubbly baths.</li>
            <li>I sue this product all the time - it does not dry the skin too awfully much - but it does have SLS</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, and you&#x27;ll eventually get the right ratio down on how to maximize bubbles with using as little of this as possible.</li>
            <li>certainly nothing I would bathe in or put my private lady parts into.</li>
            <li>Bath water is silky soft, not oily.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>May work well in a jacuzzi but get ready to splash it up in a regular bath!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>For my sensitive skin, this is my bubble bath.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and gives her what she wants when she takes her nightly bubble bath.</li>
            <li>The scent calmed down to a very nice one that reminded me of green tea frappachino or green tea latte.  </li>

            <li> Absolutely no residue left in tub for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Minus one star for needing a lot of product for making a difference in the water, so it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> You should always be careful in the tub, but the modest amount of bubbles I use doesn&#x27;t make it slick, either.  </li>
            <li> I also use the village naturals white tea and jasmine bath salts with the milk bath to give it a little something extra and to keep the scent going a little longer.</li>
            <li> I had this in my wish list for a while, so when I saw it in a local store for less, I picked it up without thinking twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoops!  </li>
            <li> They all contain the natural ingredients of coconut oil, aloe, chamomile and citrus, but these are very small amounts.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying their other products including the shower gel.</li>
            <li> I think the fragrance can be just a little bit stronger, but it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> a few people are describing in their reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NOT accusing the  Village Company of changing out anything behind anyone&#x27;s back....</li>
            <li> Hard to tell when you&#x27;re</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  </li>
            <li> free-pouring, sorry!).  </li>

            <li> I have used this product for years and when Walgreens stop selling it I turned to Amazon.  The bubbles last thru-out the entire bath.</li>

            <li> I love the fragrance and the bubbles of this bath product, also it helps keep my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> This milk bath makes my skin feel incredibly soft! It has a very light scent, so if you are sensitive to smells this is perfect for you. I have really sensitive skin and this bath is just really nice and calming. It makes a moderate amount of bubbles. I have used this for so many baths and the price is great! Will definitely order this again. ...I also use the village naturals white tea and jasmine bath salts with the milk bath to give it a little something extra and to keep the scent going a little longer. Its a really nice combination.</li>

            <li> Came in before the estimated shipment delivery. The product was sealed and handled with love. I love the aroma-therapy aspects, the scents aren&#x27;t too over bearing either and really help moisturize. It is a bubble bath so I do not recommend using with jets on high!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nightly bather and I first found this product in the bath oil version, which I understand is no longer available.  This stuff is great mixed with sesame bath oil.</li>
            <li> I love this bubble bath.  It softens the water and my skin.  The only fragrance I don&#x27;t like is orchid (I think it smells like bug spray!).  All of the others are very pleasant; not too strong.  I wish this product was more readily available in local stores.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic and deserving of 5 stars.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, it gives a lot of bubbles that last a long time, it smells great, and leaves no residue.  However the price is another story.  $6 is still a good deal for what you are getting, but I&#x27;ve been buying the exact same product (28 fl oz) for $3.22 from WalMart.    Why pay more if you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years - love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother for a Christmas gift and she loves it better than the bubble bath she used to buy. Lasts a long time and gives her what she wants when she takes her nightly bubble bath. Said it left her skin smooth and smelled great.</li>
            <li> Better than any bar soap or liquid soap i have ever used. I have had many others AXE and Dove..this product is better and it leaves a lasting smell and softness even to the rugiest looking guy..</li>
            <li> smells great and makes your skin very soft. But it leaked all over the shipping box. Amazon please tape the top.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this stuff is but it is NOT the bubble bath a few people are describing in their reviews. It doesn&#x27;t lather well and it smells like a cheap  cleaning fluid sort of smell....certainly nothing I would bathe in or put my private lady parts into. Yucka!&lt;br /&gt;I picked up the same thing at Walmart and smelled that container. It  smelled wonderful and was definitely not the same thing that&#x27;s in  this bottle.  I&#x27;m NOT accusing the  Village Company of changing out anything behind anyone&#x27;s back.... as this happened to Paul Mitchell products years ago......I&#x27;m just saying buyer beware on this particular product!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this a couple of times from Amazon and LOVE IT.  It has a very pleasing scent that is light, and it gives tons of bubbles.  I have a huge tub, and I find I use less of this product and still get my sky high pile of bubbles.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This milk bath smelled really nice and made the water silky and relaxing. The bubbles were just right as it is a \\&quot;bath milk\\&quot; and not a \\&quot;bubble bath\\&quot;. Minus one star for needing a lot of product for making a difference in the water, so it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The bubbles last during my relaxing soak and the smell was heavenly. I love the size too as you get a lot for the cost. I do recommed you add this for your home spa experience. It shipped fast and lasted as well.</li>
            <li> I had this in my wish list for a while, so when I saw it in a local store for less, I picked it up without thinking twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoops!  I don&#x27;t get along well with many, many fragrances, and I forgot to pop the cap and sniff at it in the store.  When I got home and opened it, I reeled back and thought, \\&quot;Oh, no!\\&quot;  It smelled strong, fake, and like the kind of things that so often sets me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to worry, though - I foolishly, optimistically tried some in the water, and lo:  it was just fine!  The scent calmed down to a very nice one that reminded me of green tea frappachino or green tea latte.  Yum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did my skin not freak out - it liked it!  Hooray for moisture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bubbles were nice and relaxing, but they weren&#x27;t my primary objective, so I&#x27;ve found a little goes a long way (I&#x27;d estimate 1/4 cup?  Ish?  Hard to tell when you&#x27;re free-pouring, sorry!).  I really just wanted something fragrant, soothing, and nice.  Bubbles are just a perk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as another reviewer mentioned, there was no tub residue when I was done.  You should always be careful in the tub, but the modest amount of bubbles I use doesn&#x27;t make it slick, either.  Happy times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy it just as much.</li>
            <li> I looked at the ingredients on eight bath products, four of which were Village Naturals products.  The products all had mostly the same ingredients.  They all contain the natural ingredients of coconut oil, aloe, chamomile and citrus, but these are very small amounts.  Most of what you smell in these products  is in the &amp;#34;fragrance,&amp;#34; ingredient which may be natural or not.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bubble bath from Village Naturals. It smells lightly of jasmine which I LOVE. I have sensitive skin and frequently have trouble with bubble baths however this one is kind to my skin and makes for a nice relaxing tub.</li>
            <li> My daughter thinks Village Naturals is a great brand of bath products.  I buy her a variety every year and she loves them all.</li>
            <li> Just want to tell everyone to order some of this Village Naturals White Tea Milk Bath.  This is the greatest and I searched everywhere to find it after the place I bought it quit having any and the online place where I found it also has an out of stock notice.  On E-Bay, sellers wanted about twice the $ for this.  I kept searching and to my delight found it here on Amazon.  It is the best ever!!!  The scent is mild and very nice.  It makes lots of bubbles and they last until you get out of the tub.  No bathtub ring and moisturizes too. Just great and the 28 oz bottle lasts a long time!  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  I like Jasmine best; but the Melon is also nice.</li>
            <li> I was expecting so much more  bubles as i read in other reviews, just fine but no a &amp;#34;pretty woman&amp;#34; like buble bath.</li>
            <li> This makes lots of bubbles but is also makes me itch, so I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This milk bath leaves my skin soft and lightly scented.  This product is very versatile.  It can be used as a bubble bath or simply as a body wash.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This requires a lot of effort to get the bubbles going. May work well in a jacuzzi but get ready to splash it up in a regular bath!</li>
            <li> I use this for my mom&#x27;s bath. She is 93 and she says this feels good on her skin and helps her sleep.</li>
            <li> Is your wife pregnant? If so, do yourself a favor and get her to unwind by buying this. It&#x27;s fantastic. I used to buy it locally until they stopped carrying it, and so now I buy months of it at a time to ensure I never run out. Smells amazing, and you&#x27;ll eventually get the right ratio down on how to maximize bubbles with using as little of this as possible. Safe for lactose-intollerant people such as myself to use.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product I can give 5 stars.  This bath milk is a bubble bath for me.  Better than all the others that claim to be a bubble bath but were not.  Pros- mild scent, bubbles and the water is soft, just add a cap or two and you will have bubbles that will outlast you.  My tub does have jets/whirlpool so the bubbles never stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-none</li>
            <li> The gift recipient reports this is an awesome product!  Leaves skin soft and moisturized. It is hypoallergenic and creates a delightfully decadent amount of bubbles.  This is a must for anyone who loves bubble baths!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the Mr Bubble I&#x27;d pick up at CVS and tons more relaxing.  You can feel the moisturizer in the bath but don&#x27;t feel like theres any residue afterward.  Works itself into a good foam with a standard bath and a huge mountain of foam and froth with a jacuzzi.</li>
            <li> This is a great value item. The bubbles last, it smells pleasant, and it&#x27;s big enough to last awhile for my extra bubbly baths.</li>
            <li> you have to use quite a bit to get a lot of bubbles, but i like it because it&#x27;s softer on my skin</li>
            <li> Nice bubble bath. Makes your skin feel really smooth and soft.You dont have to use alot to get alot bubbles.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without being greasy.  Bubbles well.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Makes lots of bubbles and smells good, but I don&#x27;t get the price here. You can get it at Walmart stores or Walmart on line for $3.50. I&#x27;d rather get it from Amazon but not at almost double the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother in law for christmas, she love the smell of it said she cant wait to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely fantastic, really soaps up and leaves you very clean leaves skin soft. I use it in the bath as well as in a &amp;#34;pouf&amp;#34; in the shower.</li>
            <li> For my sensitive skin, this is my bubble bath. It smells great. I also use the Village Naturals white tea milk bath soak along with this.</li>
            <li> This bubble bath produces mounds of bubbles and has a very light scent. The bathing experience is pleasant and relaxing. I like to take a bath before going to sleep - this induces a very comforting sleep experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, after buying another milk bath in Walmart.  I thought I would give this one a try and I like it!  I think the fragrance can be just a little bit stronger, but it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> It really smells good and makes a fair amount of bubbles. Very easy on the skin as well if you have sensitive skin</li>
