            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I was able to buy this after the product sold out on their website.</li>
            <li>I honestly love it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite sets they sell.</li>
            <li>real techniques brushes are the bomb!!!!</li>
            <li>super good prices, smooth</li>
            <li>Great quality, super soft bristles!</li>
            <li>Anything real techniques is amazing and with every penny.</li>
            <li>It is plastic at the bottom- a cheap looking plastic.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>This by far is my favorite set!  </li>
            <li>These brushes don&#x27;t shed the way my Baremineral brushes do and they are pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I love real techniques</li>
            <li>Not bad .</li>
            <li>love this set because the brushes are very soft and do their job.</li>
            <li>Brushes &amp; well worth the $25 price</li>
            <li>By now I have about 10 different real techniques brushes and they are all amazing.</li>
            <li>and it does not compare to the other ones I own.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expect from real techniques.</li>
            <li>Had higher expectations for a Real Techniques set.  </li>
            <li>I love every single brush in it.</li>
            <li>If you do a side by side comparison to real ones you will see what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li>The fan brush is nice to apply blush so you don&#x27;t go too heavy handed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been playing around with makeup for years now, and I always find that I love real techniques over every other drug store brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes are comparable to brushes priced twice as high.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The setting brush is good for setting power to small area such as under eye area.  </li>
            <li>For the other two brushes on the right dont really use them often</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and do not irritate skin.  </li>
            <li>soft</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON FAKES.</li>
            <li>The only reason i bought this sets was because of the sculpting brush which is really helpful for contouring .</li>
            <li>The make of the brushes look decent but when you look closer you can tell that the same materials aren&#x27;t being used in comparison to the regular real techniques line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I can still use these brushes, but for me to pay 43 dollars us (converted to canadian 50) is absolutely ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the sculpting brush, which I think could probably be a little more narrow and dense (i.e. the Nars Ita brush), but the real winner for me was the highlighting brush.</li>
            <li>If you look at the real ones, the writing should be on the other side of the brush.</li>

            <li> Very poor quality garbage from China.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>

            <li> Perfect! Just as expected and there were no problems with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I love this set because the brushes are very soft and do their job. I bought this for the sculpting brush, which I think could probably be a little more narrow and dense (i.e. the Nars Ita brush), but the real winner for me was the highlighting brush. I use it to set my undereye powder b/c it fits perfectly and sets my concealer. The fan brush is nice to apply blush so you don&#x27;t go too heavy handed.</li>
            <li> I love this set, which appears to be authentic.  The brushes are soft and do not irritate skin.

            <li> These brushes are so perfect. exactly what i expect from real techniques. soft and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Anything real techniques is amazing and with every penny.</li>
            <li> I have all the Real Techniques sets and quite a few of the brushes. This by far is my favorite set!  I love every single brush in it. Great set &amp; great value.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes you can buy for the price.  I have tried other brushes in this price range and they don&#x27;t compare.  BH a cosmetic brushes can&#x27;t touch these. These brushes are comparable to brushes priced twice as high. These brushes don&#x27;t shed the way my Baremineral brushes do and they are pretty easy to clean. I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say, I just received this brush set and it does not compare to the other ones I own. I love real techniques but I think these are fake, no I KNOW these are fake. The fan brush looks like it&#x27;s falling apart. The make of the brushes look decent but when you look closer you can tell that the same materials aren&#x27;t being used in comparison to the regular real techniques line. It is plastic at the bottom- a cheap looking plastic. Also the writing &amp;#34;real techniques by sam and nic chapman&amp;#34; are on the wrong side. If you do a side by side comparison to real ones you will see what I&#x27;m talking about. If you look at the real ones, the writing should be on the other side of the brush. Plus the text should not be black in colour. Bristles are frayed and seem so fragile I&#x27;m scared to even use them, especially for the price I paid. I&#x27;m sure I can still use these brushes, but for me to pay 43 dollars us (converted to canadian 50) is absolutely ridiculous. Buyers beware and do not buy from this seller. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON FAKES.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re alright. Fan brush is pointless</li>
            <li> real techniques brushes are the bomb!!!! super good prices, smooth and they do not shed. I have some very expensive MAC brushes that I love but shed like crazy. By now I have about 10 different real techniques brushes and they are all amazing. this kit is fab for contouring and strobing. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived with scratched handles and the hairs we&#x27;re frayed and discolored.</li>
            <li> Great quality, super soft bristles! Love this set!</li>
            <li> Fan brush looked like it was made by a child.  I contacted the seller and was refunded $5. Wish I had saved the packaging and that I could get my money back.  Had higher expectations for a Real Techniques set.  The other two work well.  Hence, 3 stars :-(</li>
            <li> Very happy with these!&lt;br /&gt;A+ Brushes &amp; well worth the $25 price point!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I&#x27;ve been playing around with makeup for years now, and I always find that I love real techniques over every other drug store brush. The quality is amazing, and you get great results.</li>

            <li> Not bad . The only reason i bought this sets was because of the sculpting brush which is really helpful for contouring . For the other two brushes on the right dont really use them often</li>
            <li> Very poor quality garbage from China. Please do not order this. When I was removing the brushes out of the packaging, I instantly noticed that the quality of the brushes were very poor. I would send the order back but I disposed of the packaging and the brushes. Very poor quality. Waste of money. The seller should be embarrassed.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and pictured. Also, within delivery time frame as promised. Thank you</li>
