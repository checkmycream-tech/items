            <li>and you have yourself a beautiful comb!</li>
            <li>The flowers are awesome</li>
            <li>this comb was so beautiful!</li>
            <li>it is perfect for my job</li>
            <li>this generously sized comb held it perfectly in place no problem!  </li>
            <li>This comb is beautiful, but after a couple of uses one of the flowers came off.</li>
            <li>However, as soon as I took it out of the package I was impressed with how gorgeous this hair comb looked.  </li>
            <li>It is actually more beautiful in person.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>Again, the flowers are nice.</li>
            <li>was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I was expecting something a bit sturdier for the price.  </li>
            <li>Make me looking good, but it is easy to lose the crystal in the flower</li>
            <li>If you get over the price for one hair comb, you&#x27;ll love it too.  </li>
            <li>Flowers are well attached, I&#x27;ve got many compliments on this comb.</li>
            <li>mentioned- mine came with nice smooth ends.  </li>
            <li>Really cute very pretty!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve glued it back on and am good to go, but would recommend your give the flowers a wiggle to make sure they stick!</li>
            <li>Sure, I can super glue it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for the people whose hair is light.</li>
            <li>it has a comfortable, snug fit.</li>
            <li>Best results yet for thick curly hair, longer teeth, firmer grip.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and elegant, I order this one and other kind at the same time, this one is much better in every way, prettier and easier to use and also more comfortable, I order another one after I see it.</li>
            <li>It seems to stay in my hair well and the painted accents and the shell/mother or pearl flowers are really pretty!  </li>
            <li>Pretty comb, but one of the flowers came off in my hand as I was taking it out of the original packaging.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is of sturdy construction- the rhinestone adorned flowers have stayed fixed in place and the hand painted detail on the top \\&quot;bridge\\&quot; portion</li>
            <li>I really like this elegant comb and am overall pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty with just enough to dress up a hair style with out being over the top.</li>
            <li>This comb, while being much higher priced than it should be, is really pretty.  </li>
            <li>Pretty product, teeth did not scratch head when inserting comb.</li>
            <li>One of the plastic flowers fell off on the first day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>I like it and it is pretty.  </li>
            <li>Knocked off one star as the first time I used it</li>
            <li>The comb really creates a very pretty hairstyle that&#x27;s both professional and functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have owned it for 2 months now, and use it about 2x a week (not counting the many times it took me to learn the style in the first few days).  </li>
            <li>This price of this comb was much too high given the quality.</li>
            <li>I get used to use this kind of comb, so just be careful not to touch the pretty white flowers, I have read other reviews, they might drop easily, but I don&#x27;t have any problem.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s classic chic.  </li>
            <li>I am experimenting on a new way to wear it.</li>
            <li>Holds my hair in french twist very well!</li>
            <li>:( I recall that although grade school paste was tasty,it really wasn&#x27;t that great a glue.</li>
            <li>(It was a little larger than I was expecting- larger than a normal sized hair comb and probably can&#x27;t be used with fine hair.)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how long this piece will last since the plastic feels almost a little too flexible; however I&#x27;m sure that with proper care it won&#x27;t break anytime soon.  </li>
            <li>so what I really like about this visually is from across the room it appears as if there are only 2 flower pins holding my hair in place rather than an entire comb.  </li>
            <li>Even though the price seemed a little high for a first time comb buyer, I would totally recommend this comb due the beauty and solidness of it.</li>

            <li> (for example, \\&quot;long hair tutorial french twist\\&quot; or \\&quot;layered hair tutorial comb updo\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> It looked like a nice comb online, too bad</li>
            <li> Now my hair is too long for a twist.</li>

            <li> This product holds my hair in a nice twist; however I am still disappointed.</li>

            <li> and since my hair is 6\\&quot; past my shoulders, that means I have to fold the twist over twice before tucking it in</li>

            <li> Really cute very pretty!</li>
            <li> This made me sad.They must have attached the flowers with grade school paste.:( I recall that although grade school paste was tasty,it really wasn&#x27;t that great a glue.</li>
            <li> This comb, while being much higher priced than it should be, is really pretty.  It seems to stay in my hair well and the painted accents and the shell/mother or pearl flowers are really pretty!  If you get over the price for one hair comb, you&#x27;ll love it too.

            <li> Best results yet for thick curly hair, longer teeth, firmer grip.  Pretty product, teeth did not scratch head when inserting comb.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and elegant, I order this one and other kind at the same time, this one is much better in every way, prettier and easier to use and also more comfortable, I order another one after I see it. It&#x27;s good for thin and thick hair. I get used to use this kind of comb, so just be careful not to touch the pretty white flowers, I have read other reviews, they might drop easily, but I don&#x27;t have any problem. I have the ear rings similar like it, they match so well.</li>
            <li> One of the plastic flowers fell off on the first day.  This product holds my hair in a nice twist; however I am still disappointed.</li>
            <li> This comb is beautiful, but after a couple of uses one of the flowers came off. Superglue easily fixed it, but I still have to be careful to not push on the flowers when using it. Keep that in mind and you have yourself a beautiful comb! I recommend searching for hair tutorials on youtube for ideas on how to use combs, sticks, etc. (for example, \\&quot;long hair tutorial french twist\\&quot; or \\&quot;layered hair tutorial comb updo\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> The flowers are awesome and I got some complements. However, the tips of the teeth are sort of rough and some of them hurt my skull. So I stopped using it. My hair is thick and heavy and that cause more strain on my skull. I would recommend this for the people whose hair is light. Try it. Again, the flowers are nice.</li>
            <li> this comb was so beautiful! it is perfect for my job and i sometimes even wear it at home. it has a comfortable, snug fit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and they sent a banana clip instead.  I asked for a replacement and the same thing happened.  It looked like a nice comb online, too bad they wouldn&#x27;t ship me one.</li>
            <li> Holds my shoulder-length hair all day without slipping. Flowers are well attached, I&#x27;ve got many compliments on this comb. Love it!</li>
            <li> I Love it! Holds my hair in french twist very well! I&#x27;d recomend to anyone with any type of hair.</li>
            <li> This price of this comb was much too high given the quality. Yes, one of the flowers fell off when I carefully opened it. Sure, I can super glue it. It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> Pretty comb, but one of the flowers came off in my hand as I was taking it out of the original packaging.  Disappointed with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I should preface this is the only french twist comb I&#x27;ve owned - I learned how to do twists with this comb. I have owned it for 2 months now, and use it about 2x a week (not counting the many times it took me to learn the style in the first few days).  In my opinion, it is of sturdy construction- the rhinestone adorned flowers have stayed fixed in place and the hand painted detail on the top \\&quot;bridge\\&quot; portion was a nice touch.  The flowers are not a cheap plastic, they are very solid. The teeth have no problem weaving into my hair and holding it in place- and since my hair is 6\\&quot; past my shoulders, that means I have to fold the twist over twice before tucking it in, that&#x27;s a lot of hair to keep suspended!   I have dark blonde hair so what I really like about this visually is from across the room it appears as if there are only 2 flower pins holding my hair in place rather than an entire comb.  It is also versatile for varying occasions- I find it is acceptable for the office, the evening, or even the grocery store- it&#x27;s classic chic.  Even though the price seemed a little high for a first time comb buyer, I would totally recommend this comb due the beauty and solidness of it. The only con I can think of is I wish they offered it in a different colors.</li>
            <li> I like it and it is pretty.  Make me looking good, but it is easy to lose the crystal in the flower</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was expecting something a bit sturdier for the price.  However, as soon as I took it out of the package I was impressed with how gorgeous this hair comb looked.  I have fairly long, thick hair, and this generously sized comb held it perfectly in place no problem!  I can&#x27;t say how long this piece will last since the plastic feels almost a little too flexible; however I&#x27;m sure that with proper care it won&#x27;t break anytime soon.  I also didn&#x27;t have trouble with sharp-edged tines like some reviewers mentioned- mine came with nice smooth ends.  The comb really creates a very pretty hairstyle that&#x27;s both professional and functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it can take on my hard-to-tame hair makes it a winner for me.</li>
            <li> I have had this comb for a couple years now. I have only worn it a couple times. It used to hold my French Twist up alone. Now my hair is too long for a twist. I am experimenting on a new way to wear it. It is very pretty with just enough to dress up a hair style with out being over the top. Arrived as stated. It is actually more beautiful in person.</li>
            <li> I really like this elegant comb and am overall pleased with it. Knocked off one star as the first time I used it the larger flower fell off. I&#x27;ve glued it back on and am good to go, but would recommend your give the flowers a wiggle to make sure they stick!</li>
