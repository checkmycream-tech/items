            <li> so I prefer to straighten my hair these days, but its still so frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair frizzy and dry !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product does not impart any shine whatsoever to my hair. It is like I am using absolutely no styling products whatsoever on my hair. The same goes for many of the other keratin products I have used. My hair is dull, dry, curly (caucasian) &amp; very frizzy. Using heat of any kind actually makes it feel drier.&lt;br /&gt;To compare my hair to others. Image most people having hair like spaghetti. Mine is thinner like angel hair pasta, only very dull, dry, curly &amp; frizzy. I will go back to using handfuls of leave-in conditioners, hair gel, curl cream, curl gel &amp; coconut oil. I officially give up &amp; realize I have a hair curse.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s hard to find in a store.  Makes my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair frizzy and dry !</li>
            <li> Good quality product for iron heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;help to straighten up hair and keep it straight for longer time.&lt;br /&gt;Always use it before ironing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> I have blond, highlighted, combo straight / wavy hair that hangs below my shoulders. I&#x27;ve used a bunch of heat protection / straightening products (Chi Iron Guard, Loreal Sleek it, Rock Your Hair 3-day Blow Out, Organix Ever Straight 14-day smoothing treatment). They all deliver the right look, but depending on the product, my hair feels either a little gummy, greasy or dry after treatment. (My guess is these products probably work better for coarser hair.) When I use PureShine my hair is smooth AND silky. I am in love!!! Day one I blow dry with a roller brush and then flat iron. Day 2 I have 1-2 small areas that I need to touch up with a flat iron. After that I&#x27;m good until the next time I wash my hair. (For that I use Organix shampoo and conditioner.)  This product really delivers top-notch results.</li>
            <li> This is the best blow dry serum. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made anymore.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  I usually have to put product after product on it, dry straight and flat iron forever and maybe it will be semi straight.  I didn&#x27;t even need to flat iron!!  It was amazing.  I dried my hair straight (which was cut in half time wise) and went to bed, woke up and it was good to go!!  Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my thick, coarse, dyed Italian hair shiny--people ask me what I&#x27;m doing differently, so my hair must have really looked awful before I started using it! Just ordered my second tube.  You don&#x27;t even need to blow dry your hair--it works just as well!!  They could probably charge more for it.</li>
            <li> Pure Shine Brilliant Blowout really delivers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did an Organix 30 Day Keratin Treatment before Christmas. On a whim I grabbed a tube of Brilliant Blowout at CVS and have used it faithfully since applying the keratin treatment.  My coarse, curly hair has been silky smooth for 10 weeks and counting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago I bought a Renpure Brazilian Keratin 4-Day Flat Iron Spray because my local store didn&#x27;t have Brilliant Blowout (my tube was virtually empty).  Renpure promises \\&quot;beautiful, straight, silky-smooth hair,\\&quot; so I figured it was worth a try. Boy was I wrong. The iron dragged through my hair, which ended up stiff, greasy and lifeless.  Truly awful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I squeezed the last drops of Brilliant Blowout out of the tube. I didn&#x27;t think it would be enough but my hair is right back to soft, smooth, silky and shiny.  I knew that Brilliant Blowout was a good product but I didn&#x27;t know exactly how good until now.  I&#x27;ll never be without it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: While I absolutely love this product, I do not recommend the Seller (CloseOutDepot) due to shoddy and questionable shipping practices. For more info, you can see my comments on the Seller&#x27;s profile page. If there are any questions concerning those comments, I have pictures to back them up.</li>
            <li> Looking Good and Feeling Good</li>
            <li> I was kind of excited about this product but I used the product and it left my hair very dry. After I ran the flat iron through my hair it wasn&#x27;t soft and I didn&#x27;t like the texture of my hair. I waited for a week and my hair was still stiff.  This might work for some people but it definitely did not work for me. I am natural and I have 4 B/C hair texture.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I&#x27;m Caucasian, and my hair is VERY dry, frizzy and damaged from years of dying and perming, (way more then I should).  I bought this product on a whim after hearing that keratin can help repair your hair.  My perm is falling out so I prefer to straighten my hair these days, but its still so frizzy and dry.  My hair also tangles very easy thruout the day.  After using this product. My hair is so soft, shiney, and frizz free, not to mention smooth and tangle free.  Will deff be keeping this product on hand.</li>
            <li> Does ok with smoothing, smells good, super watery texture.  It was fun to try, don&#x27;t plan on buying again.</li>
            <li> I just took my braids out after having them for three months and was looking for some way to tame my unruly natural coif. I looked in the black hair products but nothing really appealed and I did not feel like spending $30.00 on product alone. So I picked up Brilliant Blowout and it was worth every penny. After I washed and conditioned my hair, which again had been in braids for months, I blow dried my 4a/4b hair in about 30-30 minutes and it was so straight. It usually takes me over an hour to get those results. I later flat ironed my hair and it looks like I have been in the salon. Love this product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product for keeping your hair just the way it is after blowdrying!! The Keratin makes your hair shine as well. Keeps the hair from becoming frizzy in humidity, this stuff is a must have!!!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing, I didn&#x27;t even need a flat iron. Try it you won&#x27;t regret it. It leaves your hair silky smooth I&#x27;m completely in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Thank U. On time. Great product</li>
            <li> I have wavy/straight semi-dried dyed hair. decided to try it after reading all the &amp;#34;stuff it does&amp;#34; on the label. After the first use i noticed my hair was not frizzy and ridiculously soft.not to mention it has a good smell. I&#x27;ve tried many hair products and by far this is my fave.</li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly hair. I bought this product about a year ago and didn&#x27;t realize the great effects it had on my hair until recently. I went to the salon to get my hair cut and blown out and had terrible blowout results. Frizzy big and horrible. So I went home and redid it myself forgetting that I had this product, when about quarter way through my hair I noticed that my results were not per usual everything was Frizzy! Then I remembered this product and after using it my results were beautiful. So straight and smooth and best of all afterwards there was no heat damage!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and I&#x27;m happy I was able to find it as they stopped selling it in the store.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky and shiny... love it!</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would weigh down my thin, wavy hair. My hair dries quicker and feels smoother when dried. Just uses on the ends and avoid roots. Really like the product especially for the price</li>
            <li> This Product is the best. I&#x27;ll have smooth hair for days after a use this.</li>
