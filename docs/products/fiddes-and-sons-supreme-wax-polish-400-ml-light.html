            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li>Buffed to a nice shine on the piece of furniture I used it on.</li>
            <li>Nice semi-matte finish&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does help to put a nice sheen on the finished piece, but is not glossy at all.</li>
            <li>This wax is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, goes on easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product, it gives furniture that wonderful old world feel.</li>
            <li>Love the way the wax applies and looks.  </li>
            <li>I have been painting furniture for years, and been using Minwax on my furniture as a top coat.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I was able to salvage the area and not have to repaint the piece, but it could have been a disaster.</li>
            <li>so I was able to salvage some but not all&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this wax for my chalk painted cupboard, but I do have some advice if you use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Easy application, beautiful lasting finish.</li>
            <li>So easy to clean up after spills and the finish remains fantastic.  </li>
            <li>(so I&#x27;ve heard), and for it being my first time, I found the process to go very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I read the directions that say to apply with a cloth and lightly remove with a clean cloth.</li>
            <li>Pretty good wax, much cheaper that Annie Sloan.  </li>
            <li>It truly lets the character of the item show, not changing the original look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used this wax on a small nightstand, and I was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>And gives a nice soft shine.  </li>
            <li>I quickly got to work.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The wax was soft and very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>This wax along with Websters Chalk Paint Powder is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It still has some odor, it&#x27;s marketed as a Low Aromatic product but it was still very strong</li>
            <li>Once I was able to get enough I finished the piece quickly and did like the finish that it had.</li>
            <li>Its soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I use this in place of the AS wax, this is a little cheaper, I can this at Amazon, and seems to work just as good.  </li>
            <li>Goes on so much easier than Annie Sloan and is a lot  cheaper!</li>
            <li>I purchased 3 colors, Clear, Light &amp; Rugger Brown and I like using all of them</li>
            <li>If you use it on a dark paint, make sure the surface you are putting it on is smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love this wax, really no odor at all and goes on very nicely and doesn&#x27;t take but a few minutes</li>
            <li>I had to pick them out and quickly go back over them with a new clean cloth because the cloth I originally used got the rust bits all over it.</li>
            <li>Worked very well on our chalk paint project.</li>
            <li>Can work with it fast, so you can finish your pieces quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it does have a smell so better to use in garage or in an open air area.</li>
            <li>like the product, nice creamy texture, not too over powering of a chemical or solvent smell, but due to the damage in transit, the lid won&#x27;t go back on due to the big dent in the side of the can; not too happy with the postal service for the rough handling</li>
            <li>I refinish a large amount of furniture each year and have tried numerous products.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to spend a little extra money to try it out and see if it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The first problem was that there were little bits of rust in the container that got ALL OVER my white painted furniture.</li>

            <li> Pretty good wax, much cheaper that Annie Sloan.  Low odor, unlike minwax products.  Worked very well on our chalk paint project.</li>

            <li> This wax is very easy to use. And gives a nice soft shine.  Great over chalk paint</li>

            <li> great Buy, great wax, great for over chalk paint</li>
            <li> I like fiddes &amp; son wax the best and i have used them all including a.s. Its soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Love the way the wax applies and looks.  Used on cream white and did not change color.</li>
            <li> The wax was soft and very easy to work with. Buffed to a nice shine on the piece of furniture I used it on.</li>
            <li> I use this in place of the AS wax, this is a little cheaper, I can this at Amazon, and seems to work just as good.  I purchased 3 colors, Clear, Light &amp; Rugger Brown and I like using all of them</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but was sadly disappointed! I have been painting furniture for years, and been using Minwax on my furniture as a top coat. Fiddes &amp; Sons was recommended to me by other professional furniture painters, like myself. So I decided to spend a little extra money to try it out and see if it was worth it. As soon as I received this in the mail I decided to use it over a coffee table that had been painted with white chalk paint. I read the directions that say to apply with a cloth and lightly remove with a clean cloth. Then allow to dry for 3 minutes and buff. I quickly got to work. The first problem was that there were little bits of rust in the container that got ALL OVER my white painted furniture. I had to pick them out and quickly go back over them with a new clean cloth because the cloth I originally used got the rust bits all over it. Thankfully, I was able to salvage the area and not have to repaint the piece, but it could have been a disaster. I had to then go through the container and try to scoop out some of the wax that had none of the rust pieces in it to finish the table. Once I was able to get enough I finished the piece quickly and did like the finish that it had. With all of that said here are some pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;- Can work with it fast, so you can finish your pieces quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Nice semi-matte finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- The metal container rusted and basically ruined the wax so I was able to salvage some but not all&lt;br /&gt;- It still has some odor, it&#x27;s marketed as a Low Aromatic product but it was still very strong&lt;br /&gt;- I found it difficult to create a streak free finish after buffing, with Minwax this is never a problem.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll probably not use this product and I don&#x27;t recommend using it on your painted furniture. I&#x27;ll probably just go with Minxwax next time and save myself the extra $10 bucks!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works great with the chalk paints I use!</li>
            <li> I used this wax over some decorative milk painting. It is very easy to use, goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;It does not yellow, and is virtually invisible. It does help to put a nice sheen on the finished piece, but is not glossy at all. It truly lets the character of the item show, not changing the original look.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Best wax for finishing chalk painted furniture. Beats all the name brand chalk paint waxes hands down, and a lot less expensive!</li>
            <li> Love the product, it gives furniture that wonderful old world feel. So easy to clean up after spills and the finish remains fantastic.  The only thing is that it does have a smell so better to use in garage or in an open air area.</li>
            <li> Quality product! I use this on our metal Art. So it isn&#x27;t just for wood.</li>
            <li> I love this wax for my chalk painted cupboard, but I do have some advice if you use it.  Wipe it off right away and don&#x27;t wait a while, or you will have a difficult time taking this off.  If you use it on a dark paint, make sure the surface you are putting it on is smooth.  I did find it seems to go into crevices and leave a white wax deposited.  It might go away in time, but I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the smalll crevices.  I think it does what it is suppose to, which is protect the chalk paint finish.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this wax, really no odor at all and goes on very nicely and doesn&#x27;t take but a few minutes and you can buff it to a beautiful shine. Will definitely buy again.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> like the product, nice creamy texture, not too over powering of a chemical or solvent smell, but due to the damage in transit, the lid won&#x27;t go back on due to the big dent in the side of the can; not too happy with the postal service for the rough handling</li>
            <li> I used this wax on a small nightstand, and I was very happy with the results.  Applying wax can be tricky sometimes (so I&#x27;ve heard), and for it being my first time, I found the process to go very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great for waxing over my chalk paint projects</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li> great product... will purchase again!</li>
