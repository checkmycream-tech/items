    <ol>
            <li>I think this product is great!  </li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they would make this under a best review for toners!  </li>
            <li>However to me this is not the best benefit I have received from this product though.</li>
            <li>Excellent ingredients!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this alcohol-free toner.</li>
            <li>It does that job perfectly, without irritation.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect ending after washing with derma e cleanser.</li>
            <li>This toner is great!  </li>
            <li>The price is very fair for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>Excellent toner and great for ANY skin type.</li>
            <li>Price was good too!</li>
            <li>This makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li>It is unscented, cleansing and a welcome addition to my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>Great toner.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing stuff!  </li>
            <li>Nice quality ingredients for an inexpensive price and bonus, anti aging!</li>
            <li>I use this toner with Vit C serum and organic shea butter on top and my face has never looked this flawless!</li>
            <li>so I was happy to have a good reaction.</li>
            <li>It is pleasant to use, and on application makes the skin feel good.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is good.</li>
            <li>It also has good antioxidants in it.  </li>
            <li>The product seems good</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t a good match for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 with fair, combination skin that leans towards dryness.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll not buy it again--did not do anything good for me</li>
            <li>My skin looks good.  </li>
            <li>If you do not want toxic fragrances and a good product you will like this.</li>
            <li>a good price and a good buy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, very light feel and very healthy!</li>
            <li>When I got it out the smell was good and felt nice on my fingers.</li>
            <li>This is great because it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>This toner is so nice for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best toner of its kind - unscented, non-irritating - that I&#x27;ve very found.</li>
            <li>Best alcohol-free toner I&#x27;ve used, and more gentle than the witch hazel</li>
            <li>Wonderful toner for those who wish to use natural products</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>This got good reviews on my go-to website (Beautypedia) and so far, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really been happy with this one.</li>
            <li>It stung more than any toner I have ever used, even those with ingredients that are supposed to be irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>My cousin is even more fragrance-sensitive than I am, and she uses this product with no problem whatsoever.</li>
            <li>so maybe I should give it more stars.  </li>
            <li>Nice, light smell.</li>
            <li>but when they sent the replacement bottle they didn&#x27;t even tape the top</li>
            <li>so it opened again (pop top lid).</li>
            <li>Love my toners.  </li>
            <li>I do love the cleanser and moisturizer in this line.</li>
            <li>What I LOVE is not having to wear foundation.</li>
            <li>I got on here to order more and just had to leave a review.</li>
            <li>Never used a toner before, love this.  </li>
            <li>(most of them contain alcohol...</li>
            <li>More importantly, I think it has benefited my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, although my skin is very sensitive and it made me break out</li>
            <li>I have combo skin and it feels good for both my oily and normal parts.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat dry skin and this mild toner is perfect.</li>
            <li>When i first started using it, i noticed a light tingle- which is refreshing and indicates to me that the ingredient is working and still potent.  </li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old that has flawless skin but its very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 with combination skin; I have a lightly oily T-zone with largish pores that tend to get congested.  </li>
            <li>but this is a great 2nd choice!</li>
            <li>so have had to find all fragrance free products to use.  </li>
            <li>A lot of products say they&#x27;re fragrance free</li>
            <li>I do like that it was fragrance free though</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good toner for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far, so good with this one.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So worth the money!</li>
            <li>and its been great every single step of the way.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure that it really helps in the anti-aging department, but for some reason I believe it has.</li>
            <li>Found this product to be very drying, leading my skin to produce much more oil, thus breaking me out.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li>you do not need to pay lots of money for good facial toner like this one.</li>
            <li>Derma e is my favorite facial products for sure.</li>
            <li>said it would be good for dry skin..</li>
            <li>after a chemical peel, i wipe this stuff on my face and it&#x27;s instantly calm.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gentle, alcohol free face toner to use while on Ratin A 0.025% treatment.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a very refreshing yet slight tingle, and it leave my skin clean.  </li>
            <li>However, it does not seem to clean my skin very well.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look better and does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>If you like using a toner, This toner has anti aging pynogenol, and NO alcohol, so it&#x27;s very gentle.  </li>
            <li>The first toner I have even purchased that does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I am now on my 2nd purchase of this product:)</li>
            <li>There are many products I cannot use such as Olay, Maybelline, Mac and the list goes on.</li>
            <li>and I saw a difference in my forehead wrinkle the first week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does sting a bit on first couple of uses but then the skin gets use to it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the top on it.</li>
            <li>I have bought other things from this brand before and have always found it to be amazing.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a great simple toner that works well.</li>
            <li>I love this toner, the first I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face!</li>
            <li>its ok i have not used it long enought to really tell yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad this works for some people, but if you have rosacea and dry skin, you might want to look elsewhere!</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t provide that much moisture even I use it when Summer is coming.</li>
            <li>(the bottle is a flip top so there is minimal exposure to air).</li>
            <li>and i do really like the results from this toner</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s cheap enough, and I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>It is possible that I don&#x27;t see it because the color of the product is actually about the same color as the makeup, but I just think the alcohol cleans better, although it is much more drying.</li>
            <li>and we all know alcohol is very drying especially on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toner!</li>
            <li>the toner is very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m more normal to dry</li>
            <li>The bottle does not come with a plastic overlay like so many other liquid products do.  </li>
            <li>Many products say a product is a \\&quot;such and such toner\\&quot; like \\&quot;pycnogenol toner\\&quot; or \\&quot;acai toner\\&quot; or whatever</li>
            <li>I normally only use one brand of toner, but was running out and needed something quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have no doubt this product is equally as high in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hydrates really well, all natural and never irritates my skin, I use on face and neck/chest, I put it in a spray bottle though</li>
            <li>I rarely buy a skincare product twice, but this is my second bottle of this toner.  </li>
            <li>Non irritating and feels good on the skin, seems to remove any excess cleanser or makeup.  </li>
            <li>My skin has suffered no ill effects since using half of my first bottle, and perhaps best of all, this toner does not sting when used on broken skin (of which there is frequently a lot on my acne-prone, dry face).</li>
            <li>I like this toner because it is free of alcohol, synthetic fragrance and color, and any other skin irritants.</li>
            <li>Wanted to like it so much because of the natural ingredients, but it just wasn&#x27;t for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it is so far working very well for my oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was highly recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed another reviewer complaining that this stings, and am very surprised, because that has not been my experience at all.</li>
            <li>I like how it leaves my skin feeling clean, but not tight or dry.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals to damage your skin!</li>
            <li>The antioxidants will break down and oxidize upon exposure to light or air</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to over-dispense and waste product.</li>
            <li>Well, I guess its more of a large expression line that runs across my forehead but regardless its decreased in size.</li>
            <li>skin feels so clear.</li>
            <li>I have not used a lot of different toners over the years, so I really have nothing to compare this to.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the bottle is clear, so you have to be careful not to expose it to light.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with hormonal acne after stopping years of birth control pills.</li>
            <li>I Don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have used it for a couple of years and like it for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I put this toner on my face, it relieves the dryness and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough for my 50+ skin, feels like it&#x27;s cleaning/clearing but not stripping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I prefer the light toner to the heavy serums.  </li>
            <li>Im sensitive</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the lack of alcohol and fragrance in this toner, because most toners on the market include these irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I do feel a slight tingling, but it quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>drys their face is hard to believe because it&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product twice a day to help remove the last vestiges of makeup and clear my pores before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old female with combination to oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I like this product for the fact that it does not dry out my skin or make me break out.</li>
            <li>IT&amp;#34;S Not and seems to dry my skin out more and make it feel tight!!!</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to find products that wouldn&#x27;t make my sensitive eyelid swell.</li>
            <li>I also love that it contains green tea because I am a big green tea drinker...</li>
            <li>I have trouble with moisturizers and sunscreens causing pimples, especially in the summer, but I feel that this delivers at least some of what aging skin needs, and in winter I can add a moisturizer or serum on top, no trouble.  </li>
            <li>Over time, I believe this has helped reduce the congestion on my nose and reduced the new formation of closed blackheads and those deep pimples.  </li>

            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the top on it.</li>
            <li> I have bought other things from this brand before and have always found it to be amazing.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a great simple toner that works well.</li>
            <li> I love this toner, the first I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face!</li>
            <li> its ok i have not used it long enought to really tell yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this works for some people, but if you have rosacea and dry skin, you might want to look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t provide that much moisture even I use it when Summer is coming.</li>
            <li> (the bottle is a flip top so there is minimal exposure to air).</li>
            <li> and i do really like the results from this toner</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s cheap enough, and I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> It is possible that I don&#x27;t see it because the color of the product is actually about the same color as the makeup, but I just think the alcohol cleans better, although it is much more drying.</li>
            <li> and we all know alcohol is very drying especially on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toner!</li>
            <li> the toner is very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m more normal to dry</li>
            <li> The bottle does not come with a plastic overlay like so many other liquid products do.  </li>
            <li> Many products say a product is a \\&quot;such and such toner\\&quot; like \\&quot;pycnogenol toner\\&quot; or \\&quot;acai toner\\&quot; or whatever</li>
            <li> I normally only use one brand of toner, but was running out and needed something quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have no doubt this product is equally as high in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hydrates really well, all natural and never irritates my skin, I use on face and neck/chest, I put it in a spray bottle though</li>
            <li> I rarely buy a skincare product twice, but this is my second bottle of this toner.  </li>
            <li> Non irritating and feels good on the skin, seems to remove any excess cleanser or makeup.  </li>
            <li> My skin has suffered no ill effects since using half of my first bottle, and perhaps best of all, this toner does not sting when used on broken skin (of which there is frequently a lot on my acne-prone, dry face).</li>
            <li> I like this toner because it is free of alcohol, synthetic fragrance and color, and any other skin irritants.</li>
            <li> Wanted to like it so much because of the natural ingredients, but it just wasn&#x27;t for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it is so far working very well for my oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was highly recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed another reviewer complaining that this stings, and am very surprised, because that has not been my experience at all.</li>
            <li> I like how it leaves my skin feeling clean, but not tight or dry.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals to damage your skin!</li>
            <li> The antioxidants will break down and oxidize upon exposure to light or air</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to over-dispense and waste product.</li>
            <li> Well, I guess its more of a large expression line that runs across my forehead but regardless its decreased in size.</li>
            <li> skin feels so clear.</li>
            <li> I have not used a lot of different toners over the years, so I really have nothing to compare this to.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the bottle is clear, so you have to be careful not to expose it to light.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with hormonal acne after stopping years of birth control pills.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of years and like it for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I put this toner on my face, it relieves the dryness and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my 50+ skin, feels like it&#x27;s cleaning/clearing but not stripping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I prefer the light toner to the heavy serums.  </li>
            <li> Im sensitive</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the lack of alcohol and fragrance in this toner, because most toners on the market include these irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I do feel a slight tingling, but it quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> drys their face is hard to believe because it&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product twice a day to help remove the last vestiges of makeup and clear my pores before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old female with combination to oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I like this product for the fact that it does not dry out my skin or make me break out.</li>
            <li> IT&amp;#34;S Not and seems to dry my skin out more and make it feel tight!!!</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to find products that wouldn&#x27;t make my sensitive eyelid swell.</li>
            <li> I also love that it contains green tea because I am a big green tea drinker...</li>
            <li> I have trouble with moisturizers and sunscreens causing pimples, especially in the summer, but I feel that this delivers at least some of what aging skin needs, and in winter I can add a moisturizer or serum on top, no trouble.  </li>
            <li> Over time, I believe this has helped reduce the congestion on my nose and reduced the new formation of closed blackheads and those deep pimples.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and half now and it has not caused me any break outs, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to adding the rest of the green label products for sensitive skin as I run out  of those I;&#x27;m currently using; moisturizer and serum.</li>
            <li> I will likely go back to my other brand</li>
            <li> The bottle is as shown in the picture (not clear as mentioned in another</li>
            <li> I also wanted to mention that my bottle was not clear as another reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> It will still sting my face a little on days when my skin is feeling particularly dry and sensitive, but it has not happened often.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t tingle or sting like other toners, and it hasn&#x27;t broken out my sensitive skin, but I wonder whether it&#x27;s doing anything at all but making my face sort of wet and sticky.</li>
            <li> , then you look in the ingredients and it is actually a very minor ingredient.  </li>
            <li> And got me Paula&#x27;s toners which don&#x27;t burn and feel cooling to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> This toner left my skin feeling very tight and dry.</li>
            <li> This is a simple product, with just the stated ingredient and a few others.  </li>
            <li> because its simplicity of ingredients, it is compatible with all my other skin products.</li>
            <li> Ordered this in my attempt to add a toner to my routine of other derma-e products, with the purpose of improving the appearance of my skin and pores.</li>
            <li> I am using this for the antioxidants, but am not sure it&#x27;s actually practical.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin due to hypothyroidism and every time I wash my face, no matter what cleanser I use, my face always feels tight and dry due to having hard water at my house.  </li>
            <li> The product as dispensed is an odd orange color.</li>
            <li> It does stings a little, but i haven&#x27;t noticed any dryness or peeling since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Also, it did sting a little.  </li>
            <li> It seems to even tone and firm up the skin making healthier too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure what I think about this toner.</li>
            <li> Not good for any skin type especially dry skin!)</li>
            <li> It seems there are very few well formulated toners out there</li>
            <li> THe igredients may past their test, but the mixture of it shouldn&#x27;t because it feels like alcohol rub going on my face!  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that&#x27;s been bad from their reviews.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;m crazy about it to get it again.  </li>
            <li> Stimulates collegin growth as well as expensive serums.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend that you try it, and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is HORRIBLE and Not a GOOD buy at all!!!</li>
            <li> This toner broke my skin out terribly.  </li>
            <li> I HATE IT!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure what I think about this toner. The product as dispensed is an odd orange color. The smell is a bit funky. It certainly doesn&#x27;t tingle or sting like other toners, and it hasn&#x27;t broken out my sensitive skin, but I wonder whether it&#x27;s doing anything at all but making my face sort of wet and sticky. I think I&#x27;m going to have to use it longer and see whether I see any results, but so far...meh.</li>
            <li> I like this toner because it is free of alcohol, synthetic fragrance and color, and any other skin irritants. It balances the ph after face wash. because its simplicity of ingredients, it is compatible with all my other skin products. But it doesn&#x27;t provide that much moisture even I use it when Summer is coming.</li>
            <li> Excellent toner and great for ANY skin type. My friends and I all use this and we all have different skin, mine is acne prone. Nice quality ingredients for an inexpensive price and bonus, anti aging!</li>
            <li> The bottle does not come with a plastic overlay like so many other liquid products do.  Since the bottle cap was not tightened, the product leaked in shipping. The product itself is good.</li>
            <li> I rarely buy a skincare product twice, but this is my second bottle of this toner.  No alcohols or witch hazels, fragrances or irritants.  It is pleasant to use, and on application makes the skin feel good.  More importantly, I think it has benefited my skin.  I&#x27;m 50 with combination skin; I have a lightly oily T-zone with largish pores that tend to get congested.  Across my cheeks I can end up with blackheads or a deep-rooted pimple that seems to come from deep within me but takes forever to come to the surface if it ever does at all. Over time, I believe this has helped reduce the congestion on my nose and reduced the new formation of closed blackheads and those deep pimples.  I have trouble with moisturizers and sunscreens causing pimples, especially in the summer, but I feel that this delivers at least some of what aging skin needs, and in winter I can add a moisturizer or serum on top, no trouble.  I can&#x27;t be sure that it really helps in the anti-aging department, but for some reason I believe it has.</li>
            <li> This toner broke my skin out terribly.  I know everyone&#x27;s different but this just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have not used a lot of different toners over the years, so I really have nothing to compare this to.  I can say I have had no problems with it, and I plan to continue using it because it does what it is supposed to do. It makes my skin look better and does not dry it out. I would recommend that you try it, and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a miracle product by any means but I like using toner and I&#x27;ve really been happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was highly recommended for people with sensitive skin. Since I have rosacea, I thought it sounded perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It BURNED. I was so surprised. It stung more than any toner I have ever used, even those with ingredients that are supposed to be irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this works for some people, but if you have rosacea and dry skin, you might want to look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> This toner is so nice for my skin. I have combo skin and it feels good for both my oily and normal parts.</li>
            <li> This is great because it is fragrance free.  It also has good antioxidants in it.  The only downside is that the bottle is clear, so you have to be careful not to expose it to light.  The antioxidants will break down and oxidize upon exposure to light or air (the bottle is a flip top so there is minimal exposure to air).</li>
            <li> I use all Derma-E products for my face and i do really like the results from this toner.. Big + is NO Burning your face when you use it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with hormonal acne after stopping years of birth control pills. Ordered this in my attempt to add a toner to my routine of other derma-e products, with the purpose of improving the appearance of my skin and pores. Found this product to be very drying, leading my skin to produce much more oil, thus breaking me out. Wanted to like it so much because of the natural ingredients, but it just wasn&#x27;t for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Alcohol-free, fragrance-free! I use this to remove the last traces of makeup if I don&#x27;t wash my face well enough at night and to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> Non irritating and feels good on the skin, seems to remove any excess cleanser or makeup.  No harsh chemicals to damage your skin!</li>
            <li> I think this product is great!  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels so clear. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. This is the best toner of its kind - unscented, non-irritating - that I&#x27;ve very found. My cousin is even more fragrance-sensitive than I am, and she uses this product with no problem whatsoever. I find that it soothes my skin, especially when used in combination with the cleanser. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look great. The first toner I have even purchased that does not irritate my skin. I am now on my 2nd purchase of this product:)</li>
            <li> Hydrates really well, all natural and never irritates my skin, I use on face and neck/chest, I put it in a spray bottle though so I can mist it on.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s good enough.  It does do the job so maybe I should give it more stars.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals.  Not sure I&#x27;m crazy about it to get it again.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not sold on the purpose of a toner...</li>
            <li> Wonderful toner for those who wish to use natural products</li>
            <li> Nice, light smell. I am using this for the antioxidants, but am not sure it&#x27;s actually practical. However, it&#x27;s cheap enough, and I will continue to buy. I have very sensitive skin, and I do feel a slight tingling, but it quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try this because I like the Derma E hylauronic mask and Paula&#x27;s choice reviews said it would be good for dry skin.. We NOPE IT&amp;#34;S Not and seems to dry my skin out more and make it feel tight!!! I don&#x27;t understand why they would make this under a best review for toners!  THe igredients may past their test, but the mixture of it shouldn&#x27;t because it feels like alcohol rub going on my face!  This is the only product that&#x27;s been bad from their reviews.  It burns my skin literally everytime I&#x27;ve used it, but I tolerate it because it&#x27;s suppose to be &amp;#34;GOOD&amp;#34; for my skin. I Don&#x27;t have sensitive skin I&amp;#34;m more normal to dry.. I HATE IT!! And got me Paula&#x27;s toners which don&#x27;t burn and feel cooling to my dry skin. This is HORRIBLE and Not a GOOD buy at all!!!</li>
            <li> The product seems good but it spilled in the mail. When I got it out the smell was good and felt nice on my fingers. I have bought other things from this brand before and have always found it to be amazing. I have no doubt this product is equally as high in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to review: I sent back the spilled bottle and they took it no problems but when they sent the replacement bottle they didn&#x27;t even tape the top so it opened again (pop top lid). I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back again. Not a lot spilled the second time around, but I won&#x27;t order from them again. All it would have taken was a piece of tape or some plastic.</li>
            <li> This toner left my skin feeling very tight and dry. I purchased it because it was all-natural &amp; alcohol-free but it wasn&#x27;t a good match for my skin.  I&#x27;m 34 with fair, combination skin that leans towards dryness. I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> Love my toners.  I did not need any just bought it for the price.  It cleans without stripping.  I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product for the fact that it does not dry out my skin or make me break out. Also, I struggled with redness and have none of that after using this product. However, it does not seem to clean my skin very well. When I use alcohol on my cotton ball, I see lots of makeup residue afterwards. When I use this product, I don&#x27;t see any. It is possible that I don&#x27;t see it because the color of the product is actually about the same color as the makeup, but I just think the alcohol cleans better, although it is much more drying. I will have to find another product. I do love the cleanser and moisturizer in this line.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old that has flawless skin but its very sensitive.  There are many products I cannot use such as Olay, Maybelline, Mac and the list goes on. Whether it be redness, burning or a teenage whitehead in the morning I just cant wear them. Anyway back to this product. Let me say this stuff not only helps tighten your skin but it gives it a youthful glow. I have been using it regularly for about 6 months now with a cottonball once a day before my makeup and I saw a difference in my forehead wrinkle the first week. Well, I guess its more of a large expression line that runs across my forehead but regardless its decreased in size. However to me this is not the best benefit I have received from this product though. What I LOVE is not having to wear foundation. just powder and by the end of the day my face still has zero grease in the t zone! Love love love! Seems to hold my makeup in place too. My blush stays all day. Anyway if this sounds like you give this a try. I got on here to order more and just had to leave a review.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product I feel sticky, and the smell is odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does sting a bit on first couple of uses but then the skin gets use to it. But I&#x27;ll not buy it again--did not do anything good for me</li>
            <li> This toner was a recommended pick from Paula B over at beautipediaDOTcom, and with the low price, I thought I&#x27;d check it out.  So far I love it.  It gives you a very refreshing yet slight tingle, and it leave my skin clean.  So far so good.  I&#x27;ll update the review if I have any problems.</li>
            <li> Excellent ingredients!</li>
            <li> If you like using a toner, This toner has anti aging pynogenol, and NO alcohol, so it&#x27;s very gentle.  I have used it for a couple of years and like it for my sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t like toners with witch hazel or alcohol because they are drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks good.  Must be working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, although my skin is very sensitive and it made me break out and I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> its ok i have not used it long enought to really tell yet i realy dont see anything yet i will write back</li>
            <li> Never used a toner before, love this.  smooths skin and preps it for treatments.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the lack of alcohol and fragrance in this toner, because most toners on the market include these irritating ingredients. I have very sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin. I like how it leaves my skin feeling clean, but not tight or dry. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and half now and it has not caused me any break outs, as far as I can tell. It will still sting my face a little on days when my skin is feeling particularly dry and sensitive, but it has not happened often. The price is very fair for the amount you get. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the top on it. It&#x27;s easy to over-dispense and waste product. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an efficient method of dispensing a liquid. Other than that, this is a great simple toner that works well.</li>
            <li> Many products say a product is a \\&quot;such and such toner\\&quot; like \\&quot;pycnogenol toner\\&quot; or \\&quot;acai toner\\&quot; or whatever, then you look in the ingredients and it is actually a very minor ingredient.  Not in this case!  This is a simple product, with just the stated ingredient and a few others.  When i first started using it, i noticed a light tingle- which is refreshing and indicates to me that the ingredient is working and still potent.  Otherwise, very light feel and very healthy!</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry skin and this mild toner is perfect.</li>
            <li> If you do not want toxic fragrances and a good product you will like this. It seems to even tone and firm up the skin making healthier too.</li>
            <li> I love this toner, the first I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face! For people who say this&lt;br /&gt;toner drys their face is hard to believe because it&#x27;s alcohol free and we all know alcohol is very drying especially on sensitive skin. I use this toner with Vit C serum and organic shea butter on top and my face has never looked this flawless!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toner for sensitive skin and I trust Derma E products. Looking forward to adding the rest of the green label products for sensitive skin as I run out  of those I;&#x27;m currently using; moisturizer and serum.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this alcohol-free toner. No sticky residue, no scent. My skin has suffered no ill effects since using half of my first bottle, and perhaps best of all, this toner does not sting when used on broken skin (of which there is frequently a lot on my acne-prone, dry face). I noticed another reviewer complaining that this stings, and am very surprised, because that has not been my experience at all. The bottle is as shown in the picture (not clear as mentioned in another review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product twice a day to help remove the last vestiges of makeup and clear my pores before applying moisturizer. It does that job perfectly, without irritation. Best alcohol-free toner I&#x27;ve used, and more gentle than the witch hazel I was using prior to the switch. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Derma e is my favorite facial products for sure. It took me a long time to find products that wouldn&#x27;t make my sensitive eyelid swell. This product is perfect ending after washing with derma e cleanser.</li>
            <li> This toner is great!  I have very dry skin due to hypothyroidism and every time I wash my face, no matter what cleanser I use, my face always feels tight and dry due to having hard water at my house.  As soon as I put this toner on my face, it relieves the dryness and leaves it feeling soft.  It seems there are very few well formulated toners out there (most of them contain alcohol... yuck!  Not good for any skin type especially dry skin!) but this is one of them.  I also love that it contains green tea because I am a big green tea drinker... it&#x27;s amazing stuff!  I highly recommend this toner!</li>
            <li> I normally only use one brand of toner, but was running out and needed something quickly.  This got good reviews on my go-to website (Beautypedia) and so far, it&#x27;s been great. Gentle enough for my 50+ skin, feels like it&#x27;s cleaning/clearing but not stripping. I will likely go back to my other brand but this is a great 2nd choice!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now feb.16 and its been great every single step of the way. the toner is very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t burn at all. the soothing part isn&#x27;t an exaggeration either. after a chemical peel, i wipe this stuff on my face and it&#x27;s instantly calm. a good price and a good buy. i will be repurchasing this</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentle, alcohol free face toner to use while on Ratin A 0.025% treatment. So far, so good with this one. It does stings a little, but i haven&#x27;t noticed any dryness or peeling since I&#x27;ve been using it. Price was good too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells so have had to find all fragrance free products to use.  A lot of products say they&#x27;re fragrance free but I can still smell them.  This toner works well and has no smell!</li>
            <li> Used with the derma-e pycnognol face cream this toner fights the signs of aging.  It is unscented, cleansing and a welcome addition to my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> No perfume smells, no burning or stinging. So worth the money! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> you do not need to pay lots of money for good facial toner like this one. A++ compared to Lancome&#x27;s or Clarins extravagant price</li>
            <li> Stimulates collegin growth as well as expensive serums.  I prefer the light toner to the heavy serums.  My face and neck are immediately toned leaving a firmer look.</li>
            <li> I used the toner only once a day and it is so far working very well for my oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old female with combination to oily, acne prone skin.  This toner made me break out in tiny white pimples.  Also, it did sting a little.  I do like that it was fragrance free though and I would have continued using it if it didn&#x27;t break me out.  I also wanted to mention that my bottle was not clear as another reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Im sensitive so I was happy to have a good reaction.</li>
            <li> Great toner. My oily, acne-prone skin likes and there is no signs of irritation or adverse reactions.</li>
