            <li>Best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>It is best for a person like me to have two of these masks.</li>
            <li>and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>They are wonderful.</li>
            <li>My husband has glaucoma and needs to add heat to his eyes after his eye drops and this is perfect.</li>

            <li>great for sleeping too!</li>
            <li>Elastic band is the perfect size so it wont fall off while wearing.</li>
            <li>my daughter-in law thought it was awesome.</li>
            <li>This is perfect and the price was in the range I was looking for.</li>

            <li>it was very nice for relaxation</li>
            <li>it contours to your face very nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is good for the price though</li>

            <li>Love this item!</li>
            <li>I love this mask a lot!</li>
            <li>It will make you feel like you&#x27;ve just had a nice eye massage (</li>
            <li>nicely designed with a strap that does not get tangled with hair, but does not come close to covering my eyes.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend looking for another one if you want to get more even relief.  </li>
            <li>because I wish it was slightly more durable.  </li>
            <li>all I can say is I love</li>
            <li>I love this mask...</li>
            <li>During the extraction from the packaging, the mask became &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; to the plastic envelope it was packed in and on more than one occasion</li>
            <li>Just be sure to USE it and not put off you time. :)</li>
            <li>it is so comfortable!</li>
            <li>I am happy with this gel eye mask, it serves its purpose very well.</li>
            <li>Great product, coming from me with high recommendations.</li>
            <li>We loved them so much, I reordered another for my mom!</li>
            <li>this is nice and cool even at room temperature.  </li>
            <li>I think the container it came in would be more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great product for the price!</li>
            <li>These are fine</li>
            <li>uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added it on as a cheap purchase add-on</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t block any light</li>
            <li>This mask is a cheap rip off of the Thera Pearl mask; the quality can&#x27;t even compare.  </li>
            <li>The little beads are great, they allow the mask to mold to your face comfortably, more than an ice pack ever will.</li>
            <li>VERY comfortable and moves very well.</li>
            <li>Best thing after a hard day or when eyes need come TLC.</li>
            <li>It gives a soothing massage whether u heat it or cool it.</li>
            <li>spills off its content quickly if you step on it</li>
            <li>These serve a good purpose but they don&#x27;t stay cool for very long.</li>
            <li>Cooling was very nice for the days my eyes were slightly puffy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li>so it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Being a make up artist, I spend a lot of my day straining my eyes in effort to pay attention to everyone&#x27;s unique and beautiful facial features, After a long day of work, my eyes begin to hurt.</li>
            <li>I ordered when I was 6 month pregnant, hot all the time and not getting any sleep (burning eyes)</li>
            <li>I bought it because I have severe dry eye and need a warm compress every night.</li>
            <li>This is very cheap compared to the same mask the eye doctor wanted to sell me for $35!</li>
            <li>LOVE THE TINY LIL BEADS.</li>
            <li>First I put it in the microwave for</li>
            <li>These worked pretty well at first.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that many &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; so the mask is pretty flat and doesn&#x27;t press into my eye sockets as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>This feels great when you first put it on, unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t hold temperature long, so by the time you&#x27;re nice and relaxed in your bed or on your couch, it has warmed to room temperature</li>
            <li>we help your eye  very well</li>
            <li>good product and great price, gets nice and cold, soothing, strap is a bit lame</li>
            <li>Fits well - very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I do not like the elastic band much, so</li>
            <li>This mask works very well.</li>
            <li>This cooling eye mask is a great for tired or puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>Temperature loss EXTREMELY fast.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Love it helps me get a good night&#x27;s rest and my eyes feel less tired in the morning if that makes sense..</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this little mask.</li>
            <li>If you just need relief and soothing right above your nose and the bottoms of your eyes, ie.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s only comfortable at refrigerator temp for a rather short  while.</li>
            <li>When freezing, the beads lock into place with frost - making this exactly like a standard ice pack which freezes into a brick shape.  </li>
            <li>worth the purchase also bought Elasto Gel Hot / Cold Sinus Mask, i use both glad i bought both.</li>
            <li>Soft and comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The band is kind of tight, but I suppose after a few uses it&#x27;ll loosen up to the point it&#x27;ll be too loose.</li>
            <li>Extreme temperatures tend to make elastic dry rot quickly and loose elasticity.</li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted - too bad it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> gets pretty hard when you freeze it</li>
            <li> 15 seconds - microwaves are powerful - not a good idea.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviews, the mask broke from normal use after a few months and the beads leaked out.  </li>
            <li> Helped with my chronic dry eye and inflamation.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for inflamation and dry ee that no medication can help.</li>
            <li> Gets cold very quickly.</li>
            <li> The gel balls inside make it form easily to your face, and keep cold.</li>
            <li> Rather than using eye drops every single day which is bad for you in the long run - I would warm up the Gel Bead Eye Mask after work and sit with it on for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I did not got the green color, I got a blue one for some reason.</li>
            <li> main reason I got this is because I work in front of a computer all day and my eyes would be tired, dry and hurting at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It would instantly make my eyes water but would definitely help the dry and tired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stays cooler than other gel masks I have tried.</li>
            <li> for small heads or close eye people only</li>
            <li> It gets cold quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving it in the refrigerator for hours.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long to get cold in the fridge but also (living in Phoenix-very hot state)</li>
            <li> When I have a migraine I need dark</li>
            <li> DOWN SIDE</li>
            <li> I use it for headaches too or whenever I feel run down.</li>
            <li> I guess I couldn&#x27;t be too disappointed it was relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> But once it warms up a little</li>
            <li> Bought two of these for hubby and myself with hopes to ease our everyday headaches.</li>
            <li> waste of $6.</li>
            <li> But, after a few uses the string broke and some of the gel beads began coming out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it, just go get the Thera Pearl</li>
            <li> I used it for about 6 months but after mask has got a holes (probably  mask&#x27;s walls have been broken because of freezer) and it has became like a big block of ice so that i couldn&#x27;t use it anymore&#x3D;((&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only other downside was that the elastic band was slightly uncomfortable but now I am just getting picky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure I recommend it</li>
            <li> is that it doesn&#x27;t have small but outs for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Hard sticky type of plastic.</li>
            <li> They can get too cold after only a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> it does&#x27;t stay cold very long and</li>
            <li> Does not stay cold very long.</li>
            <li> Also, after freezing, it is extremely stiff and uncomfortable to wear, so you have to thaw it for a bit before it will mold to your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have common sense!  </li>
            <li> this.works well for headaches or tired eyes</li>
            <li> mine hasn&#x27;t broken yet and I wear it even when I sleep.</li>
            <li> Again not a good idea!</li>
            <li> Had horrible  migraines, aleviates the stress and pain hot and cold.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to get out of the package.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from migraines and one relief is cold pressure.  </li>
            <li> Because my eyes are so sentitive, the cold hurts a bit.  </li>
            <li> one sweat&#x27;s and is either way way to cold, like painfully cold and</li>
            <li> it lasts about 10 minutes before it&#x27;s no longer cold..</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Its already cold nurtured without even being put into a fridge!</li>
            <li> So there you are trying to relax with this awful smell on your face.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave it a quick wash with mild soap and water but the plastic still smells bad. So there you are trying to relax with this awful smell on your face. The band is kind of tight, but I suppose after a few uses it&#x27;ll loosen up to the point it&#x27;ll be too loose. it does&#x27;t stay cold very long and yet when at it&#x27;s freezing stage it&#x27;s actually uncomfortable so I only refrigerate it. Not sure I recommend it, it&#x27;s only comfortable at refrigerator temp for a rather short  while.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have severe dry eye and need a warm compress every night. With the Bead Eye Mask, I had to get up every 5 minutes and microwave again, 3-4 times.</li>
            <li> I suffer from migraines and one relief is cold pressure.  This stays cooler than other gel masks I have tried.</li>
            <li> These are fine but I would have preferred thicker plastic on the side that touches your face. They can get too cold after only a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> it was very nice for relaxation it we help your eye  very well and it will relief the pain  from your head</li>
            <li> Best bang for the buck. Had horrible  migraines, aleviates the stress and pain hot and cold.  Fire the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. LOVE THE TINY LIL BEADS. UNLIKE AN ICE MASK THAT HAS A BUNCH OF GEL IN IT AND DOES NOT BEND EAY, THIS ONE MOLDS TO YOUR FACE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY DOWN SIDE, WISH IT WAS A TAD LARGER</li>
            <li> The beads are not evenly distributed and fall towards the bottom of the mask. I&#x27;d recommend looking for another one if you want to get more even relief.  If you just need relief and soothing right above your nose and the bottoms of your eyes, ie. your sinuses, then this would probably work well for you.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these; one for me and one for my daughter. We loved them so much, I reordered another for my mom!</li>
            <li> I did not got the green color, I got a blue one for some reason. It gets cold quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving it in the refrigerator for hours.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask. I like putting in the freezer and using it on my eyes when I get headaches. The coldness probably lasts for 10-15 minutes. It is best for a person like me to have two of these masks. It is good for the price though</li>
            <li> If you do deep relaxation after yoga -- put this on. It will make you feel like you&#x27;ve just had a nice eye massage (whatever that is).</li>
            <li> good product and great price, gets nice and cold, soothing, strap is a bit lame so i replaced it with something i had around the house. worth the purchase also bought Elasto Gel Hot / Cold Sinus Mask, i use both glad i bought both. great price on amazon my fav retailer.</li>
            <li> Love it helps me get a good night&#x27;s rest and my eyes feel less tired in the morning if that makes sense..</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Fits well - very relaxing. Gets cold very quickly. I do not like the elastic band much, so I just insert this in my eyemask.</li>
            <li> The only thing thart I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t have small but outs for my eyes.  Because my eyes are so sentitive, the cold hurts a bit.  I did have one before that had eye cut outs and it was perfect.  Still, this is is good.</li>
            <li> Being a make up artist, I spend a lot of my day straining my eyes in effort to pay attention to everyone&#x27;s unique and beautiful facial features, After a long day of work, my eyes begin to hurt. I bought this product, and discovered that after minutes, this mask comforted my eyes. Great product, coming from me with high recommendations.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these for hubby and myself with hopes to ease our everyday headaches. They are wonderful. The gel balls inside make it form easily to your face, and keep cold. Its already cold nurtured without even being put into a fridge! I recommend!</li>
            <li> Works great. This is very cheap compared to the same mask the eye doctor wanted to sell me for $35!</li>
            <li> This mask works very well. My husband has glaucoma and needs to add heat to his eyes after his eye drops and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Helped with my chronic dry eye and inflamation. It does wonders for inflamation and dry ee that no medication can help.</li>
            <li> Have common sense!  I ended up ruining mine to the point of no return. First I put it in the microwave for 15 seconds - microwaves are powerful - not a good idea.  Some of the beads ended up bursting inside the mask.  But was definitely still usable.  A couple of days later I accidentally left my Eye Mask in the freezer over night! Again not a good idea! The Mask ended up bursting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I must say that this was a great eye mask! Cooling was very nice for the days my eyes were slightly puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I got this is because I work in front of a computer all day and my eyes would be tired, dry and hurting at the end of the day.  Rather than using eye drops every single day which is bad for you in the long run - I would warm up the Gel Bead Eye Mask after work and sit with it on for a few minutes.  It would instantly make my eyes water but would definitely help the dry and tired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product until I broke it.  4 stars - because I wish it was slightly more durable.  Only other downside was that the elastic band was slightly uncomfortable but now I am just getting picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I will be ordering another one!</li>
            <li> all I can say is I love this.works well for headaches or tired eyes</li>
            <li> I suffer from migraines, sinus headaches, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these types of masks when I have a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one sweat&#x27;s and is either way way to cold, like painfully cold and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added it on as a cheap purchase add-on special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waste of $6.</li>
            <li> This product has saved me! I ordered when I was 6 month pregnant, hot all the time and not getting any sleep (burning eyes) it&#x27;s so soothing and feels wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t take long to get cold in the fridge but also (living in Phoenix-very hot state) it lasts about 10 minutes before it&#x27;s no longer cold..</li>
            <li> This feels great when you first put it on, unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t hold temperature long, so by the time you&#x27;re nice and relaxed in your bed or on your couch, it has warmed to room temperature and you basically have a plastic mask on your face.</li>
            <li> Hard sticky type of plastic. Very uncomfortable. I think the container it came in would be more comfortable. Will make a pul cover for it as the beads will chill and work. When I have a migraine I need dark this doesn&#x27;t block any light</li>
            <li> I follow the directions, don&#x27;t microwave longer than directed, and this eye mask has lasted me months. I took off the elastic band with metal tips to microwave it, and never put it back on. I use this mask under another eye mask I wear. I am pleased with this little mask.</li>
            <li> gets pretty hard when you freeze it but it will do its job</li>
            <li> This cooling eye mask is a great for tired or puffy eyes. I use it for headaches too or whenever I feel run down. It fits well and is very refreshing and relaxing. The little beads are great, they allow the mask to mold to your face comfortably, more than an ice pack ever will. I usually wrap a paper towel around it at first so I don&#x27;t freeze my eyeballs. But once it warms up a little it&#x27;s perfect as is.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews, the mask broke from normal use after a few months and the beads leaked out.  It was good while it lasted - too bad it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> love it! mine hasn&#x27;t broken yet and I wear it even when I sleep.</li>
            <li> Love this item! I use it frozen every night before going to sleep. Contours perfectly to my face. Great way to forget to the stress of the day and have a good nights rest!</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because of the band which is elastic. Extreme temperatures tend to make elastic dry rot quickly and loose elasticity. Other than that this is a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! I love this mask... great for sleeping too! VERY comfortable and moves very well. Elastic band is the perfect size so it wont fall off while wearing.</li>
            <li> These worked pretty well at first. But, after a few uses the string broke and some of the gel beads began coming out. I guess I couldn&#x27;t be too disappointed it was relatively cheap. You know the saying... But, it served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> This mask is a cheap rip off of the Thera Pearl mask; the quality can&#x27;t even compare.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it, just go get the Thera Pearl instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) When freezing, the beads lock into place with frost - making this exactly like a standard ice pack which freezes into a brick shape.  You&#x27;d need to mold it to the shape of your face BEFORE freezing, and hope it stays that shape while freezing.&lt;br /&gt;2) Temperature loss EXTREMELY fast.  Therapearl lasts a solid 30-45 minutes, while this one lasts 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3) Extremely difficult to get out of the package.  During the extraction from the packaging, the mask became &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; to the plastic envelope it was packed in and on more than one occasion I thought it had ripped the mask.</li>
            <li> I love this mask a lot! I used it for about 6 months but after mask has got a holes (probably  mask&#x27;s walls have been broken because of freezer) and it has became like a big block of ice so that i couldn&#x27;t use it anymore&#x3D;((&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I plan to buy it again because i like it!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Soft and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;But spills off its content quickly if you step on it</li>
            <li> These serve a good purpose but they don&#x27;t stay cool for very long. I have noticed it only works if in the freezer. I got this as an add on for shipping purposes so it was definitely worth it. I just wish this would stay cooler for longer.</li>
            <li> my daughter-in law thought it was awesome.</li>
            <li> Best thing after a hard day or when eyes need come TLC. I product is made well and I think you will be happy. Just be sure to USE it and not put off you time. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this as well as the THERA°PEARL Eye Mask, and I would definitely recommend the THERA°PEARL Eye Mask over this one. It doesn&#x27;t have that many &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; so the mask is pretty flat and doesn&#x27;t press into my eye sockets as much as I would like. Also, after freezing, it is extremely stiff and uncomfortable to wear, so you have to thaw it for a bit before it will mold to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update later on about comparative durability.</li>
            <li> It gives a soothing massage whether u heat it or cool it. You will get relax when you use it. I will definitely recommend this product to use.</li>
            <li> nicely designed with a strap that does not get tangled with hair, but does not come close to covering my eyes. for small heads or close eye people only</li>
            <li> this is nice and cool even at room temperature.  it contours to your face very nicely.  i also used it on my forehead</li>
            <li> it is so comfortable!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this gel eye mask, it serves its purpose very well. I use it almost every day and like it.</li>
            <li> This is perfect and the price was in the range I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Does not stay cold very long.</li>
