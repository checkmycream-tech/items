            <li>great things about this mascara:&lt;br /&gt;1. Does not clump</li>
            <li>The tube color is amazing!</li>
            <li>This mascara is ok but not the best.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mascara for my teen/tween daughters and they loved it -- until their eyelashes started breaking off.</li>
            <li>The brush is also a good shape; it separates the lashes well and doesn&#x27;t over-coat them</li>
            <li>Favorite at a good price and subscription delivery!</li>
            <li>, intentional strokes work best w/ the colossal.  </li>
            <li>I just finished my first one and am very happy.  </li>
            <li>I liked the formula but switched the brush with another.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed, as far as drug store make up goes</li>
            <li>Love the add-on option for cosmetics</li>
            <li>: my favorite drugstore mascara is Loreal Butterfly Effects</li>
            <li>i like it better than others I have tried</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Using the One by One brush and the Mega Plush formula, I&#x27;m able to get a passable result with my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this mascara!</li>
            <li>comparison with most brands</li>
            <li>but for sure I will never buy  from this brand again.</li>
            <li>i love the bendy wand</li>
            <li>I use oil free remover (the kind that is in two layers</li>
            <li>Also love the flexible brush making it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have this in the washable version and find that it stays on all day and is easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY regret my purchase.</li>
            <li>it literally just acts like a fine comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a new mascara for me, but so far I have been pleasantly impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>When I applied it to my upper lashes, the gel glided smoothly and easily, separating my lashes very nicely.</li>
            <li>The shape of the wand does not permit smooth application in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect mascara for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>The formula feels really light, like you&#x27;re not even wearing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This feels great and my lashes really are so soft!</li>
            <li>Its nothing special.  </li>
            <li>As promised, this mascara has a Mega Plush brush that holds just the right amount of mascara!  </li>
            <li>How ingenious!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a mission to find the best mascara available (keeping in mind everybody&#x27;s lashes are different with different needs), but I think this would work for anybody.  </li>
            <li>Favorite mascara and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>With this product, you&#x27;d have to use multiple coats and it just doesn&#x27;t look good.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be a perfect amount -- not too heavy but certainly wouldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>However, it may just be my preferences and my personal lash type, so if you are interested in this, you should read more reviews just to get a good idea in general. :)</li>
            <li>I used to use  Full N Soft, which was GREAT, but it apparently has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>When applied for the very first time...</li>
            <li>I have long lashes, so I usually use Maybelline Great Lash and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading some negative reviews on this mascara I bought the product anyway and was pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>I put it on the first time, and in order to get it to even show up, I had to apply, apply, apply, apply ad infinitum!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pump your mascara and it will stay clump free much longer.  </li>
            <li>Colossal is still my all time fav.</li>
            <li>im not saying that all Maybelline mascaras suck, but this one isn&#x27;t worth the package it comes in.</li>
            <li>Love mascara in general.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Long-lasting and decently waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;-Extends and thickens lashes significantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only good if you want to look natural.</li>
            <li>Everything about it is great, right down to the adorable teal and pink tube.</li>
            <li>First, the wand is very large.</li>
            <li>I guess this mascara is okay , if you want a more natural look , but I personally did not like that thus product didn&#x27;t give me volume , length of curls my lashes very well.</li>
            <li>I have used so many different kinds of mascara</li>
            <li>I do use primer before I put it on &amp; still compliments on how naturally pretty my lashes look.</li>
            <li>you will too ;)</li>
            <li>ull be better off with a 1 dollar mascara from ur local drug store, not even kidding.</li>
            <li>It does such a good job of this that it makes the few cons more than tolerable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to only doing one coat, or if you tend to get clumps when you apply more than one coat, just invest in a metal tooth lash comb.</li>
            <li>I love it, it last all day.</li>
            <li>What I ended up doing was cleaning off an old top/brush from a Maybelline One by One bottle instead and screwing that on top of the new mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this waterproof mascara because my lashes are soft and not stiff.  </li>
            <li>Used an old clean mascara wand always, not matter the brand to comb out clumps.</li>
            <li>While I still prefer Maybelline&#x27;s Colossal Volume mascara over all others, this is definitely a close contender for second favorite!</li>
            <li>thats all the positive I have to say for this mascara.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and your eyelashes barely feel like they have mascara on.</li>
            <li>For clean voluminous lashes use their colossal cat eye instead (yellow w/ cheetah print on handle).  </li>
            <li>The brush is too flimsy and its hard to get a good coat on because of it.</li>
            <li>but it really seems to go on very easy and makes my lashes look long but natural and not goopy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the flexible shaft that holds the brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find that it curled my lashes very well -- but that&#x27;s what I have my Shu curler for.</li>
            <li>Clumpy, does not help much with length.</li>
            <li>Buy this product does not clump togethere like normal mascara!</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t  accidentally &amp;#34;scrape&amp;#34; off mascara at the tips of my lashes, so I get more length from this mascara than any other I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li>I would MAYBE recommend this product to someone who wants a very natural look.</li>
            <li>, it really helps you get the right angle for the inner and outer corner lashes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I just got this mascara and really like it so far.</li>
            <li>easy application&lt;br /&gt;Covers tiny inner lashes easily&lt;</li>
            <li>B003I6O5RC Maybelline New York</li>
            <li>Might be my new fav...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does give a really light coating, so I usually apply 2-3 coats, depending on how much drama I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li>I only had to dip once to make both my eyelashes full, but everyone has different lashes so idk.</li>
            <li>No stiff or brittle feel, even after dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smooth,</li>
            <li>The whole point to of mascara is to make your lashes look longer, and thicker and somehow using this product does the opposite.</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing I would change is how much mascara this wand picks up.</li>
            <li>This is probably my least favorite maybelline mascara.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are soft to the touch after applying this mascara.</li>
            <li>The bristles all stuck together and just transferred blobs directly onto my lashes.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;ve been wearing it since this morning (9 hrs) and so far, no flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I do like that it doesn&#x27;t flake, clump and lashes are soft to touch.</li>
            <li>The wand is marketed as being bendy and flexible, but I couldn&#x27;t really tell as I was applying the mascara, so don&#x27;t be too worried about that; it felt solid to me.  </li>
            <li>so they look natural.</li>
            <li>I love how this fills out my lashes to look plush without making them too thick or clumpy.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried when I saw the different brush then normal</li>
            <li>The formula is alright, it is not tough feeling or rough (until an hour later) and it stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li>There is no &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; when you apply the mascara, and although the wand looks &amp;#34;plush&amp;#34; and looks like it will do some major work...</li>
            <li>Needs some major work.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it picks up far too much, and sometimes far too little.</li>
            <li>its pretty expensive for something that just makes 1 huge clump out of ur lashes, plus it lasts about 3-4 weeks if u wear it every day.</li>
            <li>This mascara left a natural look on me.</li>
            <li>Even then, it barely gave me any volume.</li>
            <li>And it actually feels soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>After applying, it was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>After one application, it covered even the tiny inner lashes easily, making them thick and long.</li>
            <li>Maybe a little too large.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t so much that I get clumps (at all), and there isn&#x27;t so little that I need to put on 3 or 4 coats to see the mascara.  </li>
            <li>brush has an over-abundance of bristles, and applies a little too much at once.</li>

            <li> The wand is marketed as being bendy and flexible, but I couldn&#x27;t really tell as I was applying the mascara, so don&#x27;t be too worried about that; it felt solid to me.  </li>
            <li> so they look natural.</li>
            <li> I love how this fills out my lashes to look plush without making them too thick or clumpy.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried when I saw the different brush then normal</li>
            <li> The formula is alright, it is not tough feeling or rough (until an hour later) and it stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li> There is no &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; when you apply the mascara, and although the wand looks &amp;#34;plush&amp;#34; and looks like it will do some major work...</li>
            <li> Needs some major work.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it picks up far too much, and sometimes far too little.</li>
            <li> its pretty expensive for something that just makes 1 huge clump out of ur lashes, plus it lasts about 3-4 weeks if u wear it every day.</li>
            <li> This mascara left a natural look on me.</li>
            <li> Even then, it barely gave me any volume.</li>
            <li> And it actually feels soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> After applying, it was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> After one application, it covered even the tiny inner lashes easily, making them thick and long.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little too large.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t so much that I get clumps (at all), and there isn&#x27;t so little that I need to put on 3 or 4 coats to see the mascara.  </li>
            <li> brush has an over-abundance of bristles, and applies a little too much at once.</li>
            <li> The mascara seems to be running dry after only a week of use, I can barely get enough on my lashes!</li>
            <li> as far as mascaras go this is just above average</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this mascara is that I had to add several layers of product to get the volume I desired, and I still feel like it could be a little bit more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> It gives a decent amount of volume and the color is very black and matte.  </li>
            <li> I use to have long eye lashes and my friend said I should use this mascara.</li>
            <li> But this is no deal-breaker, just a minor dislike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently tried a very expensive brand that everyone has been raving about and found that this worked so much better than the $25 tube of designer mascara.</li>
            <li> The Falsies Volum&#x27; Express Washable Mascara, Blackest Black, 0.25 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> so I naturally have long, thick eyelashes and putting the mascara on actually makes my eyelashes look less thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was also very dry....</li>
            <li> This mascara comes with a flexible wand which was strange and foreign to me to begin with</li>
            <li> The price is comparable to other drugstore mascaras and it gives above average length and volume without clumping or flaking.  </li>
            <li> When I got this mascara, I expected it to give me mega volume, like the title says.</li>
            <li> color I bought (blackest black) had an odd navy blue color, hardly noticeable when worn but still unexpected.</li>
            <li> No large globs.</li>
            <li> I like, I always keep it when I dispose of the empty tube for re-use with other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mascara does feel slightly less heavy and waxy on my lashes but the formula doesn&#x27;t feel too different than other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels lighter on my lashes than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Other than this</li>
            <li> It makes the mascara very hard to put on, and I had to put on several coats until it actually looked like I was wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> Other mascara makes the lashes stiff and I tend to loose some when I wash it off.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t hate it, but  Maybellines other mascaras work a lot better for whatever they claim to do than this one does.</li>
            <li> I have a small length of eyashes and this mascara made it twice as long.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying again.</li>
            <li> I hate the brittle or stiff feeling of most other mascaras.</li>
            <li> So I used it and less in a month my eye lashes started to fall off</li>
            <li> Half my lower lashes are gone on one eye.</li>
            <li> Love that, hated this.</li>
            <li> Even worse, the broken lashes occurred with only occasional use of this product.</li>
            <li> Dried up.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> If you want volume, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I would suggest when using the oil remover dont rub but hold a few secs and slide it off the eye lashes.</li>
            <li> That seems to be helping to keep the few lashes I have.</li>
            <li> The wand is very odd to work with.</li>
            <li> After using for three days I woke up to discover half the length of my already short lashes had broken off!  </li>
            <li> The wand is a little limp making it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Not sure why its has volum or plush words in the name.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I have a bum tube or what,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product yet....</li>
            <li> I usually put one coat of mascara on and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much less irritating on my eyes while wearing contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your lashes with that hard waxy finish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline mascaras before and this is my least favourite.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint would be the brush.</li>
            <li> Slow</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;ll change your life, no matter what mascara you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is made to flex and that is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> Was probably outdated or expired.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for voluminous and dramatic, you will not get it here.</li>
            <li> it was not so expensive</li>
            <li> The name itself is false advertising, because there is nothing Mega or Plush or Voluminous about it!  </li>
            <li> There is a bad chemical smell that waters my eyes and maybe causing my eye lashes coming out in clumps.</li>
            <li> but I HATE that the brush is so flexible I was afraid it was gonna break on me as I was trying to apply it</li>
            <li> When I put it on, I was greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara, which is also made by Maybelline, and I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The applicator is springy, which makes it very awkward to apply the mascara.</li>
            <li> hate this stuff.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t remove this mascara with a water base makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I purchased Maybelline&#x27;s oil base make up remover</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this a week ago, and it&#x27;s HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Run away from this product! After using for three days I woke up to discover half the length of my already short lashes had broken off!  Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Love the add-on option for cosmetics</li>
            <li> Its nothing special.  For clean voluminous lashes use their colossal cat eye instead (yellow w/ cheetah print on handle).  Don&#x27;t pump your mascara and it will stay clump free much longer.  Slow, intentional strokes work best w/ the colossal.  Love that, hated this. This has a wobbly wand and doesn&#x27;t get nearly enough mascara actually onto your lashes.  If you want to sit around all day applying mascara then this is your guy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara for my teen/tween daughters and they loved it -- until their eyelashes started breaking off. Even worse, the broken lashes occurred with only occasional use of this product. I STRONGLY regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> hate this stuff. the wand part is the problem. it is made to flex and that is not a good thing. wish I would have noticed the photo of the wand before I bought a tube of it.</li>
            <li> It was like I&#x27;d had it for about 5 weeks.  Dried up.  Will not purchase online again.  Was probably outdated or expired.</li>
            <li> Favorite at a good price and subscription delivery!</li>
            <li> I just finished my first one and am very happy.  It stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t flake, or clump.  I found it to be a perfect amount -- not too heavy but certainly wouldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I liked the formula but switched the brush with another. Colossal is still my all time fav.</li>
            <li> The wand is a little limp making it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Love this waterproof mascara because my lashes are soft and not stiff.  Other mascara makes the lashes stiff and I tend to loose some when I wash it off.  Not this mascara.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t flake.  Also love the flexible brush making it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Nope. Don&#x27;t like this mascara at all. The whole point to of mascara is to make your lashes look longer, and thicker and somehow using this product does the opposite. Mind you I&#x27;m of Middle Eastern so I naturally have long, thick eyelashes and putting the mascara on actually makes my eyelashes look less thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name and look of the product are deceiving. There is no &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; when you apply the mascara, and although the wand looks &amp;#34;plush&amp;#34; and looks like it will do some major work...it literally just acts like a fine comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: my favorite drugstore mascara is Loreal Butterfly Effects</li>
            <li> While I still prefer Maybelline&#x27;s Colossal Volume mascara over all others, this is definitely a close contender for second favorite! This is a new mascara for me, but so far I have been pleasantly impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say is that the wand took some getting used to for me. This mascara comes with a flexible wand which was strange and foreign to me to begin with because I was so used to using just solid and sturdy brushes, however, once you get the hang of the flexible wand you&#x27;ll be set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as always, Maybelline has perfectly advertised products and this is one of them. The ONLY thing I would change is how much mascara this wand picks up. Sometimes it picks up far too much, and sometimes far too little. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a happy medium with it.</li>
            <li> The brush is too flimsy and its hard to get a good coat on because of it.</li>
            <li> as far as mascaras go this is just above average i like it better than others I have tried but I HATE that the brush is so flexible I was afraid it was gonna break on me as I was trying to apply it</li>
            <li> I have used so many different kinds of mascara and I keep coming back to this. I recently tried a very expensive brand that everyone has been raving about and found that this worked so much better than the $25 tube of designer mascara.</li>
            <li> I did not like this mascara... I&#x27;ve used Maybelline mascaras before and this is my least favourite. The shape of the wand does not permit smooth application in my opinion. The product was also very dry....</li>
            <li> I bought some of this a week ago, and it&#x27;s HORRIBLE!  The name itself is false advertising, because there is nothing Mega or Plush or Voluminous about it!  I put it on the first time, and in order to get it to even show up, I had to apply, apply, apply, apply ad infinitum!  I used to use  Full N Soft, which was GREAT, but it apparently has been discontinued.  This stuff is terrible.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is probably my least favorite maybelline mascara. I honestly don&#x27;t hate it, but  Maybellines other mascaras work a lot better for whatever they claim to do than this one does. However, it may just be my preferences and my personal lash type, so if you are interested in this, you should read more reviews just to get a good idea in general. :)</li>
            <li> I do think that it gives me a lot of length. I was really impressed, as far as drug store make up goes, I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT WATERPROOF MASCARA!</li>
            <li> As promised, this mascara has a Mega Plush brush that holds just the right amount of mascara!  There isn&#x27;t so much that I get clumps (at all), and there isn&#x27;t so little that I need to put on 3 or 4 coats to see the mascara.  Thanks to the flexible shaft that holds the brush, I can&#x27;t  accidentally &amp;#34;scrape&amp;#34; off mascara at the tips of my lashes, so I get more length from this mascara than any other I&#x27;ve tried!  How ingenious!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a mission to find the best mascara available (keeping in mind everybody&#x27;s lashes are different with different needs), but I think this would work for anybody.  Of all the mascaras I have, I always seem to reach for this one.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara its plush and doesn&#x27;t clump!!! I do use primer before I put it on &amp; still compliments on how naturally pretty my lashes look. I love how this fills out my lashes to look plush without making them too thick or clumpy. I used to only but big department store brands but I am extremely happy with the quality and price of this product!!! I need to buy monthly.</li>
            <li> For me this is the best mascara. I have a small length of eyashes and this mascara made it twice as long. It doesn&#x27;t flake when I put it on and hopefully it will stay like that. I only had to dip once to make both my eyelashes full, but everyone has different lashes so idk.</li>
            <li> I would MAYBE recommend this product to someone who wants a very natural look. My eyelashes are soft to the touch after applying this mascara. They aren&#x27;t hard and crunchy. They aren&#x27;t plush or voluminous. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with clumping or flaking. I prefer the Maybelline Rocket mascara to this one. This mascara is just... meh...</li>
            <li> I use to have long eye lashes and my friend said I should use this mascara. So I used it and less in a month my eye lashes started to fall off and now there short. I would this product 0 stars if I had too!</li>
            <li> It works so well!! Best mascara i ever bought! Buy this product does not clump togethere like normal mascara! I love it you will too ;)</li>
            <li> This feels great and my lashes really are so soft! Almost like I am not wearing anything! No spider lashes! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> This mascara left a natural look on me. If you are looking for voluminous and dramatic, you will not get it here. The formula is alright, it is not tough feeling or rough (until an hour later) and it stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li> The brush was clumped and knobby as soon as I took it out of the package. Trying to apply mascara with it was like trying to use a q-tip - The bristles all stuck together and just transferred blobs directly onto my lashes. What I ended up doing was cleaning off an old top/brush from a Maybelline One by One bottle instead and screwing that on top of the new mascara. Using the One by One brush and the Mega Plush formula, I&#x27;m able to get a passable result with my lashes.  Not worth buying again.</li>
            <li> When I got this mascara, I expected it to give me mega volume, like the title says. When I put it on, I was greatly disappointed. My biggest complaint would be the brush. It makes the mascara very hard to put on, and I had to put on several coats until it actually looked like I was wearing mascara. Even then, it barely gave me any volume. It&#x27;s only good if you want to look natural. If you want volume, don&#x27;t waste your money on this. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this mascara! It is currently my go to mascara! In fact I have two of them!! I never want to run out! I Have been using this mascara for about 2 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some great things about this mascara:&lt;br /&gt;1. Does not clump&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not leave your lashes with that hard waxy finish&lt;br /&gt;3. After 2 coats it looked like the falsies version volumewise but without the heaviness of the wax&lt;br /&gt;4. The tube color is amazing! so girly!&lt;br /&gt;5. It stays put all day! even in this 100 degree texas weather!</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by this mascara when I saw the commercial. I&#x27;m a big fan of [[ASIN:B003I6O5RC Maybelline New York The Falsies Volum&#x27; Express Washable Mascara, Blackest Black, 0.25 Fluid Ounce]] but thought I&#x27;d give this a try. First, the wand is very large. Maybe a little too large. I will probably trade it out for one of my spares.  ** If I find a brush I like, I always keep it when I dispose of the empty tube for re-use with other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel formula adheres evenly to the brush. No large globs. And it actually feels soft to the touch. When I applied it to my upper lashes, the gel glided smoothly and easily, separating my lashes very nicely. I was especially happy with the results on my lower lashes. After one application, it covered even the tiny inner lashes easily, making them thick and long. Again, no globbing. Plus I&#x27;ve been wearing it since this morning (9 hrs) and so far, no flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find that it curled my lashes very well -- but that&#x27;s what I have my Shu curler for. I like the \\&quot;wetness\\&quot; of the formula. It feels lighter on my lashes than other mascaras. No stiff or brittle feel, even after dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, easy application&lt;br /&gt;Covers tiny inner lashes easily&lt;br /&gt;No clumps or globs&lt;br /&gt;Great separation&lt;br /&gt;No flakes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Brush too large&lt;br /&gt;No curl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it. I hate the brittle or stiff feeling of most other mascaras. But this one feels like liquid velvet on my lashes. Used in conjunction with an eyelash curler, it&#x27;s a hit!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes have lots of volume!</li>
            <li> Clumpy, does not help much with length.</li>
            <li> Love mascara in general. Used an old clean mascara wand always, not matter the brand to comb out clumps.</li>
            <li> I just got this mascara and really like it so far. I like that it doesn&#x27;t clump.  I was a bit worried when I saw the different brush then normal but it really seems to go on very easy and makes my lashes look long but natural and not goopy.  Might be my new fav...</li>
            <li> Excellent item.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves her gift</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t arrive , I want reimbursement for this product.</li>
            <li> its pretty expensive for something that just makes 1 huge clump out of ur lashes, plus it lasts about 3-4 weeks if u wear it every day. ull be better off with a 1 dollar mascara from ur local drug store, not even kidding. im not saying that all Maybelline mascaras suck, but this one isn&#x27;t worth the package it comes in. DONT BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Long-lasting and decently waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;-Extends and thickens lashes significantly. WOW. It does such a good job of this that it makes the few cons more than tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;-No sticking or flaking with time.&lt;br /&gt;-In comparison with most brands, it&#x27;s much less irritating on my eyes while wearing contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The brush has an over-abundance of bristles, and applies a little too much at once. It needs to be thoroughly combed, otherwise it leaves lashes looking a bit pasty and matted.&lt;br /&gt;-The color I bought (blackest black) had an odd navy blue color, hardly noticeable when worn but still unexpected.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect mascara for everyday wear. It is comfortable and your eyelashes barely feel like they have mascara on.</li>
            <li> I have mix feelings with this mascara. This mascara is ok but not the best. I do like that it doesn&#x27;t flake, clump and lashes are soft to touch. Other than this thats all the positive I have to say for this mascara. This mascara has cons in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not sure why its has volum or plush words in the name. There is no evidence that it does these things to your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;2. The wand is very odd to work with. Needs some major work. It doesn&#x27;t work for this mascara liquid.&lt;br /&gt;3. You can&#x27;t remove this mascara with a water base makeup remover. I purchased Maybelline&#x27;s oil base make up remover and it does get the mascara off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not purchase again. This mascara doesn&#x27;t do what it advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/17/2012 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;Have used this mascara several weeks. I too am losing lashes. I use to have alot of lashes. Half my lower lashes are gone on one eye. I would suggest when using the oil remover dont rub but hold a few secs and slide it off the eye lashes. That seems to be helping to keep the few lashes I have. There is a bad chemical smell that waters my eyes and maybe causing my eye lashes coming out in clumps. Revised and gave it one star.</li>
            <li> once in a while I fall for a commercial and buy maybelline. There is nothing MEGA  or Volume about it.  it was not so expensive so  not a big loss but for sure I will never buy  from this brand again. I  recommend :Hypnose Drama WP by Lancome.</li>
            <li> The applicator is springy, which makes it very awkward to apply the mascara. The mascara seems to be running dry after only a week of use, I can barely get enough on my lashes! Not sure if I have a bum tube or what, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again to find out.</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t add any volume.</li>
            <li> 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some negative reviews on this mascara I bought the product anyway and was pretty impressed.  It gives a decent amount of volume and the color is very black and matte.  It does not clump or flake, and my lashes look longer and multiplied.  The wand is marketed as being bendy and flexible, but I couldn&#x27;t really tell as I was applying the mascara, so don&#x27;t be too worried about that; it felt solid to me.  The mascara does feel slightly less heavy and waxy on my lashes but the formula doesn&#x27;t feel too different than other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this mascara is that I had to add several layers of product to get the volume I desired, and I still feel like it could be a little bit more dramatic.  But this is no deal-breaker, just a minor dislike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this.  The price is comparable to other drugstore mascaras and it gives above average length and volume without clumping or flaking.  I have this in the washable version and find that it stays on all day and is easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product yet....When applied for the very first time...it was too &amp;#34;springy&amp;#34; for me...just have to get use to it I guess.</li>
            <li> Everything about it is great, right down to the adorable teal and pink tube. i love the bendy wand, it really helps you get the right angle for the inner and outer corner lashes. The brush is also a good shape; it separates the lashes well and doesn&#x27;t over-coat them so they look natural. The formula feels really light, like you&#x27;re not even wearing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give a really light coating, so I usually apply 2-3 coats, depending on how much drama I&#x27;m going for. If you&#x27;re used to only doing one coat, or if you tend to get clumps when you apply more than one coat, just invest in a metal tooth lash comb. the folding Tweezerman one is my fave, and it&#x27;s only about $12. Seriously, it&#x27;ll change your life, no matter what mascara you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people claimed in their reviews that they&#x27;re pulling their eyelashes out trying to remove it, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem. I use oil free remover (the kind that is in two layers and you have to shake it up) or creamy face cleanser (not gel or foam).</li>
            <li> I love it, it last all day.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have long lashes, so I usually use Maybelline Great Lash and it looks great.  Sometimes you just have to stick with the basics, like with mascara.  I tried this mascara, which is also made by Maybelline, and I was so disappointed.  After applying, it was barely noticeable.  I usually put one coat of mascara on and that&#x27;s it.  With this product, you&#x27;d have to use multiple coats and it just doesn&#x27;t look good.  Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I guess this mascara is okay , if you want a more natural look , but I personally did not like that thus product didn&#x27;t give me volume , length of curls my lashes very well.</li>
