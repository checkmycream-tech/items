    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>the scrub is awesome though.</li>
            <li>If you have chapped lips -- or even want help at night getting lipstick off your lips, this is the best product I have found.  </li>
            <li>Really happy with this stuff!</li>
            <li>and if anything it&#x27;s BETTER than I remembered!!!</li>
            <li>The exfoliator is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product, did not want to go through a consultant or go to a party/presentation.</li>
            <li>It is great for chapped lips or just to take the lines out of your lips for a smoother look.  </li>
            <li>It is ok, but not the greatest lip peel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE it!!!  </li>
            <li>Now when I try to put it on, it doesn&#x27;t work as good.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and so does my clients!  </li>
            <li>I tried the BeautiControl Lip Apeel for the first time over 15 years ago and absolutely LOVED it!!</li>
            <li>Amazing lip treatment that will heal and soften your lips in one treatment.</li>
            <li>The balm is nice as well.  </li>
            <li>and then the lip balm has a nice orangey creamy flavor, will see what it does until the thing is done</li>
            <li>The lip balm is also nice.</li>
            <li>Awesome job so far!!</li>
            <li>Will purchase more (If I don&#x27;t just become a BeautiControl Consultant!)  :-)</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t spend more than that.  </li>
            <li>Top layer is the lip balm (step 2)  </li>
            <li>I bought this more for the mask than the lip balm, but I love that as well.  </li>
            <li>works better than anything else I have tried...</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I am soooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>The more you use, and the drier it gets, the better the result.</li>
            <li>LOVE the lip balm and it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun--drinking more, exfoliating, sugar scrubs, mud masks, every chapstick you could name...</li>
            <li>I honestly see a huge difference already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to be able to wear some gloss tomorrow.</li>
            <li>I am sooo in love with both portions of this product.</li>
            <li>Makes her lips look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>My favorite &amp;#34;essential!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>best lip balm out there and only one I buy.</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many ways of keeping my dry lips from peeling and bleeding, and this is the best!  </li>
            <li>this stuff is pretty good, it does take away lip liner stains.  </li>
            <li>It is without a doubt the best way to keep lips exfoliated from dry patches and chapping.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Helps ease my chapped and dry lips just as excellently as I remember.&lt;br</li>
            <li>others have said, this peel is really easy to use, doesn&#x27;t stink, and truly works.  </li>
            <li>Was easy to apply and rub off.</li>
            <li>what a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find this product everywhere for so cheap.</li>
            <li>Leaves your lips smooth.</li>
            <li>And the balm is light but does the trick.</li>
            <li>I use it a few times a week to help with winter chapped lips, it is the best product I have found.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, and is easy to wipe off.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it made my lips so smooth that my husband noticed it and asked me what I did!</li>
            <li>It was only after a spa visit that I first experienced this product and became a fan immediately.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product--I use twice a week and it makes my lips incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Much more reasonable price.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks cool though.</li>
            <li>and while they&#x27;re all lovely, they don&#x27;t really do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, someone mentioned it drying out quickly</li>
            <li>I admit that I got a bit excited and treated my lips twice on the first go around, but one treatment is all you need.</li>
            <li>This was much easier and I received the Lip Apeel quickly!</li>
            <li>but i use the balm once a day and when i get out of the shower and im GOLDEN.</li>
            <li>But overall it does a fantastic job making my lips soft, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer in the top is pretty decent too - very neutral, not oily or pungent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Also make sure your lips are dry and free of balm before applying the mask.</li>
            <li>this stuff is the best, most balm work short term and make my lips worse over time.</li>
            <li>This product fights chapped dry lips and creates soft line free lips, my lip gloss has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>soft smooth and no pain.</li>
            <li>After the first treatment, I saw immediate results.</li>
            <li>I have always had peeling lips and could never wear the pretty glosses I wanted to.</li>
            <li>Now that I know it will last a while, the price seems much more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely works better than anything else on my lips.</li>
            <li>Had first been introduced to this product at a Spa party.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no irritation, and only takes a minute to use.</li>
            <li>My lips were still dry and even more cracked 7 hours after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i suspect there are better lip exfoliators out there to remove dry chapped lips though.</li>
            <li>the first time i used it my lips were a little sensitive, but they felt good, like relieved, its just a pain to do it if your in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I honestly see and feel a big, big difference just with this first use.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have to use very much, which was a relief because I felt like the price was a bit high.</li>
            <li>The balm included with the product is fine for immediate moisturizing after the mask, but but I would give it alone only 3 stars.</li>
            <li>It seems to instantly make your lips feel smooth and slippery, even when used separately from the mask.</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>I live in an extremely dry climate as well as sometimes being on medication that causes even more dryness.  </li>
            <li>Better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; generously and let it dry completely.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many other products and none of them have worked!</li>
            <li>so just as a precaution, I make sure to close the lid back quickly and tightly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had been using just plain ole vaseoline, but this works so much better</li>
            <li>That was enough proof right there that it works.</li>
            <li>After much research, I learned that daily exfoliation is pretty much the only remedy for those of us with chronically chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>Winter time has always proved difficult on my lip condition so I was very excited to find it available through Amazon</li>
            <li>But no problems with that so far!</li>
            <li>This will be my third set I&#x27;ve purchased, I&#x27;ve wasted money on other products and hands down this set works the BEST!!!</li>
            <li>I use it everyday to keep my lips smooth - which helps with my lipstick.</li>
            <li>Although its possible to do that elsewhere, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li>My lips have honestly never felt better.</li>
            <li>It cleans up my lips and makes them soft.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re sure it&#x27;s completely dry, rub it off with one or two VERY DRY fingertips until you have removed as much as possible.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with a similar problem.</li>
            <li>I was worried the lip &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; might be too much for my already dry lips, but it is not the case.  </li>
            <li>especially if you have frequent chapped lips that need to be conditioned.  </li>
            <li>my lips are always chapped they are so sensitive and constantly peeling, cracking and in pain.</li>
            <li>It is unscented but has a slight aroma when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li>But, if I stop using it for a few days, the chapped lips come right back.</li>
            <li>Like it so far, the peel goes dry and you rub it off</li>
            <li>But it only works well for the first few times.</li>

            <li> Like it so far, the peel goes dry and you rub it off</li>

            <li> I had major issues with chapped and dry lips.</li>
            <li> It last for a long time too, because you only need to use it 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this for anyone that has bothersome lips, and plan on gifting it to quite a few ppl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product truly does what it says, and with the tiny amount you need, this jar will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Works well to remove dry dead skin on lips and balm really moistens lips.</li>
            <li> last for a long time</li>
            <li> and I find myself reaching for the chap stick much less frequently.  </li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone with the same issue or during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> The interior substance meant to defoliate the lips went &#x27;hard&#x27; and unusable before I had a chance to really appreciate the product.</li>
            <li> only slight downside for me is that it&#x27;s a product to use only at home</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this; it rocks!</li>
            <li> finding something for dry lips</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry, peeling lips.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear lipstick, or even gloss, because no matter the formula the color will just dry up, peel, flake, and generally end up looking gross.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry lips like mine, I would recommend this.</li>

            <li> being that you have to apply, let dry, and remove with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure why the package says this, but either way it works wonders to make my lips soft and peel-free.</li>
            <li> It works for a short while...maybe less than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> they only fight half the battle.  </li>
            <li> You put the paste on the lips, wait for it to dry and wipe with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li> The product would have gotten 5 stars if the balm would last a little longer before needing to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s a little pricey, it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me.  </li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about spending $20 on lip balm, but in hindsight, I&#x27;ve probably spent ten times that trying to find a cure for my chronically chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Look at the other ads listed on the same page for less than $10 plus $5 shipping.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or smell bad like so many products do.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for roughly $20 from a rep</li>
            <li> I discovered I only need to use it every few day, and my lips are no longer flaking and chapped.  </li>
            <li> The cream that makes your lips peel gives me the same result as if i grabbed a wet towel and rubbed off the dead skin from my lips.</li>
            <li> I try to do it every morning because of the chronic dry peeling mess that are my lips.  </li>
            <li> i have absolutely no complaints, don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lip products but they seem almost too moist to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Then you can rinse the remaining product off and follow up with the balm or any other lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like the exfoliator and it certainly smoothed my lips, but I&#x27;m not impressed with the balm and find myself using other brands instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not perfect (especially if I&#x27;m stressed), but my dry lip issues definitely are not a concern anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I was disappointed how little they give you...especially for the jar size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a yr and a half.</li>
            <li> With a little elbow grease I got the bottom portion opened and discovered the the rest.</li>
            <li> i substitute the scrub for just giving my lips an aggressive wipe with a towel immediately after i shower to get off the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Takes away all the dead skin.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates the dead skin on your lips and then moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I try seems to make the worse or stay the same.</li>
            <li> It also keeps lips from chapping, cracking, and peeling because it keeps the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> The balm is ordinary.</li>
            <li> but I can say after having it for the past month, it is one of my essentials.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in the past.  </li>
            <li> it is dry, gets into your mouth in clumps (really disgusting) and doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of all the excess dead skin in one use.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at how thin the exfoliating stuff was, but as soon as I wiped it off with a damp washcloth, I could see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I have had this for at least three months</li>
            <li> Chapped lips cannot be &#x27;cured&#x27; sadly, but I use this product to exfoliate a few times a week</li>
            <li> It helps remove a layer of the stubborn dried fussy lip residue without having to painfully scrub it off.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The exfoliator is great.  The balm is ordinary.</li>
            <li> It was only after a spa visit that I first experienced this product and became a fan immediately.  This product fights chapped dry lips and creates soft line free lips, my lip gloss has never looked better!  Easy to use, no irritation, and only takes a minute to use.</li>
            <li> Great product especially if you have frequent chapped lips that need to be conditioned.  It helps remove a layer of the stubborn dried fussy lip residue without having to painfully scrub it off. I purchased this item at a \\&quot;spa party\\&quot; to support the sales rep but I can say after having it for the past month, it is one of my essentials.  This product was purchased for roughly $20 from a rep so don&#x27;t spend more than that.  Look at the other ads listed on the same page for less than $10 plus $5 shipping.  Much more reasonable price.    Top layer is the lip balm (step 2)  Bottom layer is the gommage/lip exfoliator (step 1)</li>
            <li> It works for a short while...maybe less than 2 hours. My lips were still dry and even more cracked 7 hours after using it.&lt;br /&gt;It looks cool though.</li>
            <li> 39.99 is WAY overpriced to buy this product.  It can be purchased from a certified BeautiControl independent consultant for $19.50 plus tax!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many ways of keeping my dry lips from peeling and bleeding, and this is the best!  I live in an extremely dry climate as well as sometimes being on medication that causes even more dryness.  I was worried the lip &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; might be too much for my already dry lips, but it is not the case.  It dries quickly, and is easy to wipe off.  I bought this more for the mask than the lip balm, but I love that as well.  It is unscented but has a slight aroma when you first put it on.  It seems to instantly make your lips feel smooth and slippery, even when used separately from the mask.</li>
            <li> Works well to remove dry dead skin on lips and balm really moistens lips. The product would have gotten 5 stars if the balm would last a little longer before needing to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> works better than anything else I have tried...BeautiControl Lip Apeel....finding something for dry lips and I have tried so many other products and none of them have worked!</li>
            <li> my lips are always chapped they are so sensitive and constantly peeling, cracking and in pain. i drink tons of water and have to constantly apply chapstick (like 5 times a day)and this causes a gross looking buildup on my lips. NO MORE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is awesome. my wife got it for me about 4 months ago and im almost out. i only use the white scrub about once a week although it recommends to use it every day. but i use the balm once a day and when i get out of the shower and im GOLDEN. soft smooth and no pain. what a huge difference. i substitute the scrub for just giving my lips an aggressive wipe with a towel immediately after i shower to get off the dead skin. the scrub is awesome though. the first time i used it my lips were a little sensitive, but they felt good, like relieved, its just a pain to do it if your in a hurry. i plan on using this indefinitely. i highly recommend this for anyone that has bothersome lips, and plan on gifting it to quite a few ppl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seriously this stuff is the best, most balm work short term and make my lips worse over time. i have absolutely no complaints, don&#x27;t hesitate! and dont be shy to use this if your a guy, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry, peeling lips.  I usually don&#x27;t wear lipstick, or even gloss, because no matter the formula the color will just dry up, peel, flake, and generally end up looking gross.  I&#x27;ve tried the sugar scrubs, etc. and while they&#x27;re all lovely, they don&#x27;t really do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, this peel is really easy to use, doesn&#x27;t stink, and truly works.  I try to do it every morning because of the chronic dry peeling mess that are my lips.  The balm is nice as well.  I can actually wear some lip gloss (haven&#x27;t tried lipstick) during the days I use the peel.  While it&#x27;s a little pricey, it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find this product everywhere for so cheap. And I was ecstatic when I found it on amazon. It works well with my lips and I love it. It also came in quicker than I thought. If you have dry lips like mine, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product is like a clay- it is dry, gets into your mouth in clumps (really disgusting) and doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of all the excess dead skin in one use.  It is ok, but not the greatest lip peel I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll look for something different next time.</li>
            <li> Like it so far, the peel goes dry and you rub it off and then the lip balm has a nice orangey creamy flavor, will see what it does until the thing is done</li>
            <li> This will be my third set I&#x27;ve purchased, I&#x27;ve wasted money on other products and hands down this set works the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from dry, peeling lips. I tried some &amp;#34;home remedy&amp;#34; type solutions that I saw online because I couldn&#x27;t find anything specifically marketed for this problem at any stores in my area. After reading the reviews, I decided to try this product and I am soooo glad I did. After the first treatment, I saw immediate results. I admit that I got a bit excited and treated my lips twice on the first go around, but one treatment is all you need. I got nervous when I read the packaging because it insinuated that this product was meant for treating lines around you mouth. I&#x27;m still not sure why the package says this, but either way it works wonders to make my lips soft and peel-free. I highly recommend this product to anyone with a similar problem. Also, someone mentioned it drying out quickly so just as a precaution, I make sure to close the lid back quickly and tightly. But no problems with that so far!</li>
            <li> If you have chapped lips -- or even want help at night getting lipstick off your lips, this is the best product I have found.  I&#x27;ve tried other lip products but they seem almost too moist to do the job.  This stuff is great.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and get it on Amazon on a regular basis.  I use it everyday to keep my lips smooth - which helps with my lipstick.</li>
            <li> this stuff is pretty good, it does take away lip liner stains.  i suspect there are better lip exfoliators out there to remove dry chapped lips though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since the mid 1990&#x27;s. It is without a doubt the best way to keep lips exfoliated from dry patches and chapping. Be sure to use the &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; generously and let it dry completely. The more you use, and the drier it gets, the better the result. Also make sure your lips are dry and free of balm before applying the mask. When you&#x27;re sure it&#x27;s completely dry, rub it off with one or two VERY DRY fingertips until you have removed as much as possible. Then you can rinse the remaining product off and follow up with the balm or any other lip moisturizer. I like to follow it with a lip plumper like Lip Fusion or Buxom. The balm included with the product is fine for immediate moisturizing after the mask, but but I would give it alone only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and so does my clients!  Will purchase more (If I don&#x27;t just become a BeautiControl Consultant!)  :-)</li>
            <li> The interior substance meant to defoliate the lips went &#x27;hard&#x27; and unusable before I had a chance to really appreciate the product.</li>
            <li> Leaves your lips smooth. Takes away all the dead skin. LOVE the lip balm and it last for a long time</li>
            <li> I just received this after ordering it Friday night. I was a little apprehensive about spending $20 on lip balm, but in hindsight, I&#x27;ve probably spent ten times that trying to find a cure for my chronically chapped lips. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun--drinking more, exfoliating, sugar scrubs, mud masks, every chapstick you could name...nothing worked. I have always had peeling lips and could never wear the pretty glosses I wanted to. I read about this and ordered it. I just tried and, and holy crap! I honestly see a huge difference already. I was skeptical at how thin the exfoliating stuff was, but as soon as I wiped it off with a damp washcloth, I could see a big difference. Different than scrubs and mud masks I put on my lips. And the balm is light but does the trick. I honestly see and feel a big, big difference just with this first use. I hope it continues to work! The big trick will be to see what happens in the morning after I use it tonight. I&#x27;m hoping to be able to wear some gloss tomorrow. Awesome job so far!! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this; it rocks! If you wear lipstains like I do, this stuff is a MUST before applying your color. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or smell bad like so many products do. Was easy to apply and rub off. The moisturizer in the top is pretty decent too - very neutral, not oily or pungent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use very much, which was a relief because I felt like the price was a bit high. Now that I know it will last a while, the price seems much more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. Don&#x27;t wait like I did.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE it!!!  Finally something that works.  I had been using just plain ole vaseoline, but this works so much better</li>
            <li> It definitely works better than anything else on my lips. But it only works well for the first few times. Now when I try to put it on, it doesn&#x27;t work as good. The lip apeel didn&#x27;t really remove all the dead skin. But overall it does a fantastic job making my lips soft, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> Had first been introduced to this product at a Spa party. Winter time has always proved difficult on my lip condition so I was very excited to find it available through Amazon as well learning I didn&#x27;t have to have/attend a party to attain it.&lt;br /&gt;Helps ease my chapped and dry lips just as excellently as I remember.&lt;br /&gt;The only slight downside for me is that it&#x27;s a product to use only at home being that you have to apply, let dry, and remove with a washcloth. Although its possible to do that elsewhere, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li> This really does work. It exfoliates the dead skin on your lips and then moisturizes. The product is in one place , so I don&#x27;t have to use multiple jars of stuff , it convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a yr and a half. I love this product, but I was disappointed how little they give you...especially for the jar size. Well, it wasn&#x27;t until yesterday, when I read someone else&#x27;s review, that there are two products in this jar. With a little elbow grease I got the bottom portion opened and discovered the the rest. I am sooo in love with both portions of this product. My lips have honestly never felt better.</li>
            <li> Amazing lip treatment that will heal and soften your lips in one treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the good reviews. My lips are always chapped and peeling so i thought this would help. The cream that makes your lips peel gives me the same result as if i grabbed a wet towel and rubbed off the dead skin from my lips. The lip balm feels like regular balm that you get at a drug store. I would definitely not buy this again and wont recommend it either.</li>
            <li> After much research, I learned that daily exfoliation is pretty much the only remedy for those of us with chronically chapped lips.  Forget the menthol-scented balms...they only fight half the battle.  Exfoliation is a key part.  Chapped lips cannot be &#x27;cured&#x27; sadly, but I use this product to exfoliate a few times a week and I find myself reaching for the chap stick much less frequently.  But, if I stop using it for a few days, the chapped lips come right back. Like I said, there is no cure, only temporary remedy. Still, I am grateful for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant because of the price, but you actually get a quite generous amount of product.  I have had this for at least three months I&#x27;m not close to running out.  For that reason, I feel that this product is a value!</li>
            <li> Great product, did not want to go through a consultant or go to a party/presentation. This was much easier and I received the Lip Apeel quickly! I use it a few times a week to help with winter chapped lips, it is the best product I have found.</li>
            <li> My daughter has chronic chapped lips to the point of bleeding. I used this on her and it was a miracle! You put the paste on the lips, wait for it to dry and wipe with a wet cloth. It dries up the skin so it just falls off into the washcloth. No pain, and no tears. The lip balm is also nice. Makes her lips look shiny and healthy. She loves it. I recommend for anyone with the same issue or during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> This product truly does what it says, and with the tiny amount you need, this jar will last a very long time.  I discovered I only need to use it every few day, and my lips are no longer flaking and chapped.  Really happy with this stuff!</li>
            <li> My favorite &amp;#34;essential!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I tried the BeautiControl Lip Apeel for the first time over 15 years ago and absolutely LOVED it!! I have a problem with chapped lips and everything else I try seems to make the worse or stay the same. I recently started looking online to find a lip scrub type item again -I couldn&#x27;t remember what the name was of the product I tried years ago....after ordering a different item that was AWFUL-I began looking again and as soon as I saw Lip Apeel I recognized it! It just arrived, I used it once and if anything it&#x27;s BETTER than I remembered!!! My husband even noticed my lips AFTER ONE USE!! This product gets 2 thumbs up and 5 stars from me!&lt;br /&gt;  J.Harris</li>
            <li> I had major issues with chapped and dry lips. I started using this with a combination with Smith&#x27;s rosebud lip balm. It&#x27;s definitely not perfect (especially if I&#x27;m stressed), but my dry lip issues definitely are not a concern anymore.</li>
            <li> love it. best lip balm out there and only one I buy. Keeps my lips moist without drying them out afterwards</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past.  It is great for chapped lips or just to take the lines out of your lips for a smoother look.  It last for a long time too, because you only need to use it 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li> I have tried this before at a BeautiControl party years ago and I remembered this worked well.  I am quite satisfied with this.  It cleans up my lips and makes them soft.</li>
            <li> This is a patented lip exfoliant. I&#x27;ve used it for about 9 years now and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it. The first time I used it, it made my lips so smooth that my husband noticed it and asked me what I did! That was enough proof right there that it works. It also keeps lips from chapping, cracking, and peeling because it keeps the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I like the exfoliator and it certainly smoothed my lips, but I&#x27;m not impressed with the balm and find myself using other brands instead.</li>
            <li> Amazing product--I use twice a week and it makes my lips incredibly soft. Better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
