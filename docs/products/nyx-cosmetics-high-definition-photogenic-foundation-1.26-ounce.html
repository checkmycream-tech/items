            <li>This make up provides amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>Nice container to disperse makeup.</li>
            <li>as another reviewer who liked that aspect said -  than matte, which is my own preference.  </li>
            <li>and it looks just as good and much better than this</li>
            <li>I can only say good things about this product it works wonderful</li>
            <li>I purchased this make up because of the brand and the higher price; I thought it would be better quality and provide a more flawless coverage</li>
            <li>I &#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is more &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; -</li>
            <li>i love the packaging with the dispenser.</li>
            <li>I just think I&#x27;m not going to be a fan of this product, I love NYX</li>
            <li>I have used better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this product to be any better than something you could buy from one of the lower end lines at the discount beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s covers very nicely, it doesn&#x27;t get cakey, and it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li>but if you put powder over it, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It is smooth.</li>
            <li>I like the silky feel of the foundation, it has medium coverage and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It smells like sunscreen too, which I particularly enjoy.</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is that it is cruelty free (not tested on animals) and highly rated as also being free of harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>Full coverage (hides acne and scars), covers redness,</li>
            <li>Very easy on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>After looking at many options available on Amazon.com, I decided to try the NYX Cosmetics High Definition Photogenic Foundation in soft beige.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The product is the right shade.</li>
            <li>Love this product doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on skin and lasts all day :)</li>
            <li>this foundation is not my favorite I have to use three to four different foundations to get the shade</li>
            <li>light to wear, great when taking photos, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Highly concentrated - you don&#x27;t need more than a tiny drop.</li>
            <li>This makeup is way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>For my 50-something skin, I just felt this was too matte and dry, and tended to settle into every fine wrinkle and large pore.</li>
            <li>I love that it does not have parabens and other toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new foundation and didn&#x27;t want to go to the store to purchase it and, not too pricey.</li>
            <li>: I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause me any problems.</li>
            <li>When I first received this foundation, it seemed a bit thin, so I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would cover my flaws like the Stay Matte, Not Flat foundation does.</li>
            <li>I have really Irish red skin, so it&#x27;s hard to find a good foundation that stays and covers all the red.</li>
            <li>well, it also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin as much as the Stay Matte foundation does.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try it with a foundation primer, which I will over the summer when my skin is not so dry, but for now I&#x27;ll just stick with my Cover Girl plus Olay Simply Ageless or, recently I sampled Lorac Natural Performance, and I really like this, too.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> close to my skin color</li>
            <li> not very good at covering areas of concern and it a couple hours after application it looked like the make up was breaking down leaving little white areas all over my face</li>
            <li> This does what it&#x27;s supposed to, though it was darker than I anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I have sensitive skin and this definitely causes issues so I only use it when I know I&#x27;ll be having pictures taken.</li>
            <li> I started using this makeup over year ago and I will not try anything else.  It is smooth. Nice container to disperse makeup. I love that it does not have parabens and other toxic ingredients. NYX is a great product.  I use their Primer too every day.</li>
            <li> Full coverage (hides acne and scars), covers redness, light to wear, great when taking photos, and a little goes a long way. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause me any problems. On oily spots it&#x27;s a bit greasy but if you put powder over it, it&#x27;s fine. Unfortunately when I sweat a lot it drips a bit, but I&#x27;m 100% satisfied. It&#x27;s my everyday &amp; go to foundation.</li>
            <li> For a less expensive foundation, I love!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new foundation and didn&#x27;t want to go to the store to purchase it and, not too pricey. After looking at many options available on Amazon.com, I decided to try the NYX Cosmetics High Definition Photogenic Foundation in soft beige. For my 50-something skin, I just felt this was too matte and dry, and tended to settle into every fine wrinkle and large pore. I didn&#x27;t try it with a foundation primer, which I will over the summer when my skin is not so dry, but for now I&#x27;ll just stick with my Cover Girl plus Olay Simply Ageless or, recently I sampled Lorac Natural Performance, and I really like this, too.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m satisfied. It is more &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; - as another reviewer who liked that aspect said -  than matte, which is my own preference.  However, matte powder, which I always use over foundation anyway, brings it to matte. What I love about this product is that it is cruelty free (not tested on animals) and highly rated as also being free of harmful ingredients. This is a combination that seems hard to find. I did not know this brand and found it on sites that rated cosmetics for both those factors. I will be continuing to buy it. And a great bonus: it is said to help increase collagen.</li>
            <li> i love the packaging with the dispenser. perfect coverage, doesnt leave the skin oily. perfect for use it all the day</li>
            <li> The shade was off. I tried with the primer from the company.  I just think I&#x27;m not going to be a fan of this product, I love NYX this ehh. I have used better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to be any better than something you could buy from one of the lower end lines at the discount beauty supply store. I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle before I moved onto something else.</li>
            <li> This makeup is way better than I expected. It goes on well, covers well and is not greasy or drying. It dries to a almost matte finish. Stays on well. Go NYX!</li>
            <li> When I first received this foundation, it seemed a bit thin, so I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would cover my flaws like the Stay Matte, Not Flat foundation does. This is actually pretty great! Not only does it cover flaws well, it also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin as much as the Stay Matte foundation does. This is definitely the foundation I&#x27;ll be sticking with for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this foundation twice now, and I must say it&#x27;s the best foundation I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s covers very nicely, it doesn&#x27;t get cakey, and it&#x27;s not heavy. 5/5. Would recommend to anyone. Also it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores! Very easy on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. I wish I would have gone a shade darker though.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on well and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> this foundation is not my favorite I have to use three to four different foundations to get the shade right and it does not last at all, I would not reccomend</li>
            <li> I like the silky feel of the foundation, it has medium coverage and goes on smooth.  The pump unscrews from the bottle, allowing access to every last drop. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Really awesome product! I have really Irish red skin, so it&#x27;s hard to find a good foundation that stays and covers all the red. It smells like sunscreen too, which I particularly enjoy.</li>
            <li> Coverage not what expected and wore off after few hours 😥</li>
            <li> Not true to the color. Had to send back.</li>
            <li> This make up provides amazing coverage. You look flawless in this.  Highly concentrated - you don&#x27;t need more than a tiny drop.</li>
            <li> Prettty good coverage. Works good for the price</li>
            <li> I can only say good things about this product it works wonderful it set up very nice, love how it sets</li>
            <li> I purchased this make up because of the brand and the higher price; I thought it would be better quality and provide a more flawless coverage, it did not, was disappointing and a waste of money. I have used high end brand make ups in the past (Estee Lauder, Clinique,) but am currently using Cover Girl Tru Blend and it looks just as good and much better than this make up did...the color of this make up was also off, it looks somewhat orange when you put it on...save your money. I am now considering purchasing an air brush make up kit and if anyone can recommend one, I would greatly appreciate it. In all fairness to the seller, I did not contact them regarding my dissatisfaction of their product because I did not have the time or energy to invest on trying to return it so I am not sure how they would have handled the customer service/satisfaction end.</li>
            <li> Love this product doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on skin and lasts all day :)</li>
            <li> The product is the right shade. Just like in the description. It arrived very promptly.</li>
