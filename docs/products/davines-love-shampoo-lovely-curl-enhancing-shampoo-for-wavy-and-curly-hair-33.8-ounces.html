            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Additionally, it has an amazing grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li>This shampoo helps me make the best of my fine but full curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It is okay  lathes nice</li>
            <li>The first duo bottles were great.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo</li>
            <li>My curls are more defined when I use it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I love the Oi oil that Davines makes for the finishing touches on my hair and I Love, Love, Love, their curl enhancing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner....</li>
            <li>And if you have curly hair it is even better....</li>
            <li>It helps keep just enough curl in my hair to keep me happy.  </li>
            <li>since I began using this product recommended by my hairdresser, I have started to enjoy having curly hair.</li>
            <li>We bought this from a salon originally then here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for my hair as we have hard water.  </li>
            <li>I may just go back to Suave for shampoo since it seems to do as good a job as any, but I&#x27;ll continue using the conditioner until the day I die.</li>
            <li>Combined with the conditioner, it creates full wavy and volumonous hair.</li>
            <li>loved the shampoo, but it was a mess when I got it the shampoo leaked, Needs a better seal.</li>
            <li>Have tried other shampoos, but Davines is, by far, the best.  </li>
            <li>so my hair has less fly aways and breakage.  </li>
            <li>I have never found anything similar to it that I liked.</li>
            <li>Because of that, I like a shampoo that feels like it&#x27;s really lathering and getting my hair clean.</li>
            <li>Not only does this smell good, but it made my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely lovely and actually works.</li>
            <li>Only problem I had was that this large bottle didn&#x27;t come with a dispenser top.</li>
            <li>I have wavy blonde hair that gets frizzy easily.</li>
            <li>Remember large bottle does not come with pump but as shown.</li>
            <li>It made my curly, frizzy hair manageable and very shiny.</li>
            <li>This product really changed my curls.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my hair and really encourages the curls.</li>
            <li>I have mid-fine curly hair, and tried many curly hair shampoos on the market and had very little success.</li>
            <li>Very gentle shampoo that leaves curly hair under control and soft.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I only shampoo about once a week (or less if I can help it), which keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>This seems to make the curls for defined so I can wear my hair naturally.</li>
            <li>The product is pretty thick, so you only need a little dollop to get a good foam.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m biased to like it because I&#x27;m in LOVE with the matching conditioner (like, seriously, I would take out an ad about the conditioner in my local paper if I had the money).</li>
            <li>First of all, the bottle is not full.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a very silky texture and moisture without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li>However...if I&#x27;m being honest with myself, the formula is a little thin and doesn&#x27;t foam up enough for my liking.</li>

            <li> It is okay  lathes nice but hair feels course after use</li>
            <li> Tried this at my daughter&#x27;s house and loved it. It made my curly, frizzy hair manageable and very shiny. And I typically wash my hair every other day,this made my hair look great for 3 days. Bought a bottle of this and the conditioner and haven&#x27;t had as great a result at home. Not sure why?</li>
            <li> I only shampoo about once a week (or less if I can help it), which keeps my hair healthy. Because of that, I like a shampoo that feels like it&#x27;s really lathering and getting my hair clean. I love the smell of this shampoo and I&#x27;m biased to like it because I&#x27;m in LOVE with the matching conditioner (like, seriously, I would take out an ad about the conditioner in my local paper if I had the money).

I may just go back to Suave for shampoo since it seems to do as good a job as any, but I&#x27;ll continue using the conditioner until the day I die.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this shampoo from my hair salon, but since I recently moved, I decided to find it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got it.  First of all, the bottle is not full.  Secondly, the consistency is nowhere close to the thickness I am used to getting.  It looks deluded. The bottle was not sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shampoo and I need to find a difference source to buy it.</li>
            <li> For any degree of wave or curl, this shampoo brings out the best in my hair. Combined with the conditioner, it creates full wavy and volumonous hair. I esp. like to use it in the summer time...I allow my hair to air-dry so maybe it&#x27;s the humidity that activates this stuff. In the winter, the results are not the same. A bit pricey, but a quality shampoo/conditioner for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Great delivery love this product!</li>
            <li> Love is the best shampoo</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and the price was great.</li>
            <li> If you do not need a deep cleaning and just want a shampoo to use on curls daily, this is the shampoo for you! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> loved the shampoo, but it was a mess when I got it the shampoo leaked, Needs a better seal.</li>
            <li> Always love my Davines shampoo!  This is my 3rd purchase in 3 years... yes it lasts that long!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!!!!!! I have fine hair, but a lot of it!  I have used this shampoo for years and I always come back to it.  It is great, it does not leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy.  I is a smoothing shampoo so my hair has less fly aways and breakage.  I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This shampoo is excellent. Not only does this smell good, but it made my hair very soft and silky. I only gave it 4 stars because the shampoo is a little on the watery side. Could be a little thicker.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My hair feels like silk and product smells great.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! It smells absolutely lovely and actually works. My curls are more defined when I use it. Only problem I had was that this large bottle didn&#x27;t come with a dispenser top. I&#x27;ll have to put it in a different container for use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Have tried other shampoos, but Davines is, by far, the best.  It helps keep just enough curl in my hair to keep me happy.  Other shampoos DO NOT do this.  Stick with Davines products, as I do.</li>
            <li> Very gentle shampoo that leaves curly hair under control and soft. Would recommend this and the conditioner. Remember large bottle does not come with pump but as shown.</li>
            <li> We bought this from a salon originally then here on Amazon. The first duo bottles were great. The next were not the same product. Different deep down smell and a pinkish color instead of pearl white. We&#x27;re stuck with 2 bottles. Not happy...</li>
            <li> I have mid-fine curly hair, and tried many curly hair shampoos on the market and had very little success. This product really changed my curls. It gives you a very silky texture and moisture without weighing your hair down. The product is pretty thick, so you only need a little dollop to get a good foam. It&#x27;s been my favorite shampoo for over 5 years now!</li>
            <li> I have been using Divines products for about two years.  This shampoo helps me make the best of my fine but full curly hair.  From time to time I switch to another Davines shampoo - one that volumizes, for example,</li>
            <li> I have wavy blonde hair that gets frizzy easily. This seems to make the curls for defined so I can wear my hair naturally. I have never found anything similar to it that I liked.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fabulous!  My hair stylist started me using this over 10 years ago.  It is wonderful for my hair as we have hard water.  And it truly does make my hair curly.  I use it in conjunction with the Momo Moisturizing Curl Enhancing serum.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It moisturizes my hair and really encourages the curls. Additionally, it has an amazing grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li> Great!&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I began using this product recommended by my hairdresser, I have started to enjoy having curly hair.</li>
            <li> Davines products are the best.  The shampoo they have for curly hair foams well and leaves my thick, frizzy, wavy hair just right for my regimen of products.  I love the Oi oil that Davines makes for the finishing touches on my hair and I Love, Love, Love, their curl enhancing conditioner.  I thank Davines for their products.  Without them, I&#x27;d be a frizzball instead of having my hair turn heads.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner....it is the best!  Hand&#x27;s down!  The Italians know what they are doing!  And if you have curly hair it is even better....</li>
            <li> This product is very thick and causes you to use too much due to this. Very expensive too. I will not buy again.</li>
