            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go so far as to say that I now have a flawless alabaster complexion.</li>
            <li>If I could give this more stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>

            <li>and I love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I am acne prone and although it did not break me out more, it also didn&#x27;t do anything for it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it just \\&quot;sits\\&quot; on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to love it</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li>it a try, You may love it too.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more in september and it was rancid, smelled like fish oil and burned my face.  </li>
            <li>You use only drops at a time, and it feels wonderful on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I thank Trilogy for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>and my face got more and more oily</li>
            <li>and I got more acne on top of that,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good to know that you&#x27;re putting on something good and natural on your skin ...</li>
            <li>I use this at night before my moisturizer or alone, and within a week my skin is softer, more hydrated, and noticeably more even toned.</li>
            <li>I use moringa oil and grape seed extract which works much better.</li>
            <li>My shipment came fast and was packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li>My dry skin has never looked more beautiful!</li>
            <li>I used it at night and has great results when you wake up your skin is really soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply makeup afterwards.</li>
            <li>The problem is the bottle can easily knocked over and spill.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to see the affect.</li>
            <li>I kept reading,but this trilogy rosehip oil kept catching my eye that people had good results with it, and now here I am saying the same thing</li>
            <li>I purchased the rose hip oil last march and loved it.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is supposed to lessen fine lines and lessen age spots.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it seems to be holding the fine wrinkles at bay</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a decrease in fine lines</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, fair skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s certified organic, which is always a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Okay, within a week, but since I&#x27;d been dealing with them for years (treating them like acne), it felt like an overnight success.</li>
            <li>I add it to my regular moisturizer for added softness and it is great.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and reduces lines around eyes....</li>
            <li>I love how it is well absorbed by the skin</li>
            <li>It is a great nurishing product and it helps with scar eliminates, I give four star only because it smelled like rubborn and this bothered me</li>
            <li>The oil is fantastic and makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li>I squeeze 3 drops into my palm and I rub my hands together to lightly pat then blend into my face.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but it has honestly never looked better.</li>
            <li>so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this for myself about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>this was my first rosehip oil purchase and I am so glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I bought this after watching a review about it from bubzbeauty and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I use it underneath an oil free moisturizer and it gives me just the right amount of moisture without feeling greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, brighter, more even toned, more manageable, and overall seems just happier.</li>
            <li>I gave this very simple and wholesome product a try and was very, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic and not expensive.</li>
            <li>suppose if you have super dry skin, this might be something good to put on your face.</li>
            <li>While the rose hip seed oil has made a tremendous impact on them (much smoother), they aren&#x27;t gone completely, so I continue to use make up.</li>
            <li>the lines on the corner of my eyes and under my eyes and my smile lines has smoothen out</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see immediate results with my skin looking more even and feeling a lot softer.  </li>
            <li>I was originally looking at a cheaper brand, but too many reviews gave low ratings for quality.  </li>
            <li>right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>It kind of resembles the smell of fish oil a little bit, but not as strong.</li>
            <li>This oil works really well and soaks right into your skin and starts healing it!</li>
            <li>my hands look sooo smooth and take away the old look of aging!!</li>
            <li>one of the conditions of dry skin is oiliness as the body produces more oil to the top layer in order to try to naturally moisturize it.  </li>
            <li>this will be a great gift, great attention ill recommend the seller in the future and ill return for buy more things, good day.</li>
            <li>Oil on the face is a hard sell for a lot of us but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried many other brands, but so far I&#x27;ve found this one to be better than others and worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve tried many brands and none compare, it also seems to go a lot further too.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery as well!</li>
            <li>but it is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products.  </li>
            <li>I have an oily skin and am acne prone, decided to give this a try at night as so many people with the same problem have recommended it.</li>
            <li>but the overall texture of my skin is much better and</li>
            <li>and I hope she loves it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin is super resilient and soft!!</li>
            <li>Although all three worked in improving the overall texture of my skin (evenness of skin tone, imparting a certain glow), Kosmea and A&#x27;kin worked visibly better than Trilogy.</li>
            <li>While this product has made a huge difference and my make up creates an almost flawless facade, I do have fairly bad acne scarring from my childhood days.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is amazing for my sensitive skin, especially my eye-lids.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s a quick way to get some nice oils mixed into my moisturizer, which I felt didn&#x27;t have enough oil for</li>
            <li>simply cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>but hopefully it will have long term effects on my skin :)</li>
            <li>My skin has not looked this healthy in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Obviously no dramatic results since I didn&#x27;t have problem skin to begin with</li>
            <li>combine about two drops of the Rosehip oil with 2-3 drops of 100% pure jojoba oil and apply to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>, then the contents of my bottle had certainly &amp;#34;turned&amp;#34; by the time that I received it.</li>
            <li>My acne scarring (particularly in the mild areas) is noticeably smoother and the moderate scars are now what I would call mild.</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about what I&#x27;ll use on my face, which tends to break out.  </li>
            <li>Not a wonder oil but overall my mom seems to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a must have.  </li>
            <li>Used it daily, has a light berry/nutty fragrance.</li>
            <li>Ive been using it for about 4 months and it has really helped reduce the appearance of my acne scars.</li>
            <li>Used it for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li>It really soaks in and hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>I was worried about this ordering on Amazon from this seller after reading complaints but my Rosehip Oil came promptly and is the real deal.</li>
            <li>My face is naturally very oily</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and use foundation, this really smooths my foundation and doesn&#x27;t show flakes/dry spots on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this point in my life I prefer to use only the most natural, edible ingredients on my skin.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts from using this oil, but I do find it necessary to exfoliate frequently since my skin tends to get a little flaky.</li>
            <li>Anyone who understands essential oils and who has experience with rosehip oil will know at one whiff that the oil labeled by Trilogy as rosehip oil contains both vegetable and fish oils, and has no trace of true rosehip aroma.</li>
            <li>This oil smells like and is MAINLY fish oil.  </li>
            <li>oil\\&quot; and within ten minutes all excess shine is gone as it is really well absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered from this particular seller twice</li>
            <li>I truly didn&#x27;t have high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I did some research and found that the Trilogy company is highly regarded, so I pulled the trigger and ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li>this being said, when I learned about Rosehip oil, I was ready and willing to try it for the aforementioned issues.  </li>
            <li>Instead of using the dropper as a dropper (putting a full drop on each fingertip), I just brush the dropper against my first, second and third fingers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought and enjoyed Trilogy Certified Organic Rosehip Oil a few times.</li>
            <li>After multiple emails to the seller they pretty much stated they don&#x27;t believe me, but will send me one bottle to replace.  </li>
            <li>Can also be used on newly healed scraps to prevent scarring.</li>
            <li>The bottle specifies that the oil was \\&quot;bottled in New Zealand\\&quot; from</li>
            <li>I have never used this type of oil for my face before, but now I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>this takes care of all my problems of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;dryness is gone, no more breakouts, and it goes on very smooth but not oily at all.</li>
            <li>but this just sinks into skin making it feel super soft!!</li>
            <li>Next time I purchase, that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;imported sources\\&quot;, which most likely means China or some southeast Asia origin, where standards are not monitored, much less enforced.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to really tighten the lid because it seems to get crusty and dry out if not closed tightly.</li>
            <li>When I first learned that jojoba oil was more consistent with the sebum our bodies naturally produces, I was skeptical but desparate enough to try it.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, I wasn&#x27;t seeing things I wanted to see--someone else saw them too.</li>
            <li>It gives the added moisture I need and makes my face extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to my mother who so far seems to like it.</li>
            <li>Use the Rosehip 2x a day with your daily moisturizer and night cream and within 2-3 months you will really see a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>…it&#x27;s natural so the results are slower…but soaks into skin well.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my sensitive skin, improved</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oily when you first apply, but it&#x27;s like a \\&quot;dry</li>
            <li>No other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Have been applying to my face daily for about a month now, and my pigmentation is less noticeable, pores look smaller, fewer pimples, and it&#x27;s super soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>Good product to use under foundation during the cold winter months though, so I will buy again.</li>
            <li>The girls in my family all have different types of skin (oily, adult acne, dry, etc.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m accustomed to wearing my make-up to cover a myriad of flaws from blotchy, uneven skin tones, redness, mild/moderate acne scars, and large pores on my nose.</li>

            <li> I thank Trilogy for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> and my face got more and more oily</li>
            <li> and I got more acne on top of that,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good to know that you&#x27;re putting on something good and natural on your skin ...</li>
            <li> I use this at night before my moisturizer or alone, and within a week my skin is softer, more hydrated, and noticeably more even toned.</li>
            <li> I use moringa oil and grape seed extract which works much better.</li>
            <li> My shipment came fast and was packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li> My dry skin has never looked more beautiful!</li>
            <li> I used it at night and has great results when you wake up your skin is really soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply makeup afterwards.</li>
            <li> The problem is the bottle can easily knocked over and spill.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to see the affect.</li>
            <li> I kept reading,but this trilogy rosehip oil kept catching my eye that people had good results with it, and now here I am saying the same thing</li>
            <li> I purchased the rose hip oil last march and loved it.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is supposed to lessen fine lines and lessen age spots.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it seems to be holding the fine wrinkles at bay</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a decrease in fine lines</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, fair skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s certified organic, which is always a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Okay, within a week, but since I&#x27;d been dealing with them for years (treating them like acne), it felt like an overnight success.</li>
            <li> I add it to my regular moisturizer for added softness and it is great.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and reduces lines around eyes....</li>
            <li> I love how it is well absorbed by the skin</li>
            <li> It is a great nurishing product and it helps with scar eliminates, I give four star only because it smelled like rubborn and this bothered me</li>
            <li> The oil is fantastic and makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I squeeze 3 drops into my palm and I rub my hands together to lightly pat then blend into my face.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but it has honestly never looked better.</li>
            <li> so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> this was my first rosehip oil purchase and I am so glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching a review about it from bubzbeauty and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I use it underneath an oil free moisturizer and it gives me just the right amount of moisture without feeling greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, brighter, more even toned, more manageable, and overall seems just happier.</li>
            <li> I gave this very simple and wholesome product a try and was very, very pleased.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic and not expensive.</li>
            <li> suppose if you have super dry skin, this might be something good to put on your face.</li>
            <li> While the rose hip seed oil has made a tremendous impact on them (much smoother), they aren&#x27;t gone completely, so I continue to use make up.</li>
            <li> the lines on the corner of my eyes and under my eyes and my smile lines has smoothen out</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see immediate results with my skin looking more even and feeling a lot softer.  </li>
            <li> I was originally looking at a cheaper brand, but too many reviews gave low ratings for quality.  </li>
            <li> right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> It kind of resembles the smell of fish oil a little bit, but not as strong.</li>
            <li> This oil works really well and soaks right into your skin and starts healing it!</li>
            <li> my hands look sooo smooth and take away the old look of aging!!</li>
            <li> one of the conditions of dry skin is oiliness as the body produces more oil to the top layer in order to try to naturally moisturize it.  </li>
            <li> this will be a great gift, great attention ill recommend the seller in the future and ill return for buy more things, good day.</li>
            <li> Oil on the face is a hard sell for a lot of us but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried many other brands, but so far I&#x27;ve found this one to be better than others and worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tried many brands and none compare, it also seems to go a lot further too.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery as well!</li>
            <li> but it is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products.  </li>
            <li> I have an oily skin and am acne prone, decided to give this a try at night as so many people with the same problem have recommended it.</li>
            <li> but the overall texture of my skin is much better and</li>
            <li> and I hope she loves it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> In the morning my skin is super resilient and soft!!</li>
            <li> Although all three worked in improving the overall texture of my skin (evenness of skin tone, imparting a certain glow), Kosmea and A&#x27;kin worked visibly better than Trilogy.</li>
            <li> While this product has made a huge difference and my make up creates an almost flawless facade, I do have fairly bad acne scarring from my childhood days.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing for my sensitive skin, especially my eye-lids.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s a quick way to get some nice oils mixed into my moisturizer, which I felt didn&#x27;t have enough oil for</li>
            <li> simply cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> but hopefully it will have long term effects on my skin :)</li>
            <li> My skin has not looked this healthy in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Obviously no dramatic results since I didn&#x27;t have problem skin to begin with</li>
            <li> combine about two drops of the Rosehip oil with 2-3 drops of 100% pure jojoba oil and apply to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> , then the contents of my bottle had certainly &amp;#34;turned&amp;#34; by the time that I received it.</li>
            <li> My acne scarring (particularly in the mild areas) is noticeably smoother and the moderate scars are now what I would call mild.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what I&#x27;ll use on my face, which tends to break out.  </li>
            <li> Not a wonder oil but overall my mom seems to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have.  </li>
            <li> Used it daily, has a light berry/nutty fragrance.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for about 4 months and it has really helped reduce the appearance of my acne scars.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li> It really soaks in and hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> I was worried about this ordering on Amazon from this seller after reading complaints but my Rosehip Oil came promptly and is the real deal.</li>
            <li> My face is naturally very oily</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and use foundation, this really smooths my foundation and doesn&#x27;t show flakes/dry spots on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this point in my life I prefer to use only the most natural, edible ingredients on my skin.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts from using this oil, but I do find it necessary to exfoliate frequently since my skin tends to get a little flaky.</li>
            <li> Anyone who understands essential oils and who has experience with rosehip oil will know at one whiff that the oil labeled by Trilogy as rosehip oil contains both vegetable and fish oils, and has no trace of true rosehip aroma.</li>
            <li> This oil smells like and is MAINLY fish oil.  </li>
            <li> oil\\&quot; and within ten minutes all excess shine is gone as it is really well absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from this particular seller twice</li>
            <li> I truly didn&#x27;t have high hopes.  </li>
            <li> I did some research and found that the Trilogy company is highly regarded, so I pulled the trigger and ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li> this being said, when I learned about Rosehip oil, I was ready and willing to try it for the aforementioned issues.  </li>
            <li> Instead of using the dropper as a dropper (putting a full drop on each fingertip), I just brush the dropper against my first, second and third fingers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and enjoyed Trilogy Certified Organic Rosehip Oil a few times.</li>
            <li> After multiple emails to the seller they pretty much stated they don&#x27;t believe me, but will send me one bottle to replace.  </li>
            <li> Can also be used on newly healed scraps to prevent scarring.</li>
            <li> The bottle specifies that the oil was \\&quot;bottled in New Zealand\\&quot; from</li>
            <li> I have never used this type of oil for my face before, but now I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> this takes care of all my problems of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;dryness is gone, no more breakouts, and it goes on very smooth but not oily at all.</li>
            <li> but this just sinks into skin making it feel super soft!!</li>
            <li> Next time I purchase, that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;imported sources\\&quot;, which most likely means China or some southeast Asia origin, where standards are not monitored, much less enforced.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to really tighten the lid because it seems to get crusty and dry out if not closed tightly.</li>
            <li> When I first learned that jojoba oil was more consistent with the sebum our bodies naturally produces, I was skeptical but desparate enough to try it.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, I wasn&#x27;t seeing things I wanted to see--someone else saw them too.</li>
            <li> It gives the added moisture I need and makes my face extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to my mother who so far seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Use the Rosehip 2x a day with your daily moisturizer and night cream and within 2-3 months you will really see a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> …it&#x27;s natural so the results are slower…but soaks into skin well.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my sensitive skin, improved</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily when you first apply, but it&#x27;s like a \\&quot;dry</li>
            <li> No other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Have been applying to my face daily for about a month now, and my pigmentation is less noticeable, pores look smaller, fewer pimples, and it&#x27;s super soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> Good product to use under foundation during the cold winter months though, so I will buy again.</li>
            <li> The girls in my family all have different types of skin (oily, adult acne, dry, etc.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m accustomed to wearing my make-up to cover a myriad of flaws from blotchy, uneven skin tones, redness, mild/moderate acne scars, and large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> I would have never spent 22 dollars on something that is clearly not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it really does work for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a GREASY, HEAVY oil.&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I don&#x27;t like about this oil is,</li>
            <li> I wake up the next morning with really soft skin, and I can attest that after using for about a month, I feel my scars have gotten slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> but it made my face breakout in a series of small pimples in unusual areas like cheeks.</li>
            <li> The price seemingly high for such a small amount</li>
            <li> It was only when I thought about reordering just now that I read some of the other reviews and realized that I may have actually been sold fish and cooking oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to lunch with a friend the other day (one I hadn&#x27;t seen in months--though I&#x27;d only been using the product about a week)</li>
            <li> Then I use my other finger tips to pick up some regular moisturizer (olay regenerist).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the last few winters at night under my regular night cream.</li>
            <li> I will come back in a few months to review if it actually erases my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have noticed my dark spots getting lighter and smaller.</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;m only half way through the bottle--and at one point it tipped over and a lot fell out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I still had half a bottle left.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost fragrance-free (slight earthy smell) and a deep amber color.</li>
            <li> I usually have breakouts regularly but had only one pimple since using this oil.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, but this didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or negative skin reactions.</li>
            <li> my I&#x27;ve been using this oil since May 1st which it did arrive on time as expected and by 3 wks of using Trilogy rosehip oil</li>
            <li> Sinks into my skin within minutes of application.</li>
            <li> As my skin matures, I am starting to see uneven tone and lines.  </li>
            <li> Alas, the pores on my nose are still visible--especially to me, though not as much to others--BUT half the size they were (they were enormous and the exposed sebum in the pores oxidizes and turns dark</li>
            <li> All the little bumps on my oily forehead that two different dermatologists said were from extreme dryness disappeared almost overnight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to use it on my neck and chest, as well as other parts of my body to help with scars and spots.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, just few drops are needed.</li>
            <li> Also, my oil came in an open box - not sure why that was.</li>
            <li> /&gt;honestly throw out your other products and just use this</li>
            <li> I use it every morning under my makeup and don&#x27;t feel the need for any other moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it every other night, and let me to tell you..</li>
            <li> I decided to try roaehip oil when I heard it was used my Miranda Kerr and other celebrities to brighten their complexion.</li>
            <li> I do this about every other night as my mositurizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve narrowed my skincare routine down to just two things: raw organic honey (for daily cleansing and as a mask) and this rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> This trilogy product says that it contains &amp;#34;minimum 80% of essential fatty acid(Omega 3 and 6 and fatty acid Omega 9&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin was starting to look dull and blotchy again.  </li>
            <li> skin is clear and radient--people are always asking me my secret.</li>
            <li> but this product smells very strange (in a bad way) and made me break out/develop scaly skin right after using it.</li>
            <li> smells like Black Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> The package says it was tested on less than 20 women.</li>
            <li> You need little bit</li>
            <li> I ran out a few weeks ago, and kept putting it off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months by mixing a few drops in with the generic-store brand aveno lotion.</li>
            <li> A few drops morning and night.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 25 but have a few) or pimples/blackheads/whiteheads like I was hoping..</li>
            <li> I will return this falsely advertised product and return to my trusted source for organic rosehip oil (I am not acting on behalf of any company, so will not disclose the brand that I have found to be reliable).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that expensive compared to other skin product.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> Trilogy Certified Organic Rosehip Oil is NOT authentic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I usually use 3 drops of this product to my face and decollete at night after applying lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very Heavy OIL.&lt;br /&gt;Might</li>
            <li> my face is LESS oily than it has ever been!!</li>
            <li> only disappointment is that it went rancid within a few months</li>
            <li> and it was hard to get my head around putting oil on my face but trying this</li>
            <li> Holy crap, I may actually have to wear blush to get a bit of pink in my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rosehip oil every day for at least years now.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a very small sample size, and I would wonder if any of the women were non-Caucasian.</li>
            <li> It is not good for oily skin or acne skin</li>
            <li> Forget all those expensive creams.</li>
            <li> when I received the item, it was broken already!</li>
            <li> I will always have a bottle and will give as gifts to my friends as long as they don&#x27;t share the secret!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smoothens skins but bad for those with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to absorb, and moisture is great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to throw the word \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; around.  Perhaps impressive, remarkable, extraordinary.  This time I will make an exception and say that this product is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heading?  Let me explain.  I&#x27;m accustomed to wearing my make-up to cover a myriad of flaws from blotchy, uneven skin tones, redness, mild/moderate acne scars, and large pores on my nose. I won&#x27;t go so far as to say that I now have a flawless alabaster complexion. I do have even skin tone!!  What is this? Holy crap, I may actually have to wear blush to get a bit of pink in my cheeks. My acne scarring (particularly in the mild areas) is noticeably smoother and the moderate scars are now what I would call mild. Alas, the pores on my nose are still visible--especially to me, though not as much to others--BUT half the size they were (they were enormous and the exposed sebum in the pores oxidizes and turns dark; therefore, they looked like blackheads--ugh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I combine about two drops of the Rosehip oil with 2-3 drops of 100% pure jojoba oil and apply to my face and neck.  That&#x27;s it.  No other moisturizers.  My face doesn&#x27;t look at all greasy, and until I started using the jojoba oil about a year ago, I looked like I was constantly sweating my face was so oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not let the word \\&quot;oil\\&quot; deter you from trying this product. When I first learned that jojoba oil was more consistent with the sebum our bodies naturally produces, I was skeptical but desparate enough to try it.  All the little bumps on my oily forehead that two different dermatologists said were from extreme dryness disappeared almost overnight.  Okay, within a week, but since I&#x27;d been dealing with them for years (treating them like acne), it felt like an overnight success. (FYI: one of the conditions of dry skin is oiliness as the body produces more oil to the top layer in order to try to naturally moisturize it.  I switched to Cetaphil when I learned this and it helped, but the jojoba oil was the clincher.)All this being said, when I learned about Rosehip oil, I was ready and willing to try it for the aforementioned issues.  I truly didn&#x27;t have high hopes.  At best, I figured some smoothing of my fine lines would still be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to lunch with a friend the other day (one I hadn&#x27;t seen in months--though I&#x27;d only been using the product about a week) and she asked if I&#x27;d been to an aesthetician or had something else done.  I grinned like a fool.  Clearly, I wasn&#x27;t seeing things I wanted to see--someone else saw them too. She was astounded at how good my skin looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply cannot say enough good things about this product. I was originally looking at a cheaper brand, but too many reviews gave low ratings for quality.  Doing more research I came across Trilogy and was impressed with the brand, so I took a chance. It has paid off. If I could give this more stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/17/13  I just put my second bottle of this in my \\&quot;cart.\\&quot;  I ran out a few weeks ago, and kept putting it off.  I have noticed that my skin was starting to look dull and blotchy again.  Then it hit me! I hadn&#x27;t been using my Rose hip seed oil since I was out.  So, here I am getting more. Still love this stuff. I do still wear make-up. While this product has made a huge difference and my make up creates an almost flawless facade, I do have fairly bad acne scarring from my childhood days. While the rose hip seed oil has made a tremendous impact on them (much smoother), they aren&#x27;t gone completely, so I continue to use make up.</li>
            <li> I have to say I reviewed several different results of people that have used rosehip oil and for days end I kept reading,but this trilogy rosehip oil kept catching my eye that people had good results with it, and now here I am saying the same thing oh.. my I&#x27;ve been using this oil since May 1st which it did arrive on time as expected and by 3 wks of using Trilogy rosehip oil the lines on the corner of my eyes and under my eyes and my smile lines has smoothen out I have to say I will continue to use Trilogy rosehip oil I will not be without it.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, so much so that I buy it for others.  I originally bought this for myself about a year ago.  I use quite it frequently--twice a day.  Instead of using the dropper as a dropper (putting a full drop on each fingertip), I just brush the dropper against my first, second and third fingers.  Then I use my other finger tips to pick up some regular moisturizer (olay regenerist).  then I mix them together and apply.  At this point, I&#x27;m only half way through the bottle--and at one point it tipped over and a lot fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a quick way to get some nice oils mixed into my moisturizer, which I felt didn&#x27;t have enough oil for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin is clear and radient--people are always asking me my secret. trilogy + regenerist + sunscreen &#x3D; perfect skin.</li>
            <li> excellent buy use it all the time. I can really see a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and enjoyed Trilogy Certified Organic Rosehip Oil a few times. This last time I bought it (which was a while ago) I couldn&#x27;t help but be dismayed by the yellow color and the fishy meets cooking oil smell. It was only when I thought about reordering just now that I read some of the other reviews and realized that I may have actually been sold fish and cooking oil. Should that not have been the case, then the contents of my bottle had certainly &amp;#34;turned&amp;#34; by the time that I received it. The vendor was Passion for Perfume, and I will not be purchasing from them again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> it is fabulous, my face feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I just finish a bottle of this oil and it&#x27;s really amazing. I used it at night and has great results when you wake up your skin is really soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I bought the Rosehip Oil for my sister&#x27;s birthday after I read about it in an article. The article recommended a certified organic product. I did some research and decided on Trilogy.  My sister loved the Rosehip so then I bought it for the rest of the girls in my family. We all love the product. The girls in my family all have different types of skin (oily, adult acne, dry, etc.) and it still has the same effects on each skin type ( youthfulness and glow to our skin). I would recommend this product to anyone looking to increase glow, youthfulness and softness to their skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what I&#x27;ll use on my face, which tends to break out.  I gave this very simple and wholesome product a try and was very, very pleased.  It felt great on my face and I have confidence because it&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment is that it went rancid within a few months and I still had half a bottle left.  It&#x27;s oil after all... What they *should* print on the label is: store in the refrigerator.  Next time I purchase, that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and my skin is changing. I have had moderate breakouts and have acne scars. I think my sun goddess days have caused wrinkles to be predominate as well as age spots. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months by mixing a few drops in with the generic-store brand aveno lotion. It has worked wonders on my wrinkles, age spots, and overall appearance and feeling of my skin. I&#x27;ve started to use it on my neck and chest, as well as other parts of my body to help with scars and spots. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> I look 10 years younger....... I will always have a bottle and will give as gifts to my friends as long as they don&#x27;t share the secret!!!!!</li>
            <li> Oil on the face is a hard sell for a lot of us but this stuff is great. I have been using it for the last few winters at night under my regular night cream. It gives the added moisture I need and makes my face extremely soft. Does not break me out.  It was reccomend by my facialist. It lasts a long time, just few drops are needed. Just be sure to really tighten the lid because it seems to get crusty and dry out if not closed tightly. Can also be used on newly healed scraps to prevent scarring. But don&#x27;t put it on until the scab falls off.</li>
            <li> Smoothens skins but bad for those with acne prone skin. Increases chances of infection..</li>
            <li> Trilogy is the best for Rosehip Oil! It&#x27;s a little more expensive but I&#x27;ve tried many brands and none compare, it also seems to go a lot further too. Fast delivery as well! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with how well it moisturized my skin. A little goes a long way and it really does work for stretch marks. Love it</li>
            <li> this was my first rosehip oil purchase and I am so glad I got it. I use it underneath an oil free moisturizer and it gives me just the right amount of moisture without feeling greasy or shiny. I only use it twice week but my regular moisturizer the rest of the days and I love the way my skin looks and feels. Obviously no dramatic results since I didn&#x27;t have problem skin to begin with but hopefully it will have long term effects on my skin :)</li>
            <li> Trilogy Certified Organic Rosehip Oil is NOT authentic rosehip oil. Anyone who understands essential oils and who has experience with rosehip oil will know at one whiff that the oil labeled by Trilogy as rosehip oil contains both vegetable and fish oils, and has no trace of true rosehip aroma. The bottle specifies that the oil was \\&quot;bottled in New Zealand\\&quot; from \\&quot;imported sources\\&quot;, which most likely means China or some southeast Asia origin, where standards are not monitored, much less enforced. Also, my oil came in an open box - not sure why that was. I will return this falsely advertised product and return to my trusted source for organic rosehip oil (I am not acting on behalf of any company, so will not disclose the brand that I have found to be reliable). *My oil was shipped from the company SB Naturals*</li>
            <li> This oil smells like and is MAINLY fish oil.  Rosehip oil is supposed to lessen fine lines and lessen age spots.  And this product did neither, as it is fish oil.  This trilogy product says that it contains &amp;#34;minimum 80% of essential fatty acid(Omega 3 and 6 and fatty acid Omega 9&amp;#34;.  If I would have realize that it said this before I purchased I would have never spent 22 dollars on something that is clearly not what I wanted. BUYER BEWARE, as the product does not even list the percent of rosehip oil it contains.</li>
            <li> I bought this initially for myself however my skin wasn&#x27;t reacting well to it. I am acne prone and although it did not break me out more, it also didn&#x27;t do anything for it. I ended up giving it to my mother who so far seems to like it. Not a wonder oil but overall my mom seems to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have.  In only 2 days noticed a difference in my complexion being softer.  I also use this on my hands and OH what a difference my hands look sooo smooth and take away the old look of aging!!</li>
            <li> Got this when I heard Princess Kate recommended it. Been using it on my face and arms - it&#x27;s really nice! It gives my face an instant glow! Very easy to use.  Love it.</li>
            <li> One of the best face oils I have used and at a great pricepount</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing the hype, and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Have been applying to my face daily for about a month now, and my pigmentation is less noticeable, pores look smaller, fewer pimples, and it&#x27;s super soft and glowy. I just love this stuff. It&#x27;s oily when you first apply, but it&#x27;s like a \\&quot;dry oil\\&quot; and within ten minutes all excess shine is gone as it is really well absorbed into the skin. Plus it&#x27;s certified organic, which is always a huge plus. I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I add it to my regular moisturizer for added softness and it is great. Using it by itself will leave the skin a bit too oily</li>
            <li> This is great rosehip oil. You need little bit and then it don&#x27;t make your face oily looking.</li>
            <li> This oil works really well and soaks right into your skin and starts healing it! I would reccomend using this product....</li>
            <li> excellent product absorbs very well into skin.</li>
            <li> this takes care of all my problems of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;dryness is gone, no more breakouts, and it goes on very smooth but not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil since April, but didn&#x27;t write a review because I just couldn&#x27;t figure this oil out.  Now, after 4 months of use, I have.  It&#x27;s a GREASY, HEAVY oil.&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I don&#x27;t like about this oil is, it just \\&quot;sits\\&quot; on top of my skin.  My skin does not absorb this oil.&lt;br /&gt;Some people say this product gives their skin a \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t like my face greasy and shiny -- yuck!&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you have super dry skin, this might be something good to put on your face. But it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, someone said they liked the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Mine smells like Black Seed Oil. Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 11-03-13&lt;br /&gt;Went into my beauty stash, and applied this because I hadn&#x27;t used it in while.  I&#x27;d FORGOTTEN about this review.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff is way too greasy for me!  Made my face break out.  It&#x27;s a very Heavy OIL.&lt;br /&gt;Might be good as an under eye wrinkle treatment -- or for feet or elbows, but I will not put this on my face again.</li>
            <li> Forget all those expensive creams. Use the Rosehip 2x a day with your daily moisturizer and night cream and within 2-3 months you will really see a difference in your skin. I was told about this oil in France. It is fantastic and not expensive. Sometimes I use it alone if running out.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it but it made my face breakout in a series of small pimples in unusual areas like cheeks. I have sensitive, fair skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> worked well on my skin, good product.</li>
            <li> this will be a great gift, great attention ill recommend the seller in the future and ill return for buy more things, good day.</li>
            <li> I use nothing else to moisturize my skin and it feels and looks amazing&lt;br /&gt;most of my brown spots have either disappeared or faded that I can now go without makeup&lt;br /&gt;my acne has totally cleared up too&lt;br /&gt;why waist your money on anything else&lt;br /&gt;this product takes care of lines, wrinkles, sun spots, scars, blotchiness, oiliness and dryness&lt;br /&gt;honestly throw out your other products and just use this</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this product. It works beautifully for my dry/combination skin. A few drops morning and night. Sinks into my skin within minutes of application. Easy to apply makeup afterwards.</li>
            <li> Good product…it&#x27;s natural so the results are slower…but soaks into skin well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and reduces lines around eyes.... I use daily!!...</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to this, but mine was also rancid when I got it. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> this is the best product ever.  Used this the first time, not sure what this what do.  It has cleared up my sensitive skin, improved&lt;br /&gt;the skin 100%.  This is a product I will use from now on.  It&#x27;s really not that expensive compared to other skin product.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, You may love it too.</li>
            <li> Like many others who have written complaints about the seller passions for perfume, so do I!  I purchased the rose hip oil last march and loved it. Used it daily, has a light berry/nutty fragrance. I ordered 2 more in september and it was rancid, smelled like fish oil and burned my face.  After multiple emails to the seller they pretty much stated they don&#x27;t believe me, but will send me one bottle to replace.  It has been 5 weeks and no replacement bottle and they refuse to answer my emails.  Trilogy, the producer, has not answered my email requests for help.  Bottom line is I have been ripped off 43$ and treated like I am a thief!</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for about 4 months and it has really helped reduce the appearance of my acne scars.Not only that but it is very moisturizing! I will definitely repurchase it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing for my sensitive skin, especially my eye-lids.  You use only drops at a time, and it feels wonderful on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have always had oily skin and I never thought I could use any oil on my skin.  I have tried many different products.  As my skin matures, I am starting to see uneven tone and lines.  I was surprised to see immediate results with my skin looking more even and feeling a lot softer.  My skin has not looked this healthy in a very long time.  I thank Trilogy for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and like the way the appearance of my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> Good acceptance by a grand daughter.</li>
            <li> best ever, really goes with my skin, love it.</li>
            <li> I have an oily skin and am acne prone, decided to give this a try at night as so many people with the same problem have recommended it. Used it for 2 weeks straight and my face got more and more oily and I got more acne on top of that,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rosehip oil every day for at least years now. Haven&#x27;t tried many other brands, but so far I&#x27;ve found this one to be better than others and worth the higher price. This isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it seems to be holding the fine wrinkles at bay (I don&#x27;t have any yet at age 37). It also gives my skin a glowy quality that people tend to notice and comment on. I use it every morning under my makeup and don&#x27;t feel the need for any other moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts from using this oil, but I do find it necessary to exfoliate frequently since my skin tends to get a little flaky. I wonder if the rosehip oil contributes to that since it is supposed to have a retinoid-like effect, and I used to get the same thing from using a retin-A cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point in my life I prefer to use only the most natural, edible ingredients on my skin. I&#x27;ve narrowed my skincare routine down to just two things: raw organic honey (for daily cleansing and as a mask) and this rosehip oil. My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but it has honestly never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used organic rosehip oils from A&#x27;kin, Trilogy and Kosmea. Although all three worked in improving the overall texture of my skin (evenness of skin tone, imparting a certain glow), Kosmea and A&#x27;kin worked visibly better than Trilogy.</li>
            <li> I have never used this type of oil for my face before, but now I cannot live without it. I usually use 3 drops of this product to my face and decollete at night after applying lotion. In the morning my skin is super resilient and soft!!</li>
            <li> I read an article with Miranda Kerr raving about the Rosehip Oil, and knew I had to try it. I did some research and found that the Trilogy company is highly regarded, so I pulled the trigger and ordered a bottle. My shipment came fast and was packaged very nicely. I have been using it every other night, and let me to tell you.. It&#x27;s AMAZING. I put it on my face and then some scars I have on my hip right before I go to bed. I wake up the next morning with really soft skin, and I can attest that after using for about a month, I feel my scars have gotten slightly lighter. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> It is not good for oily skin or acne skin</li>
            <li> Truly, all-natural products are the best for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a few drops and it will cover up your whole face and neck.  I love how it is well absorbed by the skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  In fact, it will leave your skin velvety smooth!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to know that you&#x27;re putting on something good and natural on your skin ... not something made with all sorts of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it for 1 week so I still have yet to see the results of it clearing up my blemishes, so I will come back in a few months to review if it actually erases my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;But so far, so good.  My skin is happy.</li>
            <li> My dry skin has never looked more beautiful! I use this at night before my moisturizer or alone, and within a week my skin is softer, more hydrated, and noticeably more even toned. I&#x27;m so happy with this oil.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching a review about it from bubzbeauty and was excited to try it. I&#x27;m not sure what happened but this product smells very strange (in a bad way) and made me break out/develop scaly skin right after using it. It kind of resembles the smell of fish oil a little bit, but not as strong. I bought my bottle from Etailz. Hopefully this will help someone... Just not for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered Trilogy&#x27;s Rosehip Oil in May of 2012 on Amazon and I&#x27;ve been using it religiously ever since, just ordered my third bottle! I use it on my face by itself, or two drops mixed in my Clarins daily moisturizer, Olay&#x27;s tinted moisturizer, sunscreens, you name it! It really soaks in and hydrates my skin. I have oily skin and it was hard to get my head around putting oil on my face but trying this was the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made... my face is LESS oily than it has ever been!! I was always embarrassed about my oily skin and tried to keep it from showing by using blotting papers and powder but now I don&#x27;t have to! My skin is softer, brighter, more even toned, more manageable, and overall seems just happier. I didn&#x27;t see a decrease in fine lines (I&#x27;m 25 but have a few) or pimples/blackheads/whiteheads like I was hoping.. but the overall texture of my skin is much better and the decrease in oil has made me a happy camper :). I was worried about this ordering on Amazon from this seller after reading complaints but my Rosehip Oil came promptly and is the real deal. It&#x27;s almost fragrance-free (slight earthy smell) and a deep amber color. I&#x27;ve ordered from this particular seller twice and I have not been disappointed. Just ordered a bottle for my mom for Christmas and I hope she loves it as much as I do! She has oily skin like me.</li>
            <li> It helped reduced marks on the face, and it moisturized quite nicely. The price seemingly high for such a small amount but you only need drops to cover your face. The problem is the bottle can easily knocked over and spill. We will try to buy a bigger bottle next time.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! I started using this about 2 weeks ago and can already see an improvement in my skin tone.  I usually have breakouts regularly but had only one pimple since using this oil.  My face is naturally very oily so I was concerned about using an oil based product but this just sinks into skin making it feel super soft!! So glad I found this...will use it forever!!</li>
            <li> It is a great nurishing product and it helps with scar eliminates, I give four star only because it smelled like rubborn and this bothered me</li>
            <li> Made my skin breakout, no noticeable difference the day after, and smelled like cooking oil. I use moringa oil and grape seed extract which works much better.</li>
            <li> Delighted with this purchase. It arrived promptly and well packaged. The oil is fantastic and makes my skin glow. Will definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to wear before makeup. I have combination skin and use foundation, this really smooths my foundation and doesn&#x27;t show flakes/dry spots on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, but this didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or negative skin reactions. However, I don&#x27;t notice any differences in scars or toning. The package says it was tested on less than 20 women. That&#x27;s a very small sample size, and I would wonder if any of the women were non-Caucasian. Being South Asian, I don&#x27;t have the same sort of skin chemistry as a Caucasian woman might have - so that is likely the reason why it doesn&#x27;t work for me. Good product to use under foundation during the cold winter months though, so I will buy again.</li>
            <li> when I received the item, it was broken already! There is the picture of the it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to see the affect.</li>
            <li> I decided to try roaehip oil when I heard it was used my Miranda Kerr and other celebrities to brighten their complexion. I have noticed my dark spots getting lighter and smaller. I squeeze 3 drops into my palm and I rub my hands together to lightly pat then blend into my face. I do this about every other night as my mositurizer.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Arrived as scheduled with no problems. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
