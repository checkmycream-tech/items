            <li>to be sure my hair is super clean!  </li>
            <li>gets really soapy to give hair a good clean</li>
            <li>so it was nice to fine this clarifying shampoo which is also great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean and residue free afterwards.</li>
            <li>first shampoo my hair with this and then use my favorite shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry that it has been discontinued the best I can tell and am glad I was able to find this in stock.  </li>

            <li>I use this once a week to clean my hair and my girls&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t seem to get as clean or shine as much like my favorite Citre Shine</li>
            <li>Good quality shampoo with no build up when you use it daily.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Back to Basics products, but had never tried the clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got about a years worth of Citre Shine conditioner &amp; luminators</li>
            <li>Shampoo was shipped quickly and very well packed.</li>
            <li>My first clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I really does clean your hair so well, it feels so squeaky clean after washing off all the other built up hair products used on my hair.</li>
            <li>I tried this, and it much weaker than hoped.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really works - Massage it in, leave in for about 5 minutes, then rinse and condition.</li>
            <li>Fragrance subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Years ago I used Aussie Citrifier champoo and it was very powerful and really left my hair feeling</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>I always use a good quality conditioner after using this stuff as it does tend to make my hair a little dry.  </li>
            <li>After a week of product and regular shampoo, this just helps me feel like we are starting over with a clean head of hair.</li>
            <li>Too expensive but seems like a good cleansing shampoo to remove oils and hair spray.</li>
            <li>I have highlights, and this definitely helps my hair from becoming dull and brassy.</li>

            <li> Now that I live where there is hard water, I cannot believe I went for this long without buying this shampoo to get rid of mineral buildup in my hair.</li>

            <li> I used this product a few years ago when I bought it from a hair salon.</li>
            <li> My small town quit carrying this product 2 years ago, so I have to buy it where I can find it online now.</li>

            <li> This is a great, natural clarifying shampoo. I have always liked Back to Basics products, but had never tried the clarifying shampoo. Now that I live where there is hard water, I cannot believe I went for this long without buying this shampoo to get rid of mineral buildup in my hair. I have highlights, and this definitely helps my hair from becoming dull and brassy.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used Aussie Citrifier champoo and it was very powerful and really left my hair feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;That seemed to leave the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried other citrifiers, and none compared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I tried this, and it much weaker than hoped.  I even added a container of Tea Tree Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this is the only shampoo that keeps it GONE. It is difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo two times a week and it complements my use of the regular shampoo that I use the rest of the week.</li>
            <li> I use this every once in a while if I feel that the mouse or hairspray I use is&lt;br /&gt;starting to build up on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;I first shampoo my hair with this and then use my favorite shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this everyday as it is, of course, harsh enough to do it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;Every week or two is enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;:o)&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;Neesie</li>
            <li> My first clarifying shampoo.  I was worried it might be too harsh.  Not the case at all.  Fragrance subtle and pleasant.  Excellent.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> One of the best clarifying shampoos I have been able to find. Hair feels clean and residue free afterwards. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Too expensive but seems like a good cleansing shampoo to remove oils and hair spray. gets really soapy to give hair a good clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that it has been discontinued the best I can tell and am glad I was able to find this in stock.  I am in the pool regularly so it was nice to fine this clarifying shampoo which is also great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Shampoo was shipped quickly and very well packed. No spillage or leakage. Great seller and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll shop with them again. My small town quit carrying this product 2 years ago, so I have to buy it where I can find it online now. It&#x27;s an awesome clarifying shampoo. The best !</li>
            <li> Restores shine and smells great.  I use this once a week to clean my hair and my girls&#x27; hair.  After a week of product and regular shampoo, this just helps me feel like we are starting over with a clean head of hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great! The salons in our area use to carry it but now I can only find it on Amazon. Good quality shampoo with no build up when you use it daily.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo the day before my hair appt. to be sure my hair is super clean!  I also use it every 3 weeks to remove excess styling products that build up over time!  Really works - Massage it in, leave in for about 5 minutes, then rinse and condition.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few years ago when I bought it from a hair salon. I could never find the product again, until I was searching on Amazon for items and decided to just check to see what hair products they had on the site...and there it was!  I ordered two bottles of this product, one for myself and other one to give to a family member that would benefit from this wonderful product. I really does clean your hair so well, it feels so squeaky clean after washing off all the other built up hair products used on my hair. I highly recommend this product...it works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years.  I was excited to find it on Amazon.  I use a lot of products in my hair and a lot of hairspray.  I wash my hair about every five days.  It always removes all of the build up.  The company makes it.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Super...used this for years!</li>
            <li> Bought this because I could no longer find my favorite shampoo by Citre Shine.  It seems close to what I have loved for many yrs.  Hair doesn&#x27;t seem to get as clean or shine as much like my favorite Citre Shine but I haven&#x27;t found anything else I want to use daily.  I&#x27;ve got about a years worth of Citre Shine conditioner &amp; luminators so I still get half of what I want.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clarifying shampoo to help strip styling wax out of my hair.  The salon brand shampoos were unable to perform up to task, but this stuff gets my hair squeaky clean!  I always use a good quality conditioner after using this stuff as it does tend to make my hair a little dry.  All in all, I love it for how clean it gets my hair.</li>
            <li> Back to Basics is an excellent shampoo that meets my needs.</li>
