    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is one of the best shaving soaps I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a cream or a lotion, but I find that it provides excellent protection in my shaving routine.  </li>
            <li>my boar brush is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is probably one of the best shaving soaps you&#x27;ll ever find.</li>
            <li>I think one of the best qualities of this soap, however, is the feel of your skin after your shave.</li>

            <li>Best soap because it is Wool Fat.</li>
            <li>Works best with badger brushes.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>This has to be one of the best shave soaps out there.  </li>

            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>One of the best shaving soaps in existence!</li>
            <li>The best shaving soap I have ever used, bar none.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best shave soaps I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Excellent shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Started working it on the face and in about a minute had an excellent foam.  </li>
            <li>The legendary soap.</li>
            <li>Best part is the conditioning after the shave.</li>
            <li>Great soap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have experimented on how to get the best lather with this soap</li>
            <li>Mitchell&#x27;s is excellent.  </li>
            <li>It is the best shave soap I have found.</li>
            <li>One of the best shaving soaps out there.</li>
            <li>One of the best saving soaps I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>One of the best shave soaps on the market.</li>
            <li>also bought the wood Kingsley Shave Soap Bowl and the Mitchell&#x27;s fits in it perfectly.</li>
            <li>The best shaving soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li>For instance, for the best lather, you should use a \\&quot;Boar Bristle Brush\\&quot; which is stiffer than a badger brush.</li>
            <li>For best results try skipping the bowl/scuttle and just face-lather.</li>
            <li>Blends with a pea sise dollop of cream for the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>Once you figure out the best way to make it work for you</li>
            <li>time I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve been impressed with the ease of the shave, and the lack of razor rash.</li>
            <li>infact the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>You will then get the greatest glide you will experience.</li>
            <li>Impressive.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lanolin is an excellent skin</li>
            <li>is the best.  </li>
            <li>Best shave</li>
            <li>Very best shaving soap there is, and I&#x27;ve used dozens and have years of experience as well as belong to the shave forums.</li>
            <li>Excellent lather.  </li>
            <li>but it is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so popular, people make videos about it!!</li>
            <li>Very good value.  </li>
            <li>A great post shave with excellent glide and cushion.</li>
            <li>this smells so good to me!</li>
            <li>Lathers up great , and a very good shaving soap ..</li>
            <li>Lubrication must be experienced to believe, simply incredible.  </li>
            <li>It takes some practice to get a great lather from it.</li>
            <li>but once going it is a great shaving soap and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product that protects quite well.  </li>
            <li>Great DE shaving soap, would recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li>It cushions great, and helps give a close non-irritating shave.</li>
            <li>Still, it is a great soap that I will use again.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great shave soap.</li>
            <li>Truly great soap.</li>
            <li>Great lather and shave, but</li>
            <li>Great shave soap.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be a really great soap though not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just for face protection alone this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will give you a great shave.</li>
            <li>It is not the easiest to lather but when you get it dialed in you will have a great shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;scent is alright, but man great lather on my badger brush, and the glide this stuff has is</li>
            <li>Once you do, its great.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>I use this almost every day and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great shave.</li>
            <li>this is a great soap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great, no-nonsense soap.  </li>
            <li>A great product in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Smells great though.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great soap.</li>
            <li>could go on and on for hours about how great this stuff is, if it weren&#x27;t shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Very Nice Lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels very nice on the skin</li>
            <li>Very nice scent...</li>
            <li>A very nice soap that lathers well and protects my face from burn.  </li>
            <li>lather has a pleasant scent and does a great job of lubricating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While the shave is great it still depends, somewhat, on good soap or cream, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(I got one by Parker that fits it nicely) and you&#x27;ll be set!</li>
            <li>Among the best I&#x27;ve used, very good shaving soap, scent is nice, not too strong, very very nice lather.</li>
            <li>I found the scent to be pleasant and conspicuous.</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant as well.</li>
            <li>it gets the job done and the fragrance is mildly pleasant but it will never be my \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>Easy to lather and the best soap out there...period.</li>
            <li>The box that it comes in is very cool!!</li>
            <li>Very good quality shaving soap, use bottle water to make a better foam and protective barrier on your face .</li>
            <li>Good lather and my skin feels moist after using it.</li>
            <li>Good product,</li>
            <li>problems for me getting a good lather from my cup to my face...</li>
            <li>It may be a good product, but not for this guy......</li>
            <li>Good performance.</li>
            <li>Well ... get a good badger hair brush</li>
            <li>And the lather is good too.</li>
            <li>and it is good to go.  </li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>but this is a good value.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, non drying, lightly scented, manly soap.</li>
            <li>If you want to see a good video review online, I recommend googling \\&quot;Mantic,  Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap.\\</li>
            <li>A perfect fit.</li>
            <li>(really loved that one too).</li>
            <li>In fact, if you can get a good lather out of Williams shaving soap (and yes, it can be done), then lathering with Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is a snap by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels good knowing that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my face</li>
            <li>The soap has a soapy scent which some people like or don&#x27;t like, but it smells good to me.</li>
            <li>you donâ€™t need to be an expert barber to work a good</li>
            <li>I did a bit of research and a lot of &amp;#34;experienced&amp;#34; shavers really loved this stuff.  </li>
            <li>my husband learned how to use this soap in a online forum and has loved it ever since.</li>
            <li>Good, good, good.</li>
            <li>He was excited to try it and has since told me it is one of the best shaving soaps he has ever used.</li>
            <li>Very rich lather and good amount of slickness!  </li>
            <li>if you are allergic to wool then dont play with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: feels great, nice light smell, real nice non slip shave</li>
            <li>Lather works up quickly and perfect every time.  </li>
            <li>Lovely soap, bought it for my husband, he likes shaving more now and he smells great!</li>
            <li>&quot; This gentlemen provides great tips on how to get the most out of this shaving soap.</li>
            <li>For good reason-its primary ingredient &#x27;tallow&#x27; is the basis of great shaving soaps worldwide.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that builds to an awesome lather without a lot of fuss.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>my husbands favorite shaving soap!</li>
            <li>and I have amazing results with my shaving.</li>
            <li>Great lather, smooth feel.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>MWF is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Amazing even..  </li>
            <li>lather, when you get it to work, is great and smooth.</li>
            <li>That said, I wish everything I bought online was this amazing.</li>
            <li>I soaked it in WARM water and took my boar brush to start to lather it up.  </li>
            <li>But that doesn&#x27;t stop me from making a really nice lather with this.</li>
            <li>I soak the puck in warm water while I take a shower, so let&#x27;s say 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That may be a nice routine for some people including myself, yet if I&#x27;m in a rush, forget it.  </li>
            <li>Lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>find Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat to be a nice soap.</li>
            <li>this setup the razor does glide nicely.</li>
            <li>It was a gift and they really liked it.</li>
            <li>but since I own some I will be putting this to the test.</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used wool fat shaving soap for years and what I like about it is how nice it leaves my skin for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>It takes more work than is like to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend looking at Sharpologist instructions on the best way to lather this stuff it can be trickier from what I have experienced and read.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat this shaving soap for a good lather and smooth silky platform to shave on!  </li>
            <li>Those artisan soaps often come in a variety of delightful fragrances, but I don&#x27;t care that much about fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent</li>
            <li>This is nice soap.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>good texture and smooth application, as well as good scent.  </li>
            <li>All I do is soak the brush in warm water, squeeze some water out and twirl it on the soap for 15-20 seconds.</li>
            <li>and I could use a nice scent while I shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the smell and lathers good.</li>
            <li>The slickness makes for a great shave, and the scent of the soap is clean and nice.</li>
            <li>I use hot water and a boar brush, and I get great lather and a very enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, smooth ...</li>
            <li>Shave is smooth and scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Even if you think the scent is strong, it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger like Tobac does, but provides as good of a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find Mitchell&#x27;s very easy to lather.</li>
            <li>Very light scent, but the lather is amazing, as is the feel of your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>The lather develops quickly and richly - making shaving very pleasant indeed.</li>
            <li>I still think the Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood is a winner for one of the best scents</li>
            <li>Not heavy on the fragrance, just a great lathering soap, and that&#x27;s all that it needs to be!</li>
            <li>I had read many reviews at a shaving forum and liked what I heard</li>
            <li>After hearing many times of &amp;#34;the fat&amp;#34; I decided to buy my own puck of Mitchell&#x27;s and see what the fuss was about.</li>
            <li>so for the lather... when it first got this soap my fore arm was getting huge from trying to work a perfect lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked Cella&#x27;s lather better.  </li>
            <li>Makes a really good and lasting lather, good cushion, nice lubrication, and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>This pleasant smelling soap lathers very easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>Pleasant mild scent.</li>
            <li>It does also leave my face nice and smooth and lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with this product , I have normal skin ,  no problems , very good and nice shaving with it .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll create a luscious, moisturizing, delicious smelling lather that is like no other.</li>
            <li>Put all of this with some hot water and you&#x27;ve got yourself a great shave.....</li>
            <li>This is very comfortable shaving soap.</li>
            <li>leaves face very smooth.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is mild but good.  </li>
            <li>There are easier to lather products but this really makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li>Because everyone is different and must find the best combination of razor, brush, soap and blades</li>
            <li>but I still think MWF is a better performer.</li>
            <li>However, when you combine a soap with a cream I believe the result is always better than either one by theirselves.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Now one of my favorite shaving soaps...makes the razor glide.</li>
            <li>soap is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>I do most of my shopping on Amazon and love my prime acct.</li>
            <li>/&gt;If shaving is more to you than just something you have to do, this soap will please.</li>
            <li>tried a number of soaps and creams from the cheapest (Williams) to the most costly (Fitjar).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OK with that.</li>
            <li>you like your face, you&#x27;ll love this soap.</li>
            <li>This is magic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I gave the MWF soap a shot.</li>
            <li>(if it is a downside) is that it smells like, well...soap, so if you&#x27;re expecting a fragrant bliss from your shaving soap to somehow magically blend with your aftershave and cologne</li>
            <li>This is soap is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re not allergic, a great shave and really softens the hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but I find myself using this most of the time with the body soap also.</li>
            <li>it so smooth, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>Wish the scent was better</li>
            <li>but i love the feel.</li>
            <li>It whips up better with the boar than my Silvertip badger brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You have to work to get a lather going, and a boar brush works better than a badger</li>
            <li>but I like boar better anyways.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just more for the money, so I&#x27;m OK with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for the perfect shaving soap or creme for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>Its an absolute joy to use.</li>
            <li>I used a cheese shredder and reduced the diameter, put the shredded soap in the mug, compressed it and then pressed the remaining soap in on top.</li>
            <li>It can take more water than some</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is nothing short of awesome.</li>
            <li>By that standard, this soap is among the very best out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In about 20 seconds, you have phenomenal lather.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, it&#x27;s cheap!  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Some love it, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The only ones that even compares to it are the homemade soaps my wife made (100% organic and omg wonderful)</li>
            <li>This soap lathers easier and better than any soap I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It lathers ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Accordingly I have moved it up the top tier and displaced the Proraso cream.</li>
            <li>Its among my top 3 favorite shaving products.</li>
            <li>so most of the time the ambient temperature is close to body temperature which may help.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has turned out to be one of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li>Love the logo.</li>
            <li>It really loads up great on the brush.</li>
            <li>definitely a favorite.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m sold, I had in mind to try a lot of different soaps to chose what works best for me</li>
            <li>I hope you love it like I did.</li>
            <li>love the lather I can get with this soap and any shaving brush</li>
            <li>Skin moisturization is superb and the only soap that beats it in that area is Provence Sante IMO.</li>
            <li>Supposedly, but there is no way to be sure.</li>
            <li>I use a synthetic brush mostly and face lather exclusively.</li>
            <li>It compares to the rest of my shaving stuff on top and I have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t belong to any cults(haha) but love this soap.</li>
            <li>and I stopped using the oil because this stuff alone was way better than any combination I had used</li>
            <li>Has a great smell and when you get the lather right, fantastic performance.  </li>
            <li>This is a Face-Lathering soap, and you may need to soak it in warm, but not hot, water while you soak your brush for the best results.</li>
            <li>Nice clean soap smell.</li>
            <li>No need for aftershaves or moisturizers, just a nice clean rinse.</li>
            <li>Regarding a description of the smell, it is a nice, clean soap smell that reminds me of Ivory soap.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a powdery linen clean smell.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was ok; but I just don&#x27;t get a good lather with my semouge 1800 boar brush.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, that is why it has been around so long.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty good price/use ratio.</li>
            <li>If it took you too long to get a perfect almost whipped cream lather, adjust your technique.</li>
            <li>So if you want a soap that feels great, smells manly, lathers well (with my new boar brush.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how many products and great pricing Amazon offers.</li>
            <li>Nice shaving soap, with a light to no scent, and smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li>This soap just awesome, better than Crab tree, I noticed from the very first time , the smell is light and soft somehow like baby powder , kinda.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TOBS, great smell, but not slick at all.</li>
            <li>and it left the face very clean and gave a very good shave.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth with a nice crisp smell.  </li>
            <li>Great on his sensitive skin with his safety razor.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the best wet shave soap I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate and just buy, you will enjoy and be glad you purchased.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, fresh soap smell.</li>
            <li>I still use), but out of &amp;#34;convenience&amp;#34; (really, a lack of good shaving products and knowhow)</li>
            <li>I received my order for Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap, watched and followed the advice of mantic59&#x27;s great YouTube tutorial on how to lather it properly, and subsequently gave myself the greatest, smoothest, most comfortable shave of my life.  </li>
            <li>TOBS Mr. Taylor is great for a classic yet clean scent that sticks with you.</li>
            <li>Very light clean scent which doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>It has a cult like following for a good reason!  </li>
            <li>I like the aroma, it&#x27;s very mild.</li>
            <li>Easy fix.. just work the foam on your face with the brush and it thickens up</li>
            <li>fragrance of this soap is very mild and neutral.</li>
            <li>easily-  </li>
            <li>Soap smells great and works like a charm,  second shaving soap and this one is much better.  </li>
            <li>Loaded my brush easily.  </li>
            <li>This soap is easy to lather and very mild on the skin...</li>
            <li>have found the soap easy to rinse off with no lingering film and leaves my face</li>
            <li>Lathers easily.</li>
            <li>It is a strong floral scent that just did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I like strong scents with my shave.</li>
            <li>make my face feel good after shaving, particularly in the winter.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem too strong of a scent to me either, but some people think it does based off of what I have read about it before I bought it.</li>
            <li>Wow this is amazing!</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a bar of dove soap, and I was not super impressed with the lather from it.</li>
            <li>some soaps its fine, others are not.</li>
            <li>Mild and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Clean for sure, but nothing to get excited about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They all worked but Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat seems as good as the best in performance and not nearly as costly as many other choices.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best performing shave soap that I have used thus far.</li>
            <li>the post-shave feel on your skin is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love how my face smells like fresh sheep, too.  </li>
            <li>Light scent.</li>
            <li>It makes all kinds of lather, like smudged on the ceiling and light fixtures amounts of lather.  </li>
            <li>Placed the soap in a KFC dish (where it fit well and was free to boot) and a about five twirls off the brush on the soap and rubbed the brush on the face.  </li>
            <li>Sort of a light laundry detergent smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great soap and will definitely be apart of my shave rotation.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spring for the dish because I am cheap.  </li>
            <li>my skin feel amazing, and really helps reduce nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>I use the available wool fat dish.  </li>
            <li>I have used everything from King of Shaves, Proraso, Cremo Creme, etc, and nothing has been as comfortable as the Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap.</li>
            <li>It will be smooth and moist and will feel awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>your water is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, for me this soap is among the best shaving soaps and creams I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>it becomes a fantastic soap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and does the trick</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin remarkably smooth after each shave.  </li>
            <li>I have to pair it with a lotion or shave oil to make for a comfortable shave experience.</li>
            <li>Smells relatively neutral, great product.</li>
            <li>I find the shave to be smooth, cushioned and close.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit in my shave mug</li>
            <li>so I microwaved it to fit.  </li>
            <li>Great for glide and closeness and absence of irritation.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant mild scent that is floral but still somehow masculine.</li>
            <li>Plus I enjoy the canister that my original order came in.</li>
            <li>Builds a nice lather with high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you take your time and learn how to create a good lather with it because it takes a little more work than some others.</li>
            <li>It treats your skin to a rich moisturizing experience like nothing else.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth the time!</li>
            <li>Well I decided to try this shave soap based on the reviews and I must say that I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and smells great.</li>
            <li>The full fat lanolin leaves my face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells great, light and subtle and the lather is amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes shaving easier, leaves his face feeling moisturized and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out, and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and manly like a lotion of sorts.</li>
            <li>The scent is simply clean.  </li>
            <li>Proraso was so much more satisfying in lather and for my skin, I cannot recommend this product and recommend anyone with sensitive skin to try Proraso.</li>
            <li>It is a good soap overall with a light scent.</li>
            <li>Certainly in the top quintile.</li>
            <li>I have hard water, seems to prefer the best badger vs. Silvertip for me.</li>
            <li>It lathers well even in my hard water and provides an excellent cushion for shaving.  </li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant scent, reminds me of the old time barber shops actually.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending more for a superior product, but I find this soap to be average.</li>
            <li>Definitely give this one the highest rating and good recommendation.  </li>
            <li>Tried this shave soap originally, nice lather, soft silky after feel, but wanted something with a nicer scent.</li>
            <li>but i love it so much i might have to take it</li>
            <li>By the time the sink was full...</li>
            <li>bloom into a full lather avalanche like TOBS</li>
            <li>For me, it gives a nice shave and leaves my skin baby soft for the day.    </li>
            <li>cool</li>
            <li>After that the soap maker changed the label to reflect the true ingredients.</li>
            <li>My observation is that not only does the lanolin soften up your skin nicely but it has helped brake in the boar bruch very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This stuff lather&#x27;s really thick and really fast, is really smooth, makes the razor glide better, washes off easily, and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>I get a SUPER close shave with no nicks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 different Barrister and Mann soaps, Haslinger&#x27;s Ewe&#x27;s Milk, Imperial Barber, TOBS, Pre de Provence, Phoenix Artisan soaps, and many more.</li>
            <li>have found a few artisan soaps that lather as good, but none better.  </li>
            <li>I filled the mug with the soap with hot water.  </li>
            <li>He is very pleased overall.</li>
            <li>You rarely hear this product called by its full name.</li>
            <li>I may have a new favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out new shaving soaps, and this was the latest one after trying Tabac</li>
            <li>With the soft water where I live and a good badger brush, this soap works up quickly (10 seconds or so) into an obscene amount of creamy lather.  </li>
            <li>The soap also lubricates your face very well and makes shaving easy.  </li>
            <li>All what a shaving soap should be and the reason why you buy it in the first place!</li>
            <li>I shaved it down to fit into my shaving mug and it lathers nicely and leaves your face smooth.</li>
            <li>It does require more loading time with a super soft silvertip badger though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>But the soap itself does perfectly fit a rice bowl or large ramekin, in case you were wondering..</li>
            <li>I use different brushes and get very good lather with all of them except some types take a little more work.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is light, lathers very well.</li>
            <li>for the lathering, I put some warm water on top of the puck and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Found this brand several years ago and it is by far the best, thick lather good protection during the shaving process and in all that time I have never nicked myself ..</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money as it keeps me from getting razor burn.</li>
            <li>give this a solid 4 star ratting because this is, in my opinion, a really nice shaving soap</li>
            <li>they are too &#x27;old man&#x27;-ish for my tastes, even though they are a favorite with others.</li>
            <li>This also leaves the face feeling soft and healthy after the shave.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Out of all the soaps I&#x27;ve tried so far, I like this one the most.</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite shave soap.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>the magic of MWF is the lanolin, a natural wax that the sheep exude to protect their wool...</li>
            <li>so far I love it.</li>
            <li>And it was worth my troubles...</li>
            <li>good product as described by wet shave enthusiasts.</li>
            <li>So far so good it was my first shave soap for the new adventures of DE shaving.</li>
            <li>this specific soap.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very light, reminds me baby powder or clean</li>
            <li>It has a simple, clean smell like fresh linen and is the most thoroughly hydrating shaving product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Rich and thick lather that leaves skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>I have hard water where I live but still got a great lather out of it; however, it&#x27;s lather isn&#x27;t any better than</li>
            <li>They all said that you have to watch the YouTube videos to get the right technique for lathering.</li>
            <li>This one is right up there in terms of face glide and lubrication.</li>
            <li>This is a very softly scented, strongly foaming, skin protecting soap.  </li>
            <li>Soaking the puck for 10 minutes prior to shaving, then loading the brush upside down and face lathering seems to work the best with this soap.</li>
            <li>This means no allergic reactions and a fresh clean feeling - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>is truly amazing is how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>Minimal amount of soap needed for a great lather and my face was left feeling really smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Incredibly thick, rich, comfortable lather with exceptional lubricity and glide, and afterwards my rather sensitive skin felt pleasantly moisturized and had (still has, a day later) absolutely zero irritation.</li>
            <li>I ordered a lavender scented soap at the same time because it didn&#x27;t contain parabens and was supposed to be gentle but, although I liked the aroma a lot, it was as if I had rubbed some Tabasco sauce on my face.</li>
            <li>The brush loads fairly quickly and lathers without much difficulty.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well, yet it does not &amp;#34;disolve&amp;#34; quickly.</li>
            <li>The lather is excellent and it only takes a few swirls for me to get sufficient lather to shave with.</li>
            <li>Like my friend Harlan once said: &amp;#34;You don&#x27;t always get what you pay for, but you never get MORE than you pay for.&amp;#34; I paid a bit more for some castile hand soap a few months ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Smells clean and mild (while in use - smell doesn&#x27;t linger)&lt;br /&gt;+Leaves your face soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>Few products out there these days live up to all the hype, but this incredible shave soap certainly does.  </li>
            <li>It is a very rich, thick lather that carries a bunch of moisture to your face which makes for a nice shave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And while this soap costs more than some alternatives (including the Van der Hagen soap available in drug stores everywhere for a tenth the price), it is in line with other premium products.  </li>
            <li>It took a little practice to learn to make a good lather with it</li>
            <li>The original Mitchell noticed that wool shearers&#x27; hands were always soft and supple, and thankfully decided to try a shaving product based in it.&lt;br /&gt;You will notice the lanolin effect right after your shave as you&#x27;re rinsing off your face.</li>
            <li>a first for me.  </li>
            <li>My only regret is not getting more than one of these.</li>
            <li>First let me say this; I use this soap with creams, and never alone.  </li>
            <li>I had no problems making more than enough lather.</li>
            <li>After most of the last 40 years bearded (just shaving my neck)</li>
            <li>Face feels all soft and smooth after every shave.</li>
            <li>I fill the sink with hot water...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of different soaps and a few creams, most of which are good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one of these people that soaks the puck either, I just heat it up in its dish, in a basin of hot water as I soak my brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this one will last me three months or more..</li>
            <li>pretty nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves the face feeling pretty moisturized after a scrape.</li>
            <li>big thing to remember is that just like Williams and Tabac, this is a hard-milled, tallow-based soap, and unlike the glycerin-based soaps of Van Der Hagen or Colonel Conk, a tallow soap needs to be used with lots of water, and the hotter you can get that water, the better the lather and cushion</li>
            <li>The only reason why it got 4 stars is because I&#x27;m more of a shaving cream type of guy rather than a soap puck.  </li>
            <li>scent is a great old school smell that reminds me of an old English cottage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lather is stellar and provides a lot of comfort.  </li>
            <li>For that reason alone, this soap will not become a &#x27;casual&#x27; shaver&#x27;s best choice.  </li>
            <li>Lathers even with hard water, smells like an old barber shop (not to strong, just a nice light fragrance you would expect from shaving creams).</li>
            <li>Many other products have certain aspects that I enjoy, but</li>
            <li>Much slicker and more comfortable than the other brands that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it is a very effective soap that will last a long time, the downside is it takes time to prep/load the puck.  </li>
            <li>I read shaving forums that said to use warm water not hot, to load lots of soap on the brush and to face lather instead of using a bowl.</li>
            <li>Still though, nice to mix things up and add this to your unique arsenal of hard shaving soaps.</li>
            <li>As far as the scent goes, it is just kind of a classic soapy smell that is rather mild and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger very long</li>
            <li>Worth giving it a shot based on other more positive reviews.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never get much out of it no matter how hot</li>
            <li>Bought this at the recommendation of many online forums for it&#x27;s newb-friendly lather, and will probably stick with it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>the slick side, good blade glide.</li>
            <li>I have to say after trying many different brands from many different companies this by far</li>
            <li>I have a \\&quot;Super Badger Brush\\&quot; which doesn&#x27;t make near the lather that the stiffer, boar bristle brush makes during lathering.</li>
            <li>it is warm water (he has the dish that comes with it from a previous purchase) before lathering up.</li>
            <li>a good long lasting lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved opening it up and smelling the very masculine, subtle clean aroma of the soap.</li>
            <li>Certainly adequate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps the greatest characteristic of this soap (at least boasted by the brand) is that it is made using wool fat, which has lanolin.</li>
            <li>I do have to work hard to get a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Huge cake of soap, will probably last 6 months.</li>
            <li>The bar is huge and should last 4 years, not kidding.</li>
            <li>Many wet shavers swear by this soap for a reason.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find a much easier soap that doesn&#x27;t need coaxing.</li>
            <li>I feel like these soaps really depend on the person, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;would enjoy daily.</li>
            <li>story short, quit being cheap.</li>
            <li>soap provides the comfort and the lubrication to get a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Others</li>
            <li>So really you&#x27;ll save money and give the skin on your face luxurious care.</li>
            <li>The lather holds up through a three pass shave and works well when using a straight razor or a double-edge.</li>
            <li>really like the scent, and the feel of my skin after</li>
            <li>, I much prefer the heavier woodsy smells for my soaps.</li>
            <li>Almost too much.  </li>
            <li>I used a bit too much water.  </li>
            <li>The added benefit is that it seems to be very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>My wife REALLY likes the scent a lot, too, so it&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
            <li>I rinse my brush and then swirl the dripping wet brush on top of the soap.  </li>
            <li>Wet and repeat for more water if needed.</li>
            <li>MWF doesn&#x27;t have much of any fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It really has no scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other products I&#x27;ve used: Col Conk Bay Rum - primary shave soap since I went back to DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>One shake of the brush and then work the puck gently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a cheap $2-3 individual sized lidded souffle bowl from the supermarket.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the whole week.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for this shave soap.</li>
            <li>I will warn that the MO for this product is very polarized.  </li>
            <li>really does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;smoothes</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ready when I comes out.</li>
            <li>Love it.), and especially if your skin is on the sensitive side, this might be for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews about Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap, so I had to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li>I recently got around to trying this soap (I have so many that I rotate with) and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat shaving soaps have been around for a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to see why.</li>
            <li>By protects, we mean sticks to your skin with a nice slippery texture that allows your razor to glide right over.</li>
            <li>I have one other one that I want to try, but I think I found a favorite.</li>
            <li>This soap produces a rich lather and I never need to reload my brush for subsequent passes.</li>
            <li>soap takes a few minutes of work to get a suitable lather, but I&#x27;m not in a hurry when getting ready to lay a straight razor against my throat.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>One puck of this soap lasts me several months, so it&#x27;s pretty economical compared to canned shaving creams or gels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days now, with an EJ DB89 and Polisilver Super iridium blades, and its a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not a glycerin based soap, there is a little glycerin in the ingredients - it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a large amount, so if you really like glycerin, get some vegetable glycerin on Amazon and sprinkle it on top of the soap or add it to your pre-shave.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I don&#x27;t really notice any huge difference in moisturizing, but I don&#x27;t have really dry skin either.</li>
            <li>Fair, not good for my face.</li>
            <li>The history behind the product is quite remarkable and is reflected in the quality of this&lt;br /&gt;product. BONUS SUPRISE:</li>
            <li>I was surprised as this was my first time with a soap; have used creams or croaps before.</li>
            <li>After that the soap is properly hydrated and will work very well with whatever brush you use in your daily routine, just be sure to dump out the water before you lather</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is better and less reactive to my skin than Proraso Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li>Lathers much more than previous shaving soap.</li>
            <li>The main thing I&#x27;m looking for in a shave soap is protection from the razor blade.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the smell is decent.</li>
            <li>This is a classic.</li>
            <li>A classic shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>Soak the puck and your brush in warm to hot water (hard or soft), take shower, and dump out water from soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommeded.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>Knowing the softening effect lanolin has on skin, I had high hopes ordering this soap and was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s stir, add a little water, stir, more water, repeat until you get the lather you want.  </li>
            <li>it another try with a little more patience.</li>
            <li>UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;After using this puppy for a little while I have come to master it and love it.</li>
            <li>It is as easy to lather as any other soap and easier than some.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that water hardness and temp can make a difference with this stuff, but as I have decidedly soft water here in the city, I can&#x27;t really comment on that.  </li>
            <li>While I did apply moisturizer cream after shaving (its a normal part of my routine)</li>
            <li>It should be noted that I have normal water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks before deciding if it&#x27;ll have a permanent place in my rotation but</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t any harsh chemicals in the constitution of what is much more than a soap.</li>
            <li>I have found after a few days that a stiffer bristle brush works better.  </li>
            <li>Swish your hot water filled brush a few times over the soap and start applying it to your face.</li>
            <li>Normally it takes me about a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Cella has that thick lather that kind of cakes on to your razor.</li>
            <li>I live in an area that has naturally soft water, Denver Colorado, so it lathers really well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If I try a shave soap that leaves me feeling less than fully protected, adding a few swirls of MWF assures a great shave.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and a rather coarse beard, and this has helped tremendously with irritation and closeness.  </li>
            <li>To sum up, if you have gentle or easily irritated skin and aren&#x27;t looking for a heavily scented product, this is the grail of soaps for you.  </li>
            <li>Its just right for me and has a different feel than the rest.</li>
            <li>But once you get the lather right, with enough water, it is eaaasy on the face.  </li>
            <li>I took it and actually practiced with it till I got it right.</li>
            <li>I originally rated ita 4 but now after careful consideration I must admit that it deserves a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to try a new soap.</li>
            <li>In shaving circles it&#x27;s known simply as &amp;#34;MWF&amp;#34; and may be the most widely used product in shavingdom.</li>
            <li>It went from being my least favorite to being one of my absolute favorites.</li>
            <li>With all that out the way I believe this is the BEST shaving soap I have used so far...I started with Williams soap (cheap but difficult to get a good lather) and also the blades grim smolder soap (easy to lather but burns slightly too much)...</li>
            <li>(Perfector makes a nice one), watch the youtube video on how to lather Wool Fat - and you&#x27;ll have no trouble building up a thick layer of lather</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t actually take very much soap to get all the lather you need.</li>
            <li>I know the water is very soft here</li>
            <li>claim there is something about the natural oils found in the wool that make it super slick, and that&#x27;s very evident when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hot water, regular amount on my brush</li>
            <li>In order to fit it in my shaving mug, I shredded the soap with a cheese grater, put all the chips into to the mug, and pressed down.  </li>
            <li>Also, the clean smell won&#x27;t interfere with any aftershave or cologne you put on like some of the other scented soaps out there.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get a 5 because the scent is pretty flat</li>
            <li>I used to think I had sensitive skin until I married someone with actual sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>A true English shave soap that brings back the old time feeling of your shave.</li>
            <li>If you have hard water, make sure that you use distilled or bottled water with this</li>
            <li>I bought the refill only because it would fit perfectly in an empty shaving cream container I had.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find any problems with the soap as far a lathering.  </li>
            <li>I know, it is a soap, but wow, the scent just seems so...</li>
            <li>I came around to daily shaving with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves the skin feeling well nourished and protects well with my daily straight</li>
            <li>Also leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>so far I think its a yes.</li>
            <li>My face is still soft the day after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Kinda loud ..</li>
            <li>Want to see it in action?  </li>
            <li>I have no trouble lathering this soap</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for cartridge systems in my early twenties.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my beat up old drugstore boar brush which is now probly 15 years old and a silvertip badger brush..</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t push it too far</li>
            <li>For me the real test of a shaving soap is if it provides enough cushion to allow me to get a close shave 5 mornings in a row without irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to hit my 40&#x27;s and getting conscious about the wrinkles that are going to soon develop.  </li>
            <li>I read through a bunch of soap recommendations on a shaving blog and this one seemed to be the most commonly recommended</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I call an old school type scent of days gone by</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Arko only wins on cost, and while MWF scent lingers some, it is not like tabac or TOBS where i can expect to smell it 8-16 hours later.</li>
            <li>The lanolin in this soap gives a great post shave feel to your skin that I have not experienced with any other soap.</li>
            <li>It is a bit tougher to get a decent lather compared to the soft cream I last used.</li>
            <li>I rarely use anything other than a moisturizer after shaving.</li>
            <li>Anyone lucky to have facial hair growing in different directions and can only shave with the grain</li>
            <li>When it comes to soaps Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is the only one I have used over the past 3 years that I truly love.  </li>
            <li>Its a bit much and not very masculine IMHO.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a shave soap I</li>
            <li>Very little odor, which as a healthcare pro, is important.</li>
            <li>Growing up on Williams soap and favoring Van der Hagen as a drugstore standby these days, I notice one soap generally lasts me a month (some less than that), but aside from the simply larger size of Mitchells (4.4 oz to 2.5 oz for standard mug size soaps), you just get more bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>It gives a slick feel to the skin and a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I lather before showering; after showering, and usually a second time while shaving, and my brush is full of lather when I finish and my single puck will last for maybe 300 shaves??</li>
            <li>The smell is clean,simple and mild enough to not overpower other treatments (aftershave/cologne)&lt;br</li>
            <li>big secret to getting great lather when I use this soap-or any other tallow soap-is to fill the bowl</li>
            <li>As it turns out I live only 20 miles from West Coast Shaving.  </li>
            <li>While I was there I picked up a bunch of different blades, a new boar brush and Mitchells wool fat shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>and this left me feeling soft!</li>
            <li>Lightly scented, just enough to make your shave one of life&#x27;s little luxuries, and not enough to irritate my ridiculously sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works really well providing a slick smooth lather for your razor to carve through with minimal resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it is a little too large to fit in the bottom of a typical Old Spice shaving mug, so I found a bigger shaving mug.  </li>
            <li>Razorock has similar soaps available for a third less.</li>
            <li>In fact after having wet it and let it dry a few dozen times, there is no discernible scent of any kind.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but always shaved with a razor and over the years have used different brands of mug soap.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do the job, and will probably last longer than a soft cream.</li>
            <li>so apparently I&#x27;m one of those people that has difficulty lathering it up correctly.</li>
            <li>Like a perfumed old lady or a French whore.</li>
            <li>I found this soap to be much easier than expected to lather.  </li>
            <li>use this with my Shaveology Phantom razor and I can barely even feel the razor working ...</li>
            <li>, I would recommend this soap to anyone interested in wet shaving, it performs well and the old-fashioned looking packaging actually makes for a neat decorative item if you&#x27;re going for a Victorian Era look.</li>
            <li>I now regret not getting the ceramic container it comes in, it looks cool, I now just use a small pyrex.</li>
            <li>Lather then starts building as soon as I put the brush on my face just adding a little water for the right</li>
            <li>One last point, as other reviewers have pointed out, this soap does not have a strong scent, its just very subtle and clean.</li>
            <li>I really learned to shave properly about a year and a half ago and bought a Merkur and an Edwin Jagger double edge along with a couple of straight razors.</li>
            <li>, this soap makes yor face so slick that shaving is a breeze, especially in those places near your neck where its a little more sensitive and you need to go with a lighter touch.  </li>
            <li>Normally in the colder months my face will dry out after shaving and become itchy.  </li>
            <li>It has tallow so it is super slick and cushiony allowing for a maximum of comfort and protection of the blade.</li>
            <li>This is a great soap - it is a little difficult to start the lather</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other soaps and really like the Razo Rock but</li>
            <li>I found it much easier to lather than other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest for those who like fragrance in their shave soap to just put MWF in a covered container and sprinkle in a little of their favorite cologne a few times and keep it covered</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have a rich thick lather like the &amp;#34;art of shaving&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gifted with tough facial hair and skin that doesn&#x27;t get along with shaving.</li>
            <li>the past I would change up the soap vs cream combinations frequently, but since the first time I used Mitchell&#x27;s I&#x27;ve never used another</li>
            <li>will not dry out or burn skin even if on face for awhile.</li>
            <li>soap cake was a bit larger than my shaving mug, requiring that I shave down the edges to fit and knead the flakes back in with a little warm water, but my mug runs a little on the small side.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>The resulting lather is very thick and slick, providing good &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; for the razor blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Let me preface this review by saying that I am fairly new to wet shaving and I use a late 1940&#x27;s Gillette super speed razor with feather blades and a badger brush...</li>
            <li>you have dry or sensitive skin, I would recommend looking for a review written by someone who also has dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Super thick lather.</li>
            <li>The price is high but do not be dissuaded because the puck is larger than any other I have seen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least half a dozen different soaps and creams, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Its large diameter does not fit my shaving mug.</li>
            <li>Too much water, too little water</li>
            <li>: a little expensive but should last you about six months; takes experience to get a good lather, your skin might not react well to lanolin&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried to date (granted not THAT many yet) but noticeably TABAC just failed to live up to the hype, MWF did, and trounced Tabac for comfort, closeness, cushion and how my face felt with no aftershave with 3 consecutive shaves (every other day shaving).  </li>

            <li> For best results try skipping the bowl/scuttle and just face-lather.</li>

            <li> Smells great though.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li> Great soap.</li>
            <li> could go on and on for hours about how great this stuff is, if it weren&#x27;t shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Very Nice Lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels very nice on the skin</li>
            <li> Very nice scent...</li>
            <li> A very nice soap that lathers well and protects my face from burn.  </li>
            <li> lather has a pleasant scent and does a great job of lubricating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While the shave is great it still depends, somewhat, on good soap or cream, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I got one by Parker that fits it nicely) and you&#x27;ll be set!</li>
            <li> Among the best I&#x27;ve used, very good shaving soap, scent is nice, not too strong, very very nice lather.</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be pleasant and conspicuous.</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done and the fragrance is mildly pleasant but it will never be my \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> Easy to lather and the best soap out there...period.</li>
            <li> The box that it comes in is very cool!!</li>
            <li> Very good quality shaving soap, use bottle water to make a better foam and protective barrier on your face .</li>
            <li> Good lather and my skin feels moist after using it.</li>
            <li> Good product,</li>
            <li> problems for me getting a good lather from my cup to my face...</li>
            <li> It may be a good product, but not for this guy......</li>
            <li> Good performance.</li>
            <li> Well ... get a good badger hair brush</li>
            <li> And the lather is good too.</li>
            <li> and it is good to go.  </li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> but this is a good value.  </li>
            <li> Awesome, non drying, lightly scented, manly soap.</li>
            <li> If you want to see a good video review online, I recommend googling \\&quot;Mantic,  Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap.\\</li>
            <li> A perfect fit.</li>
            <li> (really loved that one too).</li>
            <li> In fact, if you can get a good lather out of Williams shaving soap (and yes, it can be done), then lathering with Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is a snap by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels good knowing that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my face</li>
            <li> The soap has a soapy scent which some people like or don&#x27;t like, but it smells good to me.</li>
            <li> you donâ€™t need to be an expert barber to work a good</li>
            <li> I did a bit of research and a lot of &amp;#34;experienced&amp;#34; shavers really loved this stuff.  </li>
            <li> my husband learned how to use this soap in a online forum and has loved it ever since.</li>
            <li> Good, good, good.</li>
            <li> He was excited to try it and has since told me it is one of the best shaving soaps he has ever used.</li>
            <li> Very rich lather and good amount of slickness!  </li>
            <li> if you are allergic to wool then dont play with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: feels great, nice light smell, real nice non slip shave</li>
            <li> Lather works up quickly and perfect every time.  </li>
            <li> Lovely soap, bought it for my husband, he likes shaving more now and he smells great!</li>
            <li> &quot; This gentlemen provides great tips on how to get the most out of this shaving soap.</li>
            <li> For good reason-its primary ingredient &#x27;tallow&#x27; is the basis of great shaving soaps worldwide.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that builds to an awesome lather without a lot of fuss.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> my husbands favorite shaving soap!</li>
            <li> and I have amazing results with my shaving.</li>
            <li> Great lather, smooth feel.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> MWF is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Amazing even..  </li>
            <li> lather, when you get it to work, is great and smooth.</li>
            <li> That said, I wish everything I bought online was this amazing.</li>
            <li> I soaked it in WARM water and took my boar brush to start to lather it up.  </li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t stop me from making a really nice lather with this.</li>
            <li> I soak the puck in warm water while I take a shower, so let&#x27;s say 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That may be a nice routine for some people including myself, yet if I&#x27;m in a rush, forget it.  </li>
            <li> Lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> find Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat to be a nice soap.</li>
            <li> this setup the razor does glide nicely.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and they really liked it.</li>
            <li> but since I own some I will be putting this to the test.</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used wool fat shaving soap for years and what I like about it is how nice it leaves my skin for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> It takes more work than is like to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend looking at Sharpologist instructions on the best way to lather this stuff it can be trickier from what I have experienced and read.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this shaving soap for a good lather and smooth silky platform to shave on!  </li>
            <li> Those artisan soaps often come in a variety of delightful fragrances, but I don&#x27;t care that much about fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent</li>
            <li> This is nice soap.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> good texture and smooth application, as well as good scent.  </li>
            <li> All I do is soak the brush in warm water, squeeze some water out and twirl it on the soap for 15-20 seconds.</li>
            <li> and I could use a nice scent while I shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the smell and lathers good.</li>
            <li> The slickness makes for a great shave, and the scent of the soap is clean and nice.</li>
            <li> I use hot water and a boar brush, and I get great lather and a very enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, smooth ...</li>
            <li> Shave is smooth and scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Even if you think the scent is strong, it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger like Tobac does, but provides as good of a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find Mitchell&#x27;s very easy to lather.</li>
            <li> Very light scent, but the lather is amazing, as is the feel of your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> The lather develops quickly and richly - making shaving very pleasant indeed.</li>
            <li> I still think the Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood is a winner for one of the best scents</li>
            <li> Not heavy on the fragrance, just a great lathering soap, and that&#x27;s all that it needs to be!</li>
            <li> I had read many reviews at a shaving forum and liked what I heard</li>
            <li> After hearing many times of &amp;#34;the fat&amp;#34; I decided to buy my own puck of Mitchell&#x27;s and see what the fuss was about.</li>
            <li> so for the lather... when it first got this soap my fore arm was getting huge from trying to work a perfect lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked Cella&#x27;s lather better.  </li>
            <li> Makes a really good and lasting lather, good cushion, nice lubrication, and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> This pleasant smelling soap lathers very easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> Pleasant mild scent.</li>
            <li> It does also leave my face nice and smooth and lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with this product , I have normal skin ,  no problems , very good and nice shaving with it .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll create a luscious, moisturizing, delicious smelling lather that is like no other.</li>
            <li> Put all of this with some hot water and you&#x27;ve got yourself a great shave.....</li>
            <li> This is very comfortable shaving soap.</li>
            <li> leaves face very smooth.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is mild but good.  </li>
            <li> There are easier to lather products but this really makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Because everyone is different and must find the best combination of razor, brush, soap and blades</li>
            <li> but I still think MWF is a better performer.</li>
            <li> However, when you combine a soap with a cream I believe the result is always better than either one by theirselves.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Now one of my favorite shaving soaps...makes the razor glide.</li>
            <li> soap is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> I do most of my shopping on Amazon and love my prime acct.</li>
            <li> /&gt;If shaving is more to you than just something you have to do, this soap will please.</li>
            <li> tried a number of soaps and creams from the cheapest (Williams) to the most costly (Fitjar).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OK with that.</li>
            <li> you like your face, you&#x27;ll love this soap.</li>
            <li> This is magic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I gave the MWF soap a shot.</li>
            <li> (if it is a downside) is that it smells like, well...soap, so if you&#x27;re expecting a fragrant bliss from your shaving soap to somehow magically blend with your aftershave and cologne</li>
            <li> This is soap is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re not allergic, a great shave and really softens the hair.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> but I find myself using this most of the time with the body soap also.</li>
            <li> it so smooth, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> Wish the scent was better</li>
            <li> but i love the feel.</li>
            <li> It whips up better with the boar than my Silvertip badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> You have to work to get a lather going, and a boar brush works better than a badger</li>
            <li> but I like boar better anyways.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just more for the money, so I&#x27;m OK with it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the perfect shaving soap or creme for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> Its an absolute joy to use.</li>
            <li> I used a cheese shredder and reduced the diameter, put the shredded soap in the mug, compressed it and then pressed the remaining soap in on top.</li>
            <li> It can take more water than some</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is nothing short of awesome.</li>
            <li> By that standard, this soap is among the very best out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In about 20 seconds, you have phenomenal lather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, it&#x27;s cheap!  </li>
            <li> Love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Some love it, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The only ones that even compares to it are the homemade soaps my wife made (100% organic and omg wonderful)</li>
            <li> This soap lathers easier and better than any soap I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It lathers ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Accordingly I have moved it up the top tier and displaced the Proraso cream.</li>
            <li> Its among my top 3 favorite shaving products.</li>
            <li> so most of the time the ambient temperature is close to body temperature which may help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has turned out to be one of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li> Love the logo.</li>
            <li> It really loads up great on the brush.</li>
            <li> definitely a favorite.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m sold, I had in mind to try a lot of different soaps to chose what works best for me</li>
            <li> I hope you love it like I did.</li>
            <li> love the lather I can get with this soap and any shaving brush</li>
            <li> Skin moisturization is superb and the only soap that beats it in that area is Provence Sante IMO.</li>
            <li> Supposedly, but there is no way to be sure.</li>
            <li> I use a synthetic brush mostly and face lather exclusively.</li>
            <li> It compares to the rest of my shaving stuff on top and I have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t belong to any cults(haha) but love this soap.</li>
            <li> and I stopped using the oil because this stuff alone was way better than any combination I had used</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and when you get the lather right, fantastic performance.  </li>
            <li> This is a Face-Lathering soap, and you may need to soak it in warm, but not hot, water while you soak your brush for the best results.</li>
            <li> Nice clean soap smell.</li>
            <li> No need for aftershaves or moisturizers, just a nice clean rinse.</li>
            <li> Regarding a description of the smell, it is a nice, clean soap smell that reminds me of Ivory soap.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a powdery linen clean smell.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was ok; but I just don&#x27;t get a good lather with my semouge 1800 boar brush.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, that is why it has been around so long.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty good price/use ratio.</li>
            <li> If it took you too long to get a perfect almost whipped cream lather, adjust your technique.</li>
            <li> So if you want a soap that feels great, smells manly, lathers well (with my new boar brush.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how many products and great pricing Amazon offers.</li>
            <li> Nice shaving soap, with a light to no scent, and smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li> This soap just awesome, better than Crab tree, I noticed from the very first time , the smell is light and soft somehow like baby powder , kinda.</li>
            <li> /&gt;TOBS, great smell, but not slick at all.</li>
            <li> and it left the face very clean and gave a very good shave.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth with a nice crisp smell.  </li>
            <li> Great on his sensitive skin with his safety razor.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the best wet shave soap I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate and just buy, you will enjoy and be glad you purchased.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, fresh soap smell.</li>
            <li> I still use), but out of &amp;#34;convenience&amp;#34; (really, a lack of good shaving products and knowhow)</li>
            <li> I received my order for Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap, watched and followed the advice of mantic59&#x27;s great YouTube tutorial on how to lather it properly, and subsequently gave myself the greatest, smoothest, most comfortable shave of my life.  </li>
            <li> TOBS Mr. Taylor is great for a classic yet clean scent that sticks with you.</li>
            <li> Very light clean scent which doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> It has a cult like following for a good reason!  </li>
            <li> I like the aroma, it&#x27;s very mild.</li>
            <li> Easy fix.. just work the foam on your face with the brush and it thickens up</li>
            <li> fragrance of this soap is very mild and neutral.</li>
            <li> easily-  </li>
            <li> Soap smells great and works like a charm,  second shaving soap and this one is much better.  </li>
            <li> Loaded my brush easily.  </li>
            <li> This soap is easy to lather and very mild on the skin...</li>
            <li> have found the soap easy to rinse off with no lingering film and leaves my face</li>
            <li> Lathers easily.</li>
            <li> It is a strong floral scent that just did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I like strong scents with my shave.</li>
            <li> make my face feel good after shaving, particularly in the winter.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem too strong of a scent to me either, but some people think it does based off of what I have read about it before I bought it.</li>
            <li> Wow this is amazing!</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a bar of dove soap, and I was not super impressed with the lather from it.</li>
            <li> some soaps its fine, others are not.</li>
            <li> Mild and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Clean for sure, but nothing to get excited about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They all worked but Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat seems as good as the best in performance and not nearly as costly as many other choices.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best performing shave soap that I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> the post-shave feel on your skin is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love how my face smells like fresh sheep, too.  </li>
            <li> Light scent.</li>
            <li> It makes all kinds of lather, like smudged on the ceiling and light fixtures amounts of lather.  </li>
            <li> Placed the soap in a KFC dish (where it fit well and was free to boot) and a about five twirls off the brush on the soap and rubbed the brush on the face.  </li>
            <li> Sort of a light laundry detergent smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great soap and will definitely be apart of my shave rotation.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t spring for the dish because I am cheap.  </li>
            <li> my skin feel amazing, and really helps reduce nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I use the available wool fat dish.  </li>
            <li> I have used everything from King of Shaves, Proraso, Cremo Creme, etc, and nothing has been as comfortable as the Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap.</li>
            <li> It will be smooth and moist and will feel awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> your water is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, for me this soap is among the best shaving soaps and creams I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> it becomes a fantastic soap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and does the trick</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin remarkably smooth after each shave.  </li>
            <li> I have to pair it with a lotion or shave oil to make for a comfortable shave experience.</li>
            <li> Smells relatively neutral, great product.</li>
            <li> I find the shave to be smooth, cushioned and close.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit in my shave mug</li>
            <li> so I microwaved it to fit.  </li>
            <li> Great for glide and closeness and absence of irritation.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant mild scent that is floral but still somehow masculine.</li>
            <li> Plus I enjoy the canister that my original order came in.</li>
            <li> Builds a nice lather with high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you take your time and learn how to create a good lather with it because it takes a little more work than some others.</li>
            <li> It treats your skin to a rich moisturizing experience like nothing else.</li>
            <li> but it was well worth the time!</li>
            <li> Well I decided to try this shave soap based on the reviews and I must say that I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and smells great.</li>
            <li> The full fat lanolin leaves my face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells great, light and subtle and the lather is amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes shaving easier, leaves his face feeling moisturized and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out, and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and manly like a lotion of sorts.</li>
            <li> The scent is simply clean.  </li>
            <li> Proraso was so much more satisfying in lather and for my skin, I cannot recommend this product and recommend anyone with sensitive skin to try Proraso.</li>
            <li> It is a good soap overall with a light scent.</li>
            <li> Certainly in the top quintile.</li>
            <li> I have hard water, seems to prefer the best badger vs. Silvertip for me.</li>
            <li> It lathers well even in my hard water and provides an excellent cushion for shaving.  </li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant scent, reminds me of the old time barber shops actually.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending more for a superior product, but I find this soap to be average.</li>
            <li> Definitely give this one the highest rating and good recommendation.  </li>
            <li> Tried this shave soap originally, nice lather, soft silky after feel, but wanted something with a nicer scent.</li>
            <li> but i love it so much i might have to take it</li>
            <li> By the time the sink was full...</li>
            <li> bloom into a full lather avalanche like TOBS</li>
            <li> For me, it gives a nice shave and leaves my skin baby soft for the day.    </li>
            <li> cool</li>
            <li> After that the soap maker changed the label to reflect the true ingredients.</li>
            <li> My observation is that not only does the lanolin soften up your skin nicely but it has helped brake in the boar bruch very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This stuff lather&#x27;s really thick and really fast, is really smooth, makes the razor glide better, washes off easily, and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I get a SUPER close shave with no nicks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 different Barrister and Mann soaps, Haslinger&#x27;s Ewe&#x27;s Milk, Imperial Barber, TOBS, Pre de Provence, Phoenix Artisan soaps, and many more.</li>
            <li> have found a few artisan soaps that lather as good, but none better.  </li>
            <li> I filled the mug with the soap with hot water.  </li>
            <li> He is very pleased overall.</li>
            <li> You rarely hear this product called by its full name.</li>
            <li> I may have a new favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out new shaving soaps, and this was the latest one after trying Tabac</li>
            <li> With the soft water where I live and a good badger brush, this soap works up quickly (10 seconds or so) into an obscene amount of creamy lather.  </li>
            <li> The soap also lubricates your face very well and makes shaving easy.  </li>
            <li> All what a shaving soap should be and the reason why you buy it in the first place!</li>
            <li> I shaved it down to fit into my shaving mug and it lathers nicely and leaves your face smooth.</li>
            <li> It does require more loading time with a super soft silvertip badger though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> But the soap itself does perfectly fit a rice bowl or large ramekin, in case you were wondering..</li>
            <li> I use different brushes and get very good lather with all of them except some types take a little more work.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is light, lathers very well.</li>
            <li> for the lathering, I put some warm water on top of the puck and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Found this brand several years ago and it is by far the best, thick lather good protection during the shaving process and in all that time I have never nicked myself ..</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money as it keeps me from getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> give this a solid 4 star ratting because this is, in my opinion, a really nice shaving soap</li>
            <li> they are too &#x27;old man&#x27;-ish for my tastes, even though they are a favorite with others.</li>
            <li> This also leaves the face feeling soft and healthy after the shave.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Out of all the soaps I&#x27;ve tried so far, I like this one the most.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite shave soap.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> the magic of MWF is the lanolin, a natural wax that the sheep exude to protect their wool...</li>
            <li> so far I love it.</li>
            <li> And it was worth my troubles...</li>
            <li> good product as described by wet shave enthusiasts.</li>
            <li> So far so good it was my first shave soap for the new adventures of DE shaving.</li>
            <li> this specific soap.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very light, reminds me baby powder or clean</li>
            <li> It has a simple, clean smell like fresh linen and is the most thoroughly hydrating shaving product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Rich and thick lather that leaves skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I have hard water where I live but still got a great lather out of it; however, it&#x27;s lather isn&#x27;t any better than</li>
            <li> They all said that you have to watch the YouTube videos to get the right technique for lathering.</li>
            <li> This one is right up there in terms of face glide and lubrication.</li>
            <li> This is a very softly scented, strongly foaming, skin protecting soap.  </li>
            <li> Soaking the puck for 10 minutes prior to shaving, then loading the brush upside down and face lathering seems to work the best with this soap.</li>
            <li> This means no allergic reactions and a fresh clean feeling - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> is truly amazing is how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Minimal amount of soap needed for a great lather and my face was left feeling really smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Incredibly thick, rich, comfortable lather with exceptional lubricity and glide, and afterwards my rather sensitive skin felt pleasantly moisturized and had (still has, a day later) absolutely zero irritation.</li>
            <li> I ordered a lavender scented soap at the same time because it didn&#x27;t contain parabens and was supposed to be gentle but, although I liked the aroma a lot, it was as if I had rubbed some Tabasco sauce on my face.</li>
            <li> The brush loads fairly quickly and lathers without much difficulty.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well, yet it does not &amp;#34;disolve&amp;#34; quickly.</li>
            <li> The lather is excellent and it only takes a few swirls for me to get sufficient lather to shave with.</li>
            <li> Like my friend Harlan once said: &amp;#34;You don&#x27;t always get what you pay for, but you never get MORE than you pay for.&amp;#34; I paid a bit more for some castile hand soap a few months ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Smells clean and mild (while in use - smell doesn&#x27;t linger)&lt;br /&gt;+Leaves your face soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> Few products out there these days live up to all the hype, but this incredible shave soap certainly does.  </li>
            <li> It is a very rich, thick lather that carries a bunch of moisture to your face which makes for a nice shave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And while this soap costs more than some alternatives (including the Van der Hagen soap available in drug stores everywhere for a tenth the price), it is in line with other premium products.  </li>
            <li> It took a little practice to learn to make a good lather with it</li>
            <li> The original Mitchell noticed that wool shearers&#x27; hands were always soft and supple, and thankfully decided to try a shaving product based in it.&lt;br /&gt;You will notice the lanolin effect right after your shave as you&#x27;re rinsing off your face.</li>
            <li> a first for me.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is not getting more than one of these.</li>
            <li> First let me say this; I use this soap with creams, and never alone.  </li>
            <li> I had no problems making more than enough lather.</li>
            <li> After most of the last 40 years bearded (just shaving my neck)</li>
            <li> Face feels all soft and smooth after every shave.</li>
            <li> I fill the sink with hot water...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different soaps and a few creams, most of which are good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of these people that soaks the puck either, I just heat it up in its dish, in a basin of hot water as I soak my brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this one will last me three months or more..</li>
            <li> pretty nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves the face feeling pretty moisturized after a scrape.</li>
            <li> big thing to remember is that just like Williams and Tabac, this is a hard-milled, tallow-based soap, and unlike the glycerin-based soaps of Van Der Hagen or Colonel Conk, a tallow soap needs to be used with lots of water, and the hotter you can get that water, the better the lather and cushion</li>
            <li> The only reason why it got 4 stars is because I&#x27;m more of a shaving cream type of guy rather than a soap puck.  </li>
            <li> scent is a great old school smell that reminds me of an old English cottage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lather is stellar and provides a lot of comfort.  </li>
            <li> For that reason alone, this soap will not become a &#x27;casual&#x27; shaver&#x27;s best choice.  </li>
            <li> Lathers even with hard water, smells like an old barber shop (not to strong, just a nice light fragrance you would expect from shaving creams).</li>
            <li> Many other products have certain aspects that I enjoy, but</li>
            <li> Much slicker and more comfortable than the other brands that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is a very effective soap that will last a long time, the downside is it takes time to prep/load the puck.  </li>
            <li> I read shaving forums that said to use warm water not hot, to load lots of soap on the brush and to face lather instead of using a bowl.</li>
            <li> Still though, nice to mix things up and add this to your unique arsenal of hard shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> As far as the scent goes, it is just kind of a classic soapy smell that is rather mild and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger very long</li>
            <li> Worth giving it a shot based on other more positive reviews.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never get much out of it no matter how hot</li>
            <li> Bought this at the recommendation of many online forums for it&#x27;s newb-friendly lather, and will probably stick with it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> the slick side, good blade glide.</li>
            <li> I have to say after trying many different brands from many different companies this by far</li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;Super Badger Brush\\&quot; which doesn&#x27;t make near the lather that the stiffer, boar bristle brush makes during lathering.</li>
            <li> it is warm water (he has the dish that comes with it from a previous purchase) before lathering up.</li>
            <li> a good long lasting lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved opening it up and smelling the very masculine, subtle clean aroma of the soap.</li>
            <li> Certainly adequate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps the greatest characteristic of this soap (at least boasted by the brand) is that it is made using wool fat, which has lanolin.</li>
            <li> I do have to work hard to get a good lather.  </li>
            <li> Huge cake of soap, will probably last 6 months.</li>
            <li> The bar is huge and should last 4 years, not kidding.</li>
            <li> Many wet shavers swear by this soap for a reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find a much easier soap that doesn&#x27;t need coaxing.</li>
            <li> I feel like these soaps really depend on the person, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;would enjoy daily.</li>
            <li> story short, quit being cheap.</li>
            <li> soap provides the comfort and the lubrication to get a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Others</li>
            <li> So really you&#x27;ll save money and give the skin on your face luxurious care.</li>
            <li> The lather holds up through a three pass shave and works well when using a straight razor or a double-edge.</li>
            <li> really like the scent, and the feel of my skin after</li>
            <li> , I much prefer the heavier woodsy smells for my soaps.</li>
            <li> Almost too much.  </li>
            <li> I used a bit too much water.  </li>
            <li> The added benefit is that it seems to be very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> My wife REALLY likes the scent a lot, too, so it&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> I rinse my brush and then swirl the dripping wet brush on top of the soap.  </li>
            <li> Wet and repeat for more water if needed.</li>
            <li> MWF doesn&#x27;t have much of any fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It really has no scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other products I&#x27;ve used: Col Conk Bay Rum - primary shave soap since I went back to DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> One shake of the brush and then work the puck gently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a cheap $2-3 individual sized lidded souffle bowl from the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the whole week.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for this shave soap.</li>
            <li> I will warn that the MO for this product is very polarized.  </li>
            <li> really does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;smoothes</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ready when I comes out.</li>
            <li> Love it.), and especially if your skin is on the sensitive side, this might be for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews about Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap, so I had to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> I recently got around to trying this soap (I have so many that I rotate with) and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat shaving soaps have been around for a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to see why.</li>
            <li> By protects, we mean sticks to your skin with a nice slippery texture that allows your razor to glide right over.</li>
            <li> I have one other one that I want to try, but I think I found a favorite.</li>
            <li> This soap produces a rich lather and I never need to reload my brush for subsequent passes.</li>
            <li> soap takes a few minutes of work to get a suitable lather, but I&#x27;m not in a hurry when getting ready to lay a straight razor against my throat.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> One puck of this soap lasts me several months, so it&#x27;s pretty economical compared to canned shaving creams or gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days now, with an EJ DB89 and Polisilver Super iridium blades, and its a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not a glycerin based soap, there is a little glycerin in the ingredients - it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a large amount, so if you really like glycerin, get some vegetable glycerin on Amazon and sprinkle it on top of the soap or add it to your pre-shave.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I don&#x27;t really notice any huge difference in moisturizing, but I don&#x27;t have really dry skin either.</li>
            <li> Fair, not good for my face.</li>
            <li> The history behind the product is quite remarkable and is reflected in the quality of this&lt;br /&gt;product. BONUS SUPRISE:</li>
            <li> I was surprised as this was my first time with a soap; have used creams or croaps before.</li>
            <li> After that the soap is properly hydrated and will work very well with whatever brush you use in your daily routine, just be sure to dump out the water before you lather</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is better and less reactive to my skin than Proraso Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li> Lathers much more than previous shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The main thing I&#x27;m looking for in a shave soap is protection from the razor blade.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the smell is decent.</li>
            <li> This is a classic.</li>
            <li> A classic shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> Soak the puck and your brush in warm to hot water (hard or soft), take shower, and dump out water from soap.</li>
            <li> Highly recommeded.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Knowing the softening effect lanolin has on skin, I had high hopes ordering this soap and was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s stir, add a little water, stir, more water, repeat until you get the lather you want.  </li>
            <li> it another try with a little more patience.</li>
            <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;After using this puppy for a little while I have come to master it and love it.</li>
            <li> It is as easy to lather as any other soap and easier than some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that water hardness and temp can make a difference with this stuff, but as I have decidedly soft water here in the city, I can&#x27;t really comment on that.  </li>
            <li> While I did apply moisturizer cream after shaving (its a normal part of my routine)</li>
            <li> It should be noted that I have normal water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks before deciding if it&#x27;ll have a permanent place in my rotation but</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t any harsh chemicals in the constitution of what is much more than a soap.</li>
            <li> I have found after a few days that a stiffer bristle brush works better.  </li>
            <li> Swish your hot water filled brush a few times over the soap and start applying it to your face.</li>
            <li> Normally it takes me about a minute or two.</li>
            <li> Cella has that thick lather that kind of cakes on to your razor.</li>
            <li> I live in an area that has naturally soft water, Denver Colorado, so it lathers really well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If I try a shave soap that leaves me feeling less than fully protected, adding a few swirls of MWF assures a great shave.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a rather coarse beard, and this has helped tremendously with irritation and closeness.  </li>
            <li> To sum up, if you have gentle or easily irritated skin and aren&#x27;t looking for a heavily scented product, this is the grail of soaps for you.  </li>
            <li> Its just right for me and has a different feel than the rest.</li>
            <li> But once you get the lather right, with enough water, it is eaaasy on the face.  </li>
            <li> I took it and actually practiced with it till I got it right.</li>
            <li> I originally rated ita 4 but now after careful consideration I must admit that it deserves a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try a new soap.</li>
            <li> In shaving circles it&#x27;s known simply as &amp;#34;MWF&amp;#34; and may be the most widely used product in shavingdom.</li>
            <li> It went from being my least favorite to being one of my absolute favorites.</li>
            <li> With all that out the way I believe this is the BEST shaving soap I have used so far...I started with Williams soap (cheap but difficult to get a good lather) and also the blades grim smolder soap (easy to lather but burns slightly too much)...</li>
            <li> (Perfector makes a nice one), watch the youtube video on how to lather Wool Fat - and you&#x27;ll have no trouble building up a thick layer of lather</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually take very much soap to get all the lather you need.</li>
            <li> I know the water is very soft here</li>
            <li> claim there is something about the natural oils found in the wool that make it super slick, and that&#x27;s very evident when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hot water, regular amount on my brush</li>
            <li> In order to fit it in my shaving mug, I shredded the soap with a cheese grater, put all the chips into to the mug, and pressed down.  </li>
            <li> Also, the clean smell won&#x27;t interfere with any aftershave or cologne you put on like some of the other scented soaps out there.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get a 5 because the scent is pretty flat</li>
            <li> I used to think I had sensitive skin until I married someone with actual sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> A true English shave soap that brings back the old time feeling of your shave.</li>
            <li> If you have hard water, make sure that you use distilled or bottled water with this</li>
            <li> I bought the refill only because it would fit perfectly in an empty shaving cream container I had.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find any problems with the soap as far a lathering.  </li>
            <li> I know, it is a soap, but wow, the scent just seems so...</li>
            <li> I came around to daily shaving with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves the skin feeling well nourished and protects well with my daily straight</li>
            <li> Also leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> so far I think its a yes.</li>
            <li> My face is still soft the day after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Kinda loud ..</li>
            <li> Want to see it in action?  </li>
            <li> I have no trouble lathering this soap</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for cartridge systems in my early twenties.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my beat up old drugstore boar brush which is now probly 15 years old and a silvertip badger brush..</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t push it too far</li>
            <li> For me the real test of a shaving soap is if it provides enough cushion to allow me to get a close shave 5 mornings in a row without irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to hit my 40&#x27;s and getting conscious about the wrinkles that are going to soon develop.  </li>
            <li> I read through a bunch of soap recommendations on a shaving blog and this one seemed to be the most commonly recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I call an old school type scent of days gone by</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Arko only wins on cost, and while MWF scent lingers some, it is not like tabac or TOBS where i can expect to smell it 8-16 hours later.</li>
            <li> The lanolin in this soap gives a great post shave feel to your skin that I have not experienced with any other soap.</li>
            <li> It is a bit tougher to get a decent lather compared to the soft cream I last used.</li>
            <li> I rarely use anything other than a moisturizer after shaving.</li>
            <li> Anyone lucky to have facial hair growing in different directions and can only shave with the grain</li>
            <li> When it comes to soaps Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is the only one I have used over the past 3 years that I truly love.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit much and not very masculine IMHO.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a shave soap I</li>
            <li> Very little odor, which as a healthcare pro, is important.</li>
            <li> Growing up on Williams soap and favoring Van der Hagen as a drugstore standby these days, I notice one soap generally lasts me a month (some less than that), but aside from the simply larger size of Mitchells (4.4 oz to 2.5 oz for standard mug size soaps), you just get more bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li> It gives a slick feel to the skin and a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I lather before showering; after showering, and usually a second time while shaving, and my brush is full of lather when I finish and my single puck will last for maybe 300 shaves??</li>
            <li> The smell is clean,simple and mild enough to not overpower other treatments (aftershave/cologne)&lt;br</li>
            <li> big secret to getting great lather when I use this soap-or any other tallow soap-is to fill the bowl</li>
            <li> As it turns out I live only 20 miles from West Coast Shaving.  </li>
            <li> While I was there I picked up a bunch of different blades, a new boar brush and Mitchells wool fat shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> and this left me feeling soft!</li>
            <li> Lightly scented, just enough to make your shave one of life&#x27;s little luxuries, and not enough to irritate my ridiculously sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works really well providing a slick smooth lather for your razor to carve through with minimal resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it is a little too large to fit in the bottom of a typical Old Spice shaving mug, so I found a bigger shaving mug.  </li>
            <li> Razorock has similar soaps available for a third less.</li>
            <li> In fact after having wet it and let it dry a few dozen times, there is no discernible scent of any kind.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but always shaved with a razor and over the years have used different brands of mug soap.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do the job, and will probably last longer than a soft cream.</li>
            <li> so apparently I&#x27;m one of those people that has difficulty lathering it up correctly.</li>
            <li> Like a perfumed old lady or a French whore.</li>
            <li> I found this soap to be much easier than expected to lather.  </li>
            <li> use this with my Shaveology Phantom razor and I can barely even feel the razor working ...</li>
            <li> , I would recommend this soap to anyone interested in wet shaving, it performs well and the old-fashioned looking packaging actually makes for a neat decorative item if you&#x27;re going for a Victorian Era look.</li>
            <li> I now regret not getting the ceramic container it comes in, it looks cool, I now just use a small pyrex.</li>
            <li> Lather then starts building as soon as I put the brush on my face just adding a little water for the right</li>
            <li> One last point, as other reviewers have pointed out, this soap does not have a strong scent, its just very subtle and clean.</li>
            <li> I really learned to shave properly about a year and a half ago and bought a Merkur and an Edwin Jagger double edge along with a couple of straight razors.</li>
            <li> , this soap makes yor face so slick that shaving is a breeze, especially in those places near your neck where its a little more sensitive and you need to go with a lighter touch.  </li>
            <li> Normally in the colder months my face will dry out after shaving and become itchy.  </li>
            <li> It has tallow so it is super slick and cushiony allowing for a maximum of comfort and protection of the blade.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap - it is a little difficult to start the lather</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other soaps and really like the Razo Rock but</li>
            <li> I found it much easier to lather than other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest for those who like fragrance in their shave soap to just put MWF in a covered container and sprinkle in a little of their favorite cologne a few times and keep it covered</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have a rich thick lather like the &amp;#34;art of shaving&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gifted with tough facial hair and skin that doesn&#x27;t get along with shaving.</li>
            <li> the past I would change up the soap vs cream combinations frequently, but since the first time I used Mitchell&#x27;s I&#x27;ve never used another</li>
            <li> will not dry out or burn skin even if on face for awhile.</li>
            <li> soap cake was a bit larger than my shaving mug, requiring that I shave down the edges to fit and knead the flakes back in with a little warm water, but my mug runs a little on the small side.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> The resulting lather is very thick and slick, providing good &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; for the razor blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I am fairly new to wet shaving and I use a late 1940&#x27;s Gillette super speed razor with feather blades and a badger brush...</li>
            <li> you have dry or sensitive skin, I would recommend looking for a review written by someone who also has dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Super thick lather.</li>
            <li> The price is high but do not be dissuaded because the puck is larger than any other I have seen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least half a dozen different soaps and creams, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Its large diameter does not fit my shaving mug.</li>
            <li> Too much water, too little water</li>
            <li> : a little expensive but should last you about six months; takes experience to get a good lather, your skin might not react well to lanolin&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried to date (granted not THAT many yet) but noticeably TABAC just failed to live up to the hype, MWF did, and trounced Tabac for comfort, closeness, cushion and how my face felt with no aftershave with 3 consecutive shaves (every other day shaving).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other shaving soaps from various online shaving shops, with mixed success.  </li>
            <li> If you wet your brush, turn it over and let all the water drip out that you can,then you apply brush to soap and be patient and determined you will get the thick rich cream that will do the trick.</li>
            <li> mainly has a soap aroma with little fragrance.</li>
            <li> little on the high side.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars as I feel the cost is a little high, and also because I was expecting an easier time to create a lather.</li>
            <li> This soap takes a lot of water to thin out (which seems to be a common characteristic of good shave soaps).</li>
            <li> Some say this soap is hard to lather, but first time using it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in with boiling hot water until it&#x27;s about 1/2inch over the soap and let it soak for at least 5 minutes before lathering.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave with a straight razor, and when I am in a rush I use a saftey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a long lasting scent and it smells of florals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks like this soap will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> people have compared the scent to Williams, and it definitely has a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent, but it&#x27;s not nearly as &amp;#</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last so long but</li>
            <li> this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty thick as well.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, I have a feeling this puck is going to last a VERY long time!</li>
            <li> Since I started shaving right, some time ago, I got an EJ-89 which I use when I&#x27;m feeling raw, and an old type open comb gillette (which, for the moment at least, I favor for its closeness-</li>
            <li> Well, everything I tried with a nicer scent didn&#x27;t lather as well, and left my skin feeling dry ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but doesn&#x27;t obviously stand out above less expensive soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> After 25+ years of cartridge razors and the accompanying razor burn, irritation, ingrown hairs and breakouts, I finally gave up and switched to DE wet shaving about a year ago, and after a little experimentation and working natural, \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; products like this into my morning regimen, I have finally said good-bye to 99% of my skin problems.</li>
            <li> and I think if anyone sticks with traditional wet shaving for long enough they will end up with a puck eventually.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have shea butter in it, so I sometimes keep an open puck of shea butter shave soap in a shave dish next to MWF and occasionally reach down with my brush and lather from both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When prepared properly it produces a very slick lather that protects the skin very well.</li>
            <li> it seemed impossible to get it right the first time.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers up very well for me, even though I have hard water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this stuff for a long time because of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> That may be a long time from now as this soap lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34; would be that the pick was a bit thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li> but if your water is significantly harder, you may have different results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving with a safety razor for over ten years.</li>
            <li> I can now understand it&#x27;s \\&quot;cult-like\\&quot; following in the wet shaving community.  </li>
            <li> There is a reason it&#x27;s been around so long because it works.</li>
            <li> You can find it at half the price from UK or Irish vendors and shipping is the same price.</li>
            <li> Lathers well, is very slick and my only complaint would be its light scent</li>
            <li> Definitely my benchmark soap I use to compare all other soaps.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use other soaps, but once you have taken this soap for a drive there is no going back.</li>
            <li> I usually let the soap soften in a little hot water in the bowl while I shower</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to soak it or my brush very long.</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap does not lather well in hard (high mineral content) water.</li>
            <li> Seems to lubricate and doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry after you rinse off.</li>
            <li> That seemed to dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Using this soap my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out and doesn&#x27;t itch.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> A new boar brush must be broken in which takes a couple of weeks because the tips of the bristles seem too firm and rather sharp when it&#x27;s first used.  </li>
            <li> Also, a single bar of this lasts me 4 - 5 months of almost every day shaving.</li>
            <li> A single puck lasts me for 3 or 4 months, depending on how often I&#x27;m shaving.  </li>
            <li> Above average skin feel post shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same bar to wash my hands several times a day for at least two months and it looks just about the same size.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m curious to see how long this cake lasts me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next one will be cut down to size and not nuked.  </li>
            <li> I would say the slight extra cost is offset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> No particular fragrance.</li>
            <li> It actually lathered up faster than my previous brand.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but a puck will last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> It looks expensive but the value is tremendous.</li>
            <li> but this caused a reaction that caused very dry skin below my ears and on my ear lobes.</li>
            <li> I will revisit this review based on how long the cake lasts, other reviews I&#x27;ve read state Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap lasts for some time</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t that bad and the lack of strong scent may actually be preferable to some people.</li>
            <li> Or rather the lather comes up quick but is very thin.</li>
            <li> Like other hard-milled soaps, it will last ten times longer than ordinary soaps, including &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I will not say that this is great and that over there is terrible.  </li>
            <li> At the rate I use it, almost daily, the one puck will last at least a year.</li>
            <li> but you do have to work a bit longer if your water is on the harder side as is mine.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Using a wet badger brush..</li>
            <li> I was really going to wait until I had exhausted mine to write this review</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a hint of something but not much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for the last few months</li>
            <li> All wet shavers should one of these in their den.</li>
            <li> I switched to wet shaving with shaving soap at the beginning of the year and have tried three or four other shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Good value for money - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Worth the price up front....ends up less expensive that buying cans.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find all the problems that other people talk about.</li>
            <li> will continue to try other soaps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to try it with some other blades too...</li>
            <li> I do prefer it to other scents like bay rum and sandalwood...</li>
            <li> Beats every other shave soap/cream</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have nothing but rave reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> Not really sure why you can only find shave foam in pressure cans in the stores.</li>
            <li> Lathers into what I consider to be a finer lather than other soaps and</li>
            <li> This has replaced all of my other shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of MWF (or any other shave soap), keep it in a covered container between uses.  </li>
            <li> and now it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Lanolin is a wax secreted by sheep (and I guess other &amp;#34;woolly&amp;#34; animals) that helps protect the animals skin and wool from the environment and is often added to soaps (among other things) as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Even though the company boasts the qualities of lanolin, there are other ingredients that may be a problem for you (maybe even the lanolin itself).</li>
            <li> I watched a couple and have been trying this now for the past several weeks.</li>
            <li> I must have tried close to 40 different soaps, creams and sticks from the most expensive to the not so expensive.</li>
            <li> One other tip I found after you apply the cream to the face let it sit for about 20-30 seconds before you apply your razor.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t add any water to the soap or prepare it in any other way.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of other soaps but they just didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few shaving soaps/creams that don&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have gentle to oily skin and stiff, tough neck hairs.  </li>
            <li> I jammed the shavings down the sides with a spoon and now the puck is one with the bowl with no water running down the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strong smell which isn&#x27;t unpleasant, it&#x27;s a clean smell - no issues with lather</li>
            <li> There are reviewers that say it can be hard to get a later.</li>
            <li> Average lather (I know how to lather).</li>
            <li> Average scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  was uncomfortable, no lubrication and very drying to the face and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely a soap everyone should try at least once because it just might change your view on shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a few years now, trying a variety of creams and soaps.  </li>
            <li> You either love it or hate it.  </li>
            <li> I had to shave it down a bit to get it into a bicentennial shaving mug.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> Having tried a few hard soaps and creams and also having heard that \\&quot;the fat\\&quot; has a cult-like following, I had to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not super extravagant though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In either case, the lather whips up in a minute or less with no complications.  </li>
            <li> Should take less than two minutes.  </li>
            <li> The previous soap came with a brush and cup.</li>
            <li> But the combination of the tough hairs and the gentleness of my skin leads to irritation on the neck when I am not careful.  </li>
            <li> After doing a little reading, I decided to try Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little over priced.</li>
            <li> and it can be obtained by any brush and a little care and attention but this soap excels with a boar hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li> so I got the cheese grater out and took a little off the bottom.</li>
            <li> Even though it was a little pricey</li>
            <li> It seems that the end product you want is a little on the thick creamy side and not really a \\&quot;lather\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> A lot of people have trouble making lather from this soap</li>
            <li> just gave it a few circles and literally it started foaming up.. and out of the cup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DESR for about 5 months and this is the easiest lathering soap compared to a few others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are a few tricks to using this soap.</li>
            <li> but unless you want to spend a few days making soap buy this one.</li>
            <li> No matter what I tried it seemed to either be too foamy and thin or not enough water to generate a lather.</li>
            <li> American soaps aren&#x27;t regulated and they can put whatever caustic or toxic substances they want in them and even make up the ingredients.</li>
            <li> people have trouble lathering this soap</li>
            <li> There are a few videos in youtube that will help you lather with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen all the other reviews about having a hard time making lather, etc.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;MWF can be tough to lather, but after a few tries and watching a few videos online you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> But the scent is pretty bad ..</li>
            <li> and it felt very tight after shaving.</li>
            <li> I have a little hard water (calcium forms from time to time).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some say it&#x27;s a little hard to lather</li>
            <li> We have moderately hard water in my city and I&#x27;ve never had trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slick and luxurious.</li>
            <li> The water is slick.</li>
            <li> Extremely slick.</li>
            <li> It delivers a foamy slick surface that my razor just glides over.</li>
            <li> Very few shave soaps leave your skin feeling like &#x27;the fat&#x27;.</li>
            <li> must have for all serious trad wet shavers!!!  </li>
            <li> and I have heard that the soap does not respond well to hard water.</li>
            <li> I do have hard water but with a softener...</li>
            <li> It is hard to get all lathery, though.</li>
            <li> I do have hard well water, but we have a softener.&lt;br</li>
            <li> too was worried about some of the reviews.. saying the soap is hard and all the difficulties.  </li>
            <li> Before I purchased this I had heard that it was hard to lather.</li>
            <li> I have hard water</li>
            <li> I use distilled water cause my water is hard</li>
            <li> If I had one complaint it would be the scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is where Mitchell&#x27;s really loses me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen shave soaps, maybe two dozen.  </li>
            <li> While the soap does provide a thick lather, what is not mentioned is the scent of the soap.  </li>
            <li> Very slick lather.</li>
            <li> I end up with a very uncomfortable shave and the occasional nick.</li>
            <li> Probably not a mug though, unless it were seriously oversized..</li>
            <li> Part of my shaving routine and economical when compared to the nasty foam can garbage.</li>
            <li> One might be put off by the price which may seem hefty for a newcomer to the wetshaving game, eager to start saving money (previously lost on walking the cartridge treadmill) andreticent to buy apparently expensive luxury shaving soaps, but aside from being a quality product, It lasts for a quite a while.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very hard soap, so it lasts.  </li>
            <li> does for me but isn&#x27;t too thin either.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thin and whispy when it goes on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the soap to be a bit thin.</li>
            <li> But beware of false economies.</li>
            <li> As an added note, buying items made by slave-labor is a false economy.</li>
            <li> If you have bought some and are a little frustrated with making it work, just give it some time.</li>
            <li> It is not as difficult to lather as some say it is</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not expensive when you factor in the longevity of the puck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Ill be using this from now on suspect.</li>
            <li> and I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for a cake of soap.</li>
            <li> I would give it 4 1/2 stars, and not 5, if I could because of the difficult lathering.&lt;br /&gt;FURTHER</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong buying it.</li>
            <li> but it is merely operator error.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, requiring a word count to rate a product is entirely silly and demeans the process.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and without that cushion and glide</li>
            <li> I thought it would be tempermental to work with, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad at all.</li>
            <li> It also had a really bad lather.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Ocitane (bought from retail store) - hated it, produced tons of lather but never held up and</li>
            <li> and I got a horrible rash.</li>
            <li> I did all these things and got terrible lather.</li>
            <li> I would use this stuff to wash my hands, terrible as&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pleasant scent, smooth ...</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shaving soaps I have used. This is my daily go to soap.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but always shaved with a razor and over the years have used different brands of mug soap.  Found this brand several years ago and it is by far the best, thick lather good protection during the shaving process and in all that time I have never nicked myself .. a first for me.  Definitely give this one the highest rating and good recommendation.  Also, a single bar of this lasts me 4 - 5 months of almost every day shaving.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, that is why it has been around so long. It is my daily shaving cream. It takes some practice to get a great lather from it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a few years now, trying a variety of creams and soaps.  After reading reviews, I bought a puck of Mitchell&#x27;s a while back.  I&#x27;m finally on my second.  This is a very softly scented, strongly foaming, skin protecting soap.  It&#x27;s not a cream or a lotion, but I find that it provides excellent protection in my shaving routine.  A single puck lasts me for 3 or 4 months, depending on how often I&#x27;m shaving.  This is the soap I&#x27;ll be sticking with.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap - it is a little difficult to start the lather but once going it is a great shaving soap and the post-shave feel on your skin is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Excelent shaving soap . I used the Crab Tree Evelin - Nomad , they dont make that Nomad anymore and had to look for some different . This soap just awesome, better than Crab tree, I noticed from the very first time , the smell is light and soft somehow like baby powder , kinda. Overall very happy with this product , I have normal skin ,  no problems , very good and nice shaving with it . Highly recommeded.</li>
            <li> There are easier to lather products but this really makes your skin feel great. Pleasant mild scent. I have hard water, seems to prefer the best badger vs. Silvertip for me.</li>
            <li> As it turns out I live only 20 miles from West Coast Shaving.  I called them and said I would drop in.  While I was there I picked up a bunch of different blades, a new boar brush and Mitchells wool fat shaving soap.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this stuff for a long time because of the reviews.  The price varies depending on where you purchase it.  I bought the refill only because it would fit perfectly in an empty shaving cream container I had.  Next time I will buy it in the ceramic bowl.  That may be a long time from now as this soap lasts forever.  Because everyone is different and must find the best combination of razor, brush, soap and blades I will not say that this is great and that over there is terrible.  But I will make an observation.  A new boar brush must be broken in which takes a couple of weeks because the tips of the bristles seem too firm and rather sharp when it&#x27;s first used.  My observation is that not only does the lanolin soften up your skin nicely but it has helped brake in the boar bruch very quickly.  The lanolin seems to soften up the brush just like it softens up your beard.  This only took about three shaves and my boar brush is perfect.  I read all the reviews and saw the videos on this soap.  I didn&#x27;t find any problems with the soap as far a lathering.  I soaked it in WARM water and took my boar brush to start to lather it up.  No problem.  I didn&#x27;t find all the problems that other people talk about. This might be the results of the water hardness rather than the soap itself.</li>
            <li> This is just fantastic. I loved opening it up and smelling the very masculine, subtle clean aroma of the soap. There are reviewers that say it can be hard to get a later. I don&#x27;t find that to be a problem at all. I work some into my Parker silver tip badger hair brush and then get a lather up in a bowl. My only regret is not getting more than one of these. At the rate I use it, almost daily, the one puck will last at least a year. That&#x27;s pretty good price/use ratio. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other soaps and really like the Razo Rock but the Mitchell&#x27;s will outlast all of the others. Also, the clean smell won&#x27;t interfere with any aftershave or cologne you put on like some of the other scented soaps out there.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best shaving soaps you&#x27;ll ever find. It is not as difficult to lather as some say it is but you do have to work a bit longer if your water is on the harder side as is mine. But that doesn&#x27;t stop me from making a really nice lather with this. I prefer to use a boar brush with soaps but badger works well too. When prepared properly it produces a very slick lather that protects the skin very well. I think one of the best qualities of this soap, however, is the feel of your skin after your shave. The lanolin in this soap gives a great post shave feel to your skin that I have not experienced with any other soap. As far as the scent goes, it is just kind of a classic soapy smell that is rather mild and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger very long but it is very pleasant. I still think the Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood is a winner for one of the best scents but I still think MWF is a better performer. Many wet shavers swear by this soap for a reason. It is just one of the finest soaps you&#x27;ll find anywhere.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap in all aspects!</li>
            <li> Tried this shave soap originally, nice lather, soft silky after feel, but wanted something with a nicer scent. Well, everything I tried with a nicer scent didn&#x27;t lather as well, and left my skin feeling dry ... so, Back to Michells Wool Fat!</li>
            <li> First let me say this; I use this soap with creams, and never alone.  I&#x27;ve never been a fan of shaving with any soaps alone. However, when you combine a soap with a cream I believe the result is always better than either one by theirselves.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I would change up the soap vs cream combinations frequently, but since the first time I used Mitchell&#x27;s I&#x27;ve never used another soap.&lt;br /&gt;They claim there is something about the natural oils found in the wool that make it super slick, and that&#x27;s very evident when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have even used it with creams that I thought gave a horrible shave, but had an awesome smell and it made them better.&lt;br /&gt;For example;&lt;br /&gt;TOBS, great smell, but not slick at all. Razor burn and cuts  every time I used it before. Mix it with Mitchell&#x27;s, and just like that. Best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> You rarely hear this product called by its full name. In shaving circles it&#x27;s known simply as &amp;#34;MWF&amp;#34; and may be the most widely used product in shavingdom. For good reason-its primary ingredient &#x27;tallow&#x27; is the basis of great shaving soaps worldwide. It has a nice, fresh soap smell. It treats your skin to a rich moisturizing experience like nothing else. If I try a shave soap that leaves me feeling less than fully protected, adding a few swirls of MWF assures a great shave.</li>
            <li> this smells so good to me! i got this for my husband but i love it so much i might have to take it lol! i have very sensitive skin and this left me feeling soft! with no balm!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that protects quite well.  By protects, we mean sticks to your skin with a nice slippery texture that allows your razor to glide right over. To me, it smells like a dairy product, similar to milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is a very effective soap that will last a long time, the downside is it takes time to prep/load the puck.  For that reason alone, I will deduct a mark.  I soak the puck in warm water while I take a shower, so let&#x27;s say 3 minutes. Then it takes upwards of a minute to load the brush, while the soap in your dish is turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That may be a nice routine for some people including myself, yet if I&#x27;m in a rush, forget it.  I&#x27;ll find a much easier soap that doesn&#x27;t need coaxing. For that reason alone, this soap will not become a &#x27;casual&#x27; shaver&#x27;s best choice.  Still though, nice to mix things up and add this to your unique arsenal of hard shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> Great DE shaving soap, would recommend to anyone.  Fragrance is light, lathers very well.</li>
            <li> Nice clean soap smell. Very slick lather.</li>
            <li> When I switched to a safety razor a year ago, I was using the soap from target.  After doing a little reading, I decided to try Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat.  I love it.  I use hot water and a boar brush, and I get great lather and a very enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li> Among the best I&#x27;ve used, very good shaving soap, scent is nice, not too strong, very very nice lather.</li>
            <li> Best shaving soap on the market</li>
            <li> Now one of my favorite shaving soaps...makes the razor glide.</li>
            <li> Slick and luxurious. I don&#x27;t understand people saying it has no scent? I found the scent to be pleasant and conspicuous. It isn&#x27;t a long lasting scent and it smells of florals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I had to shave it down a bit to get it into a bicentennial shaving mug. Good lather and my skin feels moist after using it.</li>
            <li> Average lather (I know how to lather). Average scent. Above average skin feel post shave. Still prefer WSP Rustic Shave Soap.</li>
            <li> Best soap because it is Wool Fat. You will love it.</li>
            <li> Some say this soap is hard to lather, but first time using it I had no problems making more than enough lather. It cushions great, and helps give a close non-irritating shave. If I had one complaint it would be the scent. Just overly soap-like to me. I know, it is a soap, but wow, the scent just seems so...cleaning product like. Almost wish it had no smell at all. I prefer scents like sandalwood or bay rum. Still, it is a great soap that I will use again.</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely. Definitely worth the money as it keeps me from getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son for Christmas. He was excited to try it and has since told me it is one of the best shaving soaps he has ever used. I am amazed at how many products and great pricing Amazon offers. I do most of my shopping on Amazon and love my prime acct. Since my kids are all over the U.S. it makes shopping and shipping a dream.</li>
            <li> Very Nice Lather.&lt;br /&gt;If shaving is more to you than just something you have to do, this soap will please.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but doesn&#x27;t obviously stand out above less expensive soaps I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t mind spending more for a superior product, but I find this soap to be average.</li>
            <li> After most of the last 40 years bearded (just shaving my neck) I came around to daily shaving with a straight razor.  While the shave is great it still depends, somewhat, on good soap or cream, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a number of soaps and creams from the cheapest (Williams) to the most costly (Fitjar).  They all worked but Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat seems as good as the best in performance and not nearly as costly as many other choices.  I rate it &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy lathering&lt;br /&gt;excellent glide&lt;br /&gt;value:performance&lt;br /&gt;staying moist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like soap.  I&#x27;m OK with that.</li>
            <li> Fair, not good for my face. I feel like these soaps really depend on the person, so the review reflects my experience. It reminds me of a bar of dove soap, and I was not super impressed with the lather from it. Worth giving it a shot based on other more positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Simple,effective,delightful. I searched high and low for a shave soap I&lt;br /&gt;would enjoy daily. Many other products have certain aspects that I enjoy, but&lt;br /&gt;nothing has everything all in one like this product. All 5 senses are appeased with this&lt;br /&gt;product. The smell is clean,simple and mild enough to not overpower other treatments (aftershave/cologne)&lt;br /&gt;It leaves the skin feeling well nourished and protects well with my daily straight shave.&lt;br /&gt;The lather is unparalleled, it does not disipate as it sits on the face. Works best with badger brushes.&lt;br /&gt;What is truly amazing is how long it lasts. I have been using for 6 months and it still looks brand&lt;br /&gt;new. The history behind the product is quite remarkable and is reflected in the quality of this&lt;br /&gt;product. BONUS SUPRISE: The box that it comes in is very cool!! I keep it in my shave den as extra storage&lt;br /&gt;for blades, styptic stick,etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, quit being cheap. It looks expensive but the value is tremendous. I wish I had another&lt;br /&gt;hand for a 3rd thumbs up..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers-</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best shave soaps out there.  I have been wet shaving for about 2 years.  This soap lathers up very well for me, even though I have hard water.  Shave is smooth and scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I switched to wet shaving with shaving soap at the beginning of the year and have tried three or four other shaving soaps. I would have to say this is one of the best soaps I have found. I live in an area that has naturally soft water, Denver Colorado, so it lathers really well.&lt;br /&gt;This soap provides the comfort and the lubrication to get a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Others that I have tried have been D Harris, Col Conks, Geo Thumper, and Edwin Jagger. GFT and DH are probably the same soap works the same, CC only lasts me about 3-4 weeks. EJ needs a lot of water to create a lather.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to try other soaps but I believe that MWF will be my #1 go to soap!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Lightly scented, just enough to make your shave one of life&#x27;s little luxuries, and not enough to irritate my ridiculously sensitive skin. I ordered a lavender scented soap at the same time because it didn&#x27;t contain parabens and was supposed to be gentle but, although I liked the aroma a lot, it was as if I had rubbed some Tabasco sauce on my face. Not their fault. That&#x27;s just me. So if you want a soap that feels great, smells manly, lathers well (with my new boar brush. Yes, boar. Love it.), and especially if your skin is on the sensitive side, this might be for you.</li>
            <li> Makes a really good and lasting lather, good cushion, nice lubrication, and smells pleasant. Also leaves skin soft. I get burning reactions to some shave soaps, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Wow this is amazing! I found it much easier to lather than other soaps I&#x27;ve tried. It feels very nice on the skin and I have amazing results with my shaving. I get a SUPER close shave with no nicks and I swear this stuff makes my skin feel the best it ever has. It doesn&#x27;t actually take very much soap to get all the lather you need. So really you&#x27;ll save money and give the skin on your face luxurious care. If you want to beat up your face than this is not the shave soap for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like your face, you&#x27;ll love this soap.</li>
            <li> Good product, but it&#x27;s a little over priced.</li>
            <li> Great lather, smooth feel. I may have a new favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It is a bit tougher to get a decent lather compared to the soft cream I last used. It seems to do the job, and will probably last longer than a soft cream.</li>
            <li> I really learned to shave properly about a year and a half ago and bought a Merkur and an Edwin Jagger double edge along with a couple of straight razors. I also started to collect shaving soaps and creams one of which was this one. I realize that almost everything to do with likes and dislikes when it comes to do with shaving is very individual so my opinions may not resonate with yours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat to be a nice soap. It took a little practice to learn to make a good lather with it but it was well worth the time! The lather holds up through a three pass shave and works well when using a straight razor or a double-edge. I am also impressed with the way this stuff lasts! The puck I am using seems to keep on going so I would say the slight extra cost is offset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes a good long lasting lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lubricates the face well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not expensive when you factor in the longevity of the puck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None that I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimbo&#x27;s rating system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of making a lather ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lubricating quality ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the lather hold up ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap to lather ratio *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bang for the buck *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? Yup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this a solid 4 star ratting because this is, in my opinion, a really nice shaving soap and I would not hesitate to buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Minimal amount of soap needed for a great lather and my face was left feeling really smooth and moisturized. While I did apply moisturizer cream after shaving (its a normal part of my routine) it was sill noticeably softer. It should be noted that I have normal water and I have heard that the soap does not respond well to hard water.</li>
            <li> so apparently I&#x27;m one of those people that has difficulty lathering it up correctly. I do have hard water but with a softener...some soaps its fine, others are not. i definitely have to work for this one! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days now, with an EJ DB89 and Polisilver Super iridium blades, and its a nice shave. I&#x27;ll have to try it with some other blades too...I occasionally swap between Astra and Feathers as well.&lt;br /&gt;Using this setup the razor does glide nicely. I&#x27;m mixed on the scent however... its soapy, which I don&#x27;t mind, but tends to linger longer than I like. I do prefer it to other scents like bay rum and sandalwood... they are too &#x27;old man&#x27;-ish for my tastes, even though they are a favorite with others. If you&#x27;re used to those and not a soapy/clean scent, this might not be to your liking. Lastly, I have a feeling this puck is going to last a VERY long time! I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks before deciding if it&#x27;ll have a permanent place in my rotation but so far I think its a yes.</li>
            <li> Great shave soap. Not heavy on the fragrance, just a great lathering soap, and that&#x27;s all that it needs to be!</li>
            <li> Truly great soap. Very light scent, but the lather is amazing, as is the feel of your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is magic.  My face is still soft the day after shaving.  I love how my face smells like fresh sheep, too.  It is hard to get all lathery, though.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few shaving soaps/creams that don&#x27;t dry out my skin. I find Mitchell&#x27;s very easy to lather. I don&#x27;t even need to soak it or my brush very long. The brush loads fairly quickly and lathers without much difficulty. The resulting lather is very thick and slick, providing good &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; for the razor blade. One puck of this soap lasts me several months, so it&#x27;s pretty economical compared to canned shaving creams or gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I gave the MWF soap a shot. I had read many reviews at a shaving forum and liked what I heard so I bought some.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the scent, and the feel of my skin after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;(No problems for me getting a good lather from my cup to my face... I use a synthetic brush &#x27;Omega\Men-U&#x27;)</li>
            <li> While the soap does provide a thick lather, what is not mentioned is the scent of the soap.  It is a strong floral scent that just did nothing for me.  I stopped using it because of its scent.  It may be a good product, but not for this guy......</li>
            <li> Good performance. Light scent. Face feels all soft and smooth after every shave. Definitely my benchmark soap I use to compare all other soaps.</li>
            <li> Lathers up great , and a very good shaving soap .. But the scent is pretty bad .. Kinda loud .. Like a perfumed old lady or a French whore.</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat shaving soaps have been around for a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to see why. This review is based on results using a safety razor. Soaking the puck for 10 minutes prior to shaving, then loading the brush upside down and face lathering seems to work the best with this soap. Lathering correctly with MWF soap causes the blade to effortlessly glide across the face, minimizing irritation. This also leaves the face feeling soft and healthy after the shave. I rarely use anything other than a moisturizer after shaving. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and they really liked it.</li>
            <li> Beats every other shave soap/cream I have tried to date (granted not THAT many yet) but noticeably TABAC just failed to live up to the hype, MWF did, and trounced Tabac for comfort, closeness, cushion and how my face felt with no aftershave with 3 consecutive shaves (every other day shaving).  Arko only wins on cost, and while MWF scent lingers some, it is not like tabac or TOBS where i can expect to smell it 8-16 hours later.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other shaving soaps from various online shaving shops, with mixed success.  This is the first one that builds to an awesome lather without a lot of fuss.  The only downside (if it is a downside) is that it smells like, well...soap, so if you&#x27;re expecting a fragrant bliss from your shaving soap to somehow magically blend with your aftershave and cologne you might have to re-calculate your olfactory procedures.</li>
            <li> This is soap is absolutely fantastic! It is by far the best performing shave soap that I have used thus far. My only &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34; would be that the pick was a bit thinner than I expected. Other than that, I have nothing but rave reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> One of the best shaving soaps in existence! Lathers well, is very slick and my only complaint would be its light scent, I much prefer the heavier woodsy smells for my soaps.</li>
            <li> Great lather and shave, but I learned I&#x27;m allergic to lanolin and I got a horrible rash. So if you&#x27;re not allergic, a great shave and really softens the hair.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap! It makes shaving easier, leaves his face feeling moisturized and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out, and it smells great too. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
            <li> A lot of people have trouble making lather from this soap but I think I have got the hang of it.  Am on my second refill and I love it.  Has a great smell and when you get the lather right, fantastic performance.  If you have hard water, make sure that you use distilled or bottled water with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This and Tabac are a must have for all serious trad wet shavers!!!  I wish that they had a matching After Shave!!!</li>
            <li> I doubt I am going to impart any wisdom about this soap that you haven&#x27;t already herd or read about.  It&#x27;s Mitchell&#x27;s after all.  It has a cult like following for a good reason!  Want to see it in action?  Look it up on youtube!  It&#x27;s so popular, people make videos about it!!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent... Mild and refreshing. It lathers very well, yet it does not &amp;#34;disolve&amp;#34; quickly. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> This product cleans and clears your skin without drying it out. It hasn&#x27;t any harsh chemicals in the constitution of what is much more than a soap. This means no allergic reactions and a fresh clean feeling - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have found the holy grail! The best shaving soap I have ever used, bar none.  Lather works up quickly and perfect every time.  Lubrication must be experienced to believe, simply incredible.  Fragrance is mild but good.  Huge cake of soap, will probably last 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shave soaps I&#x27;ve ever used.  It lathers well even in my hard water and provides an excellent cushion for shaving.  It leaves your face hydrated but not oily and improves the skin texture.</li>
            <li> Looks like this soap will last a long time. It just doesn&#x27;t have a rich thick lather like the &amp;#34;art of shaving&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It is better and less reactive to my skin than Proraso Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 different Barrister and Mann soaps, Haslinger&#x27;s Ewe&#x27;s Milk, Imperial Barber, TOBS, Pre de Provence, Phoenix Artisan soaps, and many more. The main thing I&#x27;m looking for in a shave soap is protection from the razor blade. I have a very tough beard and without that cushion and glide I end up with a very uncomfortable shave and the occasional nick. I like the aroma, it&#x27;s very mild. But that&#x27;s not my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lathering, I put some warm water on top of the puck and let it sit for a few minutes. I then pour that water out into my hand and rub it on my face. The water is slick. Then I lather up with no problem. I do have hard well water, but we have a softener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The post shave feel of your skin is just incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a reason why this soap has been around for over 100 years. No soap I&#x27;ve ever tried compares to cushion and glide I experience from MWF. It lasts forever by the way so you end up paying just pennies per shave. Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen all the other reviews about having a hard time making lather, etc.  I would assume the well water would be a problem.  I have a little hard water (calcium forms from time to time).&lt;br /&gt;I shave before I shower.. always have.&lt;br /&gt;As I fill the sink with hot water... I filled the mug with the soap with hot water.  By the time the sink was full... maybe 30 seconds later.. I poured the water out of the mug.  Using a wet badger brush.. just gave it a few circles and literally it started foaming up.. and out of the cup.  Almost too much.  Based on the appearance of the foam.. I used a bit too much water.  Easy fix.. just work the foam on your face with the brush and it thickens up perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too was worried about some of the reviews.. saying the soap is hard and all the difficulties.  I&#x27;ve been using DESR for about 5 months and this is the easiest lathering soap compared to a few others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I found this soap to be much easier than expected to lather.  I have found after a few days that a stiffer bristle brush works better.  It makes all kinds of lather, like smudged on the ceiling and light fixtures amounts of lather.  It is is slippery and the razor just glides.  The added benefit is that it seems to be very moisturizing.  The price is high but do not be dissuaded because the puck is larger than any other I have seen.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have soap from everywhere but I find myself using this most of the time with the body soap also. Its just right for me and has a different feel than the rest. Ill be using this from now on suspect.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving soap. No problems lathering. Extremely slick. Not really sure why you can only find shave foam in pressure cans in the stores.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I thought I would have to spend some time building the foam and I was wrong.  Placed the soap in a KFC dish (where it fit well and was free to boot) and a about five twirls off the brush on the soap and rubbed the brush on the face.  Started working it on the face and in about a minute had an excellent foam.  Off to shaving and it left the face very clean and gave a very good shave.  I was surprised as this was my first time with a soap; have used creams or croaps before.</li>
            <li> I keep MWF on hand,always! It delivers a foamy slick surface that my razor just glides over. It works well with any aftershave, there is not any conflict with the scents that I alternate using. Plus I enjoy the canister that my original order came in. Great shave soap.</li>
            <li> There are shaving creams and shaving soaps ... and then, there&#x27;s Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously ... if you&#x27;re shaving with a double edge razor and not shaving with this, you have no idea what you&#x27;re missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication is unmatched. And lather? Well ... get a good badger hair brush (Perfector makes a nice one), watch the youtube video on how to lather Wool Fat - and you&#x27;ll have no trouble building up a thick layer of lather FAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with my Shaveology Phantom razor and I can barely even feel the razor working ... it so smooth, it&#x27;s amazing. And I&#x27;m left with no razor burn whatsoever. Wool Fat is in a class of it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: buy the refill ... along with an apothecary shaving cup (I got one by Parker that fits it nicely) and you&#x27;ll be set!</li>
            <li> With the soft water where I live and a good badger brush, this soap works up quickly (10 seconds or so) into an obscene amount of creamy lather.  The lanolin coats your face to help the razor glide over your skin.  And while this soap costs more than some alternatives (including the Van der Hagen soap available in drug stores everywhere for a tenth the price), it is in line with other premium products.  It&#x27;s a favorite of mine.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Slickest I&#x27;ve tried. Wish the scent was better but i love the feel.</li>
            <li> After hearing many times of &amp;#34;the fat&amp;#34; I decided to buy my own puck of Mitchell&#x27;s and see what the fuss was about. It turned out to be a really great soap though not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t bloom into a full lather avalanche like TOBS does for me but isn&#x27;t too thin either. Certainly adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face Protection:&lt;br /&gt;On the slick side, good blade glide. Just for face protection alone this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;A little on the high side. Razorock has similar soaps available for a third less. I&#x27;m not sure that they preform to exactly the same level but since I own some I will be putting this to the test. Not super extravagant though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;This is where Mitchell&#x27;s really loses me. I like strong scents with my shave. TOBS Mr. Taylor is great for a classic yet clean scent that sticks with you. Mitchell&#x27;s smells like a bar of Ivory Soap. Clean for sure, but nothing to get excited about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give Mitchell&#x27;s 4.5 stars. It will give you a great shave. The price isn&#x27;t that bad and the lack of strong scent may actually be preferable to some people. If you haven&#x27;t tried it I suggest giving it a go.</li>
            <li> The legendary soap. MWF. Nuff said.  Best part is the conditioning after the shave. No need for aftershaves or moisturizers, just a nice clean rinse. Smell is pleasant as well. Sort of a light laundry detergent smell. No lingering with post shave scents.</li>
            <li> Great soap! I&#x27;ve have experimented on how to get the best lather with this soap and it can be obtained by any brush and a little care and attention but this soap excels with a boar hair shaving brush. It whips up better with the boar than my Silvertip badger brush.  It&#x27;s a great soap and will definitely be apart of my shave rotation.</li>
            <li> This is very comfortable shaving soap. Seems to lubricate and doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry after you rinse off. No particular fragrance.</li>
            <li> MWF is amazing stuff. Very few shave soaps leave your skin feeling like &#x27;the fat&#x27;. Some have had issues with lathering this soap in some types of water. My water is rated with hardness of 1.8 - 7.6 grains per gallon. I have no trouble lathering this soap but if your water is significantly harder, you may have different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of this soap is very mild and neutral. The scent is noticeable in the lather but does not persist post shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MWF will be a permanent part of my shave den and I think if anyone sticks with traditional wet shaving for long enough they will end up with a puck eventually.</li>
            <li> And the lather is good too. Out of all the soaps I&#x27;ve tried so far, I like this one the most.</li>
            <li> After having used this product for a month, I find myself hooked.  As YMMV when taking someone&#x27;s word on shave gear, I thought I might provide some background about me:  I have gentle to oily skin and stiff, tough neck hairs.  I used to think I had sensitive skin until I married someone with actual sensitive skin.  But the combination of the tough hairs and the gentleness of my skin leads to irritation on the neck when I am not careful.  I learned to shave with a gillette adjustable years ago(which I still use), but out of &amp;#34;convenience&amp;#34; (really, a lack of good shaving products and knowhow) I stopped using it for cartridge systems in my early twenties.  Since I started shaving right, some time ago, I got an EJ-89 which I use when I&#x27;m feeling raw, and an old type open comb gillette (which, for the moment at least, I favor for its closeness- I use personna lab blue blades or sharper in it).  I&#x27;ve tried a number of different soaps and a few creams, most of which are good.  Mitchell&#x27;s is excellent.  It has a simple, clean smell like fresh linen and is the most thoroughly hydrating shaving product I have ever used.  It lathers up easily-  I&#x27;ve used my beat up old drugstore boar brush which is now probly 15 years old and a silvertip badger brush.. In either case, the lather whips up in a minute or less with no complications.  I&#x27;m not one of these people that soaks the puck either, I just heat it up in its dish, in a basin of hot water as I soak my brush and it is good to go.  I&#x27;ve heard that water hardness and temp can make a difference with this stuff, but as I have decidedly soft water here in the city, I can&#x27;t really comment on that.  But once you get the lather right, with enough water, it is eaaasy on the face.  Amazing even..  I dreamt wetshaving was like this as a teenager..&lt;br /&gt;  One might be put off by the price which may seem hefty for a newcomer to the wetshaving game, eager to start saving money (previously lost on walking the cartridge treadmill) andreticent to buy apparently expensive luxury shaving soaps, but aside from being a quality product, It lasts for a quite a while.  I was really going to wait until I had exhausted mine to write this review but it&#x27;s been a month, and the puck looks basically the same size!  Growing up on Williams soap and favoring Van der Hagen as a drugstore standby these days, I notice one soap generally lasts me a month (some less than that), but aside from the simply larger size of Mitchells (4.4 oz to 2.5 oz for standard mug size soaps), you just get more bang for your buck.  I&#x27;m guessing this one will last me three months or more.. So at that rate, the price basically factors out altogether.&lt;br /&gt;  To sum up, if you have gentle or easily irritated skin and aren&#x27;t looking for a heavily scented product, this is the grail of soaps for you.  One word:  I wouldn&#x27;t spring for the dish because I am cheap.  You might not be.. But the soap itself does perfectly fit a rice bowl or large ramekin, in case you were wondering.. Probably not a mug though, unless it were seriously oversized..</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will continue to shave with this FOREVER!</li>
            <li> This pleasant smelling soap lathers very easily and quickly. It is the best shave soap I have found. Swish your hot water filled brush a few times over the soap and start applying it to your face. The lather develops quickly and richly - making shaving very pleasant indeed.</li>
            <li> One of the best shaving soaps out there. It has a pleasant mild scent that is floral but still somehow masculine. It is not the easiest to lather but when you get it dialed in you will have a great shave.</li>
            <li> two words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;scent is alright, but man great lather on my badger brush, and the glide this stuff has is pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;makes my skin feel amazing, and really helps reduce nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> One of the best saving soaps I&#x27;ve used.  Love it.  Lathers nicely. I use the available wool fat dish.  I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Well I decided to try this shave soap based on the reviews and I must say that I am not disappointed. It has a very pleasant scent, reminds me of the old time barber shops actually. It does also leave my face nice and smooth and lathers up nicely. It actually lathered up faster than my previous brand. That seemed to dry out my skin and it felt very tight after shaving. I will be using this soap for quite awhile. I have one other one that I want to try, but I think I found a favorite.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shaving soap.  Lasts a long time and smells great.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite shave soap.  Very light clean scent which doesn&#x27;t linger.  Lathers into what I consider to be a finer lather than other soaps and with my water I have no issues.  What I believe makes this a distinctly different product is the oils in the soap (lanolin) make my face feel good after shaving, particularly in the winter.  Normally in the colder months my face will dry out after shaving and become itchy.  Using this soap my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out and doesn&#x27;t itch.</li>
            <li> Nice shaving soap, with a light to no scent, and smooth on my face.  Am about to the end of this cake in my mug.  I do have to work hard to get a good lather.  But would be reordering this MWF if I didn&#x27;t already have a second shaving mug already with some Edwin Jagger sandalwood in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will be reordering the Edward Jagger, or this MWF, in about a year or so.  Will get the EJ if it lathers easier for me.  Otherwise if they are tied, this MWF it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars as I feel the cost is a little high, and also because I was expecting an easier time to create a lather.</li>
            <li> Soap smells great and works like a charm,  second shaving soap and this one is much better.  I will buy again</li>
            <li> The scent is reminiscent of a stroll through the forest in springtime, I can almost hear wildlife noise while shaving.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  I&#x27;ve tried at least half a dozen different soaps and creams, and this is my favorite.  Builds a nice lather with high quality ingredients.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Love it.</li>
            <li> One of the best shave soaps on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews about Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap, so I had to at least give it a try. It is definitely worth the money. It is a very rich, thick lather that carries a bunch of moisture to your face which makes for a nice shave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the wood Kingsley Shave Soap Bowl and the Mitchell&#x27;s fits in it perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used wool fat shaving soap for years and what I like about it is how nice it leaves my skin for the rest of the day.  You have to work to get a lather going, and a boar brush works better than a badger but I like boar better anyways.  So it&#x27;s stir, add a little water, stir, more water, repeat until you get the lather you want.  I sometimes find wool fat shaving soap for a cheaper price than Mitchel&#x27;s but this is a good value.  However, it is a little too large to fit in the bottom of a typical Old Spice shaving mug, so I found a bigger shaving mug.  Maybe it&#x27;s just more for the money, so I&#x27;m OK with it.  Some people are allergic to wool fat (lanolin), so beware.  It&#x27;s also a very hard soap, so it lasts.  For me, it gives a nice shave and leaves my skin baby soft for the day.    Waddie</li>
            <li> Awesome, non drying, lightly scented, manly soap. I love this stuff. This has replaced all of my other shaving soaps. I have tried to use other soaps, but once you have taken this soap for a drive there is no going back.</li>
            <li> It takes more work than is like to get a good lather. Once you do, its great. the smell is decent.</li>
            <li> The best shaving soap I have ever used. Hands down. I have been wet shaving with a safety razor for over ten years. I have been searching for the perfect shaving soap or creme for the same amount of time. I have used everything from King of Shaves, Proraso, Cremo Creme, etc, and nothing has been as comfortable as the Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap. Its an absolute joy to use. There are a few tricks to using this soap. If you want to see a good video review online, I recommend googling \\&quot;Mantic,  Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap.\\&quot; This gentlemen provides great tips on how to get the most out of this shaving soap. For instance, for the best lather, you should use a \\&quot;Boar Bristle Brush\\&quot; which is stiffer than a badger brush. I have a \\&quot;Super Badger Brush\\&quot; which doesn&#x27;t make near the lather that the stiffer, boar bristle brush makes during lathering. One last point, as other reviewers have pointed out, this soap does not have a strong scent, its just very subtle and clean. That was a plus for me. If you are looking for something with a stronger scent you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanerhagen soap with no complaints. I just wanted to try a new soap. I like the scent, it lathers well and the razor glides over my skin. Its large diameter does not fit my shaving mug. I used a cheese shredder and reduced the diameter, put the shredded soap in the mug, compressed it and then pressed the remaining soap in on top. 3-17-17 Still using the same one. I don&#x27;t shave every day, 4-5 times a week. Probably 2-3 months left.</li>
            <li> So far so good it was my first shave soap for the new adventures of DE shaving. It smells clean and manly like a lotion of sorts. Leaves the face feeling pretty moisturized after a scrape. I would definitely recommend looking at Sharpologist instructions on the best way to lather this stuff it can be trickier from what I have experienced and read. It can take more water than some but I wouldn&#x27;t push it too far or it wont reach maximum slickness. I now regret not getting the ceramic container it comes in, it looks cool, I now just use a small pyrex.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this shaving soap for a good lather and smooth silky platform to shave on!  Last a long time.</li>
            <li> I recently got around to trying this soap (I have so many that I rotate with) and was pleasantly surprised.  Regarding a description of the smell, it is a nice, clean soap smell that reminds me of Ivory soap.  The lather is excellent and it only takes a few swirls for me to get sufficient lather to shave with. The soap also lubricates your face very well and makes shaving easy.  In order to fit it in my shaving mug, I shredded the soap with a cheese grater, put all the chips into to the mug, and pressed down.  A perfect fit.</li>
            <li> This is a classic. Having tried a few hard soaps and creams and also having heard that \\&quot;the fat\\&quot; has a cult-like following, I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nothing short of awesome. Kind of a powdery linen clean smell. And it&#x27;s a pervasive smell too, that will carry with you after your shave.&lt;br /&gt;But the magic of MWF is the lanolin, a natural wax that the sheep exude to protect their wool... The original Mitchell noticed that wool shearers&#x27; hands were always soft and supple, and thankfully decided to try a shaving product based in it.&lt;br /&gt;You will notice the lanolin effect right after your shave as you&#x27;re rinsing off your face. It will be smooth and moist and will feel awesome.&lt;br /&gt;MWF can be tough to lather, but after a few tries and watching a few videos online you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. For best results try skipping the bowl/scuttle and just face-lather. It&#x27;ll create a luscious, moisturizing, delicious smelling lather that is like no other.</li>
            <li> Very good quality shaving soap, use bottle water to make a better foam and protective barrier on your face .</li>
            <li> For me the real test of a shaving soap is if it provides enough cushion to allow me to get a close shave 5 mornings in a row without irritation.  By that standard, this soap is among the very best out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one word of warning.  Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap does not lather well in hard (high mineral content) water. So if your water comes from a well, you may as well not use it. You&#x27;ll never get much out of it no matter how hot your water is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, for me this soap is among the best shaving soaps and creams I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> Lovely soap, bought it for my husband, he likes shaving more now and he smells great!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband.  Great on his sensitive skin with his safety razor.  Does have some scent but that hasn&#x27;t irritated his skin which is often bothered by fragrance.  Very good value.  Lathers well and allows for a close shave.  He is very pleased overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out new shaving soaps, and this was the latest one after trying Tabac (really loved that one too). From all of the reviews I&#x27;ve seen here I thought it would be tempermental to work with, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad at all. In fact, if you can get a good lather out of Williams shaving soap (and yes, it can be done), then lathering with Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is a snap by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big thing to remember is that just like Williams and Tabac, this is a hard-milled, tallow-based soap, and unlike the glycerin-based soaps of Van Der Hagen or Colonel Conk, a tallow soap needs to be used with lots of water, and the hotter you can get that water, the better the lather and cushion will be.&lt;br /&gt;The big secret to getting great lather when I use this soap-or any other tallow soap-is to fill the bowl it&#x27;s in with boiling hot water until it&#x27;s about 1/2inch over the soap and let it soak for at least 5 minutes before lathering.  After that the soap is properly hydrated and will work very well with whatever brush you use in your daily routine, just be sure to dump out the water before you lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have compared the scent to Williams, and it definitely has a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent, but it&#x27;s not nearly as &amp;#34;cleaning product-y&amp;#34; to my nose. My wife REALLY likes the scent a lot, too, so it&#x27;s a winner in my book. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Like other hard-milled soaps, it will last ten times longer than ordinary soaps, including &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; shaving soap. Plus it smells great, light and subtle and the lather is amazing. Like my friend Harlan once said: &amp;#34;You don&#x27;t always get what you pay for, but you never get MORE than you pay for.&amp;#34; I paid a bit more for some castile hand soap a few months ago. I&#x27;ve been using the same bar to wash my hands several times a day for at least two months and it looks just about the same size. Sometimes money buys quality AND economy. Sometimes it just tells the world that you&#x27;re a snob. But beware of false economies. As an added note, buying items made by slave-labor is a false economy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen shave soaps, maybe two dozen.  MWF is my go-to, standard. I leave it in a shave bowl in a drawer.  I rinse my brush and then swirl the dripping wet brush on top of the soap.  In about 20 seconds, you have phenomenal lather.  Wet and repeat for more water if needed. Lather around your face further as needed.  I often do this, then take a shower and repeat the lathering when I get out of the shower, and then shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found a few artisan soaps that lather as good, but none better.  Those artisan soaps often come in a variety of delightful fragrances, but I don&#x27;t care that much about fragrance.  MWF doesn&#x27;t have much of any fragrance.  In fact after having wet it and let it dry a few dozen times, there is no discernible scent of any kind.  If you like the smell of MWF (or any other shave soap), keep it in a covered container between uses.  I&#x27;d suggest for those who like fragrance in their shave soap to just put MWF in a covered container and sprinkle in a little of their favorite cologne a few times and keep it covered and you&#x27;ll have a $40 artisanal shave soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ingredients.  It&#x27;s tallow based which I prefer.  There&#x27;s lanolin in it which I like.  Although it&#x27;s not a glycerin based soap, there is a little glycerin in the ingredients - it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a large amount, so if you really like glycerin, get some vegetable glycerin on Amazon and sprinkle it on top of the soap or add it to your pre-shave.  It doesn&#x27;t have shea butter in it, so I sometimes keep an open puck of shea butter shave soap in a shave dish next to MWF and occasionally reach down with my brush and lather from both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some reviews that say that it doesn&#x27;t lather all that well in &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; water.  We have moderately hard water in my city and I&#x27;ve never had trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it&#x27;s cheap!  I lather before showering; after showering, and usually a second time while shaving, and my brush is full of lather when I finish and my single puck will last for maybe 300 shaves?? so maybe 4 cents a shave??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> Smells great. A coupleof tablespoons of water on a damp brush to shave my entire face. Very little odor, which as a healthcare pro, is important. The full fat lanolin leaves my face smooth and clean. Blends with a pea sise dollop of cream for the best of both worlds. Worth the price up front....ends up less expensive that buying cans.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  I shaved it down to fit into my shaving mug and it lathers nicely and leaves your face smooth.</li>
            <li> Good, good, good. I use this almost every day and it works great. Just make sure you take your time and learn how to create a good lather with it because it takes a little more work than some others.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this I had heard that it was hard to lather. I read shaving forums that said to use warm water not hot, to load lots of soap on the brush and to face lather instead of using a bowl. I did all these things and got terrible lather. So I did just the opposite. Hot water, regular amount on my brush and I lathered using a bowl and now it works extremely well. Super thick lather. It went from being my least favorite to being one of my absolute favorites. If you have bought some and are a little frustrated with making it work, just give it some time. Once you figure out the best way to make it work for you it becomes a fantastic soap.</li>
            <li> Loaded my brush easily.  Lathers well.  Nice scent</li>
            <li> A very nice soap that lathers well and protects my face from burn.  Part of my shaving routine and economical when compared to the nasty foam can garbage.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it lived up to the hype. I have hard water where I live but still got a great lather out of it; however, it&#x27;s lather isn&#x27;t any better than any mama bears soaps  I have. It really has no scent, there&#x27;s a hint of something but not much.</li>
            <li> Great shave. Lasts a longtime!</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times so far, but WOW so far I love it. I&#x27;m gifted with tough facial hair and skin that doesn&#x27;t get along with shaving. Anyone lucky to have facial hair growing in different directions and can only shave with the grain understand this.&lt;br /&gt;Strong smell which isn&#x27;t unpleasant, it&#x27;s a clean smell - no issues with lather but I have a water softener.&lt;br /&gt;Each time I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve been impressed with the ease of the shave, and the lack of razor rash. I will revisit this review based on how long the cake lasts, other reviews I&#x27;ve read state Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap lasts for some time so I&#x27;m curious to see how long this cake lasts me.&lt;br /&gt;Other products I&#x27;ve used: Col Conk Bay Rum - primary shave soap since I went back to DE safety razor. Doesn&#x27;t last so long but i&lt;br /&gt;  it&#x27;s cheap and does the trick&lt;br /&gt;  L&#x27;Ocitane (bought from retail store) - hated it, produced tons of lather but never held up and the shave&lt;br /&gt;  was uncomfortable, no lubrication and very drying to the face and&lt;br /&gt;  I have oily skin. I would use this stuff to wash my hands, terrible as&lt;br /&gt;  a shaving soap for me. Some love it, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin remarkably smooth after each shave.  Love it! Feels good knowing that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my face and instead I&#x27;m putting on something that keeps my face moist. I&#x27;m about to hit my 40&#x27;s and getting conscious about the wrinkles that are going to soon develop.  This is nice soap.</li>
            <li> Rich and thick lather that leaves skin feeling great. A true English shave soap that brings back the old time feeling of your shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for the last few months and I love it. This soap produces a rich lather and I never need to reload my brush for subsequent passes. This soap takes a lot of water to thin out (which seems to be a common characteristic of good shave soaps). The soap has a soapy scent which some people like or don&#x27;t like, but it smells good to me. It doesn&#x27;t seem too strong of a scent to me either, but some people think it does based off of what I have read about it before I bought it. Even if you think the scent is strong, it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger like Tobac does, but provides as good of a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the greatest characteristic of this soap (at least boasted by the brand) is that it is made using wool fat, which has lanolin. Lanolin is a wax secreted by sheep (and I guess other &amp;#34;woolly&amp;#34; animals) that helps protect the animals skin and wool from the environment and is often added to soaps (among other things) as a moisturizer. That being said, I don&#x27;t really notice any huge difference in moisturizing, but I don&#x27;t have really dry skin either. So, who knows? I can&#x27;t tell you whether or not it will help you with dryness, but it works well for me and may work well for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry or sensitive skin, I would recommend looking for a review written by someone who also has dry or sensitive skin. Even though the company boasts the qualities of lanolin, there are other ingredients that may be a problem for you (maybe even the lanolin itself).</li>
            <li> this is a great soap. infact the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried. The only ones that even compares to it are the homemade soaps my wife made (100% organic and omg wonderful) but unless you want to spend a few days making soap buy this one. if you are allergic to wool then dont play with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: feels great, nice light smell, real nice non slip shave, you get to say wool fat allot. i find this pairs well with a Feather blade in my DE razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: a little expensive but should last you about six months; takes experience to get a good lather, your skin might not react well to lanolin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so for the lather... when it first got this soap my fore arm was getting huge from trying to work a perfect lather. Hopefully it can save you some trial and error. You donâ€™t need to face lather. Soak the puck and your brush in warm to hot water (hard or soft), take shower, and dump out water from soap. One shake of the brush and then work the puck gently. Now transfer the froth into a separate bowl and work it until it peaks. Should take less than two minutes.  I do this with a silvertip brush no problem at all. you donâ€™t need to be an expert barber to work a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak the puck, drain the puck, and play with the amount of water and soap you use until you figure it out. If it took you too long to get a perfect almost whipped cream lather, adjust your technique.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers easier and better than any soap I&#x27;ve used.  I read through a bunch of soap recommendations on a shaving blog and this one seemed to be the most commonly recommended so I decided to give it a shot.  I have hard water so lathering soaps has always been a challenge but not with this soap.  Definitely a soap everyone should try at least once because it just might change your view on shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> A classic shaving soap.  Once the puck is &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; (softened up some with repeated use) it&#x27;s a great, no-nonsense soap.  The scent is simply clean.  Leaves the face feeling moisturized.  Not cheap, but a puck will last you a long time.  All wet shavers should one of these in their den.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for a cake of soap. It smells nice. It lathers ok. Or rather the lather comes up quick but is very thin. I have to pair it with a lotion or shave oil to make for a comfortable shave experience. I&#x27;ve shaved about 30 times with it and have been shaving with a brush and puck of soap for about 10 years so it&#x27;s not a technique issue. I kept experimenting w/ the amount of water on the brush while building the lather but it kept coming out thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only explain it this way; there&#x27;s a lot of volume to the lather but it&#x27;s thin and whispy when it goes on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked Cella&#x27;s lather better.  Cella has that thick lather that kind of cakes on to your razor.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best wet shave soap I have ever used.  It does have two flaws; the smell and the price.  Reminds me of talcum powder my grandma used to use.  Its a bit much and not very masculine IMHO.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I am fairly new to wet shaving and I use a late 1940&#x27;s Gillette super speed razor with feather blades and a badger brush...With all that out the way I believe this is the BEST shaving soap I have used so far...I started with Williams soap (cheap but difficult to get a good lather) and also the blades grim smolder soap (easy to lather but burns slightly too much)...This soap is easy to lather and very mild on the skin...Smells relatively neutral, great product.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I decided to add this to my rotation. It&#x27;s just ok. At first I thought it was ok; but I just don&#x27;t get a good lather with my semouge 1800 boar brush. I use distilled water cause my water is hard but the lather just thins out and dries up on my face. Really disappointed. Wanted to like this</li>
            <li> good texture and smooth application, as well as good scent.  i&#x27;d recommend this if you like having with soap based products</li>
            <li> Saw this puppy discussed a lot on various shaving sites. They all said that you have to watch the YouTube videos to get the right technique for lathering. I watched a couple and have been trying this now for the past several weeks. I must have tried close to 40 different soaps, creams and sticks from the most expensive to the not so expensive. This one is right up there in terms of face glide and lubrication.Certainly in the top quintile. Why 4 stars? I have tried every variation to get a lather but there is no getting around that this is the most difficult soap I have ever tried. Too much water, too little water it seemed impossible to get it right the first time. No matter what I tried it seemed to either be too foamy and thin or not enough water to generate a lather. It&#x27;s as if the gremlin in the soap puck was contrary enough to defeat whatever I tried until the 2nd or 3rd try.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom lime- With effort and persistence it gets the job done and the fragrance is mildly pleasant but it will never be my \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; product. I&#x27;ll stick with may favs: Kiss My Face, Cella and Proraso cream.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Gave it another try with a little more patience. It seems that the end product you want is a little on the thick creamy side and not really a \\&quot;lather\\&quot;. If you wet your brush, turn it over and let all the water drip out that you can,then you apply brush to soap and be patient and determined you will get the thick rich cream that will do the trick. One other tip I found after you apply the cream to the face let it sit for about 20-30 seconds before you apply your razor. You will then get the greatest glide you will experience. Accordingly I have moved it up the top tier and displaced the Proraso cream.I would give it 4 1/2 stars, and not 5, if I could because of the difficult lathering.&lt;br /&gt;FURTHER UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;After using this puppy for a little while I have come to master it and love it. Great for glide and closeness and absence of irritation. I originally rated ita 4 but now after careful consideration I must admit that it deserves a 5 star rating. Its among my top 3 favorite shaving products.</li>
            <li> The only reason why it got 4 stars is because I&#x27;m more of a shaving cream type of guy rather than a soap puck.  Other than that, this soap makes yor face so slick that shaving is a breeze, especially in those places near your neck where its a little more sensitive and you need to go with a lighter touch.  The slickness makes for a great shave, and the scent of the soap is clean and nice. Put all of this with some hot water and you&#x27;ve got yourself a great shave.....All what a shaving soap should be and the reason why you buy it in the first place!</li>
            <li> Impressive. Lathers much more than previous shaving soap. The previous soap came with a brush and cup. Don&#x27;t know the brand of the soap.</li>
            <li> Bought this at the recommendation of many online forums for it&#x27;s newb-friendly lather, and will probably stick with it for a long time to come. Lathers even with hard water, smells like an old barber shop (not to strong, just a nice light fragrance you would expect from shaving creams). This is a Face-Lathering soap, and you may need to soak it in warm, but not hot, water while you soak your brush for the best results. Thoroughly impressed. Lanolin may cause unwanted ingrown hairs for some, so keep an eye on your skin.</li>
            <li> Knowing the softening effect lanolin has on skin, I had high hopes ordering this soap and was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The soap takes a few minutes of work to get a suitable lather, but I&#x27;m not in a hurry when getting ready to lay a straight razor against my throat.&lt;br /&gt;The lather has a pleasant scent and does a great job of lubricating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have found the soap easy to rinse off with no lingering film and leaves my face supple.&lt;br /&gt;The soap cake was a bit larger than my shaving mug, requiring that I shave down the edges to fit and knead the flakes back in with a little warm water, but my mug runs a little on the small side.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this soap to anyone interested in wet shaving, it performs well and the old-fashioned looking packaging actually makes for a neat decorative item if you&#x27;re going for a Victorian Era look.</li>
            <li> Works really well providing a slick smooth lather for your razor to carve through with minimal resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it easiest to face lather. Normally it takes me about a minute or two. I know the water is very soft here and it&#x27;s also in the tropics so most of the time the ambient temperature is close to body temperature which may help. All I do is soak the brush in warm water, squeeze some water out and twirl it on the soap for 15-20 seconds. I don&#x27;t add any water to the soap or prepare it in any other way. Lather then starts building as soon as I put the brush on my face just adding a little water for the right consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a cheap $2-3 individual sized lidded souffle bowl from the supermarket. The puck was ever so slightly smaller so I got the cheese grater out and took a little off the bottom. I jammed the shavings down the sides with a spoon and now the puck is one with the bowl with no water running down the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Smells clean and mild (while in use - smell doesn&#x27;t linger)&lt;br /&gt;+Leaves your face soft and hydrated&lt;br /&gt;+Reduces irritation&lt;br /&gt;+Good value for money - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This soap gave me skin irritation on my neck and burned for hours. It also had a really bad lather. Please do not buy this soap. Proraso was so much more satisfying in lather and for my skin, I cannot recommend this product and recommend anyone with sensitive skin to try Proraso.</li>
            <li> After 25+ years of cartridge razors and the accompanying razor burn, irritation, ingrown hairs and breakouts, I finally gave up and switched to DE wet shaving about a year ago, and after a little experimentation and working natural, \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; products like this into my morning regimen, I have finally said good-bye to 99% of my skin problems. I received my order for Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap, watched and followed the advice of mantic59&#x27;s great YouTube tutorial on how to lather it properly, and subsequently gave myself the greatest, smoothest, most comfortable shave of my life.  Few products out there these days live up to all the hype, but this incredible shave soap certainly does.  I can now understand it&#x27;s \\&quot;cult-like\\&quot; following in the wet shaving community.  Incredibly thick, rich, comfortable lather with exceptional lubricity and glide, and afterwards my rather sensitive skin felt pleasantly moisturized and had (still has, a day later) absolutely zero irritation. This has earned permanent space on my bathroom sink&#x27;s countertop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to wet shaving. I find the soap to be a bit thin. It may just be that my lather skills are not up to speed. It is a good soap overall with a light scent.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complain about the difficulties of lathering this soap. I took it and actually practiced with it till I got it right. And it was worth my troubles... If you want to call playing around with soap troubles.&lt;br /&gt;This has turned out to be one of my favorite soaps. A great post shave with excellent glide and cushion. I use this soap atleast once a week.  Sometimes the whole week.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a great old school smell that reminds me of an old English cottage.&lt;br /&gt;Lanolin is an excellent skin moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got just the refill puck, but I&#x27;m getting the container next go around to go with it. Love the logo.</li>
            <li> My son gave this shaving soap to me for Fathers day.  I have to say after trying many different brands from many different companies this by far is the best.  It really loads up great on the brush. It goes on pretty thick as well.  It&#x27;s what I call an old school type scent of days gone by but I dig it.  There is a reason it&#x27;s been around so long because it works. It gives a slick feel to the skin and a smooth shave. A great product in my opinion. You can&#x27;t go wrong buying it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for this shave soap. I do have sensitive skin but this caused a reaction that caused very dry skin below my ears and on my ear lobes. Smells great though.</li>
            <li> leaves face very smooth. will not dry out or burn skin even if on face for awhile. mainly has a soap aroma with little fragrance. definitely a favorite.</li>
            <li> This is the second shave soap I have tried.  I did a bit of research and a lot of &amp;#34;experienced&amp;#34; shavers really loved this stuff.  Even though it was a little pricey I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  Well I&#x27;m sold, I had in mind to try a lot of different soaps to chose what works best for me but after the shave experience with MWF I&#x27;m not 100% I just don&#x27;t buy this in bulk.  Very smooth with a nice crisp smell.  Lather is stellar and provides a lot of comfort.  I will warn that the MO for this product is very polarized.  You either love it or hate it.  I hope you love it like I did.</li>
            <li> good product as described by wet shave enthusiasts. I&#x27;m set for a year. this will last a long time. cool</li>
            <li> Is Phat. Best shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;It really does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;smoothes out the shave and reduces irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase</li>
            <li> When it comes to soaps Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat is the only one I have used over the past 3 years that I truly love.  I have tried a number of other soaps but they just didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li> my husbands favorite shaving soap! my husband learned how to use this soap in a online forum and has loved it ever since. I think he soaks it is warm water (he has the dish that comes with it from a previous purchase) before lathering up. Will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a straight razor, and when I am in a rush I use a saftey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the lather I can get with this soap and any shaving brush I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the feel of the Wool Fat on my face both before, during, and after the shave.</li>
            <li> Very best shaving soap there is, and I&#x27;ve used dozens and have years of experience as well as belong to the shave forums. It has tallow so it is super slick and cushiony allowing for a maximum of comfort and protection of the blade. Skin moisturization is superb and the only soap that beats it in that area is Provence Sante IMO. Also since this soap is made in the EU it must comply with EU regulations on safety and labeling requirements. American soaps aren&#x27;t regulated and they can put whatever caustic or toxic substances they want in them and even make up the ingredients. A member of Badger and Blade proved How to Grow a Mustache (now renamed Phoenix Accoutrements) shaving soap made in USA, couldn&#x27;t possibly have the ingredients that it did. After that the soap maker changed the label to reflect the true ingredients. Supposedly, but there is no way to be sure. With any EU made soap you can be assured it is correctly labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have trouble lathering this soap but it is merely operator error. It is as easy to lather as any other soap and easier than some. I use a synthetic brush mostly and face lather exclusively. It does require more loading time with a super soft silvertip badger though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note on price- DO NOT buy this soap from American vendors if you don&#x27;t want to get ripped off. You can find it at half the price from UK or Irish vendors and shipping is the same price.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I would buy it again.  It compares to the rest of my shaving stuff on top and I have a lot of it.  MC</li>
            <li> on par with Trumpers. The bar is huge and should last 4 years, not kidding. Lathers easily.</li>
            <li> Very rich lather and good amount of slickness!  Much slicker and more comfortable than the other brands that I have tried.  I have sensitive skin and a rather coarse beard, and this has helped tremendously with irritation and closeness.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great soap. It doesn&#x27;t get a 5 because the scent is pretty flat and I could use a nice scent while I shave.&lt;br /&gt;Lathering takes a bit of time. Be patient and you will be rewarded. There are a few videos in youtube that will help you lather with this specific soap.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very light, reminds me baby powder or clean sheets.&lt;br /&gt;The lather, when you get it to work, is great and smooth. And your skins is protected during shaving and feels protected after shaving.</li>
            <li> Easy to lather and the best soap out there...period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read on some shaving blogs that MWF has like a cult following. I don&#x27;t belong to any cults(haha) but love this soap. Some say it&#x27;s a little hard to lather but DE shaving is all about patience and enjoyment. I usually let the soap soften in a little hot water in the bowl while I shower so it&#x27;s ready when I comes out. I use different brushes and get very good lather with all of them except some types take a little more work. I find the shave to be smooth, cushioned and close. Don&#x27;t hesitate and just buy, you will enjoy and be glad you purchased.</li>
            <li> Excellent lather.  Will purchase again.  Otherwise, requiring a word count to rate a product is entirely silly and demeans the process.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit in my shave mug so I microwaved it to fit.  DON&#x27;T MICROWAVE.  Next one will be cut down to size and not nuked.  Love the smell and lathers good.</li>
            <li> I tried everything before this and I will never switch back. This stuff lather&#x27;s really thick and really fast, is really smooth, makes the razor glide better, washes off easily, and leaves my skin feeling great. Basically this is the 5-star gold standard in shaving soap. I used to use both the pre-shave oil and soap and I stopped using the oil because this stuff alone was way better than any combination I had used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on for hours about how great this stuff is, if it weren&#x27;t shaving soap. That said, I wish everything I bought online was this amazing.</li>
