            <li>Nice blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>I kept it, but not all that thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as nice</li>
            <li>it got here fast and in perfect condition...</li>
            <li>Nice hair dryer.</li>
            <li>We have had this blower for a couple of years, it has been GREAT, keep the lint trap clean for longer life.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is light weight but still does a good job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that I wanted to spend a significant amount of money, so I tried this model, which had fairly good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Held up fine!</li>
            <li>This one is very light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m adjusting and am getting along with this hair dryer for the most part.</li>
            <li>Just ok.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s an OK product, but I would neither recommend it nor buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and model of hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Just okay....</li>
            <li>status as soon as I get a better replacement.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My wife is handicapped and this dryer sure helps around here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d seen on many packages.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a really awesome product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Overall, great for the price!</li>
            <li>I love the attachment.</li>
            <li>However, I was expecting more air flow and quicker drying for 1875 watts.</li>
            <li>I just love my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This is a top notch blow dryer.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been using Conair hairdryers for years and have always been pleased with the price and quality.  </li>
            <li>Works beautifully and the last one worked for many years!</li>
            <li>So far, So Good!  </li>
            <li>This dryer is really great and simple to use; nothing fancy but def gets the job done; I luv the color and has a hook on the bottom to hang :)</li>
            <li>It was easy to work with this shipper.</li>
            <li>Every time I change hand positions I&#x27;m accidentally turning it off or moving it from hot to warm.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine hair dryer...</li>
            <li>seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>but I have fine hair and don&#x27;t want my hair blown all over the place anyway.  </li>
            <li>The device works fine for me.</li>
            <li>I also use it on spills on the carpet and it sure dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It also includes a concentrator and an easy to clean filter.  </li>
            <li>Overall it works great though.</li>
            <li>i saw this one and it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the hand set is comfortable and it does the job with lots of blowing noise.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>My wife had me buy cheap hairdryers at Walmart.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It has a nice strong force and gets pretty hot, which I like.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it has a good performance, I really fall in love, is simple to use and practice to mobilize</li>
            <li>I was pretty pleased with it -</li>
            <li>doesnt seem to have a strong blowing power, and the on/off switch is located on the handle right where you hold it which makes it turn off when you are using it.</li>
            <li>I just needed a good standard hair dryer and this one is it.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is as good as my last one.</li>
            <li>love this hair dryer, it is just the right size and dries hair quickly and nicely, the color red is also a plus</li>
            <li>Low noise and good heat options gets very hot as needed for quicker drying</li>
            <li>I needed something quick and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>and so far it seems gentle (along with good hair health product).  </li>
            <li>I have an older 1875 that I love</li>
            <li>Works very well not as hot or noisy as most.</li>
            <li>The temperature is easily adjusted and dries my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time the hot is too hot and the warm isn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li>the weight/controls are good and it was just what I expected.  </li>
            <li>But, the use of toggle switches for power and temperature right on the handle instead of a sliding switch seems like poor planning at best.  </li>
            <li>I especially like being able to clean the filter.  </li>
            <li>very good dryer, nice power, not as heavy as the reviews I read previously.</li>
            <li>There is nothing right about this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>But this one is just right.  </li>
            <li>My previous Conair dryer, which cost more than this one but was also 1875 watts, put out more air.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean the back vent.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair super fast, but I wish the cord was longer.</li>
            <li>I had one of these previously and really loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Conair dryers for years and years, and when my last hair dryer died I bought another Conair, thinking I&#x27;d get the same great dryer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be happy with any one other than my old one</li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as my old dryer, but it is significantly lighter and seems to be constructed well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming because of our litigious society and that someone might drink a blazing hot cup of McDonald&#x27;s coffee while using this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love the lightweight, the color, the different speeds.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of eighties hand held hair dryers only feels and sounds better than mine ever did before.  </li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>I had a blue one exactly like this for about 5 years, and it was the most durable hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I had been interested in the &#x27;ions&#x27;</li>
            <li>I actually haven&#x27;t been able to use either.</li>
            <li>Plus love the red color.</li>
            <li>The first one worked out</li>
            <li>Works great when I put curlers in my hair and use the slow hot setting to set the curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting used to it but was hoping when I ordered it that it would be exactly like the one I had, since it lasted for years.</li>
            <li>The airflow can be hot or warm, strong or slow.  </li>
            <li>Great replacement for my previous 12 year old Conair.  </li>
            <li>My old hair dryer did not have a way to clean the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this during the Black Friday madness and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I got this as a special deal and because it was like an old one I had.  </li>
            <li>exactly what we needed - thanks</li>
            <li>It does have different settings -- high, low, warm, cool; my husband uses the lowest settings to blow-dry the dog.</li>
            <li>She said her hair style doesn&#x27;t require them but said they could be beneficial on certain styles.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice dryer for such a low price.</li>
            <li>i sent it back as it was not what I wanted for my fine hair..</li>
            <li>Make the care giving much easier and she loves the speed and results.</li>
            <li>Maybe its the &amp;#34;ionizing&amp;#34; function of the dryer, but it really did a number on my hair.</li>
            <li>Conair has established their product quality so I cant coment much on the machine its self.  </li>
            <li>Not too much</li>
            <li>but I was very dissapointed with the heat output.  </li>
            <li>My old hairdryer died after so many years that I can&#x27;t recall when I had a different one.</li>
            <li>A solid professional (as I observe when I have my hair cut, and styled) pice of equipment that I&#x27;m glad to have bought for my guitar repair shop.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer as a replacement to my current dryer that is fairly old and I wasn&#x27;t all that pleased with anyway.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful, need a red dryer for the wife.</li>
            <li>I owned the previous version and decided to get a new one when my child need their own hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Warm&amp;#34; is barely above cool.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the exterior doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my old dryer</li>
            <li>The only gripe I have is that the cord is on the short end, other than that I am happy with it...</li>
            <li>It works better than the previous version.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because my older Conair caught on fire one morning, after about 6 years of use.</li>
            <li>A decent dryer for the price.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this particular hairdryer again.</li>
            <li>should have shopped around here locally and could have found something better in newer design paying almost the same amount</li>
            <li>Conair 1875-Watt Pro Style Hair Dryer is nicely balanced for wrist and arm movement to personally dry quickly long hair.  </li>
            <li>She highly  recommends it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for a&lt;br /&gt;Quality hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I would say this one was not as hot as my last, but still a very decent hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Dried my hair very fast and still left some of my curl, which was soft and nice.  </li>
            <li>and it is powerful enough to work for her.  </li>
            <li>Adequate, not too loud, but only two temps and two speeds.</li>
            <li>Solid performance right out of the box.</li>
            <li>just wish it was a little smaller in size , also would be nice if the cord retracted</li>
            <li>After 18 years, I found myself looking for a new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as my old dryer which was the same brand and model.  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself was very loud and bulky.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it dries fast, is quiet, and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I believe in this day and age that a blow dryer with light use should easily outlast me vs. conking out in less than a year and a half.</li>
            <li>Cord is pretty short, which I like.  </li>
            <li>a little big than I think ,but just ok</li>
            <li>I replaced my old hair dryer with this Conair.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated the low noise level and range of heat/speed settings.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed is still plenty loud.</li>
            <li>And the cord is very short as well - much shorter than any</li>
            <li>Not too much air, but just enough.  </li>
            <li>but I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li>Since I knew the specs before I purchased, I wasn&#x27;t surprised, but I did expect the &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; setting to be warmer.</li>
            <li>So far it still works.  </li>
            <li>Replacing my old Conair max with this updated version.</li>
            <li>They were too loud and broke.</li>
            <li>My new Conair 1875-Watt Pro Style Hair Dryer works just fine, but my previous one (same brand and same wattage) was much lighter to hold.</li>
            <li>Many others were not strong enough.</li>
            <li>Small, easy to use and pack.</li>
            <li>My last hairdryer was really loud so although I expected this one to be more quiet than it is, it is still not as loud as my last one.</li>
            <li>The only way to avoid doing that is to not put your hand around the inside of the handle - I&#x27;ve dropped the dumb thing on the floor more times than I can count while trying to avoid turning it off!  </li>
            <li>On the high speed and high heat, the output is only a little more than the low setting of my other dryer.  </li>
            <li>Hot and warm are the same temperature (i.e., warm), and even the cold shot isn&#x27;t really cold so much as just a little less warm.</li>
            <li>There are only 2 heat options, high and low and also speed options high and low.  </li>
            <li>First I will say that it dries hair just like any other hair dryer</li>
            <li>almost exact to the other one.  </li>
            <li>This does not get hot enough to straighten your hair...takes forever to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>But taking time to introduce him to it slowly worked fine.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting, and I like how the intake is on the back rather than the sides and is less likely to draw longer hair into it.  </li>
            <li>Until it decided to only blow on &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; no matter if set to High or Low.</li>
            <li>Basic hair dryer, not too loud, not too fancy.</li>
            <li>Pretty average.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer to use on my 8 month old puppy because it was supposed to be quiet.</li>
            <li>And although it blows a lot of air, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually dry my short hair.  </li>
            <li>, it was a quick and lazy buy on my part</li>
            <li>It has the same power as my last one but really seems to dry faster.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy, it&#x27;s much quieter than my last few dryers, and it dries quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than my previous hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Cord is very short, quite loud and dryer takes forever to dry my hair - my medium length hair.</li>
            <li>This one has the same wattage as my current one and looked smaller and less bulky for a reasonable price.  </li>

            <li> This is a top notch blow dryer.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using Conair hairdryers for years and have always been pleased with the price and quality.  </li>
            <li> Works beautifully and the last one worked for many years!</li>
            <li> So far, So Good!  </li>
            <li> This dryer is really great and simple to use; nothing fancy but def gets the job done; I luv the color and has a hook on the bottom to hang :)</li>
            <li> It was easy to work with this shipper.</li>
            <li> Every time I change hand positions I&#x27;m accidentally turning it off or moving it from hot to warm.  </li>
            <li> This is a fine hair dryer...</li>
            <li> seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> but I have fine hair and don&#x27;t want my hair blown all over the place anyway.  </li>
            <li> The device works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I also use it on spills on the carpet and it sure dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It also includes a concentrator and an easy to clean filter.  </li>
            <li> Overall it works great though.</li>
            <li> i saw this one and it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the hand set is comfortable and it does the job with lots of blowing noise.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> My wife had me buy cheap hairdryers at Walmart.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It has a nice strong force and gets pretty hot, which I like.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it has a good performance, I really fall in love, is simple to use and practice to mobilize</li>
            <li> I was pretty pleased with it -</li>
            <li> doesnt seem to have a strong blowing power, and the on/off switch is located on the handle right where you hold it which makes it turn off when you are using it.</li>
            <li> I just needed a good standard hair dryer and this one is it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is as good as my last one.</li>
            <li> love this hair dryer, it is just the right size and dries hair quickly and nicely, the color red is also a plus</li>
            <li> Low noise and good heat options gets very hot as needed for quicker drying</li>
            <li> I needed something quick and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> and so far it seems gentle (along with good hair health product).  </li>
            <li> I have an older 1875 that I love</li>
            <li> Works very well not as hot or noisy as most.</li>
            <li> The temperature is easily adjusted and dries my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time the hot is too hot and the warm isn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li> the weight/controls are good and it was just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> But, the use of toggle switches for power and temperature right on the handle instead of a sliding switch seems like poor planning at best.  </li>
            <li> I especially like being able to clean the filter.  </li>
            <li> very good dryer, nice power, not as heavy as the reviews I read previously.</li>
            <li> There is nothing right about this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> But this one is just right.  </li>
            <li> My previous Conair dryer, which cost more than this one but was also 1875 watts, put out more air.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean the back vent.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair super fast, but I wish the cord was longer.</li>
            <li> I had one of these previously and really loved it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Conair dryers for years and years, and when my last hair dryer died I bought another Conair, thinking I&#x27;d get the same great dryer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be happy with any one other than my old one</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as my old dryer, but it is significantly lighter and seems to be constructed well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming because of our litigious society and that someone might drink a blazing hot cup of McDonald&#x27;s coffee while using this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love the lightweight, the color, the different speeds.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of eighties hand held hair dryers only feels and sounds better than mine ever did before.  </li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> I had a blue one exactly like this for about 5 years, and it was the most durable hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I had been interested in the &#x27;ions&#x27;</li>
            <li> I actually haven&#x27;t been able to use either.</li>
            <li> Plus love the red color.</li>
            <li> The first one worked out</li>
            <li> Works great when I put curlers in my hair and use the slow hot setting to set the curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to it but was hoping when I ordered it that it would be exactly like the one I had, since it lasted for years.</li>
            <li> The airflow can be hot or warm, strong or slow.  </li>
            <li> Great replacement for my previous 12 year old Conair.  </li>
            <li> My old hair dryer did not have a way to clean the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this during the Black Friday madness and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I got this as a special deal and because it was like an old one I had.  </li>
            <li> exactly what we needed - thanks</li>
            <li> It does have different settings -- high, low, warm, cool; my husband uses the lowest settings to blow-dry the dog.</li>
            <li> She said her hair style doesn&#x27;t require them but said they could be beneficial on certain styles.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice dryer for such a low price.</li>
            <li> i sent it back as it was not what I wanted for my fine hair..</li>
            <li> Make the care giving much easier and she loves the speed and results.</li>
            <li> Maybe its the &amp;#34;ionizing&amp;#34; function of the dryer, but it really did a number on my hair.</li>
            <li> Conair has established their product quality so I cant coment much on the machine its self.  </li>
            <li> Not too much</li>
            <li> but I was very dissapointed with the heat output.  </li>
            <li> My old hairdryer died after so many years that I can&#x27;t recall when I had a different one.</li>
            <li> A solid professional (as I observe when I have my hair cut, and styled) pice of equipment that I&#x27;m glad to have bought for my guitar repair shop.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer as a replacement to my current dryer that is fairly old and I wasn&#x27;t all that pleased with anyway.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful, need a red dryer for the wife.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version and decided to get a new one when my child need their own hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Warm&amp;#34; is barely above cool.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the exterior doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my old dryer</li>
            <li> The only gripe I have is that the cord is on the short end, other than that I am happy with it...</li>
            <li> It works better than the previous version.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my older Conair caught on fire one morning, after about 6 years of use.</li>
            <li> A decent dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this particular hairdryer again.</li>
            <li> should have shopped around here locally and could have found something better in newer design paying almost the same amount</li>
            <li> Conair 1875-Watt Pro Style Hair Dryer is nicely balanced for wrist and arm movement to personally dry quickly long hair.  </li>
            <li> She highly  recommends it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for a&lt;br /&gt;Quality hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I would say this one was not as hot as my last, but still a very decent hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair very fast and still left some of my curl, which was soft and nice.  </li>
            <li> and it is powerful enough to work for her.  </li>
            <li> Adequate, not too loud, but only two temps and two speeds.</li>
            <li> Solid performance right out of the box.</li>
            <li> just wish it was a little smaller in size , also would be nice if the cord retracted</li>
            <li> After 18 years, I found myself looking for a new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my old dryer which was the same brand and model.  </li>
            <li> The dryer itself was very loud and bulky.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it dries fast, is quiet, and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I believe in this day and age that a blow dryer with light use should easily outlast me vs. conking out in less than a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Cord is pretty short, which I like.  </li>
            <li> a little big than I think ,but just ok</li>
            <li> I replaced my old hair dryer with this Conair.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated the low noise level and range of heat/speed settings.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed is still plenty loud.</li>
            <li> And the cord is very short as well - much shorter than any</li>
            <li> Not too much air, but just enough.  </li>
            <li> but I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li> Since I knew the specs before I purchased, I wasn&#x27;t surprised, but I did expect the &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; setting to be warmer.</li>
            <li> So far it still works.  </li>
            <li> Replacing my old Conair max with this updated version.</li>
            <li> They were too loud and broke.</li>
            <li> My new Conair 1875-Watt Pro Style Hair Dryer works just fine, but my previous one (same brand and same wattage) was much lighter to hold.</li>
            <li> Many others were not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to use and pack.</li>
            <li> My last hairdryer was really loud so although I expected this one to be more quiet than it is, it is still not as loud as my last one.</li>
            <li> The only way to avoid doing that is to not put your hand around the inside of the handle - I&#x27;ve dropped the dumb thing on the floor more times than I can count while trying to avoid turning it off!  </li>
            <li> On the high speed and high heat, the output is only a little more than the low setting of my other dryer.  </li>
            <li> Hot and warm are the same temperature (i.e., warm), and even the cold shot isn&#x27;t really cold so much as just a little less warm.</li>
            <li> There are only 2 heat options, high and low and also speed options high and low.  </li>
            <li> First I will say that it dries hair just like any other hair dryer</li>
            <li> almost exact to the other one.  </li>
            <li> This does not get hot enough to straighten your hair...takes forever to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> But taking time to introduce him to it slowly worked fine.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting, and I like how the intake is on the back rather than the sides and is less likely to draw longer hair into it.  </li>
            <li> Until it decided to only blow on &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; no matter if set to High or Low.</li>
            <li> Basic hair dryer, not too loud, not too fancy.</li>
            <li> Pretty average.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to use on my 8 month old puppy because it was supposed to be quiet.</li>
            <li> And although it blows a lot of air, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually dry my short hair.  </li>
            <li> , it was a quick and lazy buy on my part</li>
            <li> It has the same power as my last one but really seems to dry faster.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too heavy, it&#x27;s much quieter than my last few dryers, and it dries quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than my previous hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Cord is very short, quite loud and dryer takes forever to dry my hair - my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> This one has the same wattage as my current one and looked smaller and less bulky for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The airflow is slow, and the dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.</li>
            <li> and it seems to dry my hair efficiently in less time than my older hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> And it has many features such as the interruption key for temporally disable the heater and blowing cold air.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, when the dryer is on high, it blows so hard that it&#x27;s impossible to do any actual styling, so you&#x27;ll be going down to &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; fairly quickly (which is another reason for my having frizzy hair).</li>
            <li> After using the dryer twice my hair feels dry, lifeless, flat and flyaway.</li>
            <li> I just wish that I had realized that the barrel is so long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or loud.</li>
            <li> I will have to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I got a few to try out when my old Conair died.</li>
            <li> I logged on to Amazon to give seller feedback originally, but apparently for this product this is not an option, which is also disappointing.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the cord is a bit too short.</li>
            <li> My other model had a smaller barrell</li>
            <li> I bought it again just to have when the other must surely ultimately</li>
            <li> and it is definitely a lot quieter than my other one</li>
            <li> It does eventually get my hair dry, so</li>
            <li> It takes longer to dry hair.</li>
            <li> It takes me longer to dry my hair with this dryer.</li>
            <li> This looks sturdy, is actually smaller and less heavy than my old one.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that takes FOREVER to dry, so the dryer&#x27;s inability to produce hot air means longer drying time and a slight case of the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> so feels odd in your hand but not enough to dislike it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in Conair and now I&#x27;m going to have to go to a physical store (shudder! :-)</li>
            <li> Basic dryer ,no expectations beyond the one you had previously</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s red n black</li>
            <li> I use it when ever I need to dry my hair and other this to dry up too.</li>
            <li> All other dryers I&#x27;ve ever used have switches that slide up or down and only move when you want them to, not just if you accidentally touch it.  </li>
            <li> I wash and dry every other day</li>
            <li> It &#x27;blows&#x27; hard and is quite noisy relative to it - even on the low blower</li>
            <li> This worked well enough in a pinch, but is not my recommended choice for everyday use.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it is quieter than the last few dryers I have used.</li>
            <li> My fault for not be careful to order correct item.</li>
            <li> About what I expected, for the money.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not very tiring for the wrist.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected -----</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really a problem.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to be careful where I set it when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I returned this only because it is ionic and my hair is limp and doesn&#x27;t work well with ionic dryers (the ionic aspect was not in the web description but was on the box ).</li>
            <li> my other dryer took a dump.  </li>
            <li> I bought the same model Conair 9-10 years ago, and have usually used it every day.</li>
            <li> I am sorry it is so large however as I have a tender shoulder...  </li>
            <li> My dog was a little shy of it at first.</li>
            <li> In terms of the dryer itself, it is heavy, difficult to hold, and the cord is too short (especially if you have long hair and attempt to style using a brush).</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife when I heard her complaining about her previous dryer.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Unless you want your hair to be a lifeless dried-out mess, stay away from this dryer.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> The buttons that control the heat/speed are also located in an inconvenient spot on the handle, and they are sharp on the edges, which makes using the dyer even more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairdryer for a little over a week now.</li>
            <li> I wish the cord was a little longer</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy on one side</li>
            <li> It is heavy.  </li>
            <li> He now looks forward to being blow dried after his bath and when we come in out of the rain or snow.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace a travel dryer I had been using for a few months.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an option to turn off the ionic feature (not a huge deal), but it does have 2 speed and heat options.</li>
            <li> Also, though it&#x27;s touted as being quiet, all that really means is that it doesn&#x27;t have the annoying high-pitched whine that appliances with small motors often have.</li>
            <li> She has long very thick hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product lasted less than a month with daily use by one person.</li>
            <li> The placement of the controls makes it difficult to hold the hair dryer in a proper position.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle was difficult to apply but I finally got it.  </li>
            <li> It has enough settings and I&#x27;ve used the &#x27;cold blast&#x27; part a few times.  </li>
            <li> hard to hold without unintentionally pressing switches</li>
            <li> That makes it hard to use at times...</li>
            <li> The attachments were a little difficult to attach and detach but seemed to loosen up a little with use.  </li>
            <li> Due to the weight and the oddly shaped handle, I found it very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is not well conceived, the directional is poorly done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for approximately 3 months now, and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> However, within two months of purchase the diffuser attachment is broken.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I banned it wrong power connection for australia</li>
            <li> The switch is placed in the wrong place, because I accidentally shut it off all the time.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had sent all the packaging material out with the recycling.  </li>
            <li> I was a wee bit disappointed, as it didn&#x27;t live-up to the quietness of my past ionic dryer.  </li>
            <li> There are two heat settings and a cold button.</li>
            <li> I have taken care of this hairdryer and not handled it roughly, so needless to say I am disappointed with my purchase on this occasion.  </li>
            <li> The included concentrator and diffuser are very difficult to attach-</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it does not have a retractable cord.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Unfortunately I banned it wrong power connection for australia</li>
            <li> I bought this because my older Conair caught on fire one morning, after about 6 years of use. I needed something quick and inexpensive. That is what this is. The diffuser is not well conceived, the directional is poorly done. The airflow is slow, and the dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough. This worked well enough in a pinch, but is not my recommended choice for everyday use.</li>
            <li> hard to hold without unintentionally pressing switches</li>
            <li> I like some heat from a hair dryer.  This one has a position that reads &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; but, it falls short of that. I&#x27;m assuming because of our litigious society and that someone might drink a blazing hot cup of McDonald&#x27;s coffee while using this hair dryer.  The buttons on the interior of the handle take some getting used to as your grip may have a tendency to change the heat setting or turn it off.  I&#x27;m adjusting and am getting along with this hair dryer for the most part.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a year now and I like it. No problems at all. Basic hair dryer, not too loud, not too fancy.</li>
            <li> The switch is placed in the wrong place, because I accidentally shut it off all the time.  On the plus side, it is quieter than the last few dryers I have used.</li>
            <li> The cord is too short and I would not call it &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; at all..</li>
            <li> Just ok.  Wish I had purchase at Brick and Mortar, so I could have checked out the feel and weight.</li>
            <li> Great service. I just wish that I had realized that the barrel is so long. My wife has a short arm  and has difficulty using the dryer.</li>
            <li> exactly what we needed - thanks</li>
            <li> I replaced my old hair dryer with this Conair.  Works great and came with a diffuser, which I needed.  It also includes a concentrator and an easy to clean filter.  My old hair dryer did not have a way to clean the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dried my hair very fast and still left some of my curl, which was soft and nice.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I would have given this blow dryer a 5, but the cord needs to be longer.  Overall it works great though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to use at the gym. She Loves it. She has long very thick hair and it is powerful enough to work for her.  Many others were not strong enough. She is very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Love the lightweight, the color, the different speeds.  Easy to clean the back vent.  Dries my hair super fast, but I wish the cord was longer.</li>
            <li> This dryer is really great and simple to use; nothing fancy but def gets the job done; I luv the color and has a hook on the bottom to hang :)</li>
            <li> I appreciated the low noise level and range of heat/speed settings.  Unfortunately, the product lasted less than a month with daily use by one person.</li>
            <li> Excellent and efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairdryer for a little over a week now. As other reviewers have mentioned, the cord is a bit too short. Hot and warm are the same temperature (i.e., warm), and even the cold shot isn&#x27;t really cold so much as just a little less warm. I have thick hair that takes FOREVER to dry, so the dryer&#x27;s inability to produce hot air means longer drying time and a slight case of the frizzies.  Also, though it&#x27;s touted as being quiet, all that really means is that it doesn&#x27;t have the annoying high-pitched whine that appliances with small motors often have. The &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed is still plenty loud. Fortunately, when the dryer is on high, it blows so hard that it&#x27;s impossible to do any actual styling, so you&#x27;ll be going down to &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; fairly quickly (which is another reason for my having frizzy hair). It does eventually get my hair dry, so I guess it&#x27;s an OK product, but I would neither recommend it nor buy it again.</li>
            <li> Conair 1875-Watt Pro Style Hair Dryer is nicely balanced for wrist and arm movement to personally dry quickly long hair.  I wash and dry every other day and so far it seems gentle (along with good hair health product).  It reminds me of eighties hand held hair dryers only feels and sounds better than mine ever did before.  Also the color blends nicely with medium-wood rustic style.</li>
            <li> It works really well! I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife when I heard her complaining about her previous dryer. She loves it although she hasn&#x27;t used any of the attachments. She said her hair style doesn&#x27;t require them but said they could be beneficial on certain styles. She highly  recommends it.</li>
            <li> This is a fine hair dryer... I am sorry it is so large however as I have a tender shoulder...  That makes it hard to use at times... The dryer however is a good one.</li>
            <li> seems to work just fine. Disappointed that it does not have a retractable cord.  My fault for not be careful to order correct item.</li>
            <li> Pretty average. Just what I needed, though. About what I expected, for the money.</li>
            <li> Nice blowdryer.  It is a little heavy on one side so feels odd in your hand but not enough to dislike it.  It&#x27;s actually nice noise level (on the quieter side) and easy controls, great attachments ~ a great buy!</li>
            <li> I love this brand and model of hairdryer. I had a blue one exactly like this for about 5 years, and it was the most durable hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had. I would say this one was not as hot as my last, but still a very decent hairdryer. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> My old hairdryer died after so many years that I can&#x27;t recall when I had a different one. I just needed a good standard hair dryer and this one is it. It has a nice strong force and gets pretty hot, which I like. My hair is very fine so I don&#x27;t use the attachements. This looks sturdy, is actually smaller and less heavy than my old one. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Very very nice. Good quality!</li>
            <li> Very powerful, need a red dryer for the wife. This one is very light so it&#x27;s not very tiring for the wrist.</li>
            <li> Just okay....doesnt seem to have a strong blowing power, and the on/off switch is located on the handle right where you hold it which makes it turn off when you are using it. The filter door keeps popping open too....I kept it, but not all that thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> There is nothing right about this hair dryer.  It is heavy.  The placement of the controls makes it difficult to hold the hair dryer in a proper position.  And although it blows a lot of air, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually dry my short hair.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> I have an older 1875 that I love and so I bought this as a 2nd blower. It&#x27;s not as nice but it got the job done. Until it decided to only blow on &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; no matter if set to High or Low. And, well, I almost exclusively use the Low setting. I believe in this day and age that a blow dryer with light use should easily outlast me vs. conking out in less than a year and a half. I&#x27;m disappointed in Conair and now I&#x27;m going to have to go to a physical store (shudder! :-) to find my next hair dryer. So, if short-term reliability works for you: no worries!</li>
            <li> I got this as a special deal and because it was like an old one I had.  The picture shows it as an ion hairdryer as well as the description.  I got it out to use it and noticed that it is not an ion shine.  Not as described.  I feel I was ripped off.  Unfortunately I had sent all the packaging material out with the recycling.  And at $15 it will be a spare dryer.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my previous 12 year old Conair.  Conair lasts forever.</li>
            <li> First I will say that it dries hair just like any other hair dryer so I guess it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  But, the use of toggle switches for power and temperature right on the handle instead of a sliding switch seems like poor planning at best.  Every time I change hand positions I&#x27;m accidentally turning it off or moving it from hot to warm.  The only way to avoid doing that is to not put your hand around the inside of the handle - I&#x27;ve dropped the dumb thing on the floor more times than I can count while trying to avoid turning it off!  All other dryers I&#x27;ve ever used have switches that slide up or down and only move when you want them to, not just if you accidentally touch it.  And the cord is very short as well - much shorter than any I&#x27;ve had in the past.  This dryer will be going to &amp;#34;back-up&amp;#34; status as soon as I get a better replacement.</li>
            <li> I had one of these previously and really loved it.  Not too much air, but just enough.  When mine kerplunks...I am getting this one.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. There are two heat settings and a cold button. Most of the time the hot is too hot and the warm isn&#x27;t hot enough. But this one is just right.  It&#x27;s not too heavy or loud. Cord is pretty short, which I like.  I don&#x27;t use the attachments so I can&#x27;t speak on them.</li>
            <li> My wife is handicapped and this dryer sure helps around here.  Make the care giving much easier and she loves the speed and results.</li>
            <li> Basic dryer ,no expectations beyond the one you had previously</li>
            <li> Cord is very short, quite loud and dryer takes forever to dry my hair - my medium length hair. I would not purchase again nor would I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don do hair, jus melt shrink tubin&#x27;. Aye, every morn I drize me hair wit it,. It sho does the job, I like it! A solid professional (as I observe when I have my hair cut, and styled) pice of equipment that I&#x27;m glad to have bought for my guitar repair shop.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected ----- just wish it was a little smaller in size , also would be nice if the cord retracted</li>
            <li> my other dryer took a dump.  i saw this one and it was cheap.  almost exact to the other one.  works great!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is as good as my last one. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be happy with any one other than my old one but I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li> love this hair dryer, it is just the right size and dries hair quickly and nicely, the color red is also a plus</li>
            <li> We have had this blower for a couple of years, it has been GREAT, keep the lint trap clean for longer life. I am on my way to buy another</li>
            <li> Adequate, not too loud, but only two temps and two speeds. Since I knew the specs before I purchased, I wasn&#x27;t surprised, but I did expect the &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; setting to be warmer. The &amp;#34;Warm&amp;#34; is barely above cool.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my old dryer which was the same brand and model.  Not enough heat nor blower force</li>
            <li> After using the dryer twice my hair feels dry, lifeless, flat and flyaway. Maybe its the &amp;#34;ionizing&amp;#34; function of the dryer, but it really did a number on my hair. I&#x27;ve been using Conair dryers for years and years, and when my last hair dryer died I bought another Conair, thinking I&#x27;d get the same great dryer. In terms of the dryer itself, it is heavy, difficult to hold, and the cord is too short (especially if you have long hair and attempt to style using a brush). Due to the weight and the oddly shaped handle, I found it very awkward to use. The buttons that control the heat/speed are also located in an inconvenient spot on the handle, and they are sharp on the edges, which makes using the dyer even more uncomfortable. Unless you want your hair to be a lifeless dried-out mess, stay away from this dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for myself.  I was a wee bit disappointed, as it didn&#x27;t live-up to the quietness of my past ionic dryer.  It &#x27;blows&#x27; hard and is quite noisy relative to it - even on the low blower setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the hand set is comfortable and it does the job with lots of blowing noise.</li>
            <li> After 18 years, I found myself looking for a new hair dryer.  I had been interested in the &#x27;ions&#x27; I&#x27;d seen on many packages.  This is a very nice hair dryer, it came with both a diffuser and a concentrator which snap on nicely and work well, as designed.  It dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting, and I like how the intake is on the back rather than the sides and is less likely to draw longer hair into it.  Supposedly, you can remove that part for cleaning, but I haven&#x27;t figured out how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really awesome product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I have long, thick hair and it seems to dry my hair efficiently in less time than my older hair dryer.  I like the different settings, i.e. hot/warm, high/low speed.  I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for approximately 3 months now, and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was easy to work with this shipper. I have no complaints about them. Everything was great and without problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to use on my 8 month old puppy because it was supposed to be quiet. It&#x27;s not real quiet, but then it is blowing air. My dog was a little shy of it at first. But taking time to introduce him to it slowly worked fine. He now looks forward to being blow dried after his bath and when we come in out of the rain or snow. It seems well made. I will have to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> a little big than I think ,but just ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the strongest hair blower but I have fine hair and don&#x27;t want my hair blown all over the place anyway.  It meets my needs.  It has enough settings and I&#x27;ve used the &#x27;cold blast&#x27; part a few times.  I especially like being able to clean the filter.  I wish the cord was a little longer but it&#x27;s not really a problem.  As for the ionization part, eh...what&#x27;s that anyway?  The product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do--dry hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace a travel dryer I had been using for a few months. It isn&#x27;t too heavy, it&#x27;s much quieter than my last few dryers, and it dries quite quickly. It doesn&#x27;t have an option to turn off the ionic feature (not a huge deal), but it does have 2 speed and heat options. The included concentrator and diffuser are very difficult to attach- I actually haven&#x27;t been able to use either. Overall, great for the price!</li>
            <li> Conair has established their product quality so I cant coment much on the machine its self.  I got it at a great price and so I give it 4 stars (Very Respectable) So far it still works.  Not too much I can say to help you with your decision.</li>
            <li> Works very well not as hot or noisy as most. It takes longer to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and the last one worked for many years! Highly recommended for a&lt;br /&gt;Quality hair dryer.  Plus love the red color.</li>
            <li> Use this daily.  Held up fine!</li>
            <li> Much nicer than my previous hair dryer.  The temperature is easily adjusted and dries my hair very well.  I love the attachment.</li>
            <li> We now have two of this identical model. The first one worked out well so we bought another for a second bathroom. I can&#x27;t speak to whether it makes my hair any shinier, but it does a good job of drying my hair and that&#x27;s all I ask for. It does have different settings -- high, low, warm, cool; my husband uses the lowest settings to blow-dry the dog. I have noticed that the exterior doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my old dryer so I don&#x27;t have to be careful where I set it when I&#x27;m done. I have no idea what to do with the finger/curly thingy attachment -- maybe I need curly hair to appreciate its use.</li>
            <li> A decent dryer for the price. However, I was expecting more air flow and quicker drying for 1875 watts. My previous Conair dryer, which cost more than this one but was also 1875 watts, put out more air. Still, for the price, this one gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Low noise and good heat options gets very hot as needed for quicker drying</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  I owned the previous version and decided to get a new one when my child need their own hairdryer.  It works better than the previous version.  The airflow can be hot or warm, strong or slow.  Works great when I put curlers in my hair and use the slow hot setting to set the curls.</li>
            <li> I got this during the Black Friday madness and LOVE it! It has all the tips and ends anyone would need. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Solid performance right out of the box.</li>
            <li> So far, So Good!  Great Product!</li>
            <li> The nozzle was difficult to apply but I finally got it.  Very nice dryer for the $$.  Very Pleased with the delivery and purchase.</li>
            <li> My new Conair 1875-Watt Pro Style Hair Dryer works just fine, but my previous one (same brand and same wattage) was much lighter to hold. I&#x27;m getting used to it but was hoping when I ordered it that it would be exactly like the one I had, since it lasted for years.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it has a good performance, I really fall in love, is simple to use and practice to mobilize</li>
            <li> It is a simple hair dryer that I think works well, especially for the price. The only gripe I have is that the cord is on the short end, other than that I am happy with it...</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my professional-grade hair dryer, and I was considering all my options. I wasn&#x27;t sure that I wanted to spend a significant amount of money, so I tried this model, which had fairly good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly quiet. It is not as powerful as my old dryer, but it is significantly lighter and seems to be constructed well. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I just love my hair dryer. I enjoy using it.I use it when ever I need to dry my hair and other this to dry up too.</li>
            <li> My last hairdryer was really loud so although I expected this one to be more quiet than it is, it is still not as loud as my last one. It has the same power as my last one but really seems to dry faster. I love it! It works great and I would give it 5 stars if it was quieter.</li>
            <li> very good dryer, nice power, not as heavy as the reviews I read previously.</li>
            <li> This is a top notch blow dryer. I got a few to try out when my old Conair died. I like the brand so wanted a Conair again. I returned this only because it is ionic and my hair is limp and doesn&#x27;t work well with ionic dryers (the ionic aspect was not in the web description but was on the box ). Other than that, it dries fast, is quiet, and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer, but have to get adjusted to the longer gun barrell.  My other model had a smaller barrell and I held it closer to my head.  This barrell is longer and I keep bumping my head if I am not paying attention to what I am doing.  Nice dryer for the price and works great.  Two temp&#x27;s and two speeds.</li>
            <li> I bought the same model Conair 9-10 years ago, and have usually used it every day. It still works.  I bought it again just to have when the other must surely ultimately die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product longevity is why I bought it again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this blow dryer.  I also use it on spills on the carpet and it sure dries my hair quickly.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice dryer for such a low price. The device works fine for me. And it has many features such as the interruption key for temporally disable the heater and blowing cold air.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using Conair hairdryers for years and have always been pleased with the price and quality.  Recent experiences, however, have made me wonder about my loyalty to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this hairdryer arrived I was pretty pleased with it - the weight/controls are good and it was just what I expected.  The attachments were a little difficult to attach and detach but seemed to loosen up a little with use.  However, within two months of purchase the diffuser attachment is broken.  I have taken care of this hairdryer and not handled it roughly, so needless to say I am disappointed with my purchase on this occasion.  I logged on to Amazon to give seller feedback originally, but apparently for this product this is not an option, which is also disappointing.  I would not buy this particular hairdryer again.</li>
            <li> it was a gift to my wife.  It will also thaw out the washing machine</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling. I have very thick hair that takes a long time to dry. This blow dryer is light weight but still does a good job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to use and pack. A lot of options</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter cause i have one and she loved it...it got here fast and in perfect condition...she loves it...loves the power.</li>
            <li> Replacing my old Conair max with this updated version. I hope to get years of use as I did with the last one.</li>
            <li> It said nothing about ions in description.. One of the questions said not ionic but the box says IONIC. i sent it back as it was not what I wanted for my fine hair..</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer as a replacement to my current dryer that is fairly old and I wasn&#x27;t all that pleased with anyway.  The dryer itself was very loud and bulky.  This one has the same wattage as my current one and looked smaller and less bulky for a reasonable price.  I like the size and feel of holding it and it is definitely a lot quieter than my other one but I was very dissapointed with the heat output.  There are only 2 heat options, high and low and also speed options high and low.  On the high speed and high heat, the output is only a little more than the low setting of my other dryer.  It takes me longer to dry my hair with this dryer.</li>
            <li> Works great  AND it&#x27;s red n black</li>
            <li> My wife had me buy cheap hairdryers at Walmart. They were too loud and broke. This is the hairdryer she had before and this one is even in red. She loves this thing</li>
            <li> should have shopped around here locally and could have found something better in newer design paying almost the same amount, it was a quick and lazy buy on my part</li>
            <li> This does not get hot enough to straighten your hair...takes forever to dry your hair. Not using it. It IS quiet though.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer. Bought it for guest room bath.  Hasn&#x27;t been used yet.</li>
    </ol>
