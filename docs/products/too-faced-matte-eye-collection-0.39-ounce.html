            <li>/&gt;Overall, this was a great buy.</li>

            <li>A necessity for those who don&#x27;t wear bright colours.</li>
            <li>Colors are matt and gorgeous - will order from this company.</li>
            <li>I wanted a set that would be good for every day use, like for going to class or the grocery store, but also be versatile so that I could use it for date night or a night at the bars with friends.</li>
            <li>I do apply a good primer on the lid.</li>
            <li>I like a smokey eye and this powder is a good one for that type of eye.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is really good as well.</li>
            <li>The color brushes on smoothly for ideal coverage.</li>

            <li>nice colors</li>

            <li>really nice colors.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my sister though, and she liked it .</li>
            <li>Excellent seller, highly recommended +</li>
            <li>I feel very attractive with my new make up.  </li>
            <li>- it spills easily around the face - so does not have a good \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; and \\&quot;staying\\&quot; in place where it should - even with primer.</li>
            <li>She was so happy with them that I had to try them myself -- and she&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this all matte pallette!  </li>
            <li>I sent a box of these shadows to my sister because the packaging is so pretty that it makes a great gift.</li>
            <li>The case is nice to hold and opens easily.  </li>
            <li>That could also be because I love bright fun colors.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite pallet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do well with shimmery shadow any more.  </li>
            <li>love this brand</li>
            <li>I love Too</li>
            <li>I love the matte colors.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and have another palette that is a nuetral set that had a lot more shimmer finishes to them</li>
            <li>another super product from Too Faced , with exceptional pricing.</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>I bought this as a reserve because I love it and none of the stores still had it.  </li>
            <li>had I known more about this brand before-hand and known the quality and colors to expect.</li>
            <li>Love the colors, love the matte look.</li>
            <li>Love the product and recommend them to friends and family.</li>
            <li>I have lighter skin so some of the colors take a bit more layering to show.</li>
            <li>Love the way</li>
            <li>I love the colors, the direction cards, and the packaging.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t worn much shadow until now and was happy to find some tips on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wanted some more matte.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more :)</li>
            <li>I recently bought this set and the eye shadow is excellent.</li>
            <li>The colors are lovely and i like mixing them as well.  </li>
            <li>This is such an awesome product for any makeup lover!!</li>
            <li>Most are glittery, and I don&#x27;t like that look.</li>
            <li>looking forward for more too faced products.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup.</li>
            <li>I get so many complements wearing these shades.</li>
            <li>but this one is the one I will be wearing the most.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Love it color are prefect for the matte look.</li>
            <li>The matte colors are great on older skin like mine and the color lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted a good matte set.</li>
            <li>I loved that the colors blend really well together.  </li>
            <li>This would have been easy to spot</li>
            <li>and they go on easy.</li>
            <li>This set offers a great range of colors (each looks fantastic on skin).  </li>
            <li>I especially love the cardboard box in place of a plastic box that will never break down.  </li>
            <li>The lids colors are fine</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no applicator included which is fine.</li>
            <li>The colors are smooth and blend well.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the product - love the box</li>
            <li>The colors are smooth with no fallout.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>The pigmentation of 2-3 colours could be better, but it doesn&#x27;t spoil the general nice impression.</li>
            <li>This product comes beautifully packaged and the cardboard box is held closed with magnets.  </li>
            <li>Great matt shadows that stay on a long time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After getting used to this higher end product I have started wearing this shadow more often.  </li>
            <li>Great colors, and the only all matte shadow collection with useful colors that I have found.</li>
            <li>Goes on extra smooth and looks good all day.</li>
            <li>I still recommend this palette for amazing matte colors that can be worn very natural day colors or for an evening darker look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for an older lady who may becoming a little creppy around her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So good, I never even thought to double check the item I got with the item listed.</li>
            <li>The pigments are vibrant and application is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>The packaging of this product is fabulous and the colors look pretty</li>
            <li>But when it does, its a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>This one doens&#x27;t have very pretty colors</li>
            <li>Was so excited to find a pallet of pretty eye shadows, ALL IN MATTE.  </li>
            <li>Since I purchased this product I haven&#x27;t used any other eye shadow I own or even my eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Searching for this matte collection has made my makeup different than the rest, and makes me feel stunning!</li>
            <li>Not as heavily pigmented as Lorac products but a GREAT shadow for aging eyes.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I had the natural Too Faced Collection and liked it a lot, only it had too many shiny colors</li>
            <li>Very natural and easy to wear.  </li>
            <li>i love that these shades are natural and contain no shimmer, i even double one shade for eye brow filler, recommend to anyone wanting a very natural look with/without a lot of make up the shades offer a variety either way, bit pricey but worth it, pigment on each color is nice</li>
            <li>Pretty colors, should come with brushes</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>Yes, you can have pretty smoky eye makeup</li>
            <li>A specialty eyeshadow brush gives better results than a tiny sponge applicator.</li>
            <li>I used it the first weekend i went out.</li>
            <li>Although initially  I had some concerns about the product  after using the shadow and speaking with the seller, I feel  better.  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>I love the combinations that are possible.</li>
            <li>The other colors are nice.</li>
            <li>However the other colors show nicely.</li>
            <li>It is very versatile for a variety of looks, day or night.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on here which were very helpful.</li>
            <li>find the color stays on till I wash it off, and I haven&#x27;t noticed much &amp;#34;fallout&amp;#34;, shadow where you don&#x27;t want</li>
            <li>but the shadow doesn&#x27;t seem to have much pigment and staying power even with using a primer.</li>
            <li>really like the cards that suggest how to wear the looks!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why some are saying that this eye shadow is too light and doesn&#x27;t last, and that the dust spreads around the face.  </li>
            <li>but I really like these.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The texture is exceptionally smooth and long wearing.</li>
            <li>The helpful cards give great ideas for how to wear this eye shadow during the day, and how to be a little more dramatic at night.</li>
            <li>The looks they give as samples are day, classic, and fashion.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to those over the age of 50, particularly (</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and decided that all the shiny, glittery eye make-up just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>I love the neutral shades for everyday and their durability.</li>
            <li>I am not a huge fan of the top row which is the netural colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a matte palette that&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free, but this one is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Faced especially since I only buy Cruelty Free products but the reason here for only 3 stars is because this eyeshafow kit was suspiciously missing the clear plastic protective film usually on top of the eye shadow and was not crazy about how the distributor here packaged the eye-shadow kit for mailing.  </li>
            <li>Color pay off not that rich, need to apply wet or pack on to the color advertised</li>
            <li>The soft teal green color is amazing -- was never able to find a green at all that looked good on my eyes.</li>
            <li>The light colors are quite light and the dark colors are quite dark.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I bought it from another Internet store that charges more than Amazon!</li>
            <li>but the quality is also far inferior.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>for mature women&#x27;s eyes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I checked against original and while names in palette are same the shades are certainly not.</li>
            <li>Getting older and eye shadows that I have used were not lasting.</li>
            <li>I am used to a more dramatic eye look</li>
            <li>As far as the colors I&#x27;ve only used the browns and once the blue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the company makes a wide variety of sets, this one includes matte, natural looking shades ranging from pales pinks to tawny browns to more dramatic violet and gray shades.</li>
            <li>The lights don&#x27;t seem to be very pigmented, so with the mediums being so dark, there just isn&#x27;t enough pigment in the lights to balance it out.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This would have been easy to spot</li>
            <li> and they go on easy.</li>
            <li> This set offers a great range of colors (each looks fantastic on skin).  </li>
            <li> I especially love the cardboard box in place of a plastic box that will never break down.  </li>
            <li> The lids colors are fine</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no applicator included which is fine.</li>
            <li> The colors are smooth and blend well.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the product - love the box</li>
            <li> The colors are smooth with no fallout.  </li>
            <li> and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> They go on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> The pigmentation of 2-3 colours could be better, but it doesn&#x27;t spoil the general nice impression.</li>
            <li> This product comes beautifully packaged and the cardboard box is held closed with magnets.  </li>
            <li> Great matt shadows that stay on a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After getting used to this higher end product I have started wearing this shadow more often.  </li>
            <li> Great colors, and the only all matte shadow collection with useful colors that I have found.</li>
            <li> Goes on extra smooth and looks good all day.</li>
            <li> I still recommend this palette for amazing matte colors that can be worn very natural day colors or for an evening darker look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for an older lady who may becoming a little creppy around her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So good, I never even thought to double check the item I got with the item listed.</li>
            <li> The pigments are vibrant and application is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> The packaging of this product is fabulous and the colors look pretty</li>
            <li> But when it does, its a very pretty color.</li>
            <li> This one doens&#x27;t have very pretty colors</li>
            <li> Was so excited to find a pallet of pretty eye shadows, ALL IN MATTE.  </li>
            <li> Since I purchased this product I haven&#x27;t used any other eye shadow I own or even my eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Searching for this matte collection has made my makeup different than the rest, and makes me feel stunning!</li>
            <li> Not as heavily pigmented as Lorac products but a GREAT shadow for aging eyes.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I had the natural Too Faced Collection and liked it a lot, only it had too many shiny colors</li>
            <li> Very natural and easy to wear.  </li>
            <li> i love that these shades are natural and contain no shimmer, i even double one shade for eye brow filler, recommend to anyone wanting a very natural look with/without a lot of make up the shades offer a variety either way, bit pricey but worth it, pigment on each color is nice</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, should come with brushes</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> Yes, you can have pretty smoky eye makeup</li>
            <li> A specialty eyeshadow brush gives better results than a tiny sponge applicator.</li>
            <li> I used it the first weekend i went out.</li>
            <li> Although initially  I had some concerns about the product  after using the shadow and speaking with the seller, I feel  better.  </li>
            <li> The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> I love the combinations that are possible.</li>
            <li> The other colors are nice.</li>
            <li> However the other colors show nicely.</li>
            <li> It is very versatile for a variety of looks, day or night.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on here which were very helpful.</li>
            <li> find the color stays on till I wash it off, and I haven&#x27;t noticed much &amp;#34;fallout&amp;#34;, shadow where you don&#x27;t want</li>
            <li> but the shadow doesn&#x27;t seem to have much pigment and staying power even with using a primer.</li>
            <li> really like the cards that suggest how to wear the looks!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some are saying that this eye shadow is too light and doesn&#x27;t last, and that the dust spreads around the face.  </li>
            <li> but I really like these.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The texture is exceptionally smooth and long wearing.</li>
            <li> The helpful cards give great ideas for how to wear this eye shadow during the day, and how to be a little more dramatic at night.</li>
            <li> The looks they give as samples are day, classic, and fashion.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to those over the age of 50, particularly (</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and decided that all the shiny, glittery eye make-up just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I love the neutral shades for everyday and their durability.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the top row which is the netural colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a matte palette that&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free, but this one is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Faced especially since I only buy Cruelty Free products but the reason here for only 3 stars is because this eyeshafow kit was suspiciously missing the clear plastic protective film usually on top of the eye shadow and was not crazy about how the distributor here packaged the eye-shadow kit for mailing.  </li>
            <li> Color pay off not that rich, need to apply wet or pack on to the color advertised</li>
            <li> The soft teal green color is amazing -- was never able to find a green at all that looked good on my eyes.</li>
            <li> The light colors are quite light and the dark colors are quite dark.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I bought it from another Internet store that charges more than Amazon!</li>
            <li> but the quality is also far inferior.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for mature women&#x27;s eyes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I checked against original and while names in palette are same the shades are certainly not.</li>
            <li> Getting older and eye shadows that I have used were not lasting.</li>
            <li> I am used to a more dramatic eye look</li>
            <li> As far as the colors I&#x27;ve only used the browns and once the blue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the company makes a wide variety of sets, this one includes matte, natural looking shades ranging from pales pinks to tawny browns to more dramatic violet and gray shades.</li>
            <li> The lights don&#x27;t seem to be very pigmented, so with the mediums being so dark, there just isn&#x27;t enough pigment in the lights to balance it out.  </li>
            <li> This palette is suppose to have light, medium and dark, but the mediums are just a little too dark for my taste.  </li>
            <li> The colors are long lasting and the combination works for all occasions, moods, outfits, hair colors and whatever else</li>
            <li> The little red ribbon is used to lift the box open.  </li>
            <li> brushes or mirror are included, and the box is too big for an average purse, so this is one to keep at home, not for on-the-go touchups.</li>
            <li> The shadow cubes were smaller than I expected, but a little goes a long way so to me</li>
            <li> I like a little shimmer under my brow and sometimes in the middle of my eyelid</li>
            <li> The lid has a little magnet on it, keeping the cover closed when not in use, and it comes with guides for different application techniques.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find matte eyeshadows outside of big department stores or specialty stores like Sephora.</li>
            <li> I only ended up liking a few of the colors.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette for the purple shade which wasn&#x27;t what I expected AT ALL.</li>
            <li> But I was disappointed that even when using the primer, the eye shadows do not spread evenly, they are messy and leave dust all under your eyes, and does not last more than a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> I had not expected such poor quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that the entire palette is matte but the colors are bland and some are a little chalky.</li>
            <li> I have the other pallets</li>
            <li> The other colors are way too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Sent from Ferg&#x27;s Trading Post... May not use them again as not sure why I did get wrong product in right looking packaging.</li>
            <li> Planning to get the other collection!</li>
            <li> I have a few other Too Faced palattes that I like, so I thought I would try this one too.</li>
            <li> but I do like about half the colors.</li>
            <li> but it is odd.</li>
            <li> I have become so addicted to too faced products, I&#x27;m ashamed to say that I&#x27;ve bought every one of these and use them religiously.</li>
            <li> I was really tired of shiny and shimmery eye shadows, but they were the only products I could find at stores.</li>
            <li> It looked too unnatural for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really hard to find matt shadows that are other colors than browns.  </li>
            <li> but they pale when applied - and the product gets all over</li>
            <li> I use the lightest brown for my base coat on the eyelid and continue with the other two browns in the crease for a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li> The pink in the very bottom row is my go to base shadow.</li>
            <li> I use this palette every now and then, and really only because I feel guilty spending the $36 to buy it.</li>
            <li> I usually mix with my shimmer eyeshadows to get the prefect look.</li>
            <li> Subtle and dramatic at the same time.</li>
            <li> Tough to find eyeshadows that aren&#x27;t shimmery.  </li>
            <li> but sadly it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> However, the eyeshadow colors I got are entirely wrong and of inferior quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using a fake for 6 months unknowingly.</li>
            <li> Think I got a fake.</li>
            <li> The base colors are dried out, I can&#x27;t get any color on the eyeshadow applicator.</li>
            <li> as anything sparkly merely ages us.</li>
            <li> How very sad.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> There is some fallout, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because it didn&#x27;t include applicators.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very disappointed .</li>
            <li> this is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite pallet. It is very versatile for a variety of looks, day or night.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors; does not show in crease of eye. I have brown eyes and it works wonderfully. Subtle and dramatic at the same time. The soft teal green color is amazing -- was never able to find a green at all that looked good on my eyes. Great for traveling. I just wish it had room for brushes and wasn&#x27;t cardboard. Wish it were a bit smaller for traveling</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, should come with brushes</li>
            <li> Great colors, and the only all matte shadow collection with useful colors that I have found. Compact enough for travel</li>
            <li> I have a few other Too Faced palattes that I like, so I thought I would try this one too. I only ended up liking a few of the colors. The other colors are way too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect matte matte eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> A necessity for those who don&#x27;t wear bright colours. The pigmentation of 2-3 colours could be better, but it doesn&#x27;t spoil the general nice impression.</li>
            <li> For some reason I keep reaching for this palette</li>
            <li> This product comes beautifully packaged and the cardboard box is held closed with magnets.  The little red ribbon is used to lift the box open.  Three cards are included in the box which shows how the product can be applied for different looks.  The looks they give as samples are day, classic, and fashion.  The product also comes with a one time eye primer sample.  Although I like the colors, I wish that this product came with an applicator.  The colors are smooth and blend well.</li>
            <li> I have two friends that just started using Too Faced and I purchased one for my daughter in law and one for me.  I got this palette because I wanted Matte colors for my age.  I don&#x27;t do well with shimmery shadow any more.  I did get the Cat Eyes palette for my daughter in law.  She looks awesome in these colors.  I feel very attractive with my new make up.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very natural and easy to wear.  It&#x27;s perfect for an older lady who may becoming a little creppy around her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I love this brand - this is my second purchase of the Product!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Very good service.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to find a pallet of pretty eye shadows, ALL IN MATTE.  Tough to find eyeshadows that aren&#x27;t shimmery.  But I was disappointed that even when using the primer, the eye shadows do not spread evenly, they are messy and leave dust all under your eyes, and does not last more than a couple of hours.  I had not expected such poor quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope they stick with the matte pallet concept...just improve the quality.</li>
            <li> I love Too Faced especially since I only buy Cruelty Free products but the reason here for only 3 stars is because this eyeshafow kit was suspiciously missing the clear plastic protective film usually on top of the eye shadow and was not crazy about how the distributor here packaged the eye-shadow kit for mailing.  But otherwise, I like the product.</li>
            <li> Great matt shadows that stay on a long time.  I think it&#x27;s really hard to find matt shadows that are other colors than browns.  I really like this!</li>
            <li> I have become so addicted to too faced products, I&#x27;m ashamed to say that I&#x27;ve bought every one of these and use them religiously.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller, highly recommended +++++A</li>
            <li> Great matte shadow, not all of the colors work for me (I&#x27;m a Winter tone) but I do like about half the colors.</li>
            <li> I love the matte colors. The pink in the very bottom row is my go to base shadow. The other colors are nice. I am not a huge fan of the top row which is the netural colors. That could also be because I love bright fun colors.</li>
            <li> Got this for my birthday and what a disapointment! No color coverage. Maybe I am just use to MAC but even with primer this is awful. How very sad.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette. I love this brand and have another palette that is a nuetral set that had a lot more shimmer finishes to them and I really wanted a good matte set. I read the reviews on here which were very helpful. I always use an eyeshadow primer such as urban decay&#x27;s primer potion, Benefit&#x27;s stay eye foundation, or my face foundation and none of them could get the white color to pop. I am giving this a 4 for that reason. The white doesn&#x27;t show up at all. I am Latina and I am medium skinned so the color should have showed some but sadly it didn&#x27;t. However the other colors show nicely. I still recommend this palette for amazing matte colors that can be worn very natural day colors or for an evening darker look.</li>
            <li> another super product from Too Faced , with exceptional pricing. This is a great product and lasts forever, so it was a great bargain.</li>
            <li> The packaging of this product is fabulous and the colors look pretty but they pale when applied - and the product gets all over - it spills easily around the face - so does not have a good \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; and \\&quot;staying\\&quot; in place where it should - even with primer. Not crazy about the product - love the box</li>
            <li> LOOKS GREAT, APPLIES, GREAT, BEST PRICE THAT I HAVE FOUND. GLAD THAT I SEARCHED AMAZON TO FIND A BETTER PRICE!!</li>
            <li> The matte colors are a perfect alternative to days when I don&#x27;t feel like sparkling all day. Beautiful smooth colors.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a reserve because I love it and none of the stores still had it.  I think it might be discontinued.</li>
            <li> I received this item from Ferg&#x27;s Trading Post in packaging that appeared beautiful and correct. So good, I never even thought to double check the item I got with the item listed. However, the eyeshadow colors I got are entirely wrong and of inferior quality. This would have been easy to spot had I known more about this brand before-hand and known the quality and colors to expect. I have been using a fake for 6 months unknowingly.</li>
            <li> Think I got a fake. I checked against original and while names in palette are same the shades are certainly not. If it were only a colour difference I would not mind but the quality is also far inferior. Maybe I got a bad batch but it is odd. Sent from Ferg&#x27;s Trading Post... May not use them again as not sure why I did get wrong product in right looking packaging.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, love the matte look. Goes on extra smooth and looks good all day. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The matte colors are great for me.  The palette comes with three cards to help you choose a different look.  The cards go in a slot so you always have them with you.  I was disappointed because it didn&#x27;t include applicators.  However, I use cosmetic brushes anyway so that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.  Pricey but well worth it.  I also have the Chocolate Bar palette and those colors are awesome and do smell like chocolate!  Love the product and recommend them to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have lighter skin so some of the colors take a bit more layering to show. But when it does, its a very pretty color. Planning to get the other collection!</li>
            <li> Love this palette! Can no longer find it in stores or even on the Too Faced website! It&#x27;s hard to find a matte palette that&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free, but this one is exactly what I needed! The colors go on well, with or without primer. Wore the brown shades for my wedding day.</li>
            <li> Love the way Too Faced packages their products. They also include a couple of &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; cards for getting different looks from the palette. The colors are smooth with no fallout.  They blend well and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I love the colors, the direction cards, and the packaging. The only problem is it does not come with an applicator like my last kit did. One would think, for the price paid, that an applicator would come with the kit.</li>
            <li> The light colors are quite light and the dark colors are quite dark.  I bought this for stage make up so the contrast has been nice.&lt;br /&gt;I find the color stays on till I wash it off, and I haven&#x27;t noticed much &amp;#34;fallout&amp;#34;, shadow where you don&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I benefited from some online tutorials, Goss on youtube specifically. I hadn&#x27;t worn much shadow until now and was happy to find some tips on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting used to this higher end product I have started wearing this shadow more often.  The shadow cubes were smaller than I expected, but a little goes a long way so to me it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> I like the color selection and the all matte finish but the shadow doesn&#x27;t seem to have much pigment and staying power even with using a primer.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I wear a primer base before putting on the eye shadow and it manages to look great all day long!&lt;br /&gt;The colors shown on the picture are the same you will receive.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the cards that suggest how to wear the looks!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a great buy. I love the neutral shades for everyday and their durability.</li>
            <li> I had the natural Too Faced Collection and liked it a lot, only it had too many shiny colors and I wanted some more matte. This one doens&#x27;t have very pretty colors and they go on easy. This is a great set and great eye shadow!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this all matte pallette!  Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more :)</li>
            <li> Colors are matt and gorgeous - will order from this company.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some are saying that this eye shadow is too light and doesn&#x27;t last, and that the dust spreads around the face.  I recently bought this set and the eye shadow is excellent. I apply it over set foundation and have no problem with even coverage. The matte colors are great on older skin like mine and the color lasts all day.  I especially love the cardboard box in place of a plastic box that will never break down.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  My only complaint is that I bought it from another Internet store that charges more than Amazon!</li>
            <li> This eye shadow collection is perfect. I wanted a set that would be good for every day use, like for going to class or the grocery store, but also be versatile so that I could use it for date night or a night at the bars with friends. The helpful cards give great ideas for how to wear this eye shadow during the day, and how to be a little more dramatic at night. Since I purchased this product I haven&#x27;t used any other eye shadow I own or even my eyeliner! I was really tired of shiny and shimmery eye shadows, but they were the only products I could find at stores. Searching for this matte collection has made my makeup different than the rest, and makes me feel stunning!</li>
            <li> The base colors are dried out, I can&#x27;t get any color on the eyeshadow applicator. The lids colors are fine but I&#x27;m very disappointed .</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye shadow EVER!  Am so upset they quit making it.  I&#x27;ve got a couple of extras stashed.</li>
            <li> The perfect matte eye collection.  I bought several different kinds but this is the best.</li>
            <li> I am used to a more dramatic eye look but I really like these.  The colors are lovely and i like mixing them as well.  Very happy I bought these</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome product for any makeup lover!! The colors are even prettier in person that what they appear as in the photo&#x27;s online! I was very impressed and have fallen even more in love with the Too Faced company :)</li>
            <li> This is my fav eye contour palette</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this palette for about 2 years and I can&#x27;t imagine switching. The colors are long lasting and the combination works for all occasions, moods, outfits, hair colors and whatever else I keep changing. This remains my constant.</li>
            <li> Every sparkle or satin finish eyeshadow I tried caused a flare up of my eyes. I can wear these colors with no problem. I do apply a good primer on the lid. Remember to tap the brush to remove excess to prevent fallout. Build the colors by pressing onto lid NOT stroking across. Yes, you can have pretty smoky eye makeup too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for mature women&#x27;s eyes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can even dance (and sweat) with this makeup staying put for hours!</li>
            <li> no brushes and too big to carry in a purse and no mirror.&lt;br /&gt;but nice colors and i like that it&#x27;s matte and not sparkly</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my own use.  The case is nice to hold and opens easily.  As far as the colors I&#x27;ve only used the browns and once the blue.  I like a smokey eye and this powder is a good one for that type of eye.  I use the lightest brown for my base coat on the eyelid and continue with the other two browns in the crease for a more dramatic look.  My eye makeup is never the same two days in a row and I can use this palate to mix my \\&quot;look\\&quot; up.  The colors are all matte so don&#x27;t expect any shimmer at all.  I like a little shimmer under my brow and sometimes in the middle of my eyelid so I have to use another product for that look.  I would recommend this product because of the quality and choice of colors.</li>
            <li> Getting older and eye shadows that I have used were not lasting. I read that too faced was great for women in their 40s. This is the BEST eye shadow ever and I wish I found it earlier</li>
            <li> though there are many colors I wouldn&#x27;t use, I think this is THE best matte collection, period.  I recommend it to those over the age of 50, particularly (and some 40+ who have the wrinkles around the eye area) as anything sparkly merely ages us.</li>
            <li> Not as heavily pigmented as Lorac products but a GREAT shadow for aging eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find matte eyeshadows outside of big department stores or specialty stores like Sephora. Most are glittery, and I don&#x27;t like that look. This collection of matte shadows is terrific. The texture is exceptionally smooth and long wearing. The colors are great, and there are shades for daytime and drama, too. The lid has a little magnet on it, keeping the cover closed when not in use, and it comes with guides for different application techniques. There&#x27;s no applicator included which is fine. A specialty eyeshadow brush gives better results than a tiny sponge applicator.</li>
            <li> I like that the entire palette is matte but the colors are bland and some are a little chalky. I experienced a lot of fall out with the highlight colors.  I bought this palette for the purple shade which wasn&#x27;t what I expected AT ALL. I use this palette every now and then, and really only because I feel guilty spending the $36 to buy it.</li>
            <li> Like it alot !really nice colors. looking forward for more too faced products. I used it the first weekend i went out.</li>
            <li> I sent a box of these shadows to my sister because the packaging is so pretty that it makes a great gift. She was so happy with them that I had to try them myself -- and she&#x27;s right. The color brushes on smoothly for ideal coverage. The set includes instruction cards for three different looks, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the company makes a wide variety of sets, this one includes matte, natural looking shades ranging from pales pinks to tawny browns to more dramatic violet and gray shades. It&#x27;ll take you from polished day looks to smoky eyes for evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No brushes or mirror are included, and the box is too big for an average purse, so this is one to keep at home, not for on-the-go touchups.</li>
            <li> This set offers a great range of colors (each looks fantastic on skin).  The pigments are vibrant and application is very smooth.  I loved that the colors blend really well together.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this makeup. I get so many complements wearing these shades. The colors make my eye look amazing. I have the other pallets but this one is the one I will be wearing the most.</li>
            <li> Although initially  I had some concerns about the product  after using the shadow and speaking with the seller, I feel  better.  The colors are pretty. Recommend using an eye primer.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and decided that all the shiny, glittery eye make-up just didn&#x27;t do much for me. It looked too unnatural for everyday wear. These matte colors are beautiful and easy to apply with eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> i love that these shades are natural and contain no shimmer, i even double one shade for eye brow filler, recommend to anyone wanting a very natural look with/without a lot of make up the shades offer a variety either way, bit pricey but worth it, pigment on each color is nice</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the matte colors.  This is just what I wanted.  They go on smoothly and evenly.  I love the combinations that are possible.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and I really love it. I get compliments everytime I wear one of these looks.I wear all three of the looks all the time. I use the eyeshadow primer by Too Faced under these colors and they seem to last all day. There is some fallout, but not too bad. The packaging is really good as well.</li>
            <li> Love it color are prefect for the matte look. I usually mix with my shimmer eyeshadows to get the prefect look. Color pay off not that rich, need to apply wet or pack on to the color advertised</li>
            <li> This palette is suppose to have light, medium and dark, but the mediums are just a little too dark for my taste.  The lights don&#x27;t seem to be very pigmented, so with the mediums being so dark, there just isn&#x27;t enough pigment in the lights to balance it out.  I gave it to my sister though, and she liked it .</li>
