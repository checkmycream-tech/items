    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with it and would recommend Lipstix Remix.</li>
            <li>All my friends are impressed as well, and couldn&#x27;t believe I did it.  </li>
            <li>I guess practise will make perfect.  </li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I used this product today and I have to say it is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I purchased the LipStix ReMix system in hopes of making my own lispticks.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how the re-mixed lipstick look --- it was perfect, like brand new.  </li>
            <li>It did everything it claimed, and was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and then I was ALMOST able to create my own lipstick with wax and color additives.</li>
            <li>I loved mixing two or three colors to come up with a new great color.  </li>
            <li>By the time I would have to use four lipsticks to make another one I&#x27;m sure they would be expired so I would throw them away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO glad that I ordered this kit, and you will be, too.  </li>
            <li>The lipstick is now in better shape than when I bought it.</li>
            <li>It worked perfect and it is simple.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to make more.  </li>
            <li>:&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the Lipstick Remix mold had some sort of internal leaking problem, which prevented it from making a perfect &#x27;tube&#x27; shape out of the lipstick.</li>
            <li>I recommend throw away gloves for clean up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Easy to us.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s shockingly easy to do, what did we even do before this exsisted?</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>It really does work,  and the neat thing is you can make your own custom colors.</li>
            <li>This is actually fun to do, and I&#x27;m in love with the kit.  </li>
            <li>I have made so many amazing new colors, it&#x27;s been well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now so glad that I held onto all of my \\&quot;old\\&quot; lipstick tubes that were \\&quot;used up\\&quot; since there is a bunch more lipstick in every tube that you can scoop out and melt into a new lipstick.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to do and fun.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to do, and kinda fun.  </li>
            <li>I love my new colors.  </li>
            <li>I needed more than 3 &amp;#34;used up&amp;#34; lipsticks to make a new one, though.</li>
            <li>This product is so much fun.  </li>
            <li>Smart product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s remarkably easy, and the kit comes with everything you&#x27;ll need to recycle your old lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>Oh contra, this was easy as pie and and not messy at all.  </li>
            <li>you are ok with making only 1 lipstick at time, then this kit is for you, if not...</li>
            <li>I dug out the last part of 4 old tubes of lipstick that I liked.</li>
            <li>well I found mine and started blending my old and half tubes of lipstick into great new ones.  </li>
            <li>Mixed, melted &amp; cooled them like the instructions said, which was easy.</li>
            <li>Very clever.</li>
            <li>I can even fit the new lipsticks in my old YSL tubes so they look just as swanky as a brand new tube!  </li>
            <li>and I have been having so much fun restoring my old lipsticks...</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was a much cheaper alternative to the metal lipstick molds that cost hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>(HIGHLY recommend their products for cosmetics crafters!)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>What appeared to be a little bit, was a lot more than I thought.  </li>
            <li>I suggest using a cheap lipstick the first time you use this product because you will need a little practice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather buy a new tube than spend the money for this kit.</li>
            <li>Now they look like a new tube of lipstick.</li>
            <li>and melting them together to make a new lipstick.</li>
            <li>With the lipstix remix I can now retrieve the remaining product and create a brand new tube of lipstick.</li>
            <li>I produced a new mixed color on the first try.</li>
            <li>Gave this lso to a friend who saves her precious left-over lipstick in a small canister.</li>
            <li>I called MULTIPLE times on many different days and times, and yet noone EVER picked up the phone or even called back.</li>
            <li>Cleanup was easy for the mold; the little measuring cup was messier.</li>
            <li>Only if you get some mix outside then it is a lot of work to clean up.</li>
            <li>The second time, I was able to put my broken lipstick very easily into one of the four empty lipstick tubes that comes with this kit.</li>
            <li>I purchased the LipStix Remix system because I had all of these tubes of my favorite lipstick with just a little bit left in the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I think I was asking for too much, because although the kit is quite comprehensive, it only includes 1 mold, so I was stuck making one lipstick at a time.  </li>
            <li>When I combined what was left of a few tubes, I created a full lipstick!  </li>
            <li>The quality of your end product will be the same quality as the lipstick was when you bought it new.  </li>
            <li>Following the directions, as written, makes for a very professional looking finished product.  </li>
            <li>Lipstix Remix is advertised as a way to save money by digging out the lipstick from old tubes (and I found that there is a ton of the stuff still left inside!)</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly and had no problems, though microwaving took a little longer.  </li>
            <li>The kit works well, except be ready for the mess.  </li>
            <li>I give it a 4 instead of 5 because clean up is really messy if you&#x27;re using a dark lipstick.</li>

            <li> This price of this product already paid for itself as I re-used Clinque, Mary Kay and a couple of other expensive lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I also have some tubes of lipstick where the lipstick broke after 2 or 3 uses, and now I can fix the broken lipsticks that otherwise would be useless and messy.</li>
            <li> This is going to save me just crazy amounts of money!</li>

            <li> By the time I would have to use four lipsticks to make another one I&#x27;m sure they would be expired so I would throw them away. I&#x27;d rather buy a new tube than spend the money for this kit.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Shark Tank and decided to give it a try.  It was easy to do and fun.  I was amazed at how the re-mixed lipstick look --- it was perfect, like brand new.  I followed the instructions exactly and had no problems, though microwaving took a little longer.  I loved mixing two or three colors to come up with a new great color.  This price of this product already paid for itself as I re-used Clinque, Mary Kay and a couple of other expensive lipsticks.</li>
            <li> An absolute waste of money.  Could not get the lipstick out of the tube - tried to put it in freezer and still would not work.  Had bought one for a friend also and what a waste.</li>
            <li> I purchased the LipStix Remix system because I had all of these tubes of my favorite lipstick with just a little bit left in the bottom.  What appeared to be a little bit, was a lot more than I thought.  When I combined what was left of a few tubes, I created a full lipstick!  It was easy to do, and kinda fun.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  I produced a new mixed color on the first try. Cleanup was easy for the mold; the little measuring cup was messier. I suspect I may purchase some small disposable cups to mix/melt in.  And for anyone who&#x27;s wondering, using a flavored(butter) non-stick spray (all I had on hand) to grease the mold did not affect the finished product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after seeing it advertised on a morning talk show.  It really does work,  and the neat thing is you can make your own custom colors.</li>
            <li> Saw Rachel Ray try Lipstix Remix on her show so I decided to try it. It worked great. I dug out the last part of 4 old tubes of lipstick that I liked. Mixed, melted &amp; cooled them like the instructions said, which was easy. Now they look like a new tube of lipstick. I am very happy with it and would recommend Lipstix Remix.</li>
            <li> Got it for xmas.  and I have been having so much fun restoring my old lipsticks...they say the average woman has about 20 lipsticks laying around well I found mine and started blending my old and half tubes of lipstick into great new ones.  Easy to us.  Just follow the simple directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO glad that I ordered this kit, and you will be, too.  It&#x27;s remarkably easy, and the kit comes with everything you&#x27;ll need to recycle your old lipsticks.  The quality of your end product will be the same quality as the lipstick was when you bought it new.

            <li> It worked perfect and it is simple. I made a couple lipsticks. Only if you get some mix outside then it is a lot of work to clean up. A must have ladies.</li>
            <li> I used this product today and I have to say it is amazing!  If you follow directions, it works to a T!!! I love my new colors.  I recommend throw away gloves for clean up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This product is so much fun.  I read reviews that said the product was messy.  Oh contra, this was easy as pie and and not messy at all.  Following the directions, as written, makes for a very professional looking finished product.  All my friends are impressed as well, and couldn&#x27;t believe I did it.  Can&#x27;t wait to make more.  Luv it!  Luv it!  Luv it!</li>
            <li> Quite a little invention for frugal people like me.  That stick of lipstick left is such a waste!  The kit works well, except be ready for the mess.  Get some rags to wipe off waxy lipstick.  I guess practise will make perfect.  Gave this lso to a friend who saves her precious left-over lipstick in a small canister.</li>
            <li> I purchased the LipStix ReMix system in hopes of making my own lispticks.  I think I was asking for too much, because although the kit is quite comprehensive, it only includes 1 mold, so I was stuck making one lipstick at a time.  With my limited time, this only meant I could make 1 lipstick every 6 months. :&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are ok with making only 1 lipstick at time, then this kit is for you, if not... I don&#x27;t suggest this kit.</li>
            <li> It did everything it claimed, and was very easy to use.  I needed more than 3 &amp;#34;used up&amp;#34; lipsticks to make a new one, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a much cheaper alternative to the metal lipstick molds that cost hundreds of dollars. Well, you get what you pay for. This mold didn&#x27;t work at all. for repairing lipsticks, I got NOWHERE with it. I had to buy additional supplies off TKBtrading.com (HIGHLY recommend their products for cosmetics crafters!) and then I was ALMOST able to create my own lipstick with wax and color additives. However, the Lipstick Remix mold had some sort of internal leaking problem, which prevented it from making a perfect &#x27;tube&#x27; shape out of the lipstick. Complete waste of money, very disappointed. DO NOT BUY! The rest of the supplies that come with it (spatulas, jars, tubes) are fine, but the MOLD itself which is what you probably bought the kit for, is useless.</li>
            <li> I called MULTIPLE times on many different days and times, and yet noone EVER picked up the phone or even called back. The phone just kept ringing and ringing and ringing until I finally hung up. It&#x27;s been at least 2 months now (I called in November 2012). I even emailed them, and received an automated response saying that they had received my email and would respond &amp;#34;within 24 hours&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s been 2 months and I&#x27;ve heard NOTHING from them. The reason why I wanted to contact them was because I wanted to know what type of plastic the lipstick mold was made of. I don&#x27;t need any cancer-causing chemicals (like BPA) to be leeching into the lipstick I make. I also wanted to know where the lipstick mold was made of. When I received the product, all it said was &amp;#34;Made in the U.S.A. of U.S. and imported parts&amp;#34;. I checked every product that was in the kit, and I found nothing except a &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; sticker on the bag of empty lipstick tubes.</li>
            <li> Smart product! I always hated throwing away expensive lipstick when I could see there was more product below the &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; line. With the lipstix remix I can now retrieve the remaining product and create a brand new tube of lipstick. Very clever.</li>
