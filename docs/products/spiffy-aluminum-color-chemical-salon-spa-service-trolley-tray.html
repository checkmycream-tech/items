            <li> Although these products are designed for hair stylists, they can also be used right in your home.  For years, I have griped about hair, nail, and beauty products strewn all over the place.  Not anymore!  Now, she has a safe place to put these things and to let tools cool down while she is getting styled up.  This makes a great addition to the trolly also offered by this company.  The delivery was fast.  The packaging was very sturdy.  And the product is well-built, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your sanity and let your teenage girls build a pseudo-salon in their bedrooms!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this well made cart to use in my salon!</li>

            <li> I have a mobility impairment and walk with a cane.  This means that when moving articles from room to room I only have one useful hand.  I saw this tray in my hair salon and thought it just might work for me.  I purchased two: one for home and one for my office.  I am  more than pleased!  They are lightweight and the height is easily adjustable.  The casters roll very smoothly -- I never spill my tea now.  I might be purchasing more for other locations.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble, lightweight, rolls easy, easy to clean, and professional looking! Would buy this item again in the future if needed</li>
