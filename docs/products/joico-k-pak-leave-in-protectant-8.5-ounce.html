    <ol>
            <li>so you wont feel weight on your hair, and it do a great job</li>
            <li>I think it is amazing!</li>
            <li>really good for the hair...</li>
            <li>The hair stylist used this product on my hair and I loved it</li>
            <li>I didn’t expect it to detangle my hair; for me, most leave in conditioners don’t detangle my hair, so I use a product that is specifically for detangling hair (great stuff by the way).</li>
            <li>glad i tried this!</li>
            <li>this is a keeper for sure!</li>
            <li>Love how this product makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li>However, if you have the kind of hair I have DO NOT add this product to your regimen.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair without having this leave in conditioner to top it off.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and smooth and feels wonderful as well.</li>
            <li>Item did not come with top cover, I do a lot of traveling</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll just have to give it more time.</li>
            <li>I am sure the K-Pak made my hair stronger but that matters none if you can&#x27;t comb it easily after using it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a light foam, very light...</li>
            <li>this really works great and keeps my colored hair vibrant!  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even feel comfortable putting it in my hair.</li>
            <li>However, for right now I am pleased with the product and am excited to see how well it works over time.</li>
            <li>This is not like the original product I once used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used leave-on protein spray for several years, and that has been somewhat successful in keeping my hair healthy, but I noticed a step change in how healthy my hair looks and how soft it feels when I tried Joico K-Pak Leave-in Protectant.</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; and sticky....does NOT spray, but comes out like melting cool whip.  </li>
            <li>It is light, doesn’t weigh my hair down and smells great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it locally and glad they have it online here!</li>
            <li>Great product, a little pricey.</li>
            <li>All the conditioners mentioned leave my hair soft, silky, smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my fourth product from this line, and I’ve been very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>As far as it being a good protectant, I think I’ll have to wait a few months to be able to determine that; I live in the Midwest</li>
            <li>This product pretty much does it all.  </li>
            <li>Further my hair is easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be on the dry side, and this leave-in conditioner takes care of the &#x27;fly-aways&#x27; without that greasy after-feeling that I have experienced with some other products.  </li>
            <li>with either the K-pak Revitalux, Moisture Recovery Hair Mask, or K-pak Reconstructor w/ Intense Hydrator.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll I don&#x27;t see much effect.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave hair soft, more the opposite acctually</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say about this Leave In-Protectant is that it does not weigh down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was out of town and left my other leave in conditioner at home; I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>From the first day I tried this, my hair has been soft and shiny and the appearance of breakage is minimized.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair easy to comb out wet and my hair is then very soft when it dries.</li>
            <li>It conditions &amp; holds hairs in place without the sticky or crunchy feeling of normal hair styling creams or jels.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this for the first time in the store.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine, color-treated hair which I blow dry everyday.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s naturally kinky hair w/o a relaxer)so</li>
            <li>Just soft natural feeling hair.</li>
            <li>I was drawn to this product b/c of my success with Joico&#x27;s other products in the K-pak and Moisture Recovery lines.</li>
            <li>I first used this in spray form, but the foam provides volume such that I don&#x27;t need to use a second product to get body.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it is fine, so it is hard to style without products and heat to add volume.</li>
            <li>my hair was never smooth, in fact, it felt dry and it tangled easily.</li>
            <li>I generally like Joico products and especially the K-Pak line</li>

            <li> really good for the hair... it&#x27;s a light foam, very light... so you wont feel weight on your hair, and it do a great job</li>
            <li> I have relaxed african american hair.  I was drawn to this product b/c of my success with Joico&#x27;s other products in the K-pak and Moisture Recovery lines. I wanted to try a leave in conditioner/product instead of the setting mouse I usually use when I do my roller set. So I bought the Leave In-Protectant b/c it states on the bottle that it finalizes the conditioning process by sealing the cuticle, which adds shine and detangles. Ha! Every time I used the Leave In-Protectant it seemed to do the opposite b/c my hair was never smooth, in fact, it felt dry and it tangled easily. Keep in mind that I used this product after I sat under the dryer for 20 min. with either the K-pak Revitalux, Moisture Recovery Hair Mask, or K-pak Reconstructor w/ Intense Hydrator. (I alternate depending on the week).  All the conditioners mentioned leave my hair soft, silky, smooth. Further my hair is easy to detangle. The only good thing I can say about this Leave In-Protectant is that it does not weigh down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the product does not work for me because of my hair type (my hair is relaxed but it&#x27;s naturally kinky hair w/o a relaxer)so I can&#x27;t tell you not to buy it. However, if you have the kind of hair I have DO NOT add this product to your regimen.</li>
            <li> I generally like Joico products and especially the K-Pak line but this one is disappointing, I did nothing to soften my hair or make it easier to comb in fact I felt it did the opposite.  I am sure the K-Pak made my hair stronger but that matters none if you can&#x27;t comb it easily after using it.</li>
            <li> This product pretty much does it all.  It made the tangles fall out before I got to them and had to rip hair out, it seemed to protect my hair from the heat, AND it left my hair feeling like I had used an extra conditioner.</li>
            <li> glad i tried this! this really works great and keeps my colored hair vibrant!  this is a keeper for sure!</li>
            <li> Fake! When I got it, it was leaking everywhere and I didn&#x27;t even feel comfortable putting it in my hair. Threw away</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it is fine, so it is hard to style without products and heat to add volume. Thus the ends tend to dry out and split. I&#x27;ve used leave-on protein spray for several years, and that has been somewhat successful in keeping my hair healthy, but I noticed a step change in how healthy my hair looks and how soft it feels when I tried Joico K-Pak Leave-in Protectant. I first used this in spray form, but the foam provides volume such that I don&#x27;t need to use a second product to get body.</li>
            <li> Great product, a little pricey.</li>
            <li> My picky husband has been using this for years, so I was ticked when I wasn&#x27;t seeing it on the shelf at salons. It conditions &amp; holds hairs in place without the sticky or crunchy feeling of normal hair styling creams or jels. Just soft natural feeling hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair easy to comb out wet and my hair is then very soft when it dries.</li>
            <li> I was having problems with my hair drying out and breaking off. I have pretty fine, color-treated hair which I blow dry everyday. From the first day I tried this, my hair has been soft and shiny and the appearance of breakage is minimized. I think it is amazing!</li>
            <li> The hair stylist used this product on my hair and I loved it so I bought some. I feel it has helped my severly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; and sticky....does NOT spray, but comes out like melting cool whip.  This is not like the original product I once used.  Supposed &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; are not improvements at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair without having this leave in conditioner to top it off. I can&#x27;t find it locally and glad they have it online here!</li>
            <li> (Hair type: Relaxed African American) I actually purchased this for the first time in the store. I was out of town and left my other leave in conditioner at home; I was very pleased with this product. It states it’s a leave in protectant, so I didn’t expect it to detangle my hair; for me, most leave in conditioners don’t detangle my hair, so I use a product that is specifically for detangling hair (great stuff by the way). It is light, doesn’t weigh my hair down and smells great. My hair is soft and smooth and feels wonderful as well. As far as it being a good protectant, I think I’ll have to wait a few months to be able to determine that; I live in the Midwest so I think the weather there will give this product a run for its money. However, for right now I am pleased with the product and am excited to see how well it works over time. This is my fourth product from this line, and I’ve been very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Item did not come with top cover, I do a lot of traveling but I am unable to take this with me since there is no top :-(</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll I don&#x27;t see much effect. Maybe I&#x27;ll just have to give it more time. Don&#x27;t leave hair soft, more the opposite acctually</li>
            <li> Love how this product makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> Joico K-Pak has been a product in my shower for about 15 years. I have thick, course-textured, shoulder length hair and as a detangle, moisturizer and leave in conditioner, this has always worked well for me. It leaves my hair soft and manageable, and never weighs it down. My hair tends to be on the dry side, and this leave-in conditioner takes care of the &#x27;fly-aways&#x27; without that greasy after-feeling that I have experienced with some other products.  Although I have tried several other products, I always seem to come back to Joico Leave-In Protectant.</li>
