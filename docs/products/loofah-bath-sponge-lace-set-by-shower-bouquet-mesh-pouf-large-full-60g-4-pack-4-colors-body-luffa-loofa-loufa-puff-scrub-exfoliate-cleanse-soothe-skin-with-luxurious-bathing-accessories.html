            <li>They&#x27;ll make nice gifts too.</li>
            <li>Regardless, my opinion is 100% my own.</li>

            <li>and I can easily scrubb without dropping it to the bottom of the shower!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better experience.</li>

            <li>Love the ribbon for hanging...</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>LOVE THESE BATH POUF&#x27;S!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love them.....</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the reviews, and so glad I read them.</li>
            <li>I will reorder this product when I need more.</li>
            <li>I definitely love these sponges.</li>
            <li>I love this pouf.</li>
            <li>the lacey look is super cute!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, soft, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>These poufs are very full and adorable with the lace trim.  </li>
            <li>The puffs are very full and luxurious.</li>
            <li>These were nice bath pouf&#x27;s however, I do not think they were worth the price paid.</li>
            <li>I received a pack of Bath Sponge Pouf in 4 different happy colors and I love them.</li>
            <li>I use them with my favorite body wash and when I&#x27;m done showering I feel clean and not like I&#x27;ve been through a meat grinder.</li>
            <li>I am actually using them as part of a centerpiece for my daughter&#x27;s baby shower and they look beautiful in the planter that I am making.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty...look like flowers...larger than most!</li>
            <li>The sponges are fantastic.</li>
            <li>They come in 4 different colors and are over sized which is great to hold on to.</li>
            <li>However, please note, they are &amp;#34;lacey.&amp;#34; They feel amazing, but they are very &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>really soft and holds the bath wash in exceptional</li>
            <li>These bath poufs are well made and stand up to the test of making a rich lather while also having some scrubbing power.</li>
            <li>Super soft and nice quality.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely be purchasing more for myself.</li>
            <li>They lather better and seem to wash better than traditional poufs as well.</li>
            <li>They are so pretty and feel fabulous on the skin.</li>
            <li>I simply fell in love with the Shower Bouquet bath sponge the minute I lathered up!</li>
            <li>My whole family loves it!!  </li>
            <li>I only use body wash for my soap and these are much better than the $1 ones I used to get at walmart!</li>
            <li>Because it has so many layers, you can use less soap than you would with more cheaply made poufs.</li>
            <li>so the four different colors just makes it easier for us to have and use our own.....</li>
            <li>NICE AND BIG...</li>
            <li>HOWEVER WISH YOU HAD MORE MASCULINE COLORS, CHOICES ARE FEMININE.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re worth it&#x27;</li>
            <li>I was so happy to receive this extra large super soft set of poufs</li>
            <li>I put one in my travel kit right away.</li>
            <li>They are great no more rags for me</li>
            <li>Pretty too.</li>
            <li>But despite the size being the same, I still like these better.</li>
            <li>Thanks for agreat product!</li>
            <li>Used one, and gave one as a gift yesterday, I love mine, so much thicker and nicer than what you can buy locally.</li>
            <li>This large sponge foams up quickly with very little soap or body wash and it feels nice against your skin.</li>
            <li>There is a very pretty soft pink, a pretty soft blue, a nice light purple and my favorite a sunshine yellow.</li>
            <li>These were posted as LARGE and that&#x27;s why I ordered them.  </li>
            <li>Varied textures in a large, well-made pouf.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure luxury.</li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>Lathers up real well.</li>
            <li>These have a eyelet lace edging which make them so much prettier.</li>
            <li>received this product free of charge for review purposes only.</li>
            <li>They are softer but still suds up very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These poufs are very large and soft.</li>
            <li>The ribbon is nice compared to usual rope.</li>
            <li>high quality.</li>
            <li>Love this, just rough enough to exfoliate gently.</li>
            <li>Soft and supple, and exfoliates in a gentle way.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy pouf yet touches your skin in a soft luxurious way.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made of soft mesh and are super big and puffy.</li>
            <li>Pay a little more for a quality product that you will enjoy using everyday....</li>
            <li>Soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 3&amp;#34; covered in tattoos and my girlfriend likes for my skin to be soft.</li>
            <li>Extra large, extra lush and soft!</li>
            <li>I like that the material feels more like fabric and less rough.</li>
            <li>I have used other smaller bath sponges and its true.....</li>
            <li>Was afraid they would start unraveling after the first few showers but my first is still going strong!</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the large thick sponges because it holds the lather and actually saves you money because a little body wash goes a longer way.</li>

            <li> These Shower Bouquet sponge poufs are great. They are so pretty and feel fabulous on the skin. My husband loves them too. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> These poufs are very large and soft. Definitely a step above the ones I purchase in the store</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive this extra large super soft set of poufs</li>
            <li> These are by far the best! Soft and luxurious. Lather well and rinse out well. The ribbon is nice compared to usual rope.</li>
            <li> Really great product.  I have used other smaller bath sponges and its true..... you get what you paid for.  I enjoy using the large thick sponges because it holds the lather and actually saves you money because a little body wash goes a longer way. We are a family of four so the four different colors just makes it easier for us to have and use our own.....Pay a little more for a quality product that you will enjoy using everyday....</li>
            <li> Extra large, extra lush and soft! These are wonderful, and the lace isn&#x27;t scratchy at all. Because it has so many layers, you can use less soap than you would with more cheaply made poufs. My husband even loves these.</li>
            <li> I received one of these loofah&#x27;s as a gift from the company. High quality product! I love it and will definitely be purchasing more for myself. Great gift idea too!</li>
            <li> These are great! Not too soft, not too rough. Just perfect!</li>
            <li> I received a pack of Bath Sponge Pouf in 4 different happy colors and I love them. This large sponge foams up quickly with very little soap or body wash and it feels nice against your skin.</li>
            <li> The sponges are fantastic. Thank you</li>
            <li> Night and Day. I can&#x27;t believe the difference between these shower poufs and the ones I have used all my life!&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality. Soft and thick. I put one in my travel kit right away. They&#x27;ll make nice gifts too. Big thumbs-up.</li>
            <li> Works excellently.. Lathers up real well.</li>
            <li> I love  this product !!! The package included 4 different colors.  The sponge pouf feels wonderful when taking a bath. You do get a lot of suds.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful colors! Traditional Shower Poufs are just the netting. These have a eyelet lace edging which make them so much prettier. The pictures do not do the colors justice. There is a very pretty soft pink, a pretty soft blue, a nice light purple and my favorite a sunshine yellow. You can see in the picture below the one I just used was sunshine yellow. There are so many great crafts you could use these for aside from just giving them as a gift. You can make them into animals, use them as roses for a bridal shower, all you have to do is go to pinterest and put in crafts and bath pouf and the things you can do will abound. The customer service from this company was amazing. I was taken care of from the moment we started talking until they arrived in my mailbox! I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better experience. They lather better and seem to wash better than traditional poufs as well.</li>
            <li> finally found the perfect pouf!</li>
            <li> They r gud but just little bit small</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself to see if I wanted to give them as gifts, and I definitely do.  They are very pretty - the colors are great - and they feel great when you use them.  Perfect gifts - for me too.</li>
            <li> Undersized and don&#x27;t expect them to survive for long</li>
            <li> Love this, just rough enough to exfoliate gently. Great product.</li>
            <li> These bath poufs are well made and stand up to the test of making a rich lather while also having some scrubbing power. They come in 4 different colors and are over sized which is great to hold on to. I like the ribbon handle too...my hand fits well and I can easily scrubb without dropping it to the bottom of the shower! The combo of lace and mesh is really a great idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free of charge for review purposes only. Regardless, my opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Perfect.</li>
            <li> Super soft and nice quality. My wife and I both use these when we shower.  It&#x27;s like a $100 spa treatment while just taking a shower.</li>
            <li> i love these! the lacey look is super cute! and i loved mine so much i will eb givin away the other few to help spread the word!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Very fluffy.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I simply fell in love with the Shower Bouquet bath sponge the minute I lathered up! Soft and supple, and exfoliates in a gentle way. Great gift idea: bridal shower souvenirs, bath/body gift baskets and as stocking stuffers. Oh, must admit the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> These were nice bath pouf&#x27;s however, I do not think they were worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Saves on bath wash too because they lather with less! Love the ribbon for hanging... No rope to get in the way of the luxurious scrub!</li>
            <li> Very nice in the bath. Pretty too.</li>
            <li> They are great no more rags for me</li>
            <li> great item to buy with great shipping.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves it!!  Full, fluffy and firm enough so it doesn&#x27;t slip off from my hand. This one is NOT like the one my wife and daughter has been using. Its like between Japanese scrub towel and  sea-sponge.  Great!!</li>
            <li> These poufs are very full and adorable with the lace trim.  Before I reviewed these sponges, I wanted to see how they came out after cleaning them in the washing machine.  They did wash beautifully and I have put them through the washing machine 3X but do not put them in a dryer just let air dry.</li>
            <li> Love these. Well made, a bit tight and stiff at first but after using them a couple of times they soften up. They are soft but also rough enough to exfoliate if needed. I will purchase these again</li>
            <li> I thought these would be much bigger than my usual bath pouf (see picture; green is my typical one; yellow is from this order).  But despite the size being the same, I still like these better. They are softer but still suds up very well.  I like that the material feels more like fabric and less rough.</li>
            <li> NICE AND BIG...HOWEVER WISH YOU HAD MORE MASCULINE COLORS, CHOICES ARE FEMININE.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE BATH POUF&#x27;S!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are substantial, well made and luxurious!!  Don&#x27;t hesitate on these - they are a great value!</li>
            <li> Love them.....really soft and holds the bath wash in exceptional</li>
            <li> Very pretty...look like flowers...larger than most!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Feels like washing yourself with silk in the shower.  Very sturdy pouf yet touches your skin in a soft luxurious way. I know it will last a long time. Spoil yourself!  You&#x27;re worth it&#x27;</li>
            <li> Used one, and gave one as a gift yesterday, I love mine, so much thicker and nicer than what you can buy locally. I think it really scrubs , and isn&#x27;t harsh to the skin. I would recommend it to anyone, who loves to shower with a pouf. I bought it because of the reviews, and so glad I read them. Thanks</li>
            <li> These are great!  Excellent quality, soft, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> These were posted as LARGE and that&#x27;s why I ordered them.  However they are not any larger than the ones you can buy in Target or Bed Bath and Beyond for 1/2 the cost!  Save your money and buy one at any store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 3&amp;#34; covered in tattoos and my girlfriend likes for my skin to be soft. These are the largest, softest sponge poufs I have ever found. I use them with my favorite body wash and when I&#x27;m done showering I feel clean and not like I&#x27;ve been through a meat grinder. I will reorder this product when I need more. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> These bath sponges are very thick and very soft. However, please note, they are &amp;#34;lacey.&amp;#34; They feel amazing, but they are very &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I definitely love these sponges. They&#x27;re made of soft mesh and are super big and puffy. I only use body wash for my soap and these are much better than the $1 ones I used to get at walmart!</li>
            <li> The puffs are very full and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Varied textures in a large, well-made pouf.  Beautiful array of colors.</li>
            <li> Excellent item.  I am actually using them as part of a centerpiece for my daughter&#x27;s baby shower and they look beautiful in the planter that I am making.  They are also a great loofah!</li>
            <li> I love this pouf. It&#x27;s pure luxury. Having the silk ribbon to hang the pouf is great and feels so good on the skin.</li>
            <li> A really exceptional product! Was afraid they would start unraveling after the first few showers but my first is still going strong! I&#x27;m a customer for life! So luxurious! Thanks for agreat product!</li>
