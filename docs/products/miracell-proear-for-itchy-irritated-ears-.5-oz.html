            <li>what the oil was comprised of that I wanted some for both of us to use to keep our ears in a more healthy state</li>

            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>There is not too many products available for this conditon, but, luckily, this one works.</li>

            <li>For hearing aid users it is a true blessing as it relieves itching and irritation as well as facilitates insertion of the aids.</li>
            <li>Have some cotton balls handy, it can be messy!This worked ok for my itchiness due to my silicone hearing aids.</li>
            <li>His Doctor cleaned wax out of his ear and this was used to calm and sooth the ear.</li>

            <li>Very satified.</li>
            <li>I found Miracell while browsing the internet and decided to try it based on the reviews and reasonable</li>

            <li> I recommend it for ears that feel dry and have even rubbed a it outside on the earlobe.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with dry, irritated ears for years and had been given a prescription ointment in the past.  </li>
            <li> I put a little in during the day when I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to wear my hearing aids and also at night before bed with some cotton balls in my ears.</li>
            <li> A few drops nightly tends to reduce the itching.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!  For hearing aid users it is a true blessing as it relieves itching and irritation as well as facilitates insertion of the aids.</li>
            <li> This product does the job of lubricating your ear and turning a dry, flaky ear into a moist ear that doesn&#x27;t flake...But there&#x27;s nothing miraculous or revolutionary to the stuff...Read the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see that all it is is a collection of natural oils. You can put some jojoba oil, olive oil, aloe vera oil, and any other natural oils/or combination of them in your ear and you&#x27;ll get the same result. The advantage of Miracell is that the producers make the concoction for you with an easy-to-use dispenser. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but understand I&#x27;m not getting any long-term \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; relief!</li>
            <li> This product is very nice and comforting. 13 more words required. nine eight seven six five four three two one</li>
            <li> Works fine. I&#x27;ve had itchy ears for years.  No more. With this product I will not have any more itchy ears.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because it was about half the price of my usual irritation preventative. There&#x27;s a reason&lt;br /&gt;why it costs less...it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. There are very few products on the market like this one. I now prefer to use&lt;br /&gt;the other solution, which is also available at Hearing Aid Express.</li>
            <li> what may work for others, has not worked for me yet. Hopefully, I will find those which work for me soon.</li>
            <li> I use this to relieve itching ears from wearing my RITE aids. Two drops in each ear every other night before bed (seal w/cotton ball until absorbed - usually 30 min).&lt;br /&gt;I am taking one star off because maker has many different similar products with slightly different names - I don&#x27;t know if they are the some product or not. This is the product name that my audiologist gave me as a sample - it works - so I am sticking with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my grandma because she asked me to order it. She said it has helped her with her hearing aid.</li>
            <li> I use this product on the ends of my hearing aids that is inserted into the ear to stop the itchy feeling you get because the hairs are course in there.  This softens the hairs and stops the itchy feeling.  I have tried others but this one is the best and is resonably prices.  A bottle lasts me almost 2 years and I use it daily.  Shipping was very fast.  I had the product in about 4 days.  Good email communication too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other products but settled on this one product as being the most effective for dry, itchy ears.</li>
            <li> This product is the best! My skin was dry, flaky and red. Now I don&#x27;t even need to wear makeup to even out my complextion. I will use it forever!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, as it really stops the itch in my ears almost immediately. I thought the price was very fair, it shipped fast. Very satified.</li>
            <li> My mother has used this product for many years.  We tried to locate it locally, but were unable to find it anywhere.  She was very happy when I found it at Amazon.  Her ears have stopped itching.</li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating when I say that I had itchy ears, mostly in my right ear, for nearly ten years and not one doctor could find a cause or cure. The problem was most notable after a shower, but occurred at any time. I Q-tip my ears daily and was told I shouldn&#x27;t, but the idea of wax build up was gross, and besides they help dry ears. I did stop for a couple weeks but still no relief. I found Miracell while browsing the internet and decided to try it based on the reviews and reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO GLAD I did. After a week I noticed a difference and after two weeks the itching was totally gone. I used it 2-3 times a day. Even after the itching stopped, I continued to use it 1-2 times a day until the bottle was empty, as I feared it would return. If you have that mysterious ear itch problem, you can understand the fear. I did buy a second bottle just in case and used it for just a few times then discontinued. It has been six years now and I have not had a single reoccurrence!  When you look at the ingredients, I don&#x27;t know why they worked, but they did.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It also handles ear wax with wax that is deep in the ear.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Until I started using Miracell ProEar I couldn&#x27;t stand the itching in my ear canal when I was wearing my hearing aids. With ProEar I can control the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product obviously, because I can control the ear itching when I am wearing my hearing aids. I have no experience with any other products, so don&#x27;t know if there are comparable products available. Costco gave me my first couple bottle of ProEar when I complained about the itching in my ears when wearing my hearing aids that I had bought from them. I now I buy ProEar on-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I recommend Miracell ProEar to those who have ear itching when they are wearing their hearing aids. I get my best success with ProEar by putting a drop of the product on a cotton swab and then swabbing an ear channel. I repeat this process on the other ear. Then I givie the product time to be absorb into the skin in the ear channel, I repeat swabbing each ear with a cotton swab with a drop of ProEar on it. After a couple minutes the ProEar should be well absorbed in the ear channel ear and the hearing aids can be installed. I never find it necessary to repeat  this process until the next morning when I install my hearing aids.</li>
            <li> The Miracell works very good.If anyone has a problem I would recommend the Miracell that would help them. Thank youfor this product. Fred C Blanchard  blanchard115@comcast.net</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I&#x27;ve had trouble with dry, irritated ears for years and had been given a prescription ointment in the past.  While the ointment worked to a point, it couldn&#x27;t really get inside the canal, which would bother me even with the ointment.  I decided to try Miracell and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  It does cost a little more than you might expect, but I think it&#x27;s well worth it for the relief it has given me.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe hearing aids cause your ear to itch so much, but when I use Miracell ProEar,  the itching subsides</li>
            <li> I   do not  see  any   improve  due to the itching    problem.  it was stated in the   brochure    that   THIS  product  is  under satisfaction  guarantee. I called the  customer   service,  and I noticed  that   the seller  misleading   he will give  u  the manufacturing   phone in UTAH  then  when u call Utah  she  will  say   you have to call the seller   to  return   your product.       BEWARE  BUYER !!</li>
            <li> Miracell is a great product and so good for your skin!  A healing balm.  Delivered in a timely manner and in good condition.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It did not relieve the itching or discomfort. Other products including over the counter remedies have proved much better. I suggest Singular, anti histamine and of course checking to see if it wax and using wax removal medication.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a family member, and they are very pleased with the product!!  Great Price!!  I would recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It does the job it said it would. I do have to use it once a day. I will order it again as it works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Found this product to be great.  I have not used cotton swabs since I started using this.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> If you are plagued with itchy ears due to allergies, Miracell really helps. There is not too many products available for this conditon, but, luckily, this one works.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by the folks that fitted my husband with hearing aids.  They sell it themselves but being able to buy it on line for nearly the same price saved us a drive out of town to get more.  We each now have one in our bathrooms and have sent one to our daughter who has problems with wax.</li>
            <li> Product helped insert hearing aids and itchy ears.  Think product is overpriced.  Believe same results can be realized with baby oil or petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> My husband wears hearing aids, and this is a life saver. His ears become irritated&lt;br /&gt;and very itchy, and this saves the day.</li>
            <li> I tried it for my hearing aids but did not stop itching at all.  Would not recommend this for Siemens lift 700 BTE</li>
            <li> I wear behind the ear hearing aids and live in a tropical climate.  Anyone who wears hearing aids knows how itchy their ears become at times.  I put a tiny tiny drop at the tip of the hearing aid mold prior to inserting.  Don&#x27;t get any into the tubing or opening of the mold  I don&#x27;t use it if I do not have to but I do use it fairly often.  Even if you do not wear aids....just a tiny drop on the little finger works like a charm.  You can get into the ear far enough without using a Qtip.&lt;br /&gt;My ears feel smooth and calm and just one tiny application works for me for the day.You don&#x27;t need a lot....and even if you do there is no oily feeling.  I recommend it for ears that feel dry and have even rubbed a it outside on the earlobe.</li>
            <li> I purchase this item because it was given to me from my hearing aid person, for I had problems with itching and soreness, and it clam  the problem down to making me comfortable. Anyone that wears a hearing aid would benefit by this product.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its the only stuff in the world world that stopped my ears from itching. No prescription medication could do what this did. I suffered for years with itchy ears that I would practically ream out with my fingers and then get infections in them. This stopped the problem immediately. I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I think I am allergic to something in the hearing aids, but no one has suggested a solution for that problem  Miracell hasn&#x27;t solved my problem, but it surely helps.  Less expensive to buy online than in the office.</li>
            <li> I wear hearing aids and have been bothered by persistent ear itching. A few drops nightly tends to reduce the itching.</li>
            <li> We have ordered it many times.  My husband has hearing aid inserts and Miracle Ear relieves the itching they cause.</li>
            <li> Miracell Pro Ear was recommended by my ENT. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except Amazon. I have to say I don&#x27;t notice much or any real relief from it. I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for about 2 weeks now, and I still find myself scratching.</li>
            <li> Keeps your ears from drying out, and stops ear itching because of using hearing aids. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Have some cotton balls handy, it can be messy!This worked ok for my itchiness due to my silicone hearing aids. I put a little in during the day when I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to wear my hearing aids and also at night before bed with some cotton balls in my ears. I ordered it and within a day it was on my doorstep! I guess I&#x27;m just really close to the shipper but it was really nice to get it so quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband was given samples of this product by his Doctor and I decided after reviewing what it did and what the oil was comprised of that I wanted some for both of us to use to keep our ears in a more healthy state and he needed to see if his ringing would improve from using it. Not sure it has yet but it is much better than trying to stick a cotton swab in your ear. Just a drop and it helps keep it clean. The oils are all natural good oils. Can be used for more than itchy ears. His Doctor cleaned wax out of his ear and this was used to calm and sooth the ear.</li>
