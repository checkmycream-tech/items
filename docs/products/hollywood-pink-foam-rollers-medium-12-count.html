            <li>It&#x27;s great to know I can find these curlers here because most people now seem to be selling heated curlers or curling irons instead</li>

            <li>The sponge is durable and clasp are secure.</li>
            <li>They are soft and very comfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li>The foam on these rollers is not very dense and does not do a good job of forming curls.  </li>
            <li>After complaining the seller was kind enough to issue a refund.  </li>
            <li>This product is very user friendly.</li>
            <li>They also arrived right on time.</li>

            <li>They were exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>These curlers are FANTASTIC for those of us who still love to use the old-fashioned foam hair curlers -- especially because they sell the individual sizes by the bag, so you don&#x27;t get stuck with curler sizes you&#x27;ll never use (</li>
            <li>Always great for those who are tired of using heat treated hair.</li>

            <li>I guess they work and all, as long as you don&#x27;t put too much hair in them, and by too much</li>
            <li>I mean a normal amount that looks okay.</li>
            <li>I am not old, but I do roll my hair and these work really well.</li>

            <li> The large looked like what the small use to.  </li>
            <li> &amp; my hair is too delicate for regular applications of high heat.  </li>
            <li> In the stores I can only find the small and larger rollers but no medium.</li>
            <li> Find these size rollers really hard to find, you can find a package with small med and large but not just the Medium in one package.  </li>
            <li> usually, companies sell foam rollers by the bag -- of mixed sizes).  </li>
            <li> The ones considered small must be really tiny.</li>
            <li> I give them 5 stars for caring about their customers, but as far as the item goes we were not happy.</li>
            <li> I had some extra small rollers that I took the clips out of and used them with the Hollywoods, that at least helped.</li>
            <li> I would consider the size I received small.  </li>
            <li> I still have the older base of my curlers</li>
            <li> These rollers were so dense that it was next to impossible to even wrap my hair around a roller.</li>
            <li> I ordered these rollers for my mother (she has used this type my entire life) but was disappointed with the sizes.  </li>
            <li> I bought the medium size and was disappointed at how small these are.  </li>
            <li> I use a Ricard Caruso hair setter and curlers &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; these work well with this setter---but unlike the foam rollers they used to make--these are very poor quality and fall apart  while you wind your hair.  </li>
            <li> The clip separates from the base.  </li>
            <li> so I use the foam part of these---and throw the base away that came from Amazon (or their client)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Have been using this product for dozens of years, with dwindling resources to purchase them from. Wish they were still made in the USA</li>
            <li> This product is very user friendly. They are easy to put in and comfortable to sleep with them on. I would recommend them to anyone. :D</li>
            <li> Guess this is just another instance of you get what you pay for.  The foam on these rollers is not very dense and does not do a good job of forming curls.  I would advise against buy these curlers.</li>
            <li> These rollers were a gift for someone. She loved them but I do not think has used them yet. They were smaller than I thought they were going to be.</li>
            <li> These rollers were so dense that it was next to impossible to even wrap my hair around a roller. The hair just kept sliding off. Also the clips  were way too big!  The clips looked like they were for a 2\\&quot; or 2 1&#x27;2\\&quot; roller. I had some extra small rollers that I took the clips out of and used them with the Hollywoods, that at least helped. I will never buy Hollywoods again.  Does, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; ring a bell.</li>
            <li> These curlers are FANTASTIC for those of us who still love to use the old-fashioned foam hair curlers -- especially because they sell the individual sizes by the bag, so you don&#x27;t get stuck with curler sizes you&#x27;ll never use (usually, companies sell foam rollers by the bag -- of mixed sizes).

            <li> I love these rollers, I have looked everywhere for these. They are better than I expected. In the stores I can only find the small and larger rollers but no medium. I am not old, but I do roll my hair and these work really well. The sponge is durable and clasp are secure. They are perfect. Thank You Amazon for carrying these. They also arrived right on time. I reordered a second set.</li>

            <li> I guess they work and all, as long as you don&#x27;t put too much hair in them, and by too much I mean a normal amount that looks okay. The clip traps weren&#x27;t very good either. I gave them to my daughter for her dolls hair.</li>
            <li> Find these size rollers really hard to find, you can find a package with small med and large but not just the Medium in one package.  Will order from again just love this size.</li>

            <li> Just what I ordered for all night hold.  They are soft and very comfortable to sleep on.</li>

            <li> These are wonderful!  I got them for my elderly mother who has very fine hair.  They are a good size and leave a nice wave in her hair. Just what I wanted to replace the old pink foam ones she had been using.</li>
            <li> Excellent.I like them very much.i was looking for them for months and I am so thankful that I got it on amazon.Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend used these for costume party-  Had to loan some out as everyone liked them</li>
            <li> Thank you for the foam rollers.</li>
