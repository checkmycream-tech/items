            <li>Feels so wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li>While searching for the perfect shower gel, stumbled upon this so we tried it.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t the best product we have ever purchased, you may have to try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is a wonderful superior bath and shower gel.  </li>

            <li>It has a wonderful, refreshing smell, lathers well</li>
            <li>, it has a pleasant, neutral scent that doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin after washing, and it is skin softening (emollient) as claimed.</li>
            <li>and it tingles rather pleasantly.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that there hasn&#x27;t been an Alba product I&#x27;ve used that hasn&#x27;t been of great quality and equally great ingredients.</li>
            <li>its a good value</li>
            <li>The scent is really good</li>

            <li>The consistency is kind of watery, I found myself using about five pumps and my wife about three.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a shaving gel, too, and it gives a nice glide for the razor.</li>
            <li>I liked</li>

            <li>Great minty smell, feels cool and tingly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a great product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>The mint smell is very strong during the wash, which was a bit off-putting for me, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and becomes rather pleasent.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had another quirt top from my shampoo that fit the bottle perfectly</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and leaves your skin feeling cool and fresh.</li>
            <li>Love love love this shower gel!</li>
            <li>It gives me a good clean feeling</li>
            <li>it smells really good and my skin feels clean when i get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It nice a nice strong scent and you feel much more cleaner and refreshed with this soap.</li>
            <li>Great size and great price, only wish the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; was a bit stronger.</li>
            <li>My fiance and I shower together, and he seems to love this one.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the difference :)</li>
            <li>The mint is more refreshing in the shower than the bath.  </li>
            <li>I love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love &#x27;alba&#x27; products and I love mint</li>
            <li>Just received my latest order of Alba Sparkling Mint Bath &amp; Shower Gel.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, I&#x27;ve been buying this product for couple of years now.</li>
            <li>Very-very satisfied with it</li>
            <li>Refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>Refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love to take bubble baths.  </li>
            <li>The bottle and pump is excellent though, and I refill it with cheaper body wash that comes in squeeze bottles from the local grocery store, which saves me even more money since I can dose out</li>
            <li>This is fantastic on my skin!</li>
            <li>Love the tingle from the peppermint.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>column if not leaning more towards a man&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>I like Alba because unlike Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, this gives a better lather and as for Jason products</li>
            <li>Your love for this product will hinge on whether you use one of those mesh sponges or a rag.</li>
            <li>The mint has a refreshing after affect when lathered on and the bottle lasts along time.</li>
            <li>Just as many have said before....</li>
            <li>Love this body wash...very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>would have given 5 stars instead of 4 if it would lather a bit more.</li>
            <li>Used for bath , shower and love the practicality of the product with pump is a plus.  </li>
            <li>Love this body wash.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly all the way to the last of it.  </li>
            <li>I also love the citrus scent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s refreshing to use.</li>
            <li>I love the pump also and everything arrived unbroken.</li>
            <li>Most bottles had leaked all over the package during shipment.</li>
            <li>and it feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li>This bath wash is so rich and refreshing!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it cleans and smells.  </li>
            <li>Nice, light, refreshing mint scent.</li>
            <li>High quality, great price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very pleasant scent that is definitely in the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>we like this soap, its good quality and good smell, we bought it before the last price hike and it was a great value but now not near as good of a deal for the price.</li>
            <li>the body wash much more precisely. :)</li>
            <li>clean* and refreshed!</li>
            <li>Great Cream - keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li>I really like all of Alba&#x27;s bath gels, and this one was good too.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked alright nothing special!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this -- cool refreshing and moisturizing -- fantastic product</li>
            <li>Love how it leaves you minty clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying, doesn&#x27;t leave any coating on your skin, the pump is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The bath and shower gel is lovely... nice and tingly... but not as intense as I would like to to be.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a strong mint sent this is the product.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing first think in the morning.</li>
            <li>This gel lathers well as a body wash, has a crisp minty scent, and gives a nice tingle when applied.  </li>
            <li>It tingles on my skin, which feels nice in a hot shower... and the tingle lingers beyond my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the minty smell and that there is no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li>Bath gel is fine.</li>
            <li>this bath &amp; shower gel:&lt;br /&gt;Minty smell is fine, even for a man&lt;</li>
            <li>This product is able to moisturize my skin, smells great (without being too strong or odious)and feels extremely</li>
            <li>This body wash is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Leaves a light tingle if you let it sit on skin a bit.</li>
            <li>The price is also fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy every shower I take using this fantastic body wash.</li>
            <li>I love the minty fresh tingling feeling I get when I shower with this gel.  </li>
            <li>and I have used most items that you can find at your local Wal-Mart of Target and frankly, they don&#x27;t feel that good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s a great product for not leaving behind a strong scent, I&#x27;m the type of guy who likes the smell of a good clean.</li>
            <li>Has a great mint scent and your skin feel smooth, tingly, and clean when you dry</li>
            <li>I love it sooooo much!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I feel so clean and invigorated.</li>
            <li>however we just didn&#x27;t feel like we had that squeaky clean and disinfected bye bye BO feeling.  </li>
            <li>For me, all I need is about 1 1/2 pumps to get clean and that&#x27;s just because I like the smell</li>
            <li>the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great on dry skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin tingling, refreshed, feeling clean all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you like a clean scent, not flowery, this soap is for you.  </li>
            <li>Light, subtle and excellent!</li>
            <li>Feels fresh, lasts long, smells great.</li>
            <li>Great big bottle made this a real bargain too!</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite soap I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>Smells really good and actually works too.</li>
            <li>Very tingling and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The mint in the wash gives a cooling sensation on contact that I find quite nice, particularly after a workout or on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Straightforward, effective, and while it&#x27;s neutral enough for the guys, it&#x27;s pleasant and gentle enough for the girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the price for a natural soap!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and the scent is mild enough that my husband will use it too.  </li>
            <li>I love mint body washes but the other outlets give you a tiny portion for a high price and they aren&#x27;t as effective and good quality as this stuff.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll completely fall in love with this one.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>And I love that is all natural.</li>
            <li>When I received it the squirt top was completely shattered and unusable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely my favorite shower gel so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice big bottle too and lasts me a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Since using this gel I rarely need to use body lotion anymore.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin tingly and with a fresh minty scent.</li>
            <li>It give you a fresh minty feeling all over.</li>
            <li>This smells so fresh and makes just the right amount of suds (not a lot).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike all of those, THIS gel smells nice but neutral (no lingering perfume at all), it&#x27;s reasonably priced at about the third the price of products from Bath&amp;Body Works, it makes you feel clean.  </li>
            <li>it takes 3 pumps to get enough to make a decent lather, but very happy with it overall</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it, one will pay far more at Whole Foods!</li>
            <li>is coming from a 35 year old male that doesn&#x27;t really care too much about beauty products, its just that much better that it is noticeably a superior product to the competition in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the mint tingle makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting clean and really getting the dirt off.</li>
            <li>dog has super itchy skin, and I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything under the sun to help ease his itchiness (he has allergies)</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice light, fresh minty feeling, but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this wash, too, and likes it very much.</li>
            <li>I clean my face and upper body with this and my butt and lower body with the cheap stuff until that runs out...</li>
            <li>Love the big bottle with pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>I will more than likely but this again!</li>
            <li>Not only the tingle on my skin, but that refreshing mint smell...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the same price as Dove per ounce, but I feel so much better about putting this on my body</li>
            <li>Still love it though and don&#x27;t plan on getting anything else in the future.</li>
            <li>I love the big bottles too.  </li>
            <li>My husband, who is using moisturiser for the first time in his life, refused to try the lavender or mango: too girly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Alba Botanica Bath &amp; Shower Gel, Sparkling Mint for several years and am quite pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Onesta Strengthening Shampoo in the past, I liked it a lot, but they raised the price, therefor I wanted to try a cheaper solution for a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>So much better than regular soap.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more for the future.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 6.2 and it requires a pump and a half to 2 pumps to get a good lather on my whole body.</li>
            <li>All is all I would definitely recommend this soap for sensitive skin people, and this soap smells amazing.</li>
            <li>While I was hoping for a somewhat more neutral gel for our shower, I did hope the mint smell and tingling sensation would, &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; just a bit more... at least in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked and used the Midnight Tuberose for a long time and thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>I first used this product at a friends house while visiting and really like the smell and mint &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>If you do have dry skin use the Honey Mango, you will love the smell as well as the moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li>The first whiff is of a nice mint scent but under that is a heavy chemical scent.</li>
            <li>Actually while the scent is quite strong in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>Also like the value of the large size.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin so the Honey mango is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>The scent is close to addicting in that it is a gentle, pure fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Really wakes me and my skin up.</li>
            <li>Very minty, but not drying.</li>
            <li>This bath gel works very well for bubble baths when added to the bath while it fills.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various brands but this one keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>Very skin hydrating.</li>
            <li>by the time I&#x27;m done showering, I&#x27;m awake, alert, and ready to face</li>
            <li>The scent could be much stronger.</li>
            <li>Not in this case, you can really smell and feel the mint</li>
            <li>High suds!</li>
            <li>Very minty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We ended up going back to good old fashioned Dial gold bar soap and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li>So refreshing and doesn&#x27;t irritate my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this from a store with high hopes after struggling with the tough pump of Alaffia Coconut Soap which is a great soap and much foamier compared to this.</li>
            <li>I have used other Alba Bath and Shower Gel scents before and love them.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it give off a really clean, minty smell</li>
            <li>lathers beautifully and is a non irritating wash for allergy and skin sensitive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>If you do not have dry skin, you will be fine using this.</li>
            <li>and this is the first soap that has given him relief -- except the medicated shampoos that have unhealthy/toxic ingredients... which I&#x27;ve completely stopped using now that I&#x27;ve found this to work for him.</li>
            <li>Refreshing mint wakes you up or winds you down.</li>
            <li>Regular soaps tend to leave a sticky (most likely from the moisturizer) residue on my skin that makes me want to take a shower all over again.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I still have the last bottle</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so I use a little more.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and allergies, and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li>The tingle of the mint that&#x27;s the fresh extra in this long lasting shower gel that we love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just super careful not to get it in his eyes, because it is really minty, and would probably sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use a washcloth, dont buy this as it has a super watered down consistency and wont create a lather even if yuo used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Has hints of other herbal notes but overall mostly mint.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that this does not dry out my skin and leaves it feeling smooth when i dry off.</li>
            <li>AND it leaves my feeling soft but not slick like some products do.</li>
            <li>The body wash provides a soothing, nourishing and totally aromatic (minty) fragrance without using a large amount of product.</li>
            <li>I guess everyone tries to cut corners and save money or little accessories like bath soap but with Bath and Body works products I really like the products better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft,  bit oily, like I dont even need to add lotion.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural...</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>have tried the Kirkland Organic Natural soap</li>
            <li>The price and the quality offers a value that you cannot find anywhere.  </li>
            <li>well nourished ans soft.  </li>
            <li>As a guy who is conscious of the things I&#x27;m putting into and onto my body, it&#x27;s been a bit of a struggle making the switch from &amp;#34;guy body washes&amp;#34; to a natural option.</li>
            <li>Alba is the leader when it comes to natural quality.</li>
            <li>it tingles when liberally applied to -ummm- sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In fact, it leaves you feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t cause a break out</li>
            <li>I think you can get something just as good if not better for much less.</li>
            <li>I feel like I can properly start the day, after a few pumps worth of this shower gel and a hot shower.</li>
            <li>This is my main body wash, I am totally brand biased for this product.</li>
            <li>Overall still a decent product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and for years the only soap I could find that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out in hives was Dove sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, my one complaint is that the mint in this bath gel can be a bit overwhelming, so careful as not to use too much.</li>
            <li>the morning, I&#x27;ll hit my snooze button 3 times dreading getting out of my warm, comfy bed, but when I finally drag my tired butt into the shower and this soap hits my senses, it really does wake me up.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin, and us all natural.</li>
            <li>I had bought a cheaper bottle of some other stuff, but this is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>The citrus version does seem to moisture a little bit better but it is advertised as for extra dry skin while the mint is for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I live in a very hot environment and my skin often becomes tight and dry.</li>
            <li>Their Sparkling Mint Shower Gel does not pale in comparison to any of their shampoos, facial skin products or moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that reacts to chemicals in body washes, and I have not had any reaction to this wash after using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li>Last year for some reason that soap began drying my skin out considerably, so I began to look for another soap.</li>
            <li>I like the mint,and I especially like the pump action.</li>
            <li>Well that may be true is you are small.</li>
            <li>you up wash for a shower or cool down after a long workout.</li>
            <li>As usual, the it was shipped quickly and my shower gel holder was never empty.  </li>
            <li>There is the right amount of moisturizer without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li>The first time I did feel a slight tingle of refreshment.</li>
            <li>The local natural grocer is often sold out of this Alba gel, so apparently others feel the same way.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I really like this.</li>
            <li>It cleans, makes you feel refreshed and does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>little goes a long way and it is worth every penny.</li>

            <li> , it has a pleasant, neutral scent that doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin after washing, and it is skin softening (emollient) as claimed.</li>
            <li> and it tingles rather pleasantly.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that there hasn&#x27;t been an Alba product I&#x27;ve used that hasn&#x27;t been of great quality and equally great ingredients.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping and a great product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> The mint smell is very strong during the wash, which was a bit off-putting for me, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and becomes rather pleasent.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had another quirt top from my shampoo that fit the bottle perfectly</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and leaves your skin feeling cool and fresh.</li>

            <li> It gives me a good clean feeling</li>

            <li> It nice a nice strong scent and you feel much more cleaner and refreshed with this soap.</li>
            <li> Great size and great price, only wish the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; was a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I shower together, and he seems to love this one.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the difference :)</li>
            <li> The mint is more refreshing in the shower than the bath.  </li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love &#x27;alba&#x27; products and I love mint</li>
            <li> Just received my latest order of Alba Sparkling Mint Bath &amp; Shower Gel.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, I&#x27;ve been buying this product for couple of years now.</li>
            <li> Very-very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> Refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love to take bubble baths.  </li>
            <li> The bottle and pump is excellent though, and I refill it with cheaper body wash that comes in squeeze bottles from the local grocery store, which saves me even more money since I can dose out</li>
            <li> This is fantastic on my skin!</li>
            <li> Love the tingle from the peppermint.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> column if not leaning more towards a man&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> I like Alba because unlike Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, this gives a better lather and as for Jason products</li>
            <li> Your love for this product will hinge on whether you use one of those mesh sponges or a rag.</li>
            <li> The mint has a refreshing after affect when lathered on and the bottle lasts along time.</li>
            <li> Just as many have said before....</li>
            <li> Love this body wash...very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> would have given 5 stars instead of 4 if it would lather a bit more.</li>
            <li> Used for bath , shower and love the practicality of the product with pump is a plus.  </li>
            <li> Love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly all the way to the last of it.  </li>
            <li> I also love the citrus scent.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s refreshing to use.</li>
            <li> I love the pump also and everything arrived unbroken.</li>
            <li> Most bottles had leaked all over the package during shipment.</li>
            <li> and it feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> This bath wash is so rich and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans and smells.  </li>
            <li> Nice, light, refreshing mint scent.</li>
            <li> High quality, great price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very pleasant scent that is definitely in the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> we like this soap, its good quality and good smell, we bought it before the last price hike and it was a great value but now not near as good of a deal for the price.</li>
            <li> the body wash much more precisely. :)</li>
            <li> clean* and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Great Cream - keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li> I really like all of Alba&#x27;s bath gels, and this one was good too.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked alright nothing special!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this -- cool refreshing and moisturizing -- fantastic product</li>
            <li> Love how it leaves you minty clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying, doesn&#x27;t leave any coating on your skin, the pump is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The bath and shower gel is lovely... nice and tingly... but not as intense as I would like to to be.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a strong mint sent this is the product.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing first think in the morning.</li>
            <li> This gel lathers well as a body wash, has a crisp minty scent, and gives a nice tingle when applied.  </li>
            <li> It tingles on my skin, which feels nice in a hot shower... and the tingle lingers beyond my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the minty smell and that there is no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> Bath gel is fine.</li>
            <li> this bath &amp; shower gel:&lt;br /&gt;Minty smell is fine, even for a man&lt;</li>
            <li> This product is able to moisturize my skin, smells great (without being too strong or odious)and feels extremely</li>
            <li> This body wash is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Leaves a light tingle if you let it sit on skin a bit.</li>
            <li> The price is also fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy every shower I take using this fantastic body wash.</li>
            <li> I love the minty fresh tingling feeling I get when I shower with this gel.  </li>
            <li> and I have used most items that you can find at your local Wal-Mart of Target and frankly, they don&#x27;t feel that good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> while it&#x27;s a great product for not leaving behind a strong scent, I&#x27;m the type of guy who likes the smell of a good clean.</li>
            <li> Has a great mint scent and your skin feel smooth, tingly, and clean when you dry</li>
            <li> I love it sooooo much!</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I feel so clean and invigorated.</li>
            <li> however we just didn&#x27;t feel like we had that squeaky clean and disinfected bye bye BO feeling.  </li>
            <li> For me, all I need is about 1 1/2 pumps to get clean and that&#x27;s just because I like the smell</li>
            <li> the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great on dry skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin tingling, refreshed, feeling clean all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like a clean scent, not flowery, this soap is for you.  </li>
            <li> Light, subtle and excellent!</li>
            <li> Feels fresh, lasts long, smells great.</li>
            <li> Great big bottle made this a real bargain too!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite soap I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Smells really good and actually works too.</li>
            <li> Very tingling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The mint in the wash gives a cooling sensation on contact that I find quite nice, particularly after a workout or on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Straightforward, effective, and while it&#x27;s neutral enough for the guys, it&#x27;s pleasant and gentle enough for the girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the price for a natural soap!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and the scent is mild enough that my husband will use it too.  </li>
            <li> I love mint body washes but the other outlets give you a tiny portion for a high price and they aren&#x27;t as effective and good quality as this stuff.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll completely fall in love with this one.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> And I love that is all natural.</li>
            <li> When I received it the squirt top was completely shattered and unusable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely my favorite shower gel so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice big bottle too and lasts me a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Since using this gel I rarely need to use body lotion anymore.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin tingly and with a fresh minty scent.</li>
            <li> It give you a fresh minty feeling all over.</li>
            <li> This smells so fresh and makes just the right amount of suds (not a lot).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike all of those, THIS gel smells nice but neutral (no lingering perfume at all), it&#x27;s reasonably priced at about the third the price of products from Bath&amp;Body Works, it makes you feel clean.  </li>
            <li> it takes 3 pumps to get enough to make a decent lather, but very happy with it overall</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it, one will pay far more at Whole Foods!</li>
            <li> is coming from a 35 year old male that doesn&#x27;t really care too much about beauty products, its just that much better that it is noticeably a superior product to the competition in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the mint tingle makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting clean and really getting the dirt off.</li>
            <li> dog has super itchy skin, and I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything under the sun to help ease his itchiness (he has allergies)</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice light, fresh minty feeling, but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this wash, too, and likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I clean my face and upper body with this and my butt and lower body with the cheap stuff until that runs out...</li>
            <li> Love the big bottle with pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> I will more than likely but this again!</li>
            <li> Not only the tingle on my skin, but that refreshing mint smell...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same price as Dove per ounce, but I feel so much better about putting this on my body</li>
            <li> Still love it though and don&#x27;t plan on getting anything else in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the big bottles too.  </li>
            <li> My husband, who is using moisturiser for the first time in his life, refused to try the lavender or mango: too girly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Alba Botanica Bath &amp; Shower Gel, Sparkling Mint for several years and am quite pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Onesta Strengthening Shampoo in the past, I liked it a lot, but they raised the price, therefor I wanted to try a cheaper solution for a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> So much better than regular soap.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more for the future.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6.2 and it requires a pump and a half to 2 pumps to get a good lather on my whole body.</li>
            <li> All is all I would definitely recommend this soap for sensitive skin people, and this soap smells amazing.</li>
            <li> While I was hoping for a somewhat more neutral gel for our shower, I did hope the mint smell and tingling sensation would, &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; just a bit more... at least in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked and used the Midnight Tuberose for a long time and thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li> I first used this product at a friends house while visiting and really like the smell and mint &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> If you do have dry skin use the Honey Mango, you will love the smell as well as the moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li> The first whiff is of a nice mint scent but under that is a heavy chemical scent.</li>
            <li> Actually while the scent is quite strong in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> Also like the value of the large size.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so the Honey mango is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> The scent is close to addicting in that it is a gentle, pure fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Really wakes me and my skin up.</li>
            <li> Very minty, but not drying.</li>
            <li> This bath gel works very well for bubble baths when added to the bath while it fills.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various brands but this one keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very skin hydrating.</li>
            <li> by the time I&#x27;m done showering, I&#x27;m awake, alert, and ready to face</li>
            <li> The scent could be much stronger.</li>
            <li> Not in this case, you can really smell and feel the mint</li>
            <li> High suds!</li>
            <li> Very minty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We ended up going back to good old fashioned Dial gold bar soap and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> So refreshing and doesn&#x27;t irritate my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this from a store with high hopes after struggling with the tough pump of Alaffia Coconut Soap which is a great soap and much foamier compared to this.</li>
            <li> I have used other Alba Bath and Shower Gel scents before and love them.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it give off a really clean, minty smell</li>
            <li> lathers beautifully and is a non irritating wash for allergy and skin sensitive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you do not have dry skin, you will be fine using this.</li>
            <li> and this is the first soap that has given him relief -- except the medicated shampoos that have unhealthy/toxic ingredients... which I&#x27;ve completely stopped using now that I&#x27;ve found this to work for him.</li>
            <li> Refreshing mint wakes you up or winds you down.</li>
            <li> Regular soaps tend to leave a sticky (most likely from the moisturizer) residue on my skin that makes me want to take a shower all over again.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I still have the last bottle</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so I use a little more.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and allergies, and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li> The tingle of the mint that&#x27;s the fresh extra in this long lasting shower gel that we love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just super careful not to get it in his eyes, because it is really minty, and would probably sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use a washcloth, dont buy this as it has a super watered down consistency and wont create a lather even if yuo used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Has hints of other herbal notes but overall mostly mint.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that this does not dry out my skin and leaves it feeling smooth when i dry off.</li>
            <li> AND it leaves my feeling soft but not slick like some products do.</li>
            <li> The body wash provides a soothing, nourishing and totally aromatic (minty) fragrance without using a large amount of product.</li>
            <li> I guess everyone tries to cut corners and save money or little accessories like bath soap but with Bath and Body works products I really like the products better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft,  bit oily, like I dont even need to add lotion.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural...</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> have tried the Kirkland Organic Natural soap</li>
            <li> The price and the quality offers a value that you cannot find anywhere.  </li>
            <li> well nourished ans soft.  </li>
            <li> As a guy who is conscious of the things I&#x27;m putting into and onto my body, it&#x27;s been a bit of a struggle making the switch from &amp;#34;guy body washes&amp;#34; to a natural option.</li>
            <li> Alba is the leader when it comes to natural quality.</li>
            <li> it tingles when liberally applied to -ummm- sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, it leaves you feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t cause a break out</li>
            <li> I think you can get something just as good if not better for much less.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can properly start the day, after a few pumps worth of this shower gel and a hot shower.</li>
            <li> This is my main body wash, I am totally brand biased for this product.</li>
            <li> Overall still a decent product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and for years the only soap I could find that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out in hives was Dove sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, my one complaint is that the mint in this bath gel can be a bit overwhelming, so careful as not to use too much.</li>
            <li> the morning, I&#x27;ll hit my snooze button 3 times dreading getting out of my warm, comfy bed, but when I finally drag my tired butt into the shower and this soap hits my senses, it really does wake me up.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin, and us all natural.</li>
            <li> I had bought a cheaper bottle of some other stuff, but this is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The citrus version does seem to moisture a little bit better but it is advertised as for extra dry skin while the mint is for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a very hot environment and my skin often becomes tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Their Sparkling Mint Shower Gel does not pale in comparison to any of their shampoos, facial skin products or moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that reacts to chemicals in body washes, and I have not had any reaction to this wash after using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> Last year for some reason that soap began drying my skin out considerably, so I began to look for another soap.</li>
            <li> I like the mint,and I especially like the pump action.</li>
            <li> Well that may be true is you are small.</li>
            <li> you up wash for a shower or cool down after a long workout.</li>
            <li> As usual, the it was shipped quickly and my shower gel holder was never empty.  </li>
            <li> There is the right amount of moisturizer without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> The first time I did feel a slight tingle of refreshment.</li>
            <li> The local natural grocer is often sold out of this Alba gel, so apparently others feel the same way.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I really like this.</li>
            <li> It cleans, makes you feel refreshed and does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time with mainstream store-bought body washes and have not determined the exact ingredient or process, but this seems to be just right for me.</li>
            <li> wash lathers very well and a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> The other few times not so much.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> pump provides a generous amount of wash, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> we have a few members of the family with sensitive skin who can use this soap without issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are now 3 of us using this soap (including the dog), I shower daily, the other person showers 3 or 4 times a week, and the dog twice a month (he&#x27;s 70 lbs and furry) and one bottle lasts us about 3 months.</li>
            <li> It also does not irritate or dry out my sometimes picky skin.</li>
            <li> It does not make my skin neither oily nor dry....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave any funky residue, it lathers well on a shower pouf</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve used this soap, I don&#x27;t get those dry cracks in my skin.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.</li>
            <li> and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> While the functionality (lather, rinsing, moisturizing) qualities seem as good as usual, the underlying chemical smell is really unpleasant and off-putting.</li>
            <li> We use this with Eucerin eczema relief lotion and we haven&#x27;t had any dry skin issues since.</li>
            <li> Since moving to Colorado 3 years ago, both my husband and I have been battling the effects of the dry climate on our skins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a manly man, with fancy tastes on a budget and dry skin .  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and used to get cracks on my knuckles and elbows...</li>
            <li> I wanted to find an all natural soap since what we put on our skin goes directly into our body, and after trying several that either caused me to itch like crazy or dried my skin out too much, I finally found this soap.</li>
            <li> Not a straight mint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on various lotions &amp; oils, but no more.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s for a guy, it has to smell like woodsmoke and musk??), and excessive other ingredients (I&#x27;ll moisturize later thanks).&lt;br</li>
            <li> they have other scents, but this one&#x27;s my favourite;</li>
            <li> After trying a few out, didn&#x27;t notice much difference, they seemed to weak like they had almost no scent.</li>
            <li> Finally an affordable earth and human friendly body wash product that does not break the bank or smell awful.</li>
            <li> The worst thing I find with most big soaps with convenient pumps is the pump itself.</li>
            <li> A previous order had shower gel all over the inside of the box when I received it.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have any sensitive areas as the mint may cause an uncomfortable tingle.</li>
            <li> I do wish it were a little less runny, it is creamy</li>
            <li> a shampoo, it makes my hair dry a little, but at least it contains no sulfates</li>
            <li> showers!&lt;br /&gt;The mint scent acts like a little aromatherapy session.&lt;br /&gt;Body</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find a paraben-free body wash that actually is emollient and that cleans well.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the second time my order of Bath &amp; Shower Gel has been poorly packaged.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the need for a heavy body lotion before dressing for bed or and outing.</li>
            <li> but it is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> When I went to purchase locally, it was hard to find and expensive, so I ordered in bulk from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Quite hard to press</li>
            <li> No residue and soap scum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for anything mint.</li>
            <li> In other words I am sorry I bought it</li>
            <li> I like to support manufacaturers that sell natural and vegetarian products but am sometimes disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s frustrating to use pumps like these in the shower.</li>
            <li> The spout on the pump was broken off.  </li>
            <li> Alba Bath and Shower gel is thin, smells like a used piece of mint gum-</li>
            <li> I wish I never got it as this smells awful and doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all.</li>
            <li> A pump was broken on another.</li>
            <li> From bad scent to excessive dryness, we thought this may be it.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t bother my husband, but it is a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> smell is so faint</li>
            <li> Like other reviews I read, it has a nasty chemical smell to is.</li>
            <li> my shipment came in and THE PUMP WAS BROKEN OFF!!</li>
            <li> Considering there isn&#x27;t any bad stuff in this soap</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> How annoying.</li>
            <li> Terrible Subscribe and Save product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great! After I shower I feel refreshed!</li>
            <li> Love how it leaves you minty clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product. Used it a few times. The first time I did feel a slight tingle of refreshment. The other few times not so much. My fiance and I shower together, and he seems to love this one. I have dry skin so the Honey mango is my absolute favorite. I am going to write a 5 star review for that one. Each person is different and so is our body. It is  good product just not for my skin, I will continue to support Alba, I will not bash one product like most reviewers do. If you do not have dry skin, you will be fine using this. If you do have dry skin use the Honey Mango, you will love the smell as well as the moisturizing benefits. When i step out the shower with the honey mango my skin feels so soft,  bit oily, like I dont even need to add lotion. When I step out the shower with this sparkly mint, I feel like I do. That&#x27;s the difference :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful body wash.  The mint is more refreshing in the shower than the bath.  Great value.  Quality ingredients. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This body wash is fabulous. The mint is very refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t seem to linger after the shower, so no smelling like a mint plant all day! I have sensitive skin and allergies, and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  Smells awesome and leaves your skin feeling cool and fresh. Will buy again</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful, refreshing smell, lathers well and it&#x27;s natural...these are attributes I look for in a body wash and Alba Botanica has impressed me with this product. I will continue to buy this in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like all of Alba&#x27;s bath gels, and this one was good too. However, my one complaint is that the mint in this bath gel can be a bit overwhelming, so careful as not to use too much. It gives me a good clean feeling and I also like using this in my bubble baths. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it, one will pay far more at Whole Foods! I&#x27;d say try this and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> it smells really good and my skin feels clean when i get out of the shower. its a good value</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and I have used most items that you can find at your local Wal-Mart of Target and frankly, they don&#x27;t feel that good on my skin.  Regular soaps tend to leave a sticky (most likely from the moisturizer) residue on my skin that makes me want to take a shower all over again.  This product is able to moisturize my skin, smells great (without being too strong or odious)and feels extremely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Kirkland Organic Natural soap and it just doesn&#x27;t feel the same.  The price and the quality offers a value that you cannot find anywhere.  I also use their lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Alba!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Not a straight mint. Has hints of other herbal notes but overall mostly mint. Love the big bottle with pump dispenser. Leaves me feeling clean and fresh. Great all year but I especially love during the summer. Leaves a light tingle if you let it sit on skin a bit. Don&#x27;t use it to wash your face though unless you keep it away from eyes. The minty/menthol burns.</li>
            <li> Bought this from a store with high hopes after struggling with the tough pump of Alaffia Coconut Soap which is a great soap and much foamier compared to this. As a soap it&#x27;s alright, does not foam up well but isn&#x27;t too &#x27;unfoamy&#x27; either. The worst thing I find with most big soaps with convenient pumps is the pump itself. This one turned out to be no different. Quite hard to press and it&#x27;s frustrating to use pumps like these in the shower. I am thinking of returning it or filling it up in another jar with a pump.</li>
            <li> I love &#x27;alba&#x27; products and I love mint so this is the PERFECT shower gel. Very refreshing scent. Feels so wonderful on my skin. Really wakes me and my skin up. I feel so clean and invigorated. There is the right amount of moisturizer without being too heavy.  The price is also fantastic. I will keep on buying this. Please do not stop making this product, alba! I love it sooooo much!</li>
            <li> I like this bath gel a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most bath-gels are heavy with cloying perfumes (thanks, but I&#x27;m a guy and I REALLY don&#x27;t want to smell like lavender and vanilla all day) or heavy musks (because it&#x27;s for a guy, it has to smell like woodsmoke and musk??), and excessive other ingredients (I&#x27;ll moisturize later thanks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike all of those, THIS gel smells nice but neutral (no lingering perfume at all), it&#x27;s reasonably priced at about the third the price of products from Bath&amp;Body Works, it makes you feel clean.  It&#x27;s not drying, doesn&#x27;t leave any coating on your skin, the pump is easy to use.  Straightforward, effective, and while it&#x27;s neutral enough for the guys, it&#x27;s pleasant and gentle enough for the girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my mind, this puts the Alba gel somewhere between soaps and the traditional fragrance-and-moisturizer-laden gels aimed at a female demographic.  Kudos to them for making a product that fills that gaping hole in the market that everyone else seems to ignore. The local natural grocer is often sold out of this Alba gel, so apparently others feel the same way.  Try it and see if you do!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful superior bath and shower gel.  The scent is close to addicting in that it is a gentle, pure fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers beautifully and is a non irritating wash for allergy and skin sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite body wash.  I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and the scent is mild enough that my husband will use it too.  It also does not irritate or dry out my sometimes picky skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a strong mint boday wash and this is it!!  Talk about wake up your senses in the morning and great bubble and cleaning ability.  I will be a repeat customer</li>
            <li> This gel lathers well as a body wash, has a crisp minty scent, and gives a nice tingle when applied.  Leaves skin well nourished ans soft.  Would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> While searching for the perfect shower gel, stumbled upon this so we tried it.  Dove for men, Axe, Irish Spring, you name it we tried it.  From bad scent to excessive dryness, we thought this may be it.  It wasn&#x27;t.  The scent is really good however we just didn&#x27;t feel like we had that squeaky clean and disinfected bye bye BO feeling.  The consistency is kind of watery, I found myself using about five pumps and my wife about three.  This wasn&#x27;t the best product we have ever purchased, you may have to try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ended up going back to good old fashioned Dial gold bar soap and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> very nice. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just received my latest order of Alba Sparkling Mint Bath &amp; Shower Gel.  The product is wonderful, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.  The spout on the pump was broken off.  Luckily, I still have the last bottle so I can use the pump from that bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time my order of Bath &amp; Shower Gel has been poorly packaged.  A previous order had shower gel all over the inside of the box when I received it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I&#x27;ve been buying this product for couple of years now. Very-very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll completely fall in love with this one.  Not only does it give off a really clean, minty smell but it cools your body off as you wash.  My boyfriend and I give it 2 THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this -- cool refreshing and moisturizing -- fantastic product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find a paraben-free body wash that actually is emollient and that cleans well. This body wash meets all my criteria for perfection in a body wash. It lathers well, with or without a bath puff or washcloth, it has a pleasant, neutral scent that doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin after washing, and it is skin softening (emollient) as claimed. I have sensitive skin that reacts to chemicals in body washes, and I have not had any reaction to this wash after using it for several weeks. The mint in the wash gives a cooling sensation on contact that I find quite nice, particularly after a workout or on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pump provides a generous amount of wash, it goes a long way. I use this as a shaving gel, too, and it gives a nice glide for the razor. My husband uses this wash, too, and likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Refreshing scent. Lasts awhile--good size bottle.</li>
            <li> Never thought shopping at Bath and Body Works would be consider a luxury but every product at that store surpassed this product in a big way. I guess everyone tries to cut corners and save money or little accessories like bath soap but with Bath and Body works products I really like the products better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Alba Bath and Shower gel is thin, smells like a used piece of mint gum- not peppermint or wintergreen either, leaves me feeling not cleaned. In other words I am sorry I bought it and I have learned a lesson. I will stay with Bath and Body Works products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- I do not work at BBW nor do I have stock in the store or its affiliates.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. I prefer to use it during my morning shower to help wake me up especially during the winter months.  I have used the citrus version as well. The citrus version does seem to moisture a little bit better but it is advertised as for extra dry skin while the mint is for normal to dry skin. I have yet to use this for a bubble bath. For me, all I need is about 1 1/2 pumps to get clean and that&#x27;s just because I like the smell so I use a little more. Be careful if you have any sensitive areas as the mint may cause an uncomfortable tingle.</li>
            <li> Finally an affordable earth and human friendly body wash product that does not break the bank or smell awful. Refreshing mint wakes you up or winds you down.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell it the feeling of it.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on the reviews. I am not disappointed. Very minty, but not drying. Refreshing. The bottle is huuge. (I managed to miss the 32oz in the description.) It will last a long time. I like the lather and the scent is great for both women and men. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love to take bubble baths.  This bath gel works very well for bubble baths when added to the bath while it fills.  It also smells good without leaving a perfume after smell.</li>
            <li> minty- invigorating- smoothing! I love a good body wash to start my day! I will more than likely but this again!</li>
            <li> The mint smell is very strong during the wash, which was a bit off-putting for me, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and becomes rather pleasent. The bottle and pump is excellent though, and I refill it with cheaper body wash that comes in squeeze bottles from the local grocery store, which saves me even more money since I can dose out the body wash much more precisely. :)</li>
            <li> we like this soap, its good quality and good smell, we bought it before the last price hike and it was a great value but now not near as good of a deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I first used this product at a friends house while visiting and really like the smell and mint &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;.  When I went to purchase locally, it was hard to find and expensive, so I ordered in bulk from Amazon.  Fast shipping and a great product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I live in a very hot environment and my skin often becomes tight and dry. I&#x27;ve tried various brands but this one keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. The scent is also very refreshing. I buy this one and the mango, alternating between the two.</li>
            <li> The tingle of the mint that&#x27;s the fresh extra in this long lasting shower gel that we love</li>
            <li> This is fantastic on my skin! I usually have a hard time with mainstream store-bought body washes and have not determined the exact ingredient or process, but this seems to be just right for me. It leaves a nice light, fresh minty feeling, but is not overwhelming. It does not make my skin neither oily nor dry.... It just feels *clean* and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I have been using this body wash for about a year now and get through subscribe and save. I love it!!!  It does not dry out your skin, and us all natural. Love the tingle from the peppermint.</li>
            <li> High quality, great price</li>
            <li> Great minty smell, feels cool and tingly. Perfect for summer. Very skin hydrating.</li>
            <li> Great Cream - keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shower soaps I&#x27;ve experienced.  This soap has a Great scent and leaves skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the soap! Smells good and body rejuvenating feeling. And I love that is all natural. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this wash! It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave any funky residue, it lathers well on a shower pouf and it tingles rather pleasantly.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite soap I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this soap for probably 5 years and I just love it. It tingles on my skin, which feels nice in a hot shower... and the tingle lingers beyond my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I&#x27;ll hit my snooze button 3 times dreading getting out of my warm, comfy bed, but when I finally drag my tired butt into the shower and this soap hits my senses, it really does wake me up. Not only the tingle on my skin, but that refreshing mint smell... by the time I&#x27;m done showering, I&#x27;m awake, alert, and ready to face the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great on dry skin. I have very dry skin, and used to get cracks on my knuckles and elbows... but since I&#x27;ve used this soap, I don&#x27;t get those dry cracks in my skin. I also use it on my face, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out. It leaves my skin tingling, refreshed, feeling clean all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dog has super itchy skin, and I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything under the sun to help ease his itchiness (he has allergies) and this is the first soap that has given him relief -- except the medicated shampoos that have unhealthy/toxic ingredients... which I&#x27;ve completely stopped using now that I&#x27;ve found this to work for him. I&#x27;m just super careful not to get it in his eyes, because it is really minty, and would probably sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are now 3 of us using this soap (including the dog), I shower daily, the other person showers 3 or 4 times a week, and the dog twice a month (he&#x27;s 70 lbs and furry) and one bottle lasts us about 3 months. It goes a LOT further if you use a washcloth to lather up your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if they stopped making this soap, it&#x27;s irreplaceable!</li>
            <li> As a guy who is conscious of the things I&#x27;m putting into and onto my body, it&#x27;s been a bit of a struggle making the switch from &amp;#34;guy body washes&amp;#34; to a natural option. My wife and I have been splitting neutral scents (as neutral as they can be) for about two years now and I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; with the choices up to this point. After ordering an Alba product last time, I knew the products they made were quality, so I found this scent and decided this was our next one. After using it, it reminds me a lot of a tea tree scent with mint as well...it&#x27;s a very pleasant scent that is definitely in the &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; column if not leaning more towards a man&#x27;s scent. I like Alba because unlike Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, this gives a better lather and as for Jason products, I get the feeling Alba is the leader when it comes to natural quality.</li>
            <li> So refreshing and doesn&#x27;t irritate my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Your love for this product will hinge on whether you use one of those mesh sponges or a rag. If you use a washcloth, dont buy this as it has a super watered down consistency and wont create a lather even if yuo used the whole bottle. If you use a mesh sponge, there will be suds everywhere. I do have to say that this does not dry out my skin and leaves it feeling smooth when i dry off. I just prefer cloth rags to mesh sponges so this one is not for me. of course, if you like healthier skin solutions, the stuff that lathers wont meet your criteria.</li>
            <li> Makes bath a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and for years the only soap I could find that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out in hives was Dove sensitive skin. Last year for some reason that soap began drying my skin out considerably, so I began to look for another soap. I wanted to find an all natural soap since what we put on our skin goes directly into our body, and after trying several that either caused me to itch like crazy or dried my skin out too much, I finally found this soap. It&#x27;s about the same price as Dove per ounce, but I feel so much better about putting this on my body and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was with how they shipped the product. When I received it the squirt top was completely shattered and unusable. Luckily I had another quirt top from my shampoo that fit the bottle perfectly so I didn&#x27;t have to ship it back. All is all I would definitely recommend this soap for sensitive skin people, and this soap smells amazing. I will definitely be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Invigorating, quick-cleaning, no residue shower cream.</li>
            <li> Had this on subscription now for over a year!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the tingle!</li>
            <li> The mint has a refreshing after affect when lathered on and the bottle lasts along time. I would recommend  this to anyone who like mint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked and used the Midnight Tuberose for a long time and thought I&#x27;d try something new. While the functionality (lather, rinsing, moisturizing) qualities seem as good as usual, the underlying chemical smell is really unpleasant and off-putting. The first whiff is of a nice mint scent but under that is a heavy chemical scent.</li>
            <li> Alba Botanica Sparkling Mint body wash smells sensational and feels revitalizing as you cleanse your body. The body wash provides a soothing, nourishing and totally aromatic (minty) fragrance without using a large amount of product. This is my second purchase and I enjoy every shower I take using this fantastic body wash.</li>
            <li> Just as many have said before.... my shipment came in and THE PUMP WAS BROKEN OFF!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Ugh. How annoying. The bath and shower gel is lovely... nice and tingly... but not as intense as I would like to to be. The scent could be much stronger.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife.  She loves it and recommends it.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash...very refreshing.  Also like the value of the large size.</li>
            <li> I wish I never got it as this smells awful and doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all. Seems like it was diluted with water. if you want to smell like York Peppermint Patties, go for it.</li>
            <li> Has a great mint scent and your skin feel smooth, tingly, and clean when you dry off.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely my favorite shower gel so far. Others have made me feel like I had a residue left on my skin, but not this stuff! I had bought a cheaper bottle of some other stuff, but this is worth the extra money. I clean my face and upper body with this and my butt and lower body with the cheap stuff until that runs out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given 5 stars instead of 4 if it would lather a bit more. I saw some reviews saying you only need one pump to wash your hole body. Well that may be true is you are small. I&#x27;m 6.2 and it requires a pump and a half to 2 pumps to get a good lather on my whole body. Still love it though and don&#x27;t plan on getting anything else in the future. You won&#x27;t be unsatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;This is coming from a 35 year old male that doesn&#x27;t really care too much about beauty products, its just that much better that it is noticeably a superior product to the competition in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/21/13 - DO NOT BUY French Lavender. I wanted to try it cause I liked Sparkling meant. Like other reviews I read, it has a nasty chemical smell to is. I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> Used for bath , shower and love the practicality of the product with pump is a plus.  Wonder if it can be used as shampoo, wanna try that</li>
            <li> This is a really nice shower gel.  I&#x27;ve always been a fan of minty shower gel products, and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s a nice big bottle too and lasts me a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash. The smell is great, not overpowering, even with my ultrasensitive pregnancy nose. Because it isn&#x27;t a girly scent, my husband uses it too. One drawback- it tingles when liberally applied to -ummm- sensitive skin. This doesn&#x27;t bother my husband, but it is a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Smells really good and actually works too. No residue and soap scum.  Versatile so the entire family can use it.  I love the big bottles too.  Will order again and again.</li>
            <li> I like to support manufacaturers that sell natural and vegetarian products but am sometimes disappointed.  Not in this case, you can really smell and feel the mint but it is not overwhelming.  And Subscribe and Save price makes this a great value.  I will be getting this monthly since my husband and kids like it too!</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that there hasn&#x27;t been an Alba product I&#x27;ve used that hasn&#x27;t been of great quality and equally great ingredients. Their Sparkling Mint Shower Gel does not pale in comparison to any of their shampoos, facial skin products or moisturizers. The gel smells great and wakes your skin up with a wonderful mint fragrance and emollient consistency. I feel like I can properly start the day, after a few pumps worth of this shower gel and a hot shower. Truly like no shower gel I have tried before. It cleans, makes you feel refreshed and does not dry your skin out. In fact, it leaves you feeling soft and moisturized. Well done, Alba. Well done!</li>
            <li> best body wash i&#x27;ve ever used. they have other scents, but this one&#x27;s my favourite; always makes my skin tingle and makes me feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I like this shower wash.  It&#x27;s minty. It&#x27;s huge and lasts a long time. I like the mint,and I especially like the pump action. Works perfectly all the way to the last of it.  This is my 2nd bottle purchased.</li>
            <li> This soap works GREAT. I also love the citrus scent. Considering there isn&#x27;t any bad stuff in this soap it&#x27;s really great for the price. It cleans the skin well and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering. This is my main body wash, I am totally brand biased for this product.</li>
            <li> Me and my son have eczema. Our doctor recommended to use a Hypo-allergenic soap. After trying a few out, didn&#x27;t notice much difference, they seemed to weak like they had almost no scent. After trying this out we&#x27;re very pleased. It nice a nice strong scent and you feel much more cleaner and refreshed with this soap. We use this with Eucerin eczema relief lotion and we haven&#x27;t had any dry skin issues since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for anything mint. This wash is great the mint tingle makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting clean and really getting the dirt off. It is a great wake you up wash for a shower or cool down after a long workout. My boyfriend has sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t cause a break out so that was great too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Not only do I get the minty smell but the tingling feeling on the skin. AND it leaves my feeling soft but not slick like some products do. I don&#x27;t feel the need for a heavy body lotion before dressing for bed or and outing.</li>
            <li> Nice minty scent and it&#x27;s refreshing to use. Does the job, but the product leaked in shipping.</li>
            <li> Since moving to Colorado 3 years ago, both my husband and I have been battling the effects of the dry climate on our skins. I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on various lotions &amp; oils, but no more. Since using this gel I rarely need to use body lotion anymore. My husband, who is using moisturiser for the first time in his life, refused to try the lavender or mango: too girly. I bought the mint and have converted him over. Actually while the scent is quite strong in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin afterwards. So men don&#x27;t need to worry that they smell girly and us girls can happily put on our favourite perfume without worrying that the smells will clash.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! I will buy more when I am out! I love the pump also and everything arrived unbroken.</li>
            <li> I had to add peppermint oil, but nice</li>
            <li> smells great, works well.  it takes 3 pumps to get enough to make a decent lather, but very happy with it overall</li>
            <li> This is good show gel but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money I paid. I think you can get something just as good if not better for much less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Alba Botanica Bath &amp; Shower Gel, Sparkling Mint for several years and am quite pleased with the product. The mint fragrance is pleasant &amp; refreshing. The gel is soothing on my skin and isn&#x27;t drying. I will continue to use the gel for my daily shower. Thanks for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Very tingling and refreshing. High suds!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a manly man, with fancy tastes on a budget and dry skin .  This product is amazing, smells good, works good and you can&#x27;t find a better price.  I love mint body washes but the other outlets give you a tiny portion for a high price and they aren&#x27;t as effective and good quality as this stuff.</li>
            <li> Bath gel is fine. Terrible Subscribe and Save product. Most bottles had leaked all over the package during shipment. A pump was broken on another. Giant pain.</li>
            <li> If you like a clean scent, not flowery, this soap is for you.  Lathers great, cleans well.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I would prefer.  I alternate between this soap and the Aveeno just for moisture.</li>
            <li> I have received this product a couple times now on the autodelivery option. It&#x27;s a very refreshing and soothing scent, and my husband even loves it.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked alright nothing special! Could of been more minty!</li>
            <li> Light, subtle and excellent! Not too minty but enough to wake you up in the morning and start your day. Gives a nice tingle feeling while you shower. Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I have used other Alba Bath and Shower Gel scents before and love them.  This scent did not disappoint me either...almost like a massage product !  As usual, the it was shipped quickly and my shower gel holder was never empty.  Great job Alba and Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Onesta Strengthening Shampoo in the past, I liked it a lot, but they raised the price, therefor I wanted to try a cheaper solution for a sulfate free shampoo. Here&#x27;s my opinion about this bath &amp; shower gel:&lt;br /&gt;Minty smell is fine, even for a man&lt;br /&gt;It is a foaming gel (not recommended for face)&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo, it makes my hair dry a little, but at least it contains no sulfates</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a strong mint sent this is the product.  It reminds me of York peppermint patties every time I use it. I do wish it were a little less runny, it is creamy but I prefer a thicker product. Other than that I really like this.</li>
            <li> I love the minty smell and that there is no bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin tingly and with a fresh minty scent. Perfect for morning showers!&lt;br /&gt;The mint scent acts like a little aromatherapy session.&lt;br /&gt;Body wash lathers very well and a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> While I was hoping for a somewhat more neutral gel for our shower, I did hope the mint smell and tingling sensation would, &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; just a bit more... at least in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so faint it&#x27;s almost non-existent, while it&#x27;s a great product for not leaving behind a strong scent, I&#x27;m the type of guy who likes the smell of a good clean. Great size and great price, only wish the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; was a bit stronger. Overall still a decent product.</li>
            <li> Very minty. Kinda smells like something from the dentist.</li>
            <li> This smells so fresh and makes just the right amount of suds (not a lot). we have a few members of the family with sensitive skin who can use this soap without issue. Love the price for a natural soap!</li>
            <li> I ordered the mint flavor. The smell of mint is not overpowering, just right and it feels so refreshing. So much better than regular soap.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It smells amazing first think in the morning.</li>
            <li> This bath wash is so rich and refreshing! I absolutely love it. It give you a fresh minty feeling all over. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the shower for about 6 months.  Love the way it cleans and smells.  Will be ordering more for the future.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh, lasts long, smells great.</li>
            <li> This stuff smell great.  Peppermint smell is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the minty fresh tingling feeling I get when I shower with this gel.  It&#x27;s invigorating and helps wake up all my senses whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this shower gel! Nice, light, refreshing mint scent. Great big bottle made this a real bargain too!</li>
