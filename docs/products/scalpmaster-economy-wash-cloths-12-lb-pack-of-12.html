    <ol>
            <li>As for the washcloths themselves, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>

            <li>Perfect, want lightweight clothes with a bit of texture for washing.</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>I bought these for a craft project and they were perfect.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: If you are looking for something just to get a job done, perfect.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for what I wanted</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Bulky washcloths, which are often beautifully designed</li>
            <li>They will make great shop rags.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>There are 12 washcloths in each pack, so this is a great inexpensive bulk buy option.  </li>
            <li>They are great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>These are great wash clothes.  </li>
            <li>However, they are great for makeup removal and tidying up the bathroom.</li>
            <li>These were a great buy.</li>
            <li>I think they would be good for children also.</li>
            <li>I thought that was fair and will improve the feedback.  </li>
            <li>I received these in good time.  </li>
            <li>Good product for the price, they get the job done and feel good on my skin</li>
            <li>I love these wash cloths!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>These are nice wash cloths.  </li>
            <li>they work pretty good!</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t nice enough for the guest bathroom, of course, but they are perfect for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>That is exactly why they&#x27;re great - they&#x27;re rags.</li>
            <li>They have a scrubby texture that makes them easy to soap up and gives a nice exfoliating face wash.</li>
            <li>These thinner cloths handle much better and do not take up alot of space,even rolled up.</li>
            <li>They look more like shop cloths or dish cloths to me.  </li>
            <li>Most of them were stitched okay.</li>
            <li>I am using them until I find better ones.</li>
            <li>I have saved tons of money and they are actually better at cleaning up spills than any paper towel out there.  </li>
            <li>I have some that were bought as seconds that have held up for 5 years - better made and thicker.</li>
            <li>I did not expect the clothes to be luxurious, but I did expect better than I got.</li>
            <li>The picture shows cloths with rounds corners like most washcloths</li>
            <li>They see more use than my Egyptian cotton ones.  </li>
            <li>Looks can be deceiving and these sure were.</li>
            <li>but quality is more for using as a shop rag.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use</li>
            <li>Wanted a washcloth that would be easy to launder, yet inexpansive and plentiful.</li>
            <li>For a woman with medium or small hands for sure these are great!</li>
            <li>They were shipped promptly and the packaging was fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for months and even though they are cheap, they have held up just fine in the wash.</li>
            <li>but they are cheap and do the job.</li>
            <li>I actually liked these so much</li>
            <li>If you put them in your guest bathroom, you&#x27;re going to look cheap.</li>
            <li>I am still using the original dozen washcloths I purchased almost 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>Put t hem in the rags in the garage to clean oil and grease.</li>
            <li>They seem like one you would use to clean the bathroom at a hotel.</li>
            <li>They remind me of those dingy-grey cloths that bus boys and bartenders use to clean off horizontal surfaces in restaurants and bars.</li>
            <li>They do what they are supposed to do, which is clean my body when I take a shower.</li>
            <li>They dry quickly and are great all purpose cloths.</li>
            <li>Good for short term use but don&#x27;t expect years of life.</li>
            <li>And while it&#x27;s true that these cloths are somewhat translucent, the nap is rough--good for grabbing dust and dirt, if you&#x27;re using them as rags, or for exfoliating skin.</li>
            <li>Luckily, they work for my needs</li>
            <li>I like that there are so many of them that you can use a new one every day without worrying about running out of them.</li>
            <li>so I can give my guest a hot towel before dinner service - ARG!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also quite rough as a result, so probably not the best for daily use when it comes to your skin.</li>
            <li>Because I do laundry once a week, I don&#x27;t want damp items sitting in the pile of clothes, so these thin cloths are perfect.</li>
            <li>Once-a-week laundry also means I have a fresh cloth to use every day with backups.</li>
            <li>They were much cheaper than the ones here locally and just as good.</li>
            <li>The cloth is not of high quality terry, and the hems are coming out of a couple of the wash cloths but for the price, and for cleaning my face, they are just fine.  </li>
            <li>and they exfoliate just the right amount.</li>
            <li>These are way better than their super low price suggests.</li>
            <li>A very inexpensive way to quickly stock the bathroom.</li>
            <li>have HOWEVER the cloths that arrived seem very cheaply made and squared corners looking more like small towels.</li>
            <li>I only hope that any wash cloth is better than no wash cloth.</li>
            <li>First they said they delivered it, but never got it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying enough so that you have a full laundry load full to make each wash worth it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying a finer quality brand and go look at them in a retail store first.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am really pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Feels kind of rough</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to retire the first 12 to the rag bin, where they will probably hold up well for yet another 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are okay, but actually too skimpy for me, threadbare in spots.</li>
            <li>That is exactly what these wash cloths are.  </li>
            <li>I certainly can&#x27;t complain about the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really ashamed to give these as gifts.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointing.</li>
            <li>but these are not choths for anyone who wants them for facecloths or company.</li>
            <li>got them thanks zadie.</li>
            <li>This wash cloths like these can be rolled neatly and left in a basket in the bath room so you can have a clean cloth each time you want one without much laundry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind that these towels are very flimsy but what gets me is that they are light grey in color.  </li>
            <li>These have a good price but the material is pretty thin.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t even make good rags , they are rough certainly not cotton or absorbent.</li>
            <li>I bought these so that I could have a fresh washcloth each morning and night to wash my face with - and still only do laundry once a week.  </li>
            <li>I suspect these cloths will be a big hit with people who want to do small cleanup jobs around the house or even wash the car, as well as those who want to remove makeup without worrying about staining the good</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, an, inexpensive light weight face cloth, not, a heavy, thick facecloth of higher quality</li>
            <li>The color was a dingy off-white and they looked used rather then brand new.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care the quality because I only want to use it as a hot towel before dinner</li>
            <li>I have tried many times with you but still not able to pay them.</li>
            <li>Not real thick but just normal cheaper cloths that I have used for years and got them at a bargain.  </li>
            <li>I got these more for face washing and wanted something thinner than the overly-thick ones you commonly see in stores.</li>
            <li>My old cloths with stood the bleaching well.  </li>
            <li>My face is sensitive and tends to break out, but since using these washcloths, my breakouts have been fewer.</li>
            <li>They remind me quite a bit of the cheap towels used in bars or restaurants, or a utility towel, rather than a washcloth, and would probably be better used as such if you&#x27;re looking not to destroy better-looking towels for messy cleanup jobs.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just the right texture- rough enough to exfoliate nicely but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling raw.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made in India and fairly well constructed, but also very thinly woven and to the point where you can see your hand through the material.</li>
            <li>However, I will probably be using these to remove scary, green-looking facial masques instead, so as not to ruin good washcloths, and buying new ones for daily use.     </li>
            <li>not real heavy weight</li>
            <li>If i order from amazoned again and find out thye are using usps for delivery I will cancel order I want nothing to to with them, just this one order have spent hours trying to reslove this and am getting very fustrated.</li>
            <li>They look nice in this pic too but upon arriving they were not even in a package but instead 24 very thin, see through cloths were put into a gallon size zip lock bag.  </li>
            <li>They are stitched well and, so far, haven&#x27;t started fraying on the edges like another set I bought from a different company at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Was not happy with the product but costs more to ship back.  </li>
            <li>They are just a little thicker than the hot washcloths the airlines hand out before meals.  </li>
            <li>The first time I washed the wash-clothes a couple of them raveled because the hems were too narrow.</li>
            <li>Wanted something for small wet clean-ups in the kitchen, and these don&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
            <li>They are a bit thin but for face washing they are just fine.  </li>
            <li>I use a fresh cloth to wash my face at night, polish the sink with it afterward, wring it well and drape it over the shower curtain rod to dry, and the morning toss the dry cloth down the laundry chute.</li>

            <li> I use a fresh cloth to wash my face at night, polish the sink with it afterward, wring it well and drape it over the shower curtain rod to dry, and the morning toss the dry cloth down the laundry chute.</li>
            <li> , I end up using for hand towels,just to keep them from becoming dusty!</li>
            <li> I just use once and throw into the laundry, all week long, and can do it again next week.  </li>
            <li> As several other pointed out, these are not soft, fluffy, or very absorbent.</li>
            <li> This product was so different from what I expected that I double-checked the labels on the bag.</li>
            <li> They are not even remotely plush; they are not even white.</li>
            <li> Also, I resent them being foreign made - and not marketed as such.</li>
            <li> I have washed them about twice and haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with loose strings or anything like that.</li>
            <li> They dry quickly and never smell mildew-ey the way plush, expensive wash cloths do.</li>
            <li> Unless you definitely want something with a loose see-through weave, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> However, they promptly sent them with a tracking number and politely emailed me a few days later about it to apologize.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for a few weeks and they&#x27;ve been through several laundry washes.  </li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The material is somewhat rough, but I have found that they become fluffier after washing them in the washing machine and drying them in the dryer.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re rough and sparse in Terry loops.  </li>
            <li> ligther weight than expected and somewhat cheep.</li>
            <li> Plain white wash cloths, a bunch, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about washing them too often.</li>
            <li> They are a little rough - not super soft and fluffy - but they exfoliate well.  </li>
            <li> but for the purposes I bought them for working extremely well</li>
            <li> set of wash cloths were square (no rounded corners) and were very rough.  </li>
            <li> This product is not worth purchasing regardless of the inexpensive cost.</li>
            <li> Like these, I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything expensive and they are just rough enough to feel like a facial scrubbing..</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m not very happy</li>
            <li> They were flat and so hard</li>
            <li> Sorry again, when looking up close on the picture the wash cloths look like normal wash cloths.  </li>
            <li> The cloths are fairly thin and a few have some strings hanging off the sides, but even with heavy use and frequent washing, none are unraveling.  </li>
            <li> They did fluff up just a bit, but they are still not very good.  </li>
            <li> I had a little trouble with these getting shipped on time and had to contact the seller about it a week after they were ordered.</li>
            <li> It is not as fluffy as it looks on the picture.  </li>
            <li> A few hems were not caught and this resulted in frayed hems.  </li>
            <li> Unless you like to pamper yourself every time you use a wash cloth, save your Christy Renaissance Egyptian Cotton cloths for guests and use these Economy taskmasters for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like fluffy washcloths and would prefer one that is thinner.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, they are thin and loosely woven.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ORIGINAL: As long as you have realistic expectations for what these wash cloths are, you should not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because these cloths are so thin, they dry in less than 8 hours if you ring them out well</li>
            <li> They are not thick, fluffy, or crazy absorbent.  </li>
            <li> The wash cloths I received are a thin, loose, course weave with square corners and heavy hems.</li>
            <li> The towels have a hemmed edge that is hard and bulky.</li>
            <li> These washcloths were the cheapest material I have every seen with poorly woven fabric and uneven.</li>
            <li> Yes, they turn dingy, shrink unevenly, and seem to thin over time.</li>
            <li> very poor quality - rough and almost see through</li>
            <li> These are so thin I am not sure.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not white :-(</li>
            <li> but they were worse.  </li>
            <li> I like thin washcloths...</li>
            <li> these are so thin that I don&#x27;t understand how they don&#x27;t disintegrate</li>
            <li> If your thinking of getting these for wash cloths...DON&#x27;T.  If you want something thin and flimsy for a rag then go ahead and buy them.</li>
            <li> I needed thin, sturdy wash cloths.  </li>
            <li> These are thin, they are harsh and, to me, worthless.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to tell quality of towels and washcloths on line.</li>
            <li> I hate thick ones and have a difficult time finding any that are thin and made well.  </li>
            <li> The quallity is very poor.</li>
            <li> My husband goes through paper towels like crazy</li>
            <li> I ordered these washclothes because I wanted thin ones, but when they arrvied, the quality was awful.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch for gift boxes for the homeless and was deeply disappointed that they were not as pictured.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not look at all like the picture. The towels have a hemmed edge that is hard and bulky. The quallity is very poor. I was expecting economy but this towel is pitiful.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did with these washcloths was to put them in the maintenance room in my condo building for wiping tools.   I often buy bulk, inexpensive, washcloths from Bed bath and beyond and figured these would be about the same. Not at all.  These are thin, they are harsh and, to me, worthless.  I didn&#x27;t send them back because it was easier to toss them away.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble with these getting shipped on time and had to contact the seller about it a week after they were ordered. However, they promptly sent them with a tracking number and politely emailed me a few days later about it to apologize.    As for the washcloths themselves, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m very impressed. I got these more for face washing and wanted something thinner than the overly-thick ones you commonly see in stores. However, I will probably be using these to remove scary, green-looking facial masques instead, so as not to ruin good washcloths, and buying new ones for daily use.     They&#x27;re made in India and fairly well constructed, but also very thinly woven and to the point where you can see your hand through the material. They&#x27;re also quite rough as a result, so probably not the best for daily use when it comes to your skin. They remind me quite a bit of the cheap towels used in bars or restaurants, or a utility towel, rather than a washcloth, and would probably be better used as such if you&#x27;re looking not to destroy better-looking towels for messy cleanup jobs.</li>
            <li> This wash cloths like these can be rolled neatly and left in a basket in the bath room so you can have a clean cloth each time you want one without much laundry. They are so easy to use and they exfoliate just the right amount. For a woman with medium or small hands for sure these are great! I think they would be good for children also. Bulky washcloths, which are often beautifully designed, I end up using for hand towels,just to keep them from becoming dusty! These thinner cloths handle much better and do not take up alot of space,even rolled up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that these towels are very flimsy but what gets me is that they are light grey in color.  I was expecting these to be white.  I didn&#x27;t care the quality because I only want to use it as a hot towel before dinner is served.  But it&#x27;s not white :-( so now I&#x27;m going to try to bleach it to see if this helps.  It is not as fluffy as it looks on the picture.  The towel is also very grainy, it is uneven in texture... Overall I&#x27;m not very happy and I bought 100 of them so I can give my guest a hot towel before dinner service - ARG!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t even make good rags , they are rough certainly not cotton or absorbent. Put t hem in the rags in the garage to clean oil and grease.</li>
            <li> I certainly can&#x27;t complain about the price.  However, when the washcloths arrived they were not at all as pictured.  The picture showed terry wash cloths with rounded corners.  The wash cloths I received are a thin, loose, course weave with square corners and heavy hems. They look more like shop cloths or dish cloths to me.  I ordered a bunch for gift boxes for the homeless and was deeply disappointed that they were not as pictured.  I have neither the time nor the money to return them, so I washed them hoping they would improve.  They did fluff up just a bit, but they are still not very good.  Most of them were stitched okay. A few hems were not caught and this resulted in frayed hems.  They will have to do for this year, but never again. I&#x27;m really ashamed to give these as gifts. I only hope that any wash cloth is better than no wash cloth. You get what you pay for. You also expect to get what is pictured.  I&#x27;ve posted a picture of the actual product. This product was so different from what I expected that I double-checked the labels on the bag. They were shipped promptly and the packaging was fine. They are labeled 100% cotton made in Pakistan.</li>
            <li> I am using them until I find better ones. Was not happy with the product but costs more to ship back.  The company (voluntarily) refunded my shipping costs when I sent 3 stars as feedback.  I thought that was fair and will improve the feedback.  The company delivered on time, the product is just not what I was hoping for.  They will make great shop rags.</li>
            <li> First they said they delivered it, but never got it. So they gave me a credit back. Then a week later post office said they had my package. Went and got it, contacted company they said they could not charge me again. They said I had to contact you. I have tried many times with you but still not able to pay them. The biggest problem is with usps have had nothing but problems with them, lkast 4 or 5 orders with them they keep saying they delivered the packages but I never got them, and days later the packages they said I recieved mysteriously end up at thier office and have to go pick them up. If i order from amazoned again and find out thye are using usps for delivery I will cancel order I want nothing to to with them, just this one order have spent hours trying to reslove this and am getting very fustrated.</li>
            <li> I ordered these washclothes because I wanted thin ones, but when they arrvied, the quality was awful. The color was a dingy off-white and they looked used rather then brand new. This product is not worth purchasing regardless of the inexpensive cost.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal.  My husband goes through paper towels like crazy so a couple years ago I started buying these types of hand towels in bulk instead of buy hand towels. I have saved tons of money and they are actually better at cleaning up spills than any paper towel out there.  I would suggest buying enough so that you have a full laundry load full to make each wash worth it.  I buy the IKEA plastic bag holders as my paper towel holder. I have done this for about 3 years now and I always get compliments from guests when they come over.</li>
            <li> I received these in good time.  They were flat and so hard I thought they&#x27;d been used for years.  I washed them hoping to soften them but they were worse.  One couldn&#x27;t use them on your body and they could not absorb anything.  I&#x27;m returning this order.  They could scalp you alright.</li>
            <li> I just needed some wash cloths.... but they arrived with makeup on them.  It is as if someone wiped their face before shipping.(even though they came in a plastic bag)  Every one appears to be dingy and of greyish color.  I guess I&#x27;ll wash them and use as dust cloths.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, they get the job done and feel good on my skin and they last.</li>
            <li> There are 12 washcloths in each pack, so this is a great inexpensive bulk buy option.  I bought these so that I could have a fresh washcloth each morning and night to wash my face with - and still only do laundry once a week.  They are great for that purpose.  They are just a little thicker than the hot washcloths the airlines hand out before meals.  The cloths are fairly thin and a few have some strings hanging off the sides, but even with heavy use and frequent washing, none are unraveling.  These aren&#x27;t nice enough for the guest bathroom, of course, but they are perfect for my purposes.  I just use once and throw into the laundry, all week long, and can do it again next week.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.  A very inexpensive way to quickly stock the bathroom.</li>
            <li> These washcloths were the cheapest material I have every seen with poorly woven fabric and uneven. I should have sent them back but will use them for rags. It is difficult to tell quality of towels and washcloths on line. I would recommend buying a finer quality brand and go look at them in a retail store first.</li>
            <li> they work pretty good!</li>
            <li> Like these, I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything expensive and they are just rough enough to feel like a facial scrubbing..</li>
            <li> These are nice wash cloths.  I use them for cleaning my face.  They are a bit thin but for face washing they are just fine.  The cloth is not of high quality terry, and the hems are coming out of a couple of the wash cloths but for the price, and for cleaning my face, they are just fine.  I would probably purchase them again.</li>
            <li> The first time I washed the wash-clothes a couple of them raveled because the hems were too narrow. Another one raveled in the next washing. I use these every day. I have some that were bought as seconds that have held up for 5 years - better made and thicker. The seconds have finished edges rather than hemmed. I did not expect the clothes to be luxurious, but I did expect better than I got. Also, I resent them being foreign made - and not marketed as such.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointing. The picture shows cloths with rounds corners like most washcloths have HOWEVER the cloths that arrived seem very cheaply made and squared corners looking more like small towels. I could never put these out as wash cloths.</li>
            <li> not real heavy weight but for the purposes I bought them for working extremely well</li>
            <li> Wanted something for small wet clean-ups in the kitchen, and these don&#x27;t fit the bill. Unless you definitely want something with a loose see-through weave, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the softest wash clothes but they are cheap and do the job. They seem like they will hold up well to multiple washings.  Update: 10 months later about. These wash cloths are holding up well. They see more use than my Egyptian cotton ones.  Update: 2+ years later, still using them. None have frayed or fallen apart yet.</li>
            <li> Sorry again, when looking up close on the picture the wash cloths look like normal wash cloths.  Not real thick but just normal cheaper cloths that I have used for years and got them at a bargain.  They look nice in this pic too but upon arriving they were not even in a package but instead 24 very thin, see through cloths were put into a gallon size zip lock bag.  I use white rags all the time for the tub and kitchen and bleach them every time I wash.  My old cloths with stood the bleaching well.  These are so thin I am not sure.  Looks can be deceiving and these sure were.</li>
            <li> I ordered these washcloths because they said they were \\&quot;thin\\&quot;.  I hate thick ones and have a difficult time finding any that are thin and made well.  I&#x27;ve used them for a few weeks and they&#x27;ve been through several laundry washes.  They are stitched well and, so far, haven&#x27;t started fraying on the edges like another set I bought from a different company at the same time.  They are a little rough - not super soft and fluffy - but they exfoliate well.  My face is sensitive and tends to break out, but since using these washcloths, my breakouts have been fewer.</li>
            <li> It finally happened--I bought an amazon product that wasn&#x27;t what was pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My set of wash cloths were square (no rounded corners) and were very rough.  Almost like they were meant to be shop rags for an auto mechanic.  Fortunately, I am only using these wash cloths to wash my face every night--would not provide these for guests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have held up through several washings now--no unraveling or anything.</li>
            <li> Wash my face twice a day. Wanted a washcloth that would be easy to launder, yet inexpansive and plentiful. Does the job.</li>
            <li> I like thin washcloths...these are so thin that I don&#x27;t understand how they don&#x27;t disintegrate</li>
            <li> These have a good price but the material is pretty thin.  Good for short term use but don&#x27;t expect years of life.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, an, inexpensive light weight face cloth, not, a heavy, thick facecloth of higher quality</li>
            <li> What I ordered was delivered on time. The product was what I expected.  For the price, they are perfect</li>
            <li> Not as pictured. I wanted them for washing face every night before bed but quality is more for using as a shop rag. I ordered two 12 packs they sent one ten. Will return!!</li>
            <li> YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR  . STARTED COMING APORT ON SIDES AFTER  TWO WASHING.</li>
            <li> These rags are horrid. They seem like one you would use to clean the bathroom at a hotel. Gross and I returned it.</li>
            <li> It just is what it is.</li>
            <li> These are great wash clothes.  They&#x27;re just the right texture- rough enough to exfoliate nicely but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling raw.  The economy pack is an added bonus too.</li>
            <li> I use these as a face/chest washcloth and as my &amp;#34;sweat cloth&amp;#34; at the gym. I like that there are so many of them that you can use a new one every day without worrying about running out of them. The material is somewhat rough, but I have found that they become fluffier after washing them in the washing machine and drying them in the dryer. I have washed them about twice and haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with loose strings or anything like that. Overall, I am really pleased with them. They dry quickly and are great all purpose cloths.</li>
            <li> If your thinking of getting these for wash cloths...DON&#x27;T.  If you want something thin and flimsy for a rag then go ahead and buy them.</li>
            <li> Perfect, want lightweight clothes with a bit of texture for washing.</li>
            <li> These washcloths are of the poorest quality I&#x27;ve ever seen.  They&#x27;re rough and sparse in Terry loops.  Luckily, they work for my needs but these are not choths for anyone who wants them for facecloths or company.</li>
            <li> Feels kind of rough but it serves it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  I am still using the original dozen washcloths I purchased almost 5 years ago. Yes, they turn dingy, shrink unevenly, and seem to thin over time. However, they are great for makeup removal and tidying up the bathroom. I&#x27;m about to retire the first 12 to the rag bin, where they will probably hold up well for yet another 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL: As long as you have realistic expectations for what these wash cloths are, you should not be disappointed. Don&#x27;t, for example, expect to put these out for guests. They are not even remotely plush; they are not even white. They remind me of those dingy-grey cloths that bus boys and bartenders use to clean off horizontal surfaces in restaurants and bars. And while it&#x27;s true that these cloths are somewhat translucent, the nap is rough--good for grabbing dust and dirt, if you&#x27;re using them as rags, or for exfoliating skin. I suspect these cloths will be a big hit with people who want to do small cleanup jobs around the house or even wash the car, as well as those who want to remove makeup without worrying about staining the good facecloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because these cloths are so thin, they dry in less than 8 hours if you ring them out well and the air is not too humid. I use a fresh cloth to wash my face at night, polish the sink with it afterward, wring it well and drape it over the shower curtain rod to dry, and the morning toss the dry cloth down the laundry chute. Because I do laundry once a week, I don&#x27;t want damp items sitting in the pile of clothes, so these thin cloths are perfect. Once-a-week laundry also means I have a fresh cloth to use every day with backups. I actually liked these so much I ordered a second dozen. Unless you like to pamper yourself every time you use a wash cloth, save your Christy Renaissance Egyptian Cotton cloths for guests and use these Economy taskmasters for everyday use.</li>
            <li> These were a great buy. They were much cheaper than the ones here locally and just as good. Great buy!</li>
            <li> As several other pointed out, these are not soft, fluffy, or very absorbent. That is exactly why they&#x27;re great - they&#x27;re rags. They&#x27;re for scrubbing dirt off of tools, tables, or your body.</li>
            <li> The only use for this product is as a rag.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like fluffy washcloths and would prefer one that is thinner. These are okay, but actually too skimpy for me, threadbare in spots.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a craft project and they were perfect.  I needed thin, sturdy wash cloths.  That is exactly what these wash cloths are.  They are not thick, fluffy, or crazy absorbent.  They are very basic wash cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you are looking for something just to get a job done, perfect.  If you put them in your guest bathroom, you&#x27;re going to look cheap.</li>
            <li> very poor quality - rough and almost see through</li>
            <li> got them thanks zadie.</li>
            <li> I love these wash cloths! Like other reviewers have said, they are thin and loosely woven. They have a scrubby texture that makes them easy to soap up and gives a nice exfoliating face wash. They dry quickly and never smell mildew-ey the way plush, expensive wash cloths do. I&#x27;ve had them for months and even though they are cheap, they have held up just fine in the wash. These are perfect for what I wanted and I use them every day instead of all the others in my linen closet that look nicer but are not at all functional.</li>
            <li> These are just what I was looking for. Plain white wash cloths, a bunch, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about washing them too often. Yay! These are way better than their super low price suggests. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product! I will purchase again !</li>
            <li> These were not 12 x 12 as described and I could not use them for the purpose I intended (boo boo bunnies).  I did keep themk to use as household rags.</li>
            <li> ligther weight than expected and somewhat cheep.</li>
            <li> Hey, they&#x27;re washcloths. They do what they are supposed to do, which is clean my body when I take a shower.</li>
