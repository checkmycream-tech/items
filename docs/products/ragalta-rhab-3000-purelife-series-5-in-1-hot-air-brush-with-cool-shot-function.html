    <ol>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>This was a wonderful product for about a month then the brush attachment broke where it clips on to the handle.</li>
            <li>I am SO happy to have found this.  </li>
            <li>The brush works good.</li>
            <li>Great Deal am pleased with this purchase, I would recommend</li>
            <li>This is a very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>Plus, a huge piece of my hair had to be cut off!</li>
            <li>most have nylon bristles which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>I guess it works okay</li>
            <li>Sincerely,  Dianne</li>
            <li>but with more fullness.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how much I love this styler.</li>
            <li>If you can find a better made product like this, it works way better than a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I am a hot styler junkie and have yet to find an ideal one that will have the right brush.  </li>
            <li>It has good power, and behaves the way a hot brush should.</li>
            <li>It is even better than the one I had and easy attachment switch out.</li>
            <li>how dare I complain about how easy it is to my easy to manage hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that dries in a frizzy sort of wave without product or styling.</li>
            <li>I had to cut the balls off the attachment before I could get my hair free.</li>
            <li>It has filled a need</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this Ragalta to anyone because of my experience, assuming all of their hot brushes have cheaply functioning push buttons that don&#x27;t click securely onto the attachments.</li>
            <li>I received a full refund, and plan try another brand: Panasonic Kurukuru.</li>
            <li>it breaks easily even though i dont use it that much.</li>
            <li>I like the power very much.  </li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job, and it&#x27;s much easier than using a round brush and a big dryer.</li>
            <li>Could have with 2 more different size brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love this item and this is my second time purchasing it last time it broke within month and this times within 3 weeks the attachents break to easily</li>
            <li>Great for drying thick curly hair without drying it out too much.</li>
            <li>However, if anyone does purchase it, make sure your attachments CLICK in place tightly so that they do not slide off, then maybe the unit would be worth it.</li>
            <li>This works very well and is quite versatile.</li>
            <li>, it wakes me up every morning when he gets ready to go to work.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product two stars because the comb attachment does not stay latched onto the main piece.</li>
            <li>This dryer is not quite powerful enough to dry my hair from start to finish, so I use my professional dryer to get most of the wet out of my hair, then use this dryer with brush attachment to  finish and smooth my hair.</li>
            <li>May be good for short hair but don&#x27;t use it if you have hair longer than a few inches!</li>
            <li>I had looked for same one for replacement without success.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been using &amp;#34;National&amp;#34; brand (Japanese brand - a/k/a &amp;#34;Panasonic&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>A hot air device with a paddle/detangling brush attachment and at an AMAZINGLY low price!</li>
            <li>(Someone else who bought this dryer thought it wasn&#x27;t hot enough</li>
            <li>This item is not a brand name that I recognize but it had an attachment very important to me, a sort of lifter thing that lets you dry the roots of your hair without disturbing the rest of the hair, so it dries more naturally</li>
            <li>I quickly opened the box and tossed the additional 4 attachments to the side as I secured my beloved paddle brush attachment to the base, plugged it in and turned the heat on high!</li>
            <li>It is so loud</li>
            <li>I also use the curling iron attachment to re-set wayward curls when wearing my hair natural.</li>
            <li>The styler has a bit flimsy built, but so far it works well.</li>
            <li>After just 15 minutes of one-handed drying/styling, my hair was totally dry and impeccably straight!</li>
            <li>I have only used the round brush and it works for me fine.</li>
            <li>I was very careful to make sure I took a small strand</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made and the metal used can not withstand pulling the brush through your hair, and I have short thin hair.</li>
            <li>, I spotted a hot air dryer in Target but was disappointed when I realized that most hot air dryers only come with round barrels.</li>

            <li> /&gt;After much experimentation, I realized I could cut 10 minutes off my dry/styling time by only using a round brush on the hair that frames my face and using a paddle brush to dry the rest (hair flipped toward the floor for volume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t used any of the other attachments.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the other attachments.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bear the thought of going back to the days where I parted my hair into small sections in order to dry each section with a zillion wrist-torturing strokes of a round brush.</li>
            <li> It was a sad time, really...</li>
            <li> so I replaced it with this hair dryer (less than 1/2 the price of National).  </li>
            <li> As I dried my hair, it would slide and fall off</li>
            <li> I have had a brush dryer similar to this for several years and was very sad when it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I know, I know, everyone with curly thick hair just scoffed at me...</li>

            <li> Bad quality, it doesn&#x27;t style my hair at all</li>

            <li> Bad quality, it doesn&#x27;t style my hair at all</li>
            <li> I have looked for something like this for a number of years....most have nylon bristles which I don&#x27;t like.  This works very well and is quite versatile.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using &amp;#34;National&amp;#34; brand (Japanese brand - a/k/a &amp;#34;Panasonic&amp;#34;) hair dryers for years but the brush has deteriorated over the years on his current one so I replaced it with this hair dryer (less than 1/2 the price of National).  A big mistake.  It is so loud, it wakes me up every morning when he gets ready to go to work.  I guess it works okay since he has not complained but I&#x27;m not a happy camper.  I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> This product should NOT be sold! I vaguely remember reading about someone getting thier hair hung but just thought it would/could not happen. I was very careful to make sure I took a small strand but it would not let go no matter what I did. I had to cut the balls off the attachment before I could get my hair free. Plus, a huge piece of my hair had to be cut off! This is a very cheaply made product. It has no qualities of any other hair system I have ever used. IT SHOULD BE BANNED FROM SALES. May be good for short hair but don&#x27;t use it if you have hair longer than a few inches! I have used hair dryers and different hair curling products for over 50 years. Piece of junk and very dangerous for hair!  I would give it a -5 but it won&#x27;t let me and wouldn&#x27;t post unless I put something in.  Sincerely,  Dianne</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that dries in a frizzy sort of wave without product or styling. I am perfectly capable of blow drying my hair straight with a round brush as they do in the salon and it typically takes less then 30 minutes... but I am uber lazy and HATE the entire process!

I couldn&#x27;t bear the thought of going back to the days where I parted my hair into small sections in order to dry each section with a zillion wrist-torturing strokes of a round brush. BUT... what if there was a paddle hot air brush?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After scouring shelves and the depths of the internet, atlas, I found this unrecognizable brand offering me everything my thin head of wavy-frizzy hair could have ever dreamed of! A hot air device with a paddle/detangling brush attachment and at an AMAZINGLY low price! I ordered without delay and waited for its arrival like a child waits for Christmas morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And today, that day came! I quickly opened the box and tossed the additional 4 attachments to the side as I secured my beloved paddle brush attachment to the base, plugged it in and turned the heat on high! After just 15 minutes of one-handed drying/styling, my hair was totally dry and impeccably straight! I have only used it once but I havea feeling that this heaven sent product is going to be a life changer.</li>
            <li> I have had a brush dryer similar to this for several years and was very sad when it stopped working.  I had looked for same one for replacement without success.  I am SO happy to have found this.  It is even better than the one I had and easy attachment switch out. I would recommend tis Ragalta RHAB to everyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This dryer/styler works well and has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> This item is not a brand name that I recognize but it had an attachment very important to me, a sort of lifter thing that lets you dry the roots of your hair without disturbing the rest of the hair, so it dries more naturally but with more fullness. It has good power, and behaves the way a hot brush should. I&#x27;ve had it for about two months and it&#x27;s perfect. Haven&#x27;t used any of the other attachments. Recommended! (Someone else who bought this dryer thought it wasn&#x27;t hot enough but I bet she was using it on the setting that just has regular air blowing, not HOT air. The settings go LO, HI, and then HI but no heat.)</li>
            <li> Great Deal am pleased with this purchase, I would recommend</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I love this styler. I have very thick very curly hair (3b-3c). This dryer is not quite powerful enough to dry my hair from start to finish, so I use my professional dryer to get most of the wet out of my hair, then use this dryer with brush attachment to  finish and smooth my hair. It does a wonderful job, and it&#x27;s much easier than using a round brush and a big dryer. I also use the curling iron attachment to re-set wayward curls when wearing my hair natural. It leaves my hair bouncy and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;I use this styler every time I dry my hair. It has filled a need I didn&#x27;t even know I had!&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about ordering a second, so I have one as backup.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Great for drying thick curly hair without drying it out too much.</li>
            <li> I love this item and this is my second time purchasing it last time it broke within month and this times within 3 weeks the attachents break to easily and i was very disappointed.. I put it back in the box and trying to find time to ship it back. I love this item but its sad it breaks easily even though i dont use it that much. ;(</li>
            <li> I gave this product two stars because the comb attachment does not stay latched onto the main piece. As I dried my hair, it would slide and fall off and I would have to reattach it. Perhaps I received a faulty unit because the attachment didn&#x27;t click and lock in place. I returned it after trying it once because I couldn&#x27;t deal with the constant putting on of the attachment every few seconds. I received a full refund, and plan try another brand: Panasonic Kurukuru. I would not recommend this Ragalta to anyone because of my experience, assuming all of their hot brushes have cheaply functioning push buttons that don&#x27;t click securely onto the attachments. However, if anyone does purchase it, make sure your attachments CLICK in place tightly so that they do not slide off, then maybe the unit would be worth it.</li>
            <li> This is AC100-120V/200-240V ?????</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful product for about a month then the brush attachment broke where it clips on to the handle. It is very cheaply made and the metal used can not withstand pulling the brush through your hair, and I have short thin hair. If you can find a better made product like this, it works way better than a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I am a hot styler junkie and have yet to find an ideal one that will have the right brush.  I have only used the round brush and it works for me fine. Could have with 2 more different size brushes.  The styler has a bit flimsy built, but so far it works well.</li>
            <li> The brush works good. Don&#x27;t like the other attachments.</li>
            <li> I like the power very much.  What is not correct for me is the length of the curling rod.  It is too short.  I like the attachments also but would like to see a curl release.</li>
