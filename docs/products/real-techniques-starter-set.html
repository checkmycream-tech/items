            <li>Fair price,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved Pixiwoo makeup tutorials for awhile now, Samantha Chapman knows her stuff</li>
            <li>Looks good, case holder is good,  </li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>Good quality fibers and well constructed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairdresser, and for the money this brand is a good deal.</li>
            <li>And all it good is</li>
            <li>case is conceptually a good idea in that it has a self stand, however the materials that it is made from is a bit flimsy</li>
            <li>Maybe good for eyebrows, not for eyes.</li>
            <li>Good quality brushes, they case they come in</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be buying that brand anymore, the quality wasn&#x27;t as good as I was expecting for their price.</li>
            <li>Delighted with them.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention they are SO fairly priced.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Excelent product, good quality, good deal, you pay a fare price  for an excelent product.</li>
            <li>Have purchased them for others because they are so good.</li>
            <li>THESE BRUSHES ARE TOO GOOD</li>
            <li>Good selection of brushes for eyes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good quality, wash well.</li>
            <li>shipping and packing was good.</li>
            <li>so idk how good brushes should feel</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a nice variety of brushes and the bristles are great quality, hold product well, and haven&#x27;t shown the slightest sign of shedding.</li>
            <li>Good brushes.</li>
            <li>good wear</li>
            <li>I had never tried any of these brushes and theyre good</li>

            <li>Good quality brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>and I just didn&#x27;t think they could possibly be as good as others I had bought for 3 or 4 times the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are superior to animal hair brushes in every way.</li>
            <li>I feel that this is a truly superior product in every way.t, your brushes will start shedding.</li>
            <li>I feel that this is a truly superior product in every way.</li>
            <li>You will not have good control using this brush.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;d say this is a good set for a beginner</li>
            <li>and I loved them now</li>
            <li>They work so good for eye shadow and eye brow filling.</li>
            <li>I realized that there were loads of good reviews online about the brushes.</li>
            <li>I can already tell that they are good .</li>
            <li>Good brush set for the eyes.</li>
            <li>then are affordable and really good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it has a good eye lid brush</li>
            <li>and it works really good.</li>
            <li>good set...</li>
            <li>I think they are good</li>
            <li>Also, the writing on the brushes isn&#x27;t as good as the Ecotools brand.  </li>
            <li>It may be good for concealer or something else though.</li>
            <li>good value</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for some good brushes.</li>

            <li>Good quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I think they are a good value.</li>
            <li>Even after watching tutorials on YouTube, my work did not look as good, at all.</li>
            <li>They are good for the price, and just good period.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the gel eyeliner brush and the brow brush isn&#x27;t as good quality as the others in this set.  </li>
            <li>Really good brushes from Sam Champan of Pixiwoo on YouTube.</li>
            <li>my sister loved it she bought some of these brushes</li>
            <li>and i loved them to because of the packaging its two in one</li>
            <li>A good starter kit for eye make up brushes that anyone can have.</li>
            <li>but once you give it a try you&#x27;ll find some of its good use some brushes are of no use to me.</li>
            <li>She loved them and had been asking for them for 2 years.</li>
            <li>i loved the quality and the pacakaging ,i didnt use them yet</li>
            <li>They are really good for blending and application.</li>
            <li>I think I would have liked one of the shadowed brushes to have a beveled edge but otherwise happy with purchase.</li>

            <li>They are good quality</li>

            <li>Kudos to Mrs. Chapman &amp; Real Techniques for a brilliant collabo!</li>
            <li>They seem well made and come in a handy case.  </li>
            <li>I liked how the handles were labeled</li>
            <li>The blend shadows nicely.</li>
            <li>Over all these brushes are quite spectacular.</li>
            <li>Good set for a starter, for sure.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use the stand but the quality of the brushes are the best .</li>
            <li>Real techniques for the win!</li>
            <li>This brand has a nice weight and heft to the brush.</li>
            <li>Even when I saw that Samantha and Nicola Chapman (makeup artists known as Pixiwoo on YouTube) had produced and were using their own line of brushes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the liner brush and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I used them to do my own make up for a friend&#x27;s wedding</li>
            <li>but they are nice quality over all</li>
            <li>Real Techniques has amazing quality brushes and this set is perfect.</li>
            <li>I wanted the best quality but simply couldn&#x27;t afford the $50-per-brush that a lot of companies charge, and this set is a happy medium.</li>
            <li>No complaints with the brushes, they have held up well and work nicely.</li>
            <li>These are spectacular brushes.</li>
            <li>This set is really nice.</li>
            <li>The stand is also nice to keep the brushes in place.</li>
            <li>They are synthetic but they hold make up and move the product nicely.</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice set of brushes to replace my drugstore ones.</li>
            <li>Metal handle with rubber for a nice grip.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that, for me, these are comparable to Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>When I use them my eye makeup turns out to be really nice</li>
            <li>Nice way to keep all the make up brushes.</li>
            <li>I use this brush on a weekly basis, and it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>Works nicely on brows, eyeliner, or pinpoint</li>
            <li>but I used it a couple times and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>These ones seem nice though</li>
            <li>real Techniques Starter Set is just perfect!</li>
            <li>Love this set and the price really good</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use the case, but it&#x27;s a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>They also blend really nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice eye starter set.  </li>
            <li>The travel case is a nice touch and does keep the brushes snugly in place within your purse or luggage.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for nice and inexpensive brushes, buy these.</li>
            <li>Has all the brushes needed for day to day use in a handy case.  </li>
            <li>They hold up well after washing, fit comfortably in your hand, and do a great job of applying!</li>
            <li>Really nice brush set for the price</li>
            <li>I liked the face brushes, not the eye ones.</li>
            <li>I bought this set because of the deluxe crease brush.</li>
            <li>I am kind of in the air as to whether I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li>your on a budget its a nice set</li>
            <li>I love the eyeliner brush, it gives really good control for gel liner.</li>
            <li>Nice design.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice for when you travel</li>
            <li>Love these brushes, they work as good as my mac brushes do.</li>
            <li>The stand is also quite handy and helpful if you plan to travel with it.</li>
            <li>It came in a nicely packaged box, brand new,great price.</li>
            <li>They are a great deal, and perform better than brushes costing much more.</li>
            <li>I like the deluxe crease brush to apply concealer.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques brushes are just awesome!  </li>
            <li>But I went out on a limb and bought some pricy eye shadow and this set of nice starter brushes to go with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a variety to chose from, and through experimentation</li>
            <li>package is nice for travel and standing up on its</li>
            <li>Perfect brushes, does what it says, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I never had a set of nice brushes.</li>
            <li>I use the Deluxe Crease Brush every day for applying shadow to my crease.</li>
            <li>The brow brush is perfect and gentle.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice (as in soft and fairly dense, but the case is brilliant!</li>
            <li>It protects the brushes and keeps cosmetic dust from getting rubbed all over a bag, AND it is a handy stand.</li>
            <li>The liner brush is nice and providers a smudgy line.  </li>
            <li>The stand is really handy</li>
            <li>Applies eye shadow effectively.</li>
            <li>Really nice quality and well designed.</li>

            <li>You don&#x27;t have the shedding problem you have with cheaper brushes, but they are in a nice affordable price range.</li>
            <li>Real techniques are great and affordable!</li>
            <li>I hope to own all of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for the price.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner brush is trash, I guess these would be really good for someone who&#x27;s just started out with brushes who has never used better brushes like mac or sigma.</li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>I use the deluxe crease brush for concealing flaws.</li>

            <li>I really love how they tell you what each brush are used for because it was incredibly helpful for someone that is starting to learn how to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>The Real Techniques are the best ( reasonably priced) range around.  </li>
            <li>The littlest brush doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a good use for it.</li>
            <li>overall good set and good price.</li>
            <li>Overall good quality brushes at a good value.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and apply the product great.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, wash up great and no shedding.</li>
            <li>very soft and great application</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t lose hair, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They are all very soft and I have experienced no shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>they clean very easily too.</li>
            <li>The case is very handy, too, I can fit 3 large brushes (powder, blush, and foundation) in addition, and the eyelash/brow groomer (not included).</li>
            <li>These brushes are elastic but not weak, takes as much shadows as I need for a perfect makeup.</li>
            <li>the second brush to the left, is great for blending (although not as great as MAC 217 brush, but still good if you are looking for an affordable alternative)&lt;br /&gt;- affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes are good quality, but they are rather large for the eye area.</li>
            <li>High quality, beautiful, and easy to travel with and clean.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;d rather more buy and probaby looking for &amp;#34;halloween&amp;#34; makeup like smooth makeup.</li>
            <li>I like that they are soft, they work great.</li>
            <li>Anyway I found these brushes which were affordable, cute, and animal free, I decided to buy them</li>
            <li>Only really liked one brush from this set to be honest !</li>
            <li>brushes are really soft and the weight of the brush is great.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and the handles are great.  </li>
            <li>I would say I only use 3 brushes out of the 5 but they blend eyeshadow wonderfully and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I primarily use brushes from top of the line companies</li>
            <li>I love the accent brush for applying smudgey powder / liner to my lower lash line &amp; also for precise eyeshadow crease application.</li>
            <li>I love it ,, these brushes are fantastic ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really worn makeup before, so this kit is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>I like it, very cute and pretty.</li>
            <li>I love the accent brush for applying smudgey powder / liner to my lower lash line &amp; also for precise eyeshadow crease application.  </li>
            <li>They are soft, have great color payoff, and haven&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than MAC 217 because I have average lid space and this applies and blends my crease color perfectly.</li>
            <li>these brushes give me a smooth, lovely look.</li>
            <li>,&lt;br /&gt;Never expected this could be so awesome</li>
            <li>This is the best 15$ I ever spent.</li>
            <li>cuz I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, but real technique is a really good investment.</li>
            <li>I got this because I had heard good things about real techniques.</li>
            <li>These brushes are nice and I would say they&#x27;re worth buying.</li>
            <li>Good product at reasonable price.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re like my sister and don&#x27;t care all that much about makeup these will be good for you.</li>
            <li>If you want a good set of brushes and don&#x27;t want to spend MAC or Segmia money I recommend real techniques.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten good at it on brushes that take me so much longer to do it.</li>
            <li>After reading some very positive reviews I decided to buy my own set</li>
            <li>They are super soft, easy to clean, dont shed hairs and work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The bristles never fall out, and they are so easy to clean!</li>
            <li>So soft and easy to use, and great, even results.</li>
            <li>it, overall its a good brush set.. if the eyeliner brush was better i would have given it a 5 star!</li>
            <li>And the other brushes are very good too!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to see where they go :)</li>
            <li>All the other brushes are equally wonderful.</li>
            <li>Each brush is uniquely designed to fulfill many tasks.  </li>
            <li>They were in the original packaging, never been opened, and packaged securely!</li>
            <li>I use the eyeshadow ones more than the detail and eyeliner brushes, but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>So quick and easy!</li>
            <li>My full  review was written in the Core Collection set!  </li>
            <li>These are very good brushes, better than I expected.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, blend wonderfully and really pack on the shadow.</li>
            <li>The handles make these brushes easy to store and grip.  </li>
            <li>Easily cleaned with water and a drop of shampoo.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, wash and store.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques are some of my favorite brushes, and this is an amazing set for anyone who loves eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I also love that when I clean them there is no fallout.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes are easy to use and easily washed.  </li>
            <li>so you can easily grab the brush you need.  </li>
            <li>I honestly bought this on impulse because I didn&#x27;t really need this brush set, but I bought it anyway mostly because of</li>
            <li>Easy to use for the eyes.</li>
            <li>easy to store.</li>
            <li>Who would have known that you could get such great brushes for so cheap?!</li>
            <li>I like the set because its easy to get the looks I want.</li>
            <li>The knots wouldn&#x27;t hold (easy fix).</li>
            <li>They feel like soft bristle feathers really and make it so easy to apply flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>7-8 brushes fit comfortably and safely.  </li>
            <li>Real techniques brushes are the best I use them all the time, soft, easy to clean love them all</li>
            <li>Thank  you  amazon for making shopping easy.</li>
            <li>All the brushes are soft with great color and smooth for application.</li>
            <li>These brushes are labeled and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the real techniques brushes and now own them all.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with all the Real Techniques brushes I own.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and pleasant to us.  </li>
            <li>the eyebrow brush is soft and thicker than your typcial eyebrow brush, it&#x27;s great for filling your eyebrows in quickly but you can&#x27;t make it draw fine lines to resemble hair follicles, so it&#x27;s better for people who just want to fill them in.</li>
            <li>The stand/holder is great for when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning and not having to dig through my bag for the right one.</li>
            <li>They are excellent quality and just the right sizes for all sorts of different looks.</li>
            <li>Great product for people just starting to wear more detailed eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This set is perfect to create a smokey eye and actually any kind of eye make up.&lt;br /&gt;It has all the essentials you need for a professional finish</li>
            <li>They are soft, don&#x27;t seem to shed, are easy to clean and offer great coverage.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is really cool, I love the brushes&#x27; color, as well as the case they come with.</li>
            <li>( it holds the eyeshadow dust pretty nicely</li>
            <li>Compared to Sigma and other high-end brush sets it is a great value and the set is nice.</li>
            <li>I use these with the lorac pro and naked 3 palettes, and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a set that was pretty nice-</li>
            <li>the traveling kit is cool and stylish.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I dont even know what prompted me to want any in the first place.</li>
            <li>I had heard a lot of good things about Real Techniques brushes, as far as being good quality and affordable.</li>
            <li>the brushes are amazing and they clean nicely and feel very soft.</li>
            <li>They came nicely packaged in their little case but most importantly they work great.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great, I own several Real Techniques brushes, this set was the latest addition to my collection and did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>They are a great introductory set to eyes and super soft!</li>
            <li>you are new to makeup brushes and are looking for a good set to get you started for eye makeup</li>
            <li>After each use I just wipe them off with a makeup remover wipe and they&#x27;re good as new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup artist so these brushes are working just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft, easy to hold, and the bristles DON&#x27;T fall out, which is great because a lot of drugstore  brushes have bristles that fall out.</li>
            <li>After only one use I FELL IN LOVE these are so amazing and for the price!</li>
            <li>I have used all but the fine liner brush,</li>
            <li>I find that I reach for them first among all of my brushes, most of which cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li>fine brush.</li>
            <li>and it still works just fine for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I wish this set came with the FINE eyeliner brush.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying the fine liner brush separately for an additional $6.  </li>
            <li>These brushes were fine for what I needed them for and the carry well in my purse.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as fond of the liner brush in this kit because it doesn&#x27;t give me the fine line that I like</li>
            <li>and I was super pleased with the precision and the results.</li>
            <li>Really good brushes, very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft, and it does a good job of applying makeup in the exact places</li>
            <li>However, you can use a cheap eyeshadow brush and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The price is right angles on with my make up very smoothly</li>
            <li>HUGE brushes.</li>
            <li>I use them, along with the Core collection set, whenever I travel or am in a huge rush.</li>
            <li>Brushes make a huge difference in the pplication of eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>The brushes are never scratchy and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and I know she will enjoy them.</li>
            <li>Really well designed and nice length</li>
            <li>To be cruelty free, you can consider Too faced for synthetic fibers.</li>
            <li>I like these brushes, they are good quality, soft, blend makeup well, and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>These brushes are light weight and look cheap</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone who wants nice brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fantastic.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing quality at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>The larger brush is great for blending.</li>
            <li>but it would work well as a smudger for my liner or precise detailing/highlighting.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone on a budget or seeking 100% cruelty free and animal hair free brushes.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;-The tiny smudge brush is great for using shadow to set your eyeliner (keeps it from smudging).</li>
            <li>brow brush has firm but not scratchy bristles, and perfect for filling in and shaping brows.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really a preference to be honest</li>
            <li>The hairs don&#x27;t skew like cheaper brushes do and they are fairly easy to keep clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>free application&lt;</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t in the market for having to purchase individual brushes at the makeup counters then these are a great alternative.</li>
            <li>I have been using the same Bobbi Brown brushes for years - I thought they were great, until I used them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always told myself to stop buying cheap tools but</li>
            <li>buy for such a great price.</li>
            <li>it made me feel like a pro because i applied everything so smoothly with these brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>All my RT brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>so i just use it for precise contouring.</li>
            <li>Worth way more than what we pay for this set.</li>
            <li>The real Techniques Starter Set did not cost a lot and they were nice brushes and work well.</li>
            <li>I love.the face brushes more but these are still worth it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how cheap these brushes are for the quality they offer.</li>
            <li>I love how colorful these brushes are.</li>
            <li>I recommend all RT brushes they are fantastic for makeup you can see them on Pixiwoo videos..</li>
            <li>I recommend these to everyone who is looking for a great travel kit or even just starting out with makeup.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the lightweight handles and travel case.</li>
            <li>however i have a feeling that i will really enjoy it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for applying a wash of color anywhere above the lid.</li>
            <li>They are cruelty free.</li>
            <li>They are extremely easy to clean--</li>
            <li>Great starter kit, a definitely must-have.  </li>
            <li>Hairs don&#x27;t come off and they clean easily with makeup coming off efficiently.</li>
            <li>This kit fit the bill.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean without worrying about getting water beneath the metal part and they&#x27;re purple.</li>
            <li>This set is a perfect starter set for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the various brush tips in this kit.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous line of brushes by Makeup Artist Samantha Chapman in England.</li>
            <li>I have a set of my own and like them so much, I got a set for my sister ....</li>
            <li>This is great starting set because it includes everything you would need to buy separately.  </li>
            <li>I love these brushes for the price, def worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I think overall the set is great though.</li>
            <li>They are still in great shape, the only one that looks a bit messed up is the angled brush</li>
            <li>precise application</li>
            <li>The fluffy brush is excellent for blending out shadows and the crease brush worked its wonders as well.</li>
            <li>If you look at the Real Technique tutorials, the deluxe crease brush is often used as a concealer brush by both the ladies of Pixiwoo.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and work wonders .</li>
            <li>these brushes are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The big ones are great to apply concealer and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>They are amazing quality and hold up really well.</li>
            <li>and they are really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The others are fantastic, but I find those two stand out.</li>
            <li>All in all, a fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li>The deluxe crease brush applies and blends shadow very well.</li>
            <li>They are nicely made and dense, they just don&#x27;t work very well for their intended purposes.</li>
            <li>I have more fun putting on</li>
            <li>I always used the cheap brushes that came with the cheap makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been following Sam on Pixiewoo for a bit now and am so happy for her and Nic</li>
            <li>I literally saw a difference in how smooth my eyeshdow went on when using their brushes.</li>
            <li>The price is cheap.</li>

            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and blend colors precisely.</li>
            <li>The great thing, especially if you are a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34;, is that there is a website by the designer with tutorials, so you can learn how to do makeup with the very brushes you own.</li>
            <li>Just loving my real technique brushes wouldn&#x27;t trade them in for nothing.  </li>
            <li>love them, and I&#x27;m defiantly looking to buy more real techniques brushes</li>
            <li>All of the real Techniques brushed worked wonderful.</li>
            <li>I lost mine and miss it so much, it was slightly larger and perfect for filling in my brows.</li>
            <li>I love real techniques and I love these brushes</li>
            <li>I would be better served to get the good brushes, pay the extra, and get brushes that work for me.</li>
            <li>So far so good with staying together and hairs not falling out.</li>
            <li>Loved it, soft and light in weight, have not tried yet</li>
            <li>The brushes don&#x27;t shed, and the cut is precise and NOT uneven, so you&#x27;ll get a good amount of product everytime.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and I really wish Amazon would restock this line so I could purchase some more brushes.</li>
            <li>But, as I began to work with them, I found that each brush has many possible (and often surprising) uses.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft on the skin, really good pick up of product,</li>
            <li>The video is quick and easy to understand, and it is easy to find on YouTube too.</li>
            <li>Soft and good quality</li>
            <li>Despite these brushes don&#x27;t have natural bristles, they are good also with powder product.</li>
            <li>I love them and they&#x27;re so soft and nice to use.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are nice and light and pick up make up very well..</li>
            <li>Good and soft brushes.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques brushes is the best overall.</li>
            <li>Best of all they got here in 2 &amp; a half days !</li>
            <li>I am VERY particular over what type of brushes I use, and these are, by far, the best I&#x27;ve come across - for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I got these brushes and I fell in love right away.</li>
            <li>A girl can never have too many brushes, right?</li>
            <li>Would have given a better review if some of the brushes weren&#x27;t all scratched up right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I love the Pixiwoo YouTube channel with the makers&#x27; videos, where they DO use these brushes along with other brands, and I have been incredibly happy with them.  </li>
            <li>The crease brush and the liner brush are my favorites, they are superior compare to other brushes of that kind that I had before.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the case, but it would be very useful when I travel.  </li>
            <li>The case/stand/holder is very useful for storage and standing up</li>
            <li>Very nice set especially since it comes with a travel case.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>very useful and versatile pouch&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love love this set they are very convenient,, specially the dome shaped brush i like using it for under eye or blemish concealing</li>
            <li>absolutly adore the first brush on the left, it is great for applying concealer, and i felt that the concealer stays put for a longer time when i use the brush.. much better than fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I do highly recommend the real Techniques face brushes, they are great quality</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft, and they pick up a good amount of powder (you can tell cause when you start, they&#x27;re white, which is handy if you wash the bristles between every use to make sure they won&#x27;t carry over between applications).</li>
            <li>From left to right: First brush (biggest) is amazing for blending concealer!!!</li>
            <li>But so worth it anyways for the first 3 brushes, theyre amazing.</li>
            <li>You honestly get a great product for a small price.</li>
            <li>I Love them so very much</li>
            <li>high quality bristles, nice design,</li>
            <li>I needed some new brushes that would hold up better and give me a better finish/application.</li>
            <li>I really live the contouring/crease brush -- it has a nice taper to it that makes getting highlighting shadow into the corners of my eye really precise.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, good budget brushes for price and as a moderate make up user they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had very low expectations but was very surprised to find that these brushes are great!</li>
            <li>I love this set so much!</li>
            <li>I am now in LOVE with real Techniques brushes!</li>
            <li>I love this set so much!</li>
            <li>are well constructed brushes, all synthetic and vegan friendly.</li>

            <li>so I was excited when she came out with these brushes.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the 12 bucks!</li>

            <li>I must say that I just love love love my brushed from Teal Techniques.</li>
            <li>She picked out the item and is familiar with the brand.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love, defintiely for anyone who is just starting to use and learn about makeup products..</li>
            <li>but With the amount paid &amp; get 5 brushes, its worth it!</li>
            <li>It is so useful!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a amateur makeup artist and a pro too.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes they are very versatile, I use them for eye shadow, contouring my face, highlighting my face,  setting powder under my eyes, eyeliner, eyebrows, just everything!</li>
            <li>I have been dying to buy these brushes and am not disappointed whatsoever.</li>
            <li>, everything is lovely and very well thought!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Samantha Chapman!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re perfect for everyday eye looks!</li>
            <li>This is my first set of makeup brushes (bought both these and the core collection set) and I love them both.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend buying these if you need a set of brushes, and the case is so handy for travel!</li>
            <li>I am a first time makeup brush user, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about the brand, if they would meet my needs, etc.</li>
            <li>This set seemed like a good starting point until I understood a bit more about applying makeup and could decide what types of brushes were worth investing in.</li>
            <li>I will say that for the price I&#x27;m not disappointed with this set.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes for the price - they&#x27;re very versatile and perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to recieve these brushes as I seen alot of youtube beauty gurus use them</li>
            <li>/&gt;While all the brushes work very well, my absolute favorite in this set is the Deluxe Crease Brush.</li>
            <li>These are great, I think they could be a little bit better quality, but they work well</li>
            <li>quality is perfect, so soft, smooth and easy to clean and dry !</li>
            <li>They feel soft, hold product well without taking it back off of your skin, and create a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>I am in love with these brushes they are such a steal for the price, amazing quality.</li>
            <li>When using the eyebrow brush with powdered brow colors, it puts the color on quickly and smoothly (for mid-grade brow powders).</li>
            <li>They are so soft, really pack color on for great pigmentation, and blend effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Clean after every use</li>
            <li>Case is super cheap.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very multipurpose- as with most of the real Techniques line, and are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have tried many make up brushes from high end to more economical.</li>
            <li>and I can tell she worked really hard on crafting the most optimal brush set with some pretty awesome innovations i.e. the multi-folding case/display!</li>
            <li>LOVE THE PRODUCT AND THE SUPER PACKAGING VERY VERY FAST DELIVERY&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li>These brushes are very pretty and light weight.  </li>
            <li>I own nearly all of them!</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the deluxe crease brush was too big for the crease, but it actually works beautifully and buffs eye shadow out like a dream for a smokey eye.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and stiff so it makes a good blending brush too.</li>
            <li>I dont use the little one ment for liner because my gel liner brush is very good</li>
            <li>Thanks real techniques for good quality brushes at such a good price.</li>
            <li>Really easy to blend colors and get the right look.</li>
            <li>The smallest brush is just amazing and makes highlighting the inner corner so easy, it can be also used for precise application, smudging eyeliner or applying shadow on the lower lash line.</li>
            <li>I love to large brushes.  </li>
            <li>Love my new make up brushes!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are light with very softness (cruelty-free) bristles!!</li>
            <li>Very soft and very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes to everybody who wants high quality brushes for a really good price.</li>
            <li>I got this brushes for my wife and she liked it very much and told me that it&#x27;s very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first legit set of eye brushes and I bought these because of the great reviews and low price.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and do exactly what she says they will.</li>
            <li>If you go to the Real Techniques website creator Sam Chapman gives you fantastic, simple styles in which to use her tools for a great finish.</li>
            <li>These were a great value for the money spent.</li>
            <li>I feel for the money, this is the best eye set on the market--at least that I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love real techniques.</li>
            <li>Better than brushes costing 2-3x as much.</li>
            <li>I sooo love these brushes the whole line ...</li>
            <li>Complete tools for a nice eyes make up.</li>
            <li>I get really good controll especially when putting on gel liners. ^_^</li>
            <li>But there&#x27;s a limit to how many of those brushes you really need.</li>
            <li>I do use the one brush to make my eyeliners more rubbed in rather than a straight line.</li>
            <li>I really love real techniques brand brushes.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and feel nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>I love all my Real Technique brushes.</li>

            <li>Bristle are nice and soft.</li>

            <li>I love it so much ...</li>
            <li>i love these brushes.. the shadow brushes blend really well.</li>
            <li>i went back and bought another one because i loved it so</li>
            <li>These are my absolute favorite brushes of all time.</li>
            <li>It was such a good brush.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes so much I bought two sets.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have their face stipling brush (it&#x27;s a brush for applying gel or liquid blush and foundation) and love it so much.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and pick-up color nicely.</li>
            <li>I love all of the real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>These type of brushes need to pick up product well, be soft and effective on the sensitive eye area, and wear well (wash up nice, and not shed).</li>
            <li>own nearly 100 brushes, and these are used regulary by me.</li>
            <li>I have a house full of daughters.  </li>
            <li>Love all of real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>I wish it came with two shading/blending brushes though as you really need more than one to create a smoky eye.</li>
            <li>I have a full review of this set here:</li>
            <li>brushes are nice and soft</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, very ease to use.</li>
            <li>Good quality and low cost.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know a whole lot about brushes but these have worked well for me :)</li>
            <li>Love , I just did a review on the face Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>I own nearly all of them</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these brushes.</li>
            <li>Also the larger doom shaped brush is really good for blending concealer, highlighter..</li>
            <li>Good brushes,buy with Core Collection Set,competent for daily use.</li>
            <li>Love this kit and ALL of Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>love all real technique brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall good brush set.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft bristles with nice packaging.</li>
            <li>I Love these brushes so much.</li>
            <li>Such a good price too.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this set again for mother&#x27;s day, and my mother loved it as well.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of all things make-up and these brushes are a good set for beginners or pros in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Because I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience doing my makeup nicely, I didn&#x27;t want to blow a hundred bucks on a set of professional brushes.</li>
            <li>liked these brushes so much that I kept them for me instead of adding them to my Professional kit :-)</li>
            <li>Love all the real techniques brushes</li>
            <li>I use these almost every day, and loved the fact that it came in such a convenient set.</li>
            <li>I love the versatility of the brushes and the website offers great instructional videos on application and the various ways you can use them.</li>
            <li>I got this as a present for my sister and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell they are pretty good quality</li>
            <li>They are really soft, they did not shed after washing and applies makeup pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>far as the brushes themselves, they are good quality, apply shadows smoothly and evenly, and are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They hold product well, application is lovely (and easy), they&#x27;re soft, and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>I use the accent brush less often, but it is great for any type of detailed application.  </li>
            <li>Soft on the skin, easy to wash, love</li>
            <li>so the crease brush is a little too large for my creases, but it works wonderfully as a blender and brow highlighter brush.</li>
            <li>positive factor about them is that they are easy and quick to clean.</li>
            <li>However these are a great alternative to some other brands.  </li>
            <li>I still use other brushes to supplement but specifically the deluxe crease brush and other shadow brush are awesome!</li>
            <li>Other than that i think its a great set to have in your collection whether your a beginner or not.</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m happy with these.</li>
            <li>While you can do it with one of the blendy-er brushes, I just think a flat shader would have been a good addition.</li>
            <li>I love samantha chapman and her brushes are a great reflection of hard work she puts into her followers.</li>
            <li>Love my new brushes!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this set along with the many other Real Techniques brushes I own.</li>
            <li>(I love how Real Techniques brushes are colorful) doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them with two of my Urban Decay Naked palettes and gotten flawless looks.</li>
            <li>Third is perfect for highlighting inner corners and bottom lash line.</li>
            <li>,this could have been a much better value, next time I&#x27;ll spend more</li>
            <li>I love this set &amp; have recently purchased 2 more to give as stocking stuffers to my sisters.  </li>
            <li>nothing extraordinary.. a case with brushes.</li>
            <li>they came really quick</li>
            <li>buy 3 more just to have enough for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li>brushes are super soft and applies just as good as make up brushes cost 5x&#x27;s as much as this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the quality I was hoping for and the &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; has a cheep look and feel, but they are adequate.</li>
            <li>this item came so quickly and arrived when i wanted it to.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Hold product very and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, use them daily, and really like them.</li>
            <li>These are better than any of my high end brushes.</li>
            <li>if you love make up and are awiz at applying and if you are looking for brushes that are high qaulity without breaking the bank</li>
            <li>I admit I&#x27;ve never used MAC or more high end brushes</li>
            <li>I usually do take very good care of my things</li>
            <li>They are very decent quality and give a nice variety for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>but other than that very nice quality.</li>
            <li>All Real Techniques brushes so far I purchased are great editions to my collections, they are very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>with the quality of the brush you would expect a much higher price but these brushes are so so so cheap.</li>
            <li>I was told you needed makeup brushes and the reviews on this product made it seem like a great purchase, but since I used an open box product there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m able to send it back.</li>
            <li>The case is also very cute and convenient as it has extra slots to put brushes in</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty fantastic at liner.</li>
            <li>great work samantha , i am such a big fan of yours. :)</li>
            <li>but i got this exact  brush here at $15.60 and free shipping too..........</li>
            <li>The case is nice too, nothing flashy- very sturdy &amp; serviceable as case and stand which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>You can use them very many different ways.</li>
            <li>So mach so that I actually gave away many of my old brushes to a good friend.</li>
            <li>They are super soft, blend amazingly and are very affordable!</li>
            <li>They are soft, and easy to use!</li>
            <li>They are cruelty free, animal hair free (yes apparently those are TWO different things) and they are effective!</li>
            <li>Great quality and work well with all type of high end to low end makeup.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find them on Amazon for less $$.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the brushes: they look great, feel great and the overall packaging looks very fancy to my young teen!</li>
            <li>For 20.00$ or less it is a great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I am willing to pay that much for just eye brush set.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with Real Techniques brushes and I absolutely love this brush set.</li>
            <li>These are my first Real Techniques​ brushes and I have to say that I love the quality.</li>
            <li>I love all the brushes but the ones meant for eyeshadow, that is the first 2 just poke my eyes too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adorable very soft ...</li>
            <li>the top brush is very soft but dense.</li>
            <li>My favorite &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; brushes by far!</li>
            <li>Well made, beautiful, soft and the combo of natural and synthetic fibers really make a difference.</li>
            <li>The angled eyeliner brush is perfect for eyebrows because it&#x27;s slightly thicker and really soft</li>
            <li>I love that these brushes are affordable and super soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>(You must do the eyes first, like with any set of brushes, and then the foundation, in case you have to clean excess off your cheeks)</li>
            <li>The fine liner brush makes applying gel eyeliner so much easier.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and almost flimsy, and the brush I had been looking forward to the most, the deluxe crease brush, was too big to do anything but pack color on with.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush set.</li>
            <li>Another great little feature is the combination case/stand</li>
            <li>Great little brush set.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques products are all very good and have never let me down!</li>
            <li>I might buy another from this brand to see if the face brushes are any better, but this has certainly ruined my experience with Real Techniques.</li>
            <li>This little brushes and amazing , their my favorite to use when doing my eyes</li>
            <li>liner brush is perfect for liner and for eyebrow, not that hard but enough for doing a perfect job.&lt;br /&gt;The pointed brushes (the two little) can be used for concealer and pointed highlight.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The best thing is it comes with a nice little black folding case for travel/storage!</li>
            <li>I can also fit a foundation brush and blush brush (also from real Techniques) and a powder brush.  </li>
            <li>Great for everyday make up application.  </li>
            <li>Yeassssss theyre amazing the ONLY bushes I use for my makeup</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t shed, which is nice considering even some of the more popular and expensive make-up brushes tend to do so.</li>
            <li>I am a huge real Techniques fan and use them in almost all my youtube makeup tutorials.</li>
            <li>I prefer a round brush with longer bristles for the crease, like the Mac 219, or bdellium 781 (bdellium is a great line of cruelty-free brushes).</li>
            <li>I have both of the real Techniques kits with the cases, which are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Before I got these brushes I did do heavy research online and saw great reviews.</li>
            <li>Professional makeup artist, Samantha Chapman (the brush creator), has amazing videos on the Real Techniques website and on YouTube that show you how to use the brushes (You can also see her and her sister, Nic, on Pixiwoo on YouTube and on their blog).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this eyeliner brush in the set as lip brush, so useful after all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are soft, have not shed through washings, and have many uses.</li>
            <li>Real techniques brushes are the most affordable high quality brushes out there!</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the colors.</li>
            <li>This is the second set that I got, my favourite is de deluxe crease brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes are well worth it.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s kind of a pain to put back the brushes in the holder.</li>
            <li>It softens everything you put into the crease to make a lovely, professional look.</li>
            <li>These brushes make a nice basic set.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft, so I&#x27;m glad.</li>
            <li>Have nice soft touch and blend very well.</li>
            <li>Most brush sets out there are complete face sets - powder brushes, contour brushes, etc.</li>
            <li>I have experienced zero shedding even after several washes, so far</li>
            <li>It honestly holds it own among the even more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>I own a set of Urban Decay and some Mac brushes and</li>
            <li>I love real techniques so much,  that I dont want to use them on my clients.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money she says just for the crease brush.</li>
            <li>The brushes come in a nice portable case that can be folded back to stand upright.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is about these brushes, or how they are so affordable, but they are worth every penny and them some.</li>
            <li>She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the full set of these brushes since they first launched in 2012.</li>
            <li>I love Real Techniques brushes however I really dont use any of these brushes except for maybe one.</li>
            <li>And while I rarely use the crease brush on my crease, I use it all the time as well.  </li>
            <li>The pixel point brush is one that I use very rarely only because I use eye liners with built in applicators, but again, if you needed a precision brush, it would do nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an economical way to figure out what your preference brushes are.</li>
            <li>buy more and the are really soft.</li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>They are a really nice quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I suppose you get what you pay for, so it&#x27;s reasonable good enough for what you pay.</li>
            <li>its well worth the price</li>
            <li>SO WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li>worth the investment, seem to be washable.</li>
            <li>My personal favorites are the angled brush and the deluxe crease brush.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to complete my collection with some more of Samantha&#x27;s brushes.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was when the deluxe crease brush hairs separated from the brush itself.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They are much more better as I expected.</li>
            <li>Each one gets used daily, and the packaging for them helps to keep them nice and organized.</li>
            <li>I love the case they come in, and the brushes are so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>This brand  is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Fun to have a colorful eyeshadow brush set.</li>
            <li>The primer that comes with these brushes are worth the price of the brushes.</li>
            <li>This kit is definitely a useful addition to makeup junkies.</li>
            <li>Worth the hype.</li>
            <li>However, set was still worth it.</li>
            <li>They are soft, great for blending shadows and applying eyeliner, super easy to wash and dry really fast.</li>
            <li>Good starter set, brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed so far.  </li>
            <li>Worth your money.</li>
            <li>I love them so much they apply everything very well.</li>
            <li>(But I rarely do that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it worth it?</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hair is soft and easy to clean after used&lt;br</li>
            <li>There just worth it</li>
            <li>I have an old slanted eyeshadow brush which I love for crease application.</li>
            <li>My eye brows look more natural than ever.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for packing color all over the lid, cutting the crease, and the baby one in the middle is actually perfect for getting eyeshadow right underneath your bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>It also comes in a very handy little carrying case that you can also use as a stand when you are not traveling.</li>
            <li>love these brushes work just as good as MAC if not better !</li>
            <li>They wash up very easily, and of course have this cute little carrying case if you travel.</li>
            <li>But that is ok, I can use it for many other things.</li>
            <li>Most of the other sets I was looking into had too many brushes.</li>
            <li>These are great makeup brushes and they were so much cheaper than getting them at Ulta or any other store.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the bristles and would really recommend it to anyone looking for new makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>These do the exact same thing, sometimes better and at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super soft and easy to hold</li>
            <li>I was really excited about purchasing these brushes as they seemed to be exactly what I was looking for (makeup brushes that were good enough to learn some makeup techniques with but cheap enough to avoid a costly investment if I sucked).  </li>
            <li>The case is good to use for travel with my other brushes.</li>
            <li>The other brushes are good size range and the bristles don&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>The price is also right.  </li>
            <li>The sizes are just right</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>They are just the right size and shape for defining and detailing eyes.  </li>
            <li>These eye brushes are just the right size for whatever look you are going for.</li>
            <li>They do not shed or lose their shape and they pick up just the right about of product.</li>
            <li>The brushes are well made and were priced just right.</li>
            <li>I now know why my makeup never came out looking like the youtube tutorials, because i didnt have the right tools.</li>
            <li>It was the right decision for me.</li>
            <li>I read some of the reviews on here right before purchasing and almost talked myself out of it...</li>
            <li>The bristles of these brushes have just the right springiness.</li>
            <li>The variety of bristle trims are just the right size for me.</li>
            <li>I have wanted these brushes for about a year but the price had never been right  adj when I saw them under $15</li>
            <li>I  jumped right on it.  </li>
            <li>For some reason I feel like I need to keep picking up color to get the right amount of eyeshadow on.</li>
            <li>Makes trying new styles easy.</li>
            <li>I usually just use cheap brushes with my makeup but this was definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Simple to clean, easy to apply, and quick to travel.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush set!</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li>If only Real Techniques would sell the deluxe crease brush on its own, I&#x27;d definitely get myself another one.</li>
            <li>Not a single one has shed and they&#x27;re so easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes they are very soft and thick very nice.</li>
            <li>These are by far my most favorite makeup brushes, especially the angled eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great kit for someone who&#x27;s just starting out with eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;-The shader brush is extremely soft and would probably work very well with mineral shadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish they sold a more complete brush set im buying more of these same brand but face brushes .</li>
            <li>The pointed eyeliner brush is amazing and everyone is saying it&#x27;s too long</li>
            <li>When I took off the plastic, everything looked pretty good; exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have large eyes and that brush does quick work of applying eyeshadow and blending.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft, precise, inexpensive, and are more than enough to do a full eye look.</li>
            <li>I usually buy all high end brushes and my favorite is Trish McEvoy brushes but these brushes are fabulous for the price and even if they were a bit more they would still be worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>High quality brushes that does their job well, worth your $12!</li>
            <li>While they are really nice, I&#x27;m not positive I would have paid full price for these as in my opinion there are better options out there for the same price range.</li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean and they don&#x27;t shed(!)</li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Might be good as a gift to a young girl starting out trying makeup and learning how to care for brushes.</li>
            <li>This is soft, easy to use, durable.</li>
            <li>They clean up easily and I have not lost any bristles, even after daily use.</li>
            <li>This is a nice and reasonably priced set of brushes for makeup beginners needing a basic brush kit.</li>
            <li>The final 2 brushes are the ones I don&#x27;t picture myself using, they remind me of the brushes you get with a huge cheap palette of eyeshadow or something.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and the handles are easy to hold onto when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>The fibers are soft and the brushes are easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>I bust these out every few days to try again, but I&#x27;m not getting more satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I am a cosmetics professional and absolutely love the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>Product goes on easily with no waste.</li>
            <li>Soft and very blend able.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and apply the product easily.</li>
            <li>There is nothing remarkable about them and they don&#x27;t apply foundation well or generally fulfill basic requirements for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are very soft and don&#x27;t have a cheap or plastic feeling to them at all.</li>
            <li>Very soft and the brush is light.</li>
            <li>Everything I expected them to be and a lot more!</li>
            <li>Everything I expected and more!</li>
            <li>This is pretty much why I bought the set; watching tutorials online, I noticed that most women use a soft domed brush for blending.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected,  real techniques is a good product, cheaper here .</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I found that the real Techniques line harnesses the same fantastic quality as those brushes for a much more reasonable price range.</li>
            <li>Overall the brushes are very light, and densely packed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t fill in my brows with a brush very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough that the bristles won&#x27;t hurt the delicate skin under the eyes, I manage to achieve a more flawless coverage than I would using my ring finger to pat it in.</li>
            <li>The base shadow brush is more appropriate as a blending brush and the deluxe crease brush is better off as an under eye concealer brush.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t use the case when travelling, because many of my other brushes don&#x27;t fit, so I could take or leave the travel case.</li>
            <li>REAL TECHNIQUES BRUSHES NEVER FAIL TO IMPRESS ME!</li>
            <li>The deluxe crease brush is pretty large for a crease brush, too large for smaller eyes unless you are blending everything out.</li>
            <li>Even if you neglect to clean a brush after several uses they clean right up.</li>
            <li>These Real Technique brushes seem well made, very soft, easily cleaned</li>
            <li>Love these brushes they&#x27;re so soft with a high end quality but without the price tag.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of their travel lip brushes which are holding up good, no pieces on my lips which is exactly what happened the last time I bought brushes for a little more money.  </li>
            <li>almost like I&#x27;m a pro, and fast!  </li>
            <li>The whole line of brushes is the holy grail!</li>
            <li>Real Techniques makes great brushes for such low prices.</li>
            <li>I have since become a bit more skilled and I no longer use my Starter Set as I have purchased more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>fact that they&#x27;re quite pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many ecotools&#x27; products which I actually found I prefer to use</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this!</li>
            <li>Really like these brushes!</li>
            <li>Real Techniques never disappoints!</li>
            <li>They are soft and smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li>These were my first brush kit</li>
            <li>The plastic outside looked pretty okay.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Love my brushes especially the accent brush</li>
            <li>The brush material is soft to the touch on the skin and the light to hold.  </li>
            <li>I thought these brushes were going to be mediocre at best considering</li>
            <li>Bought these to replace my collection of e.l.f./forever 21 brushes which I didn&#x27;t like in the first place.</li>
            <li>These are my alltime favortie brushes and I really recomend it!</li>
            <li>Been hearing a lot mixed reviews and I have to say I love them.</li>
            <li>When i tried to do my eyeshadow, the brushes worked really well!</li>
            <li>I will buy more brushes from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I would get more eyeshadow use out of it if it was smaller, but I do like its applications as a face brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that they will last for years to come.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that they will last for years to come.</li>
            <li>Out of all the real Technique brushes I own, this set is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the case and how it can lock open and stand up.  </li>
            <li>The handles are a pretty metallic purple and the have rubber tips on the end.</li>
            <li>So I like the brushes (which is why I bought these in the first place)</li>
            <li>I recommend this product everyone ;)</li>
            <li>The contour brush is my absolute fave!</li>
            <li>Would buy a second set if I didn&#x27;t have so many</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister, along with her first eye-shadow palette.  </li>
            <li>Real Techniques &amp;#34; core collection &amp;#34; are my babies !</li>
            <li>As a general rule I LOVE real Technique brushes.  </li>
            <li>When this set wears out I&#x27;m going to re-purchase this exact set again.</li>
            <li>really not expensive</li>
            <li>This brush set at first seemed lacking.</li>
            <li>Got the softness and quality I would expect from Real Techniques brushes!  </li>
            <li>and I have higher end brushes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will buy more from the same brand!</li>
            <li>I really have no use for but the set was still worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>neither did I when I first got them.</li>
            <li>With these brushes I can do my eyes in like 5 minutes, and they look fantastic and natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Theses brushes are pretty</li>
            <li>Came in fast to!</li>
            <li>so i decided to buy them off amazon as they are in a such more affordable range.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed-Simple-</li>
            <li>I first learned of the set(s) from Samantha Chapman on youtube through her brother&#x27;s fiance Tanya Burr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>colors of the brushes are pretty.</li>
            <li>so i could get more precision when doing beards for cosplay, as i am a girl, and different eye makeup!</li>
            <li>I bought this when I first got my eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li>so I know exactly what Im getting.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought these :D</li>
            <li>Love them and will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is I will they had more of a rounder shader brush kinda of like the E.L.F. C brush.</li>
            <li>these brushes never fail me.</li>
            <li>Ive purchased several more of these sets to give as gift and everyone raves about them.</li>
            <li>But in general yes good brush set to have especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fake as it&#x27;s says on reviews</li>
            <li>I will, definitely, purchase more.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li>I am a seasoned licensed cosmetologist.</li>
            <li>For the most part I find myself only using the largest 2 brushes.</li>
            <li>I love real techniques in general.</li>
            <li>I am obssesed with all real techniques brushes!</li>
            <li>They are real great for beginners as they have everything you might need and its not too expensive.</li>
            <li>I also bought a shading brush, which looks more practical for putting on shadows and such.</li>
            <li>I have used real Techniques brushes in the past, and thought they would be a great gift.  </li>
            <li>and I love these more than my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>Those are the first eye brushes i ever bought.</li>
            <li>I think i will be starting to collct more brushes for higher-end results</li>
            <li>There is enough space for more brushes in the holder too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my humble opinion they&#x27;re good</li>
            <li>Use them everyday, just as good as my sigma brushes</li>
            <li>I wanted some reasonable brushes to practice the looks my favorite YouTube beauty guru Jaclyn Hill did with the more expensive sigma brushes since I&#x27;m fairly new to more detailed make up application.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are super soft and a good size for average to larger-sized eyes/faces.</li>
            <li>I needed new brushed though, and I liked the look of these.</li>
            <li>As with all &amp;#34;real Techniques&amp;#34; brushes these are so super soft!!</li>
            <li>The bristles on all of the brushes are soft and dense, so you can easily apply and blend out shadow without much effort.  </li>
            <li>Soft brushes are gentle and make blending easy.  </li>
            <li>item came much more quickly than I expected.  </li>
            <li>OMG these brushes are so soft and perform their jobs like a pro!!!!</li>
            <li>They are soft and a nice weight and don&#x27;t feel cheap like a lot of other brushes on the market.</li>
            <li>so if there are any of you who want to create a winged liner or any type of eyeliner shape, i urge you to try using the first brush on the right, which is perfect for first time users, hard enough , and makes life so much easier, you can also use it to retouch and fill your eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased other Real Technique products and have always been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This was such a smart purchase for me, these brushes don&#x27;t disappoint :)</li>
            <li>the other ones are amazing.</li>
            <li>Soft brushes and great little carrying case that does sit upright like the picture shows.</li>
            <li>I find myself reaching for these over any other brushes I own.</li>
            <li>Plus, these brushes are incredibly soft and fun to brush on your face!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t really have a good sized general lid brush for packing on color.</li>
            <li>Budget friendly with professional results.</li>
            <li>The other brushes are quite nice.  </li>
            <li>theyre professional brushes but not expensive like most professional brushes are.</li>
            <li>eyeshadow brush picks up so much product with light pressure and its soft on the lids.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>, cant wait to use it, the hair is soft and it feels good when I tries to test on my face</li>
            <li>I love real Technique brushes, they are reasonably priced and last me a few years with good care.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really have no point of reference for what separates an awesome make up brush from a lame one.</li>
            <li>I feel like they are a good alternative for much more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>Great addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup kit - be it professional makeup artist or just the everyday person.</li>
            <li>They are soft and smooth and work really well.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and give me a more professional look when used.</li>
            <li>I would 100% consider purchasing more Real Techniques brushes in the future!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more real techniques brushes in the immediate future!</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and quickly tossed my old ones and use only these.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are slightly bigger than I imagined, but that&#x27;s completely fine and more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li>they are super soft!</li>
            <li>These are super soft brushes!</li>
            <li>Now I am being asked by my friends to do their makeup on special events because they want that professional finish look.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and made very well!</li>
            <li>They are very soft and very pretty if you choose to display them on your makeup table.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft, easy to wash, quick to dry.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much all I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>first, i didn&#x27;t find use for the angeled brush because i was already using a much thinner  elf brush for my brows</li>
            <li>These were my first purchase of Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li>I have other brushed by them that work great also.</li>
            <li>In other tutorials she uses different brushes, so they must already know these brushes aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>I use the biggest brush for concealer, and pretty much don&#x27;t use the others.</li>
            <li>, first look what she does with them, and then think if you really need them.</li>
            <li>They work very well and are so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>They are soft, and full.  </li>
            <li>I feel pampered using these brushes and the quality is superior to brushes I have had in the past.</li>
            <li>some of the brushes in this set are not useful and/or kind of bristly on my skin.</li>
            <li>While the price may seem low these brushes are a very good quality better than any brushes that u have purchased previously from target or other drug stores.</li>
            <li>you are serious about makeup, I would probably recommend spending a bit more for better quality brushes.</li>
            <li>one main difference i noticed was that my mally brushes (that look similarly to these carry a bit more weight in my hand.)</li>
            <li>I have several brush sets from high end to lower priced sets and these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Each brush is labeled with its intended purpose to make it easy, but if you follow Sam&#x27;s blog, she suggests different ways to use each brush.</li>
            <li>but when it came to prom, I needed some basic brushes that would be easy use for a beginner.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft, I can&#x27;t wait to break them in.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and they&#x27;re synthetic</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and they are super soft.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft, and I have washed them twice now</li>
            <li>Super soft brushes that blend my make-up like butter.</li>
            <li>Super soft</li>
            <li>Trust the before reviews, these brushes are worth the money, soft and comparable to higher priced ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I DO think that this is quite a nice starter set, though I found the sizes of the brushes to be somewhat odd.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather large and is more suitable for applying a thin line of shadow underneath the eye instead of for eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and seem worth it.</li>
            <li>A single MAC brush would cost more than all 5 of these brushes and in my experience, not hold up as well.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to spend more than $20 dollars on single brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll splurge on eyeshadow palettes all of the time, but I can&#x27;t stand dropping more than 10 bucks on a single brush.</li>
            <li>I decided to get them anyway because the price of the set was cheaper than most single brushes I had and figured I&#x27;d give them to a friend</li>
            <li>The brushes are too large.</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles and are very high quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and gentle on my skin (even after constant use!), and are super easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>This is my second brush set - the first being a gift from my parents, a Kirkland (which is the generic brand for Costco) that I actually really liked.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and hold the pigment very well.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re super soft and don&#x27;t shed much at all.</li>
            <li>Excellent brushes and super low prices, you cannot go wrong with these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought and tried different kind of brushes on the maket, cheap and very expensive ones and nothing as good as these Real technique brushes.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques has a channel on You Tube where they post tutorials on how to use their brushes, how to achieve certain looks, etc.  </li>
            <li>I dig the brushes &amp; the little wallet-ish thing that holds them is nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Accent Brush – A nice little brush.</li>
            <li>it is too thick, i can tell from the pic, so i ordered another Fine Liner Brush, and i am glad i did.</li>
            <li>and all who worked on making this a high quality not expensive</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush set,it comes with a base brush,and a deluxe crease brush,an accent brush,a fine liner brush,brow brush,and a panoramic case.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to find a good quality brow brush that evenly distributes product and gets inbetween the hairs.</li>
            <li>Although I love the brush quality, I feel like the two brushes on the right side (Pixel-Point Eyeliner Brush, Brow Brush) are a little large.  </li>
            <li>Second brush is great for blending harsh lines for eye shadow (transition).</li>
            <li>By far the best brushes that I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried some expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>but I ended up loving these brushes and giving away some of my more expensive brushes</li>
            <li>The eyeliner brush doesn&#x27;t really work out.  </li>
            <li>Samantha Chapman + Real Techniques &#x3D;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It hold the product very will&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like it a lot, though I haven&#x27;t used it very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see the Real Techniques brand has been expanding</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it that much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These brushes work really well.</li>
            <li>I got this time is much thiner</li>
            <li>The liner brush works well for applying a brown powder over my liner, I have&#x27;t really used the accent brush yet</li>
            <li>I purchased these from real techniques Amazon LLC.</li>
            <li>Absolutely impractical.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use this as my travel brush kit and it works really well.</li>

            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m supposed to do with this set.</li>
            <li>very much.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I also really like this company.</li>

            <li>They really do so much of the work for you.</li>
            <li>Also, it works really well on blending your makeup.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that just one Mac brush costs as much as the whole set of these ones.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the brow brush though.</li>
            <li>and they really help with putting my eye-shadows on.</li>
            <li>They hold the products really well and apply evenly without dropping fallout everywhere.</li>
            <li>When it comes to brushes I don&#x27;t know much of what I should have  </li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>just really helps it blend</li>
            <li>This set makes it much simpler for her to to experiment and practice with shades and techniques.</li>
            <li>I really like the standing case too.</li>
            <li>I really like this set.  </li>
            <li>The others i don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>Really soft and none of the bristles have come out,I&#x27;m just not crazy about the travel case,but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, easy to clean and have minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the remainder of the brushes as much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush set!</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it too much</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t travel much either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched the videos and read on the real Techniques site, so I know what to do with each one, but they are just not hitting it for me.  </li>
            <li>I like a lot real techniques brushes .</li>
            <li>Very recommend this set to all.</li>
            <li>They are much sturdier.  </li>
            <li>Work very well and are durable.</li>
            <li>the brushes in this set are really nice&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>and she seems to really know her stuff.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the stand much though</li>
            <li>they are real and not fact incase anyone was wondering.</li>
            <li>They are soft, don&#x27;t shed, and the case they come with is useful for storage.</li>
            <li>I already had some of the face brushes from Real Techniques</li>
            <li>Got them for my daughter who doesn&#x27;t use a ton of makeup and doesn&#x27;t want every brush shape available, but needed the essential brushes.  </li>
            <li>I really like all the brushes.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I found out about Real Techniques Brushes from Sam Chapman, who posts as Pixiwoo on youtube.  </li>
            <li>I have almost all the Real Techniques brushes</li>
            <li>own.&lt;br /&gt;The package is sleek enough to fit into a bag or a purse.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>thanks so much, deffinately deserves 5 stars</li>
            <li>Fast and on point..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been doing its job very well.</li>
            <li>brushs set , the eye set and blush brush  from Real Techniques</li>
            <li>Real Techniques has a travel set</li>
            <li>But these brushes have really improved my look when I do wear makeup.</li>
            <li>I am very out of practice with makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much space for things and this helps with space saving and keeps the brushes from any dust and being distorted</li>
            <li>The palette was the real gift; but she didn&#x27;t really have any brushes to use with it, so I just wanted to get her started.</li>
            <li>And the case is very convenient.</li>
            <li>its name ..for starter it&#x27;s really suit for beginner like</li>
            <li>real technique brush</li>
            <li>and really that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li>I really wished (with all myself)</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>Ordered for a friend, came on time, nothing broken, everything looked great.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>Apply cosmetics very well.</li>
            <li>also really like the travel case they come in.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll definitely need to secure your brushes in the bands or else</li>
            <li>The Techniques Starter Kit really beat them ALL.</li>
            <li>I am really exited about this purchase</li>
            <li>really like the dome brushes in this set.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put makeup on my eyebrows, so the eyebrow brush doesn&#x27;t get much use either.</li>
            <li>and you dont have any eye brushes i really recommend trying this set out before you purchase nicer ones.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have almost the whole set</li>
            <li>and they work really well with powder or cream.</li>
            <li>However these brushes are very multifunctional.</li>
            <li>The great thing is that there is a variety of brushes; it&#x27;s not like some kits where you get several that look very similar and are just different sizes.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy these, and that this is helpful, especially since I know I&#x27;m rambling.</li>
            <li>After seeing a lot of makeup gurus on YouTube use this brush (well, all the Real Techniques brushes), I was sold on the fact that they seemed to work so well on camera and the affordable prices.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched Sam and Nic&#x27;s youtube videos (absolute recommend, they&#x27;re a godsend for people like me who aren&#x27;t very make-up savvy) and heard about them there.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush set.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>but I really like the standup case</li>
            <li>But alas, can&#x27;t use it that way, so I still need a replacement - however, otherwise the set is great and would buy again.</li>
            <li>They are very well made and work wonders.</li>
            <li>When I first got it I thought I was too flimsy and full to apply a smooth line, but once I loaded it up it made a really smooth, thin line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice starter set or sufficient brush set for regular daily use.</li>
            <li>I also own the ones for the base and they are great too.</li>
            <li>my clients love them especially how soft they feel on the skin</li>
            <li>The case is kind of a waste unless you plan to always keep them in a case or you travel a lot and need all of them.</li>
            <li>I love that the brushes are both universal and soft.</li>
            <li>The base shadow brush and deluxe crease brush are great.</li>
            <li>love all of the real techniques brushes very good quality, was shocked when i received them right the next day</li>
            <li>I never expected to find a use for the accent brush, but now I use it to apply color directly to my crease or make a strong V with it and then blend it out.</li>
            <li>These brushes are not only super soft and easy to hold, but they apply my eye products seamlessly.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft but have just the right bounce in them.</li>
            <li>The case is great for drying the brushes (as they should dry upside down).</li>
            <li>They are freakishly soft, clean SUPER easily, never lose bristles, maintain their unique shapes...</li>
            <li>I love that these brushes are good quality and look and feel expensive - even though they are not!</li>
            <li>Very soft, manageable size, and really get the job done!</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed (like the natural bristle bare escentuals brushes do) and I just love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>left my original review</li>
            <li>but I have bought other brushes from the core collection and prefer the utility of them more.</li>
            <li>Can be used for many purposes other than applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price, these are fantastic little brushes: soft, do not shed at all, do not absorb too much product, and easy to clean with a brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>better than expected!</li>
            <li>They hold up much better than my MAC and other brand brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall, this set is worth the price that you pay for it!</li>
            <li>I have since ordered some of the other brushes and now most of my brush collection consists of this brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They lose a few hairs in the first uses, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>(I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Body Wash or just regular Equate hand soap to clean mine.)</li>
            <li>I plan on buying a second one just to add to my collection, but even for the beginner or amateur this is a great set.</li>
            <li>It was really nice that it came with a case for the brushes, although I&#x27;m not sure how much she cared about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the small detailing brush is great for inner corner work</li>
            <li>(I was scared because they look too big) and it was easy, fast and look so professional.</li>
            <li>All the products I have purchased were amazing and for a little price!</li>
            <li>Other than that, the stand/case is useful and keeps everything clean and organised.</li>
            <li>I use them with both high end and mass market shadows and have been very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves this set, high quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li>They work like high end brushes with out the high end price tag!</li>
            <li>Just make sure they dry completely or else</li>
            <li>I have had Mac brushes for more than 6 years and always found them shedding, these have not shed a single hair and they are so so soft and my skin goes all uhmmm</li>
            <li>Each brush is dense, gentle on delicate skin, and so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They are dense, soft, well-constructed, and they each do exactly what they&#x27;re designed to do.</li>
            <li>funny thing is that I dont have one complete make up set.  </li>
            <li>Better than your average &amp;#</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that this groomer is not included in the set - I find it essential for perfect mascara application.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no problems at all, very soft, do a great job, no loose bristles, big ones will stand up on end on the counter.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t wear eyeliner on my daily makeup, so I use the very detailed brush for putting on glitter on the inner corner of my eyes and it can even blend it!</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a permanent use for it, but I have used it to apply powder under my eyes and to add highlights on top my cheek bones and down my nose.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t like putting on eye makeup when I feel small stings from shadow brushes, so these are simply smooth and I dare say more feathery-er than a feather!&lt;br /&gt;The handles, the multi functional case where you can add even more brushes on the other side</li>
            <li>For those who are trying to start new with brushes or beginners these brush&#x27;s are what you are looking for!</li>
            <li>I purposely didn&#x27;t clean red OCC Lip Tar off of my lip brush for a month, and the lip tar came off as easily as any other product.</li>
            <li>I also love how soft these brushes&#x27; bristles are--they don&#x27;t feel prickly whatsoever on my lids (a peeve I have with other brands), and they pick up and distribute product very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to real techniques.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to eye shadow, and always thought that it would be complicated to use brushes for the application, but these are so easy to use and my shadow looks amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are several brushes I&#x27;ve not seen before, including a teeny detail brush, which I love, because I tend to be more subtle with my eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>Love the lavendar color and velcro closure for black carrier.</li>
            <li>I have purchased better for less here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>two brushes are decent but they are not anything to write home about.</li>
            <li>a decent product.</li>
            <li>This particular set.</li>
            <li>I bought a few extra as Christmas gifts and the recipients loved them as well.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for concealer.</li>
            <li>I love how I can use different brush for different use.</li>
            <li>What you see are vibrant colors on your eyes</li>
            <li>Definitely all the most necessary brushes youll ever need</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the entire set and use it daily.</li>
            <li>since its a duo fiber brush (and its cut in layers..like hair would be) it allows for a decent amount of product to fall off the brush or not even get on the eyelid at all.</li>
            <li>and that is the main reason I bought it</li>
            <li>Exactly what you need to start being a little more professional about makeup application.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and spread eyeshadows really well.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>.the &amp;#34;eyebrow brush&amp;#34; is much wider than I expected, in fact too wide to get a really fine precise tip on my brows.  </li>
            <li>i reach for these more often than i do some of my very expensive brushes--these are great quality especially for the price!!</li>
            <li>I dont exactly know how much does it cost every individual brush that real techiques sells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe in buying high end brushes</li>
            <li>I discovered these brushes watching the creator&#x27;s YouTube makeup guide channel, Pixiwoo, which I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Just highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>These brushes are of a high quality for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>and I use high quailty make up ...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let people fool you into thinking you need high end brand names, you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY REC.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>highly recommended it for you</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product because I have been watching Sam Chapman´s Pixiwoo videos for a while</li>
            <li>I highly recommend RT</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand for brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest getting these</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them</li>
            <li>and they are definitely a high quality.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, and handles are long for comfortable using.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend you watch the videos, figure out which ones you want and buy them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to by this set.</li>
            <li>natural bristles can pack more powder and blending is extremely luxurious.</li>
            <li>I just wished they picked up and distributed makeup a little better.</li>
            <li>I would prefer if they came in a case like the Sigma brushes, or if they included a cute little bag to keep them in, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>these &amp; my eyes look a lot better than when I use to use those little spongy tips.</li>
            <li>once i opened the package, the brushes were soft, steady and seemed very tactile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like the colored handles because it makes them easy to differentiate and find the one I am looking for, making application slightly faster</li>
            <li>and I have a hard time having any kind of precision on my brows.  </li>
            <li>Work super well with both liquid and dry products which is what I love the most, but unfortunately the labeling rubbed off just after 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I do not use the case because it&#x27;s hard to fit in my case, but overall, I love the brushes.</li>
            <li>These are decent for starters but I can already tell I will be wanting new brushes soon.</li>
            <li>The bristles were really soft on the skin and it catches the eyeshadows colour pigments really well.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li>They work very well with everything I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I added these five brushes to the real Techniques Travel Essentials Set and now have a complete makeup set.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on high dollar brushes!</li>
            <li>I have been very plesantly surprised with them.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>so far they are holding up really well.</li>
            <li>But these brushes are soft and gentle.  </li>
            <li>They are so soft and very affordable.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft but they still pack on those shadows and allow you to really blow people away with your eyes.</li>
            <li>Soft, REALLY pick up the eye-shadows, and do their jobs.</li>
            <li>The fluffy crease brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I brought a HD blending set of brushes from sephora a while back for over $70 but for some reason I didn&#x27;t feel they were worth it.</li>
            <li>A few brushes that I don&#x27;t use yet but love the ones I do</li>
            <li>These have been in my collection for a long time now with many washes and they last and don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>I will be buying a few more as gifts.</li>
            <li>other than that I loved the other 2 that came with the set.</li>
            <li>only one brush is useful</li>
            <li>I use all of the different shapes (I didn&#x27;t think I would), and find the case quite useful (also a surprise).</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing a few more sets to use on jobs.</li>
            <li>she loves it, if they must wear it at least this keeps things tidy and sanitary and organized.</li>
            <li>Plenty of options for what I think most people need for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Real Techniques are triple better than does and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li>I had been meaning to order these brushes for a long time, and I am so glad that I finally did.</li>
            <li>and I use most of them everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally hopeless at doing makeup</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t care for the case because its hard to stick the brushes back in but other than that these are awesome!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not professional grade, but they&#x27;re damn good for anything LESS than professional grade.</li>
            <li>I did not experience any shedding, the bristles are super soft and pick up just enough product with any excess.</li>
            <li>They are amazing quality, really soft, and are relatively inexpensive compared to other brushes.</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush and several other of the real Techniques brushes and really love them.  </li>
            <li>I use the accent brush to highlight the inner corners of my eye and right under the brow.</li>
            <li>High quality, soft but steady.</li>
            <li>I have a few different sets love them!</li>
            <li>I would most certainly recommend these to any make up user, amateur or professional.  </li>
            <li>These brushes along with the larger real Techniques foundation brush live up to the positive reviews preceding mine.</li>
            <li>the Base Shadow Brush and Deluxe Crease Brush were smaller so that I can get a more precise application&lt;</li>
            <li>Since getting the full line of these, I have not purchased a single new brush.</li>
            <li>The large brush is perfect for my base color on the eyelid.</li>
            <li>A colleague that I have adopted into my family, is new to makeup.</li>
            <li>And cant wait to arrived my new sets of it..</li>
            <li>so I can try new things with my eyeshadow palettes.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re brand new.</li>
            <li>I am not a make-up pro by any means so not wanting to pay a lot of money for new brushes.</li>
            <li>I was looking for new blending brushes and came across this kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying out a new liquid eyeliner at the moment.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t live without the smudge brush; i use it every day.</li>
            <li>These are new brushes and I can already see where the letters are coming off.  </li>
            <li>I am not afraid to wash these since ether do hold up better than all of my other brands of brushes ( however I am still careful and conscious when I wash them.)</li>
            <li>If you want high-quality brushes, I seriously recommend all the brushes from the real Techniques brand because they are seriously the best.</li>
            <li>They also dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I use these every day and absolutely cannot recommend Real Techniques brushes and products enough.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner brush is a bit thick but the eyebrow brush is okay if you have thicker brows because it is much thicker than any angled eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li>I really like the two left brushes and reach for them for eyeshadow, blending concealer a lot, they wash really well too</li>
            <li>I have used the stubby shadow brush a few times and need to play around with it a bit more -- it is quite round and well, stubby, but makes it easy to pack on color.  </li>
            <li>If you need new brushes at a reasonable price, you don&#x27;t have to go to that large company that begins with an &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; or the one that starts with an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34;, just go get yourself a set of Real Techniques brushes and you&#x27;ll never need to worry about those other high end brushes again.</li>
            <li>BUT: I found them very soft, applies make up well</li>
            <li>I gr8 s very soft</li>
            <li>I loveee these brushes they&#x27;re sooooo very soft.</li>
            <li>comparable to brushes from sephora very soft but sturdy</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and multipurpose.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and hold a lot of product.  </li>
            <li>It gives it a very soft effect.</li>
            <li>Although the blenders were not up to my expectations, the rest of the brushes weren&#x27;t to bad and all of them had good quality handles and are good for a little makeup bag on the go.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding of the bristles at all!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality of the brushes for the price!</li>
            <li>My favoriteeee brushes by far!</li>
            <li>I use them all pretty much daily except for the tapered brow, I have a brush I prefer to that.</li>
            <li>I find the brushes are solid and pretty versatile.</li>
            <li>definitely an added bonus from the creators of Real Techniques!</li>
            <li>They are also soooo soft!</li>
            <li>This is my first set of makeup brushes, I&#x27;m not big into makeup</li>
            <li>I am not a makeup artist, however I think this is one of the most comprehensive, yet not overwhelming eye shadow brush sets.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the liner brush for a small brown undereye line with powder.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend these any higher, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>so I could have one for dark eye shadows and light eye shadows without having to mix them.  </li>
            <li>They are all high quality items individually, and the set just makes it that much</li>
            <li>I personally found the eyeliner brush a bit wide for my taste, but it&#x27;s good for other things.</li>
            <li>they are nice and softly textured and dont feel rough or sharp.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner brush is firm and makes putting gel eyeliner on so easy.</li>
            <li>Mixed feelings good for someone just getting into makeup, but not good for professionals.</li>
            <li>The smaller eyeshadow brush is my favorite for doing the crease and using matte dark eyeshadow along the lash line.</li>
            <li>the only thing is that i was surprised on the size of the brushes they are pretty smal compared to others.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and were as expected.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and do no irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft and blend eye shadow to seamlessly.</li>
            <li>Not only did it cut my time in front of the mirror down by almost 10 min, but my make up looks so much better.</li>
            <li>As a bonus for those starting out with more serious makeup application, the brushes are labeled with their suggested use right on the handle.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be long, however, before you start replacing the brushes in this set with more expensive, better shaped brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with these and use at least one of them everyday!</li>
            <li>I will say the eyebrow brush is a little big if you have thinner brows and want a very precise line.</li>
            <li>Apparently the handles are cheap, hollow aluminum (or some kind of thin, flexible metal).  </li>
            <li>I have simply put these brushes in my large Shu Uemura brush case.</li>
            <li>though the liner one seems quite large, I have been using all of them for slightly different purposes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s certainly compact enough for travel.</li>
            <li>Given the positive reviews they have received and the reasonable price, they are worth at least trying out.</li>
            <li>is like a little free gift.</li>
            <li>I think people are more likely to want a fine brush because with a fine brush you can go thick or thin.  </li>
            <li>wear gel liner everyday and was pleasantly surprised by the fine liner brush.</li>
            <li>Wish the blending brush wasnt so thick and round and more &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; but it works fine</li>
            <li>but I actually do every day...pretty clever!</li>
            <li>Also, doing the crease/outer v is typically hard for beginners, and you&#x27;ll be able to do it like a pro with these brushes.</li>
            <li>Feels like hard plastic on my face, I tried to give it a second chance but my final makeup wasn&#x27;t good too.</li>
            <li>Really soft brushes.</li>
            <li>The crease brush and the accent brush, especially,  have really helped me to improve my eye makeup looks.  </li>
            <li>The brow brush is too soft to be of any use to me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s safe to say I use at least 4/5 every time I am applying eyeshadow on now.</li>
            <li>So far I have not noticed any brush bristles or hairs falling .</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SO SOFT</li>
            <li>I had been following Samantha and Nicola Chapmans&#x27; youtube video tutorials for years before Samantha began the Real Techniques brush collection.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that they are really soft on my eyes?</li>
            <li>Hairs completely fell out of another one.</li>
            <li>so it blends the color naturally into your eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>but it was the complete oposite.</li>
            <li>This is the second set of brushes I have purchased from real Techniques.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really do anything beyond basic eye makeup</li>
            <li>Just invest in the additional foundation brush, and you&#x27;re completely set.</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>Soft, not scratchy, with no shedding.</li>
            <li>The only thing i can say is the lip brush doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>bristle is soft and dense.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>They are soft and do not she&#x27;d and all.</li>
            <li>(I find it too soft for the gel liner I use), but the blending/shadow brush are my favorites.</li>
            <li>Has everything you would need to complete an eye makeup look and the bristles are soft</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and retain their bristles even after a couple of washes.</li>
            <li>They work well, and so far haven&#x27;t had any shedding.</li>
            <li>I saw it all in action</li>
            <li>After washing animal hair brushes, you are supposed to condition them with an oil or conditioner so they stay soft and don&#x27;t get brittle.</li>
            <li>, they are soft.</li>
            <li>, they are soft.</li>
            <li>Also when I went to you the crease brush as a blender for my eye make up - it took off the makeup that took so long to apply in the first place.</li>
            <li>and yes they work the brushes are soft</li>
            <li>These are very high-end brushes, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>So soft and they pick up a lot of color.</li>
            <li>The only brush I don&#x27;t use often is the angled brush as I use a much thinner brush to apply my brow powder.  </li>
            <li>So soft.  </li>
            <li>the only thing I can think of that would really improve it would be the inclusion of a spoolie for working on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Got these eye make up brushes for my 18 year old daughter</li>
            <li>Professional quality.</li>
            <li>So far, none of the brushes have shed any hairs.</li>
            <li>They are soft AND they do the job.  </li>
            <li>I dropped one and stepped on it and it smashed completely.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li>it is too big and spreads out product too much.</li>
            <li>But I do like that they&#x27;re EXTREMELY soft, and the largest brush is like a mini stippling brush almost.</li>
            <li>I have washed them once and no shedding so far.  </li>
            <li>and they don´t seem to pick up humidity as much as natural bristle ones.</li>
            <li>The Real Techniques brushes offer the same quality at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Im surprised how soft they are.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and wash well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 years old and have never owned any make up brushes except my blush brush.</li>
            <li>The are definitely the real deal</li>
            <li>they are so soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I did without these professional brushes before.  </li>
            <li>and they fill so soft on my eyes.</li>
            <li>So soft, blends out any eyeshadow with ease.</li>
            <li>Professional quality.</li>
            <li>I like this set because I really don&#x27;t know the names/uses of all the different eye shadow brushes out there.  </li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes just blows my mind and they are just so soft i swear almost like a teddy bear.</li>
            <li>the brushes are soft and the bristles do not fall off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Brushes feel soft and brush hair does not have fall</li>
            <li>so soft and professionel</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles on all the brushes in this set are really soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>They are soft and allow a novice like me apply makeup like a pro.</li>
            <li>the brushes are so soft and they don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>and the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves them and uses them daily.</li>
            <li>soft, hold product well</li>
            <li>I did actually buy the buffing brush from ulta which I highly recommend as well!</li>
            <li>but i guess you only get what you paid for. hahaha</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, never shed and blend like a dream.</li>
            <li>The brushes are affordable and the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>Seems to grab just enough shadow powder and blends real well...</li>
            <li>The brushes are all soft, and none of the fibers have fallen out.</li>
            <li>, so I can actually see how much powder I&#x27;ve picked up.</li>
            <li>Too young for makeup in my opinion at 11</li>
            <li>They are soft and plush.</li>
            <li>The case is different from the one i ordered from Real Techniques online page.</li>
            <li>They are so soft, they do not shed.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are dense yet soft, and even though they DO pick up product well, I didn&#x27;t find the application amount to be satisfactory for me.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and blends color</li>
            <li>Professional makeup brushes at a non-professional price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are definitely soft however.</li>
            <li>you already have a pretty good grip on your eye make up skills, you might consider more expensive brushes, but if you just need a small, basic set for traveling or as an emergency back up, get it!</li>
            <li>I actually use the brow brush more to smudge my eyeliner when I want a smoky look, but it is firm and would do well when defining brows with powder.</li>
            <li>but i could only use like two of the most fluffy ones.</li>
            <li>The brow brush is quite thick and stout, but it works great for everyday use on your brows.</li>
            <li>Good quality handles (this might seem like a weird comment, but</li>
            <li>These are really good for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li>I recommend them to anyone needing good make-up brushes but are unable to afford the pricier products.</li>
            <li>Kind of irritating</li>
            <li>The base shadow brush has become my crease&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li>The deluxe cream brush is much too big (for my eyes at least) to deposit color cleanly in the crease without making a big mess of the edges because the brush is not tapered at all.</li>
            <li>When they arrived, I got seriously jealous and bought some single brushes from Real Techniques for my own set.  </li>
            <li>I have washed the several times and still go right back into shape.  </li>
            <li>the crease blending brush is short and stiff, which is okay, but i prefer a fluffier version.</li>
            <li>As mentioned by other reviewers, my expectations weren&#x27;t that high when I first viewed the product.</li>
            <li>The brushes do not shed anymore than is to be expected with makeup brushes, in fact they shed less than other higher end makeup brushes I own.</li>
            <li>I find the accent brush works really, really well for filling in the brows, and I think the flat eyeshadow brush is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the dome blending brush had random long hairs sticking out of the top that I had to trim with scissors, which just made it seem cheap to me.</li>
            <li>The small brushes are definitely what I need and the skinny lightweight design of the handle helps me hold it so easily when doing things that require really steady hands.</li>
            <li>I actually just recently bought a few brushes from Sephora&#x27;s Pro line and they&#x27;re pretty great but also pretty expensive (between $24-40 per face brush)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is decent enough.</li>
            <li>This set is pretty great for just the crease brush and the base shadow brush.</li>
            <li>For the same price I bought the \\&quot;core collection\\&quot; set which is a better deal in my opinion, and has one small brush for applying eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>I love the brushes, but the case they come in isn&#x27;t very practical for traveling (its a little bulky just to store those little brushes).</li>
            <li>These are sleek, high quality brushes with a low price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes and if they wear out I will definitely repurchase.  </li>
            <li>The case has additional elastic holders, I can fit a mascara in one and a small eye palate in another.</li>
            <li>I find that a thinner eye liner brush (I do not recall if it is called that, but I mean the long thin one) would have been great, the one included is a little clumsy, but I used it for applying highlighter at exact places and for that it is great.</li>
            <li>When I do need and angled brush, I prefer the Real Techniques brush to far more expensive brushes from MAC and Sephora.  </li>
            <li>I really love the deluxe crease brush for applying my base colors, although it&#x27;s way too big to use on your crease.</li>
            <li>I found these at Ulta while looking for a large domed shadow brush that was the same size or slightly smaller than my Sonia Kashuk one from target.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve NEVER experienced shedding with this, or the other Real Techniques set I own.</li>
            <li>I left the firts one I got for concealer and the new one for eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Brush fibers dry straight and don&#x27;t frizz.</li>
            <li>I just purchased another, not because my old one didn&#x27;t last, but because I prefer replacing old brushes rather than cleaning them.</li>
            <li>Sam does a tutorial at the real techniques site using all of the brushes and they look slightly smaller than what you actually get.  </li>
            <li>you can even fit in a few extra brushes if you need to.</li>
            <li>only eye liner brush is too fat for nice and thin gel eye line.</li>
            <li>I also thought the brow brush was too thick and big for the job, but I tried it and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>All brushes has very soft bristles &amp; has no problem in picking up products...except pixel- point brushes which havent discovered how to use as brush quite big for liner brush....</li>
            <li>They are very soft brushes, and I do not feel that they are too big for the intended purposes as some others have stated.</li>
            <li>For the same reason, they dry off very fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the first 3 brushes in the set, they&#x27;re very fluffy and dense.</li>
            <li>The other three brushes are very useful, and the small Accent Brush is fun to use to put highlight to the inner corner of the eyes.</li>
            <li>I use the angles brush for both eyebrow and eyeliner, the blending brush for applying concealer under my eyes and overall there are so many other uses to those brushes other than eyes.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the perks of living in a major city</li>
            <li>I was hoping the small angeled brush was a little less dense and more precise.</li>
            <li>I ordered these brushes because I spend most of my time on my eye makeup everyday and wanted some other brushes besides e.l.f. brand brushes.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was faster than expected as I live very far from US.</li>
            <li>These are surprisingly fantastic brushes for less than the cost of a single brush.</li>
            <li>Specially the way it&#x27;s in one small kit.</li>
            <li>at some point of course you will want to invest in natural bristle brushes but for people on a limited income these will get the job done and are much nicer than anything else at this price or really anything i&#x27;ve found for less than $100.</li>
            <li>Her demonstration and other positive reviews about this product, made me decide to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>They are professional quality for a low price.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft that I don&#x27;t actually smudge well with</li>
            <li>They basically just absorb all your makeup and barely put any on you</li>
            <li>bristles are soft, I have recently compared them to my Ulta Collection.</li>
            <li>My old mac brushes lay untouched in the back of my drawer.</li>
            <li>that if you add anything else to the pack, you cannot close it barely.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like the brushes barely picked up the makeup.</li>
            <li>These brushes are far too big for eye makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I have washed them several times thus far without any of the hairs falling out.</li>
            <li>They barely pick up color and are rubbish at blending.</li>
            <li>They are every bit as soft as my Sigmas, and WAY above the quality of the ELF, Ecotools, and Sonia Kashuk brushes I started out with!  </li>
            <li>so far i&#x60;ve used only the blender brush.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to start doing my makeup like a grown-up, which meant throwing out the blue eye shadow (or at least hiding it in the back of the cabinet), picking up a nice, nude palette, and finally investing in some makeup brushes instead of those crappy, spongy applicators.</li>
            <li>I use the deluxe crease brush as my base shadow brush and vice versa as recommended by the creator because I have smaller eyes/lids and it works fantastic that way.</li>
            <li>which is kind of cheesy.</li>
            <li>its not a great set but two or three brushes are ok.</li>
            <li>and I stuck my RT expert face brush in there as well as use it to put my brushes in there and hang it upside down to dry when I clean them.</li>
            <li>There are only a few changes I would make to the book that holds them, like sealing all of the way around to prevent stuff from contaminating my brushes, but other than that I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Long live taklon!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>Yet it is less than that for a WHOLE SET!</li>
            <li>These same brushes sell in other department stores for a higher price.</li>
            <li>felt like it was flopping around when I put shadow on...and the eyebrow brush felt super soft...not stiff enough for my brows..</li>
            <li>Only con for me is the detail fine liner brush is too thick for me.</li>
            <li>No loose bristels</li>
            <li>so you do t end up with a hot mess of eyeshadow dust around the eye ( of yall</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this problem with any of the other Real Techniques brushes I have purchased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really convenient due to size and functionality to throw in your overnight bag.  </li>
            <li>the liner brush is okay, its a little too flimsy and doesn&#x27;t have a firm point.</li>
            <li>I can just feel a difference when I directly compare these to my more expensive brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got them at a small discount but would definitely pay full amount.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The base shadow, deluxe crease and the accent brush are worth buying the set for alone.</li>
            <li>too long , hard to use, and not stiff enough to provide you with the precise application with a gel liner.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any of the usual problems with these, such as hairs falling out, the metal around them becoming loose.</li>
            <li>the flat shadow brush picks up a decent amount of e/s..but not nearly as much as my really old maybelline brush (which I have had for about 10 years).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cleaned and dried my brushes right before using them to do my makeup regularly.</li>
            <li>round blending brush is honestly very large for my tiny eyelids, so I use it for highlighting under my brow bone and sometimes I conceal my under eyes with</li>
            <li>I did not like the liner, eyebrow, or shadow brush...liner a bit too long, shadow to soft...</li>
            <li>quality is not bad, but the angled eyeliner is way too thick to be an angled eyeliner.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t keep it on my desk for daily use as the elastic is pretty tight</li>
            <li>The only negative I would have about this set is that the brow brush is a little too big and bulky for me, but for some reason I still use it at times, as it blends amazingly</li>
            <li>It visually stood out to me from other brushes that quite frankly, looked a little cheap.</li>
            <li>My mac brushes take hours (sometimes days) to dry completely, even if I wipe them against a sham first.</li>
            <li>I must say that they are not the same shape exactly, but I guess this happens a lot unless they are super expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>I tend to be fairly hard on them and go through them rather quickly.</li>
            <li>But I know for certain that I wouldnt buy this again because it&#x27;s not cool to check the brushes that come in here and notice that they dont work how they are supposed</li>
            <li>I occasionally use the accent brush, but it&#x27;s a little sloppy (the fibers aren&#x27;t dense enough) to really do a good job.</li>
            <li>Product doesn&#x27;t linger in the brush nearly as much it does on animal hair brushes, which lets me use less product.</li>
            <li>Product doesn&#x27;t linger in the brush nearly as much it does on animal hair brushes, which lets me use less product.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Pixel-Point Eyeliner Brush&amp;#34; is definitely not for eyeliner, the bristles are too long and too soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this set after watching pixiwoo for such a long time and seeing these brushes in action.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical because of the price, but I found that they are quite worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not live anywhere near an Ulta</li>
            <li>And last brush (angled) is actually really nice for applying black eye shadow as eyeliner for a less harsh look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically use the 2 thing ones in the middle very often.</li>
            <li>I use the angled brush to shape and fill in my eyebrows, I use the pointed liner brush for my cream and gel eyeliners, I have several other similar brushes and I always come back to these two in particular.</li>
            <li>They come with a little stand case and are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li>I was searching for new shadows because I didn&#x27;t like the way they looked with other applicators and brushes.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it to blend my under-eye concealer and to cover up some small blemishes, and it does the job seamlessly.</li>
            <li>I learned that just because something is cruelty free, doesn&#x27;t mean there is no animal hair!</li>
            <li>only complaint is some of them are a little big, but otherwise they are lovely.</li>
            <li>but this collection were not good enough for me ,It&#x27;s contains 5 brushes but were not all useful to me , brow brush is thick for my eyebrows shaped and also the fine liner brush make draw the liner difficult and not beautiful , other than that they are excellent of quality and smoothness.</li>

            <li> Fair price,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Pixiwoo makeup tutorials for awhile now, Samantha Chapman knows her stuff</li>
            <li> Looks good, case holder is good,  </li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> Good quality fibers and well constructed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser, and for the money this brand is a good deal.</li>
            <li> And all it good is</li>
            <li> case is conceptually a good idea in that it has a self stand, however the materials that it is made from is a bit flimsy</li>
            <li> Maybe good for eyebrows, not for eyes.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, they case they come in</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t be buying that brand anymore, the quality wasn&#x27;t as good as I was expecting for their price.</li>
            <li> Delighted with them.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention they are SO fairly priced.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, good quality, good deal, you pay a fare price  for an excelent product.</li>
            <li> Have purchased them for others because they are so good.</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE TOO GOOD</li>
            <li> Good selection of brushes for eyes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good quality, wash well.</li>
            <li> shipping and packing was good.</li>
            <li> so idk how good brushes should feel</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice variety of brushes and the bristles are great quality, hold product well, and haven&#x27;t shown the slightest sign of shedding.</li>
            <li> Good brushes.</li>
            <li> good wear</li>
            <li> I had never tried any of these brushes and theyre good</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;these work just as good.</li>
            <li> This is a good set.</li>
            <li> These are good quality brushes at a good price.</li>
            <li> All good.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> and I just didn&#x27;t think they could possibly be as good as others I had bought for 3 or 4 times the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are superior to animal hair brushes in every way.</li>
            <li> I feel that this is a truly superior product in every way.t, your brushes will start shedding.</li>
            <li> I feel that this is a truly superior product in every way.</li>
            <li> You will not have good control using this brush.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;d say this is a good set for a beginner</li>
            <li> and I loved them now</li>
            <li> They work so good for eye shadow and eye brow filling.</li>
            <li> I realized that there were loads of good reviews online about the brushes.</li>
            <li> I can already tell that they are good .</li>
            <li> Good brush set for the eyes.</li>
            <li> then are affordable and really good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it has a good eye lid brush</li>
            <li> and it works really good.</li>
            <li> good set...</li>
            <li> I think they are good</li>
            <li> Also, the writing on the brushes isn&#x27;t as good as the Ecotools brand.  </li>
            <li> It may be good for concealer or something else though.</li>
            <li> good value</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone looking for some good brushes.</li>
            <li> I like them, it is good.</li>
            <li> Not made of animal hair, nevertheless of good quality.</li>
            <li> I got them because the price was good</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I think they are a good value.</li>
            <li> Even after watching tutorials on YouTube, my work did not look as good, at all.</li>
            <li> They are good for the price, and just good period.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the gel eyeliner brush and the brow brush isn&#x27;t as good quality as the others in this set.  </li>
            <li> Really good brushes from Sam Champan of Pixiwoo on YouTube.</li>
            <li> my sister loved it she bought some of these brushes</li>
            <li> and i loved them to because of the packaging its two in one</li>
            <li> A good starter kit for eye make up brushes that anyone can have.</li>
            <li> but once you give it a try you&#x27;ll find some of its good use some brushes are of no use to me.</li>
            <li> She loved them and had been asking for them for 2 years.</li>
            <li> i loved the quality and the pacakaging ,i didnt use them yet</li>
            <li> They are really good for blending and application.</li>
            <li> I think I would have liked one of the shadowed brushes to have a beveled edge but otherwise happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic and a great price!</li>
            <li> They are good quality</li>
            <li> The angled and detailer brushes are good for gel and eyeshadow to line the eyes.</li>
            <li> Good brushes.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the deluxe crease brush on my eyes, but it&#x27;s great for blending in concealer.</li>
            <li> I loved all the brushes except the eyeliner ones.</li>
            <li> good</li>

            <li> Very Good Brushes For The Right Price!</li>
            <li> The angle brush is PERFECT for using on eye brows and the eye liner brush is great for giving you that soft line with gel liner.  </li>

            <li> Amazing brushes.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to Mrs. Chapman &amp; Real Techniques for a brilliant collabo!</li>
            <li> They seem well made and come in a handy case.  </li>
            <li> I liked how the handles were labeled</li>
            <li> The blend shadows nicely.</li>
            <li> Over all these brushes are quite spectacular.</li>
            <li> Good set for a starter, for sure.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use the stand but the quality of the brushes are the best .</li>
            <li> Real techniques for the win!</li>
            <li> This brand has a nice weight and heft to the brush.</li>
            <li> Even when I saw that Samantha and Nicola Chapman (makeup artists known as Pixiwoo on YouTube) had produced and were using their own line of brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the liner brush and liked it.  </li>
            <li> I used them to do my own make up for a friend&#x27;s wedding</li>
            <li> but they are nice quality over all</li>
            <li> Real Techniques has amazing quality brushes and this set is perfect.</li>
            <li> I wanted the best quality but simply couldn&#x27;t afford the $50-per-brush that a lot of companies charge, and this set is a happy medium.</li>
            <li> No complaints with the brushes, they have held up well and work nicely.</li>
            <li> These are spectacular brushes.</li>
            <li> This set is really nice.</li>
            <li> The stand is also nice to keep the brushes in place.</li>
            <li> They are synthetic but they hold make up and move the product nicely.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice set of brushes to replace my drugstore ones.</li>
            <li> Metal handle with rubber for a nice grip.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that, for me, these are comparable to Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> When I use them my eye makeup turns out to be really nice</li>
            <li> Nice way to keep all the make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I use this brush on a weekly basis, and it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> Works nicely on brows, eyeliner, or pinpoint</li>
            <li> but I used it a couple times and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> These ones seem nice though</li>
            <li> real Techniques Starter Set is just perfect!</li>
            <li> Love this set and the price really good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use the case, but it&#x27;s a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> They also blend really nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice eye starter set.  </li>
            <li> The travel case is a nice touch and does keep the brushes snugly in place within your purse or luggage.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for nice and inexpensive brushes, buy these.</li>
            <li> Has all the brushes needed for day to day use in a handy case.  </li>
            <li> They hold up well after washing, fit comfortably in your hand, and do a great job of applying!</li>
            <li> Really nice brush set for the price</li>
            <li> I liked the face brushes, not the eye ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because of the deluxe crease brush.</li>
            <li> I am kind of in the air as to whether I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li> your on a budget its a nice set</li>
            <li> I love the eyeliner brush, it gives really good control for gel liner.</li>
            <li> Nice design.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice for when you travel</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, they work as good as my mac brushes do.</li>
            <li> The stand is also quite handy and helpful if you plan to travel with it.</li>
            <li> It came in a nicely packaged box, brand new,great price.</li>
            <li> They are a great deal, and perform better than brushes costing much more.</li>
            <li> I like the deluxe crease brush to apply concealer.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques brushes are just awesome!  </li>
            <li> But I went out on a limb and bought some pricy eye shadow and this set of nice starter brushes to go with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a variety to chose from, and through experimentation</li>
            <li> package is nice for travel and standing up on its</li>
            <li> Perfect brushes, does what it says, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I never had a set of nice brushes.</li>

            <li> I will be purchasing more brushes from them soon.</li>
            <li> The crease brush (smallest rounded head) works alright, but my Revlon smokey eye duo brush works a lot better and was way cheaper than this brush.</li>
            <li> I love the case they come in that has a toggle to stand them upright.</li>
            <li> I will be getting the rest of the collection for sure.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this set.i use that crease brush to apply eyeshadow, crease, everything.</li>

            <li> Love the online instructional video.  </li>

            <li> I was confident that this brand wasn&#x27;t going to fall apart because of that as I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on them since she is too young for really good brushes!  </li>

            <li> they clean very easily too.</li>
            <li> The case is very handy, too, I can fit 3 large brushes (powder, blush, and foundation) in addition, and the eyelash/brow groomer (not included).</li>
            <li> These brushes are elastic but not weak, takes as much shadows as I need for a perfect makeup.</li>
            <li> the second brush to the left, is great for blending (although not as great as MAC 217 brush, but still good if you are looking for an affordable alternative)&lt;br /&gt;- affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes are good quality, but they are rather large for the eye area.</li>
            <li> High quality, beautiful, and easy to travel with and clean.</li>

            <li> brushes are really soft and the weight of the brush is great.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and the handles are great.  </li>

            <li> I love the accent brush for applying smudgey powder / liner to my lower lash line &amp; also for precise eyeshadow crease application.  </li>

            <li> ,&lt;br /&gt;Never expected this could be so awesome</li>
            <li> This is the best 15$ I ever spent.</li>
            <li> cuz I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, but real technique is a really good investment.</li>
            <li> I got this because I had heard good things about real techniques.</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice and I would say they&#x27;re worth buying.</li>
            <li> Good product at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re like my sister and don&#x27;t care all that much about makeup these will be good for you.</li>
            <li> If you want a good set of brushes and don&#x27;t want to spend MAC or Segmia money I recommend real techniques.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten good at it on brushes that take me so much longer to do it.</li>
            <li> After reading some very positive reviews I decided to buy my own set</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to see where they go :)</li>
            <li> All the other brushes are equally wonderful.</li>
            <li> Each brush is uniquely designed to fulfill many tasks.  </li>
            <li> They were in the original packaging, never been opened, and packaged securely!</li>
            <li> I use the eyeshadow ones more than the detail and eyeliner brushes, but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> So quick and easy!</li>
            <li> My full  review was written in the Core Collection set!  </li>

            <li> These brushes are labeled and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the real techniques brushes and now own them all.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with all the Real Techniques brushes I own.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and pleasant to us.  </li>
            <li> the eyebrow brush is soft and thicker than your typcial eyebrow brush, it&#x27;s great for filling your eyebrows in quickly but you can&#x27;t make it draw fine lines to resemble hair follicles, so it&#x27;s better for people who just want to fill them in.</li>
            <li> The stand/holder is great for when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning and not having to dig through my bag for the right one.</li>
            <li> They are excellent quality and just the right sizes for all sorts of different looks.</li>
            <li> Great product for people just starting to wear more detailed eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect to create a smokey eye and actually any kind of eye make up.&lt;br /&gt;It has all the essentials you need for a professional finish</li>
            <li> They are soft, don&#x27;t seem to shed, are easy to clean and offer great coverage.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is really cool, I love the brushes&#x27; color, as well as the case they come with.</li>
            <li> ( it holds the eyeshadow dust pretty nicely</li>
            <li> Compared to Sigma and other high-end brush sets it is a great value and the set is nice.</li>
            <li> I use these with the lorac pro and naked 3 palettes, and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a set that was pretty nice-</li>
            <li> the traveling kit is cool and stylish.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I dont even know what prompted me to want any in the first place.</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot of good things about Real Techniques brushes, as far as being good quality and affordable.</li>
            <li> the brushes are amazing and they clean nicely and feel very soft.</li>
            <li> They came nicely packaged in their little case but most importantly they work great.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, I own several Real Techniques brushes, this set was the latest addition to my collection and did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> They are a great introductory set to eyes and super soft!</li>
            <li> you are new to makeup brushes and are looking for a good set to get you started for eye makeup</li>
            <li> After each use I just wipe them off with a makeup remover wipe and they&#x27;re good as new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup artist so these brushes are working just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft, easy to hold, and the bristles DON&#x27;T fall out, which is great because a lot of drugstore  brushes have bristles that fall out.</li>
            <li> After only one use I FELL IN LOVE these are so amazing and for the price!</li>
            <li> I have used all but the fine liner brush,</li>
            <li> I find that I reach for them first among all of my brushes, most of which cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li> fine brush.</li>
            <li> and it still works just fine for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I wish this set came with the FINE eyeliner brush.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying the fine liner brush separately for an additional $6.  </li>
            <li> These brushes were fine for what I needed them for and the carry well in my purse.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as fond of the liner brush in this kit because it doesn&#x27;t give me the fine line that I like</li>
            <li> and I was super pleased with the precision and the results.</li>
            <li> Really good brushes, very soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft, and it does a good job of applying makeup in the exact places</li>
            <li> However, you can use a cheap eyeshadow brush and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The price is right angles on with my make up very smoothly</li>
            <li> HUGE brushes.</li>
            <li> I use them, along with the Core collection set, whenever I travel or am in a huge rush.</li>
            <li> Brushes make a huge difference in the pplication of eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> The brushes are never scratchy and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and I know she will enjoy them.</li>
            <li> Really well designed and nice length</li>
            <li> To be cruelty free, you can consider Too faced for synthetic fibers.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes, they are good quality, soft, blend makeup well, and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These brushes are light weight and look cheap</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone who wants nice brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fantastic.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing quality at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> The larger brush is great for blending.</li>
            <li> but it would work well as a smudger for my liner or precise detailing/highlighting.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone on a budget or seeking 100% cruelty free and animal hair free brushes.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;-The tiny smudge brush is great for using shadow to set your eyeliner (keeps it from smudging).</li>
            <li> brow brush has firm but not scratchy bristles, and perfect for filling in and shaping brows.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really a preference to be honest</li>
            <li> The hairs don&#x27;t skew like cheaper brushes do and they are fairly easy to keep clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li> free application&lt;</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t in the market for having to purchase individual brushes at the makeup counters then these are a great alternative.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same Bobbi Brown brushes for years - I thought they were great, until I used them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always told myself to stop buying cheap tools but</li>
            <li> buy for such a great price.</li>
            <li> it made me feel like a pro because i applied everything so smoothly with these brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> All my RT brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> so i just use it for precise contouring.</li>
            <li> Worth way more than what we pay for this set.</li>
            <li> The real Techniques Starter Set did not cost a lot and they were nice brushes and work well.</li>
            <li> I love.the face brushes more but these are still worth it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how cheap these brushes are for the quality they offer.</li>
            <li> I love how colorful these brushes are.</li>
            <li> I recommend all RT brushes they are fantastic for makeup you can see them on Pixiwoo videos..</li>
            <li> I recommend these to everyone who is looking for a great travel kit or even just starting out with makeup.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the lightweight handles and travel case.</li>
            <li> however i have a feeling that i will really enjoy it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for applying a wash of color anywhere above the lid.</li>
            <li> They are cruelty free.</li>
            <li> They are extremely easy to clean--</li>
            <li> Great starter kit, a definitely must-have.  </li>
            <li> Hairs don&#x27;t come off and they clean easily with makeup coming off efficiently.</li>
            <li> This kit fit the bill.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean without worrying about getting water beneath the metal part and they&#x27;re purple.</li>
            <li> This set is a perfect starter set for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the various brush tips in this kit.  </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous line of brushes by Makeup Artist Samantha Chapman in England.</li>
            <li> I have a set of my own and like them so much, I got a set for my sister ....</li>
            <li> This is great starting set because it includes everything you would need to buy separately.  </li>
            <li> I love these brushes for the price, def worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I think overall the set is great though.</li>
            <li> They are still in great shape, the only one that looks a bit messed up is the angled brush</li>
            <li> precise application</li>
            <li> The fluffy brush is excellent for blending out shadows and the crease brush worked its wonders as well.</li>
            <li> If you look at the Real Technique tutorials, the deluxe crease brush is often used as a concealer brush by both the ladies of Pixiwoo.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and work wonders .</li>
            <li> these brushes are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The big ones are great to apply concealer and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> They are amazing quality and hold up really well.</li>
            <li> and they are really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The others are fantastic, but I find those two stand out.</li>
            <li> All in all, a fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li> The deluxe crease brush applies and blends shadow very well.</li>
            <li> They are nicely made and dense, they just don&#x27;t work very well for their intended purposes.</li>
            <li> I have more fun putting on</li>
            <li> I always used the cheap brushes that came with the cheap makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been following Sam on Pixiewoo for a bit now and am so happy for her and Nic</li>
            <li> I literally saw a difference in how smooth my eyeshdow went on when using their brushes.</li>
            <li> The price is cheap.</li>
            <li> Price is affordable, the brushes are great, totally recommend!</li>
            <li> and they are more than worth their value.</li>
            <li> Precise application.</li>
            <li> Overall, great transaction.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> They’re perfect for the everyday eyeshadow users.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price as you would pay quite a bit more in the drugstore or even Walmart.  </li>
            <li> , Iherb got this to me in 3 days which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by several friends and it really is great.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re multi-task and easy to use, as well as clean.</li>
            <li> I like that the tips are light colored</li>
            <li> All brushes are easy to use, clean, and store.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed and blend colors precisely.</li>
            <li> The great thing, especially if you are a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34;, is that there is a website by the designer with tutorials, so you can learn how to do makeup with the very brushes you own.</li>
            <li> Just loving my real technique brushes wouldn&#x27;t trade them in for nothing.  </li>
            <li> love them, and I&#x27;m defiantly looking to buy more real techniques brushes</li>
            <li> All of the real Techniques brushed worked wonderful.</li>
            <li> I lost mine and miss it so much, it was slightly larger and perfect for filling in my brows.</li>
            <li> I love real techniques and I love these brushes</li>
            <li> I would be better served to get the good brushes, pay the extra, and get brushes that work for me.</li>
            <li> So far so good with staying together and hairs not falling out.</li>
            <li> Loved it, soft and light in weight, have not tried yet</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t shed, and the cut is precise and NOT uneven, so you&#x27;ll get a good amount of product everytime.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and I really wish Amazon would restock this line so I could purchase some more brushes.</li>
            <li> But, as I began to work with them, I found that each brush has many possible (and often surprising) uses.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft on the skin, really good pick up of product,</li>
            <li> The video is quick and easy to understand, and it is easy to find on YouTube too.</li>
            <li> Soft and good quality</li>
            <li> Despite these brushes don&#x27;t have natural bristles, they are good also with powder product.</li>
            <li> I love them and they&#x27;re so soft and nice to use.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are nice and light and pick up make up very well..</li>
            <li> Good and soft brushes.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques brushes is the best overall.</li>
            <li> Best of all they got here in 2 &amp; a half days !</li>
            <li> I am VERY particular over what type of brushes I use, and these are, by far, the best I&#x27;ve come across - for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes and I fell in love right away.</li>
            <li> A girl can never have too many brushes, right?</li>
            <li> Would have given a better review if some of the brushes weren&#x27;t all scratched up right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I love the Pixiwoo YouTube channel with the makers&#x27; videos, where they DO use these brushes along with other brands, and I have been incredibly happy with them.  </li>
            <li> The crease brush and the liner brush are my favorites, they are superior compare to other brushes of that kind that I had before.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the case, but it would be very useful when I travel.  </li>
            <li> The case/stand/holder is very useful for storage and standing up</li>
            <li> Very nice set especially since it comes with a travel case.</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> very useful and versatile pouch&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love love this set they are very convenient,, specially the dome shaped brush i like using it for under eye or blemish concealing</li>
            <li> absolutly adore the first brush on the left, it is great for applying concealer, and i felt that the concealer stays put for a longer time when i use the brush.. much better than fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I do highly recommend the real Techniques face brushes, they are great quality</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft, and they pick up a good amount of powder (you can tell cause when you start, they&#x27;re white, which is handy if you wash the bristles between every use to make sure they won&#x27;t carry over between applications).</li>
            <li> From left to right: First brush (biggest) is amazing for blending concealer!!!</li>
            <li> But so worth it anyways for the first 3 brushes, theyre amazing.</li>
            <li> You honestly get a great product for a small price.</li>
            <li> I Love them so very much</li>
            <li> high quality bristles, nice design,</li>
            <li> I needed some new brushes that would hold up better and give me a better finish/application.</li>
            <li> I really live the contouring/crease brush -- it has a nice taper to it that makes getting highlighting shadow into the corners of my eye really precise.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, good budget brushes for price and as a moderate make up user they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had very low expectations but was very surprised to find that these brushes are great!</li>
            <li> I love this set so much!</li>
            <li> I am now in LOVE with real Techniques brushes!</li>
            <li> I love this set so much!</li>
            <li> are well constructed brushes, all synthetic and vegan friendly.</li>
            <li> I had purchased these before &amp; lost them, but I still love them as much now as I did then!</li>
            <li> so I was excited when she came out with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the 12 bucks!</li>
            <li> Love the Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> My purchase was really worth it!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li> Affordable brushes that are useful and durable!</li>
            <li> I really love the real techniques brushes!</li>
            <li> I must say that I just love love love my brushed from Teal Techniques.</li>
            <li> She picked out the item and is familiar with the brand.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love, defintiely for anyone who is just starting to use and learn about makeup products..</li>
            <li> but With the amount paid &amp; get 5 brushes, its worth it!</li>
            <li> It is so useful!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for a amateur makeup artist and a pro too.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are very versatile, I use them for eye shadow, contouring my face, highlighting my face,  setting powder under my eyes, eyeliner, eyebrows, just everything!</li>
            <li> I have been dying to buy these brushes and am not disappointed whatsoever.</li>
            <li> , everything is lovely and very well thought!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Samantha Chapman!</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re perfect for everyday eye looks!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes (bought both these and the core collection set) and I love them both.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend buying these if you need a set of brushes, and the case is so handy for travel!</li>
            <li> I am a first time makeup brush user, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about the brand, if they would meet my needs, etc.</li>
            <li> This set seemed like a good starting point until I understood a bit more about applying makeup and could decide what types of brushes were worth investing in.</li>
            <li> I will say that for the price I&#x27;m not disappointed with this set.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes for the price - they&#x27;re very versatile and perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to recieve these brushes as I seen alot of youtube beauty gurus use them</li>
            <li> /&gt;While all the brushes work very well, my absolute favorite in this set is the Deluxe Crease Brush.</li>
            <li> These are great, I think they could be a little bit better quality, but they work well</li>
            <li> quality is perfect, so soft, smooth and easy to clean and dry !</li>
            <li> They feel soft, hold product well without taking it back off of your skin, and create a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these brushes they are such a steal for the price, amazing quality.</li>
            <li> When using the eyebrow brush with powdered brow colors, it puts the color on quickly and smoothly (for mid-grade brow powders).</li>
            <li> They are so soft, really pack color on for great pigmentation, and blend effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Clean after every use</li>
            <li> Case is super cheap.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very multipurpose- as with most of the real Techniques line, and are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried many make up brushes from high end to more economical.</li>
            <li> and I can tell she worked really hard on crafting the most optimal brush set with some pretty awesome innovations i.e. the multi-folding case/display!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT AND THE SUPER PACKAGING VERY VERY FAST DELIVERY&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> These brushes are very pretty and light weight.  </li>
            <li> I own nearly all of them!</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the deluxe crease brush was too big for the crease, but it actually works beautifully and buffs eye shadow out like a dream for a smokey eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and stiff so it makes a good blending brush too.</li>
            <li> I dont use the little one ment for liner because my gel liner brush is very good</li>
            <li> Thanks real techniques for good quality brushes at such a good price.</li>
            <li> Really easy to blend colors and get the right look.</li>
            <li> The smallest brush is just amazing and makes highlighting the inner corner so easy, it can be also used for precise application, smudging eyeliner or applying shadow on the lower lash line.</li>
            <li> I love to large brushes.  </li>
            <li> Love my new make up brushes!!</li>

            <li> Easy to clean and do exactly what she says they will.</li>

            <li> I feel for the money, this is the best eye set on the market--at least that I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love real techniques.</li>

            <li> Complete tools for a nice eyes make up.</li>
            <li> I get really good controll especially when putting on gel liners. ^_^</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s a limit to how many of those brushes you really need.</li>
            <li> I do use the one brush to make my eyeliners more rubbed in rather than a straight line.</li>

            <li> I love all of the real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> These type of brushes need to pick up product well, be soft and effective on the sensitive eye area, and wear well (wash up nice, and not shed).</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t know a whole lot about brushes but these have worked well for me :)</li>
            <li> Love , I just did a review on the face Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> I own nearly all of them</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these brushes.</li>
            <li> Also the larger doom shaped brush is really good for blending concealer, highlighter..</li>
            <li> Good brushes,buy with Core Collection Set,competent for daily use.</li>
            <li> Love this kit and ALL of Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> love all real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall good brush set.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft bristles with nice packaging.</li>
            <li> I Love these brushes so much.</li>
            <li> Such a good price too.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this set again for mother&#x27;s day, and my mother loved it as well.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of all things make-up and these brushes are a good set for beginners or pros in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience doing my makeup nicely, I didn&#x27;t want to blow a hundred bucks on a set of professional brushes.</li>
            <li> liked these brushes so much that I kept them for me instead of adding them to my Professional kit :-)</li>
            <li> Love all the real techniques brushes</li>
            <li> I use these almost every day, and loved the fact that it came in such a convenient set.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of the brushes and the website offers great instructional videos on application and the various ways you can use them.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for my sister and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell they are pretty good quality</li>
            <li> They are really soft, they did not shed after washing and applies makeup pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> far as the brushes themselves, they are good quality, apply shadows smoothly and evenly, and are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They hold product well, application is lovely (and easy), they&#x27;re soft, and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I use the accent brush less often, but it is great for any type of detailed application.  </li>
            <li> Soft on the skin, easy to wash, love</li>
            <li> so the crease brush is a little too large for my creases, but it works wonderfully as a blender and brow highlighter brush.</li>
            <li> positive factor about them is that they are easy and quick to clean.</li>
            <li> However these are a great alternative to some other brands.  </li>
            <li> I still use other brushes to supplement but specifically the deluxe crease brush and other shadow brush are awesome!</li>
            <li> Other than that i think its a great set to have in your collection whether your a beginner or not.</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m happy with these.</li>
            <li> While you can do it with one of the blendy-er brushes, I just think a flat shader would have been a good addition.</li>
            <li> I love samantha chapman and her brushes are a great reflection of hard work she puts into her followers.</li>
            <li> Love my new brushes!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this set along with the many other Real Techniques brushes I own.</li>
            <li> (I love how Real Techniques brushes are colorful) doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them with two of my Urban Decay Naked palettes and gotten flawless looks.</li>
            <li> Third is perfect for highlighting inner corners and bottom lash line.</li>
            <li> ,this could have been a much better value, next time I&#x27;ll spend more</li>
            <li> I love this set &amp; have recently purchased 2 more to give as stocking stuffers to my sisters.  </li>
            <li> nothing extraordinary.. a case with brushes.</li>
            <li> they came really quick</li>
            <li> buy 3 more just to have enough for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li> brushes are super soft and applies just as good as make up brushes cost 5x&#x27;s as much as this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the quality I was hoping for and the &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; has a cheep look and feel, but they are adequate.</li>
            <li> this item came so quickly and arrived when i wanted it to.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Hold product very and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, use them daily, and really like them.</li>
            <li> These are better than any of my high end brushes.</li>
            <li> if you love make up and are awiz at applying and if you are looking for brushes that are high qaulity without breaking the bank</li>
            <li> I admit I&#x27;ve never used MAC or more high end brushes</li>
            <li> I usually do take very good care of my things</li>
            <li> They are very decent quality and give a nice variety for a decent price.  </li>
            <li> but other than that very nice quality.</li>
            <li> All Real Techniques brushes so far I purchased are great editions to my collections, they are very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> with the quality of the brush you would expect a much higher price but these brushes are so so so cheap.</li>
            <li> I was told you needed makeup brushes and the reviews on this product made it seem like a great purchase, but since I used an open box product there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m able to send it back.</li>
            <li> The case is also very cute and convenient as it has extra slots to put brushes in</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty fantastic at liner.</li>
            <li> great work samantha , i am such a big fan of yours. :)</li>
            <li> but i got this exact  brush here at $15.60 and free shipping too..........</li>
            <li> The case is nice too, nothing flashy- very sturdy &amp; serviceable as case and stand which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> You can use them very many different ways.</li>
            <li> So mach so that I actually gave away many of my old brushes to a good friend.</li>
            <li> They are super soft, blend amazingly and are very affordable!</li>
            <li> They are soft, and easy to use!</li>
            <li> They are cruelty free, animal hair free (yes apparently those are TWO different things) and they are effective!</li>
            <li> Great quality and work well with all type of high end to low end makeup.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find them on Amazon for less $$.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the brushes: they look great, feel great and the overall packaging looks very fancy to my young teen!</li>
            <li> For 20.00$ or less it is a great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I am willing to pay that much for just eye brush set.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Real Techniques brushes and I absolutely love this brush set.</li>
            <li> These are my first Real Techniques​ brushes and I have to say that I love the quality.</li>
            <li> I love all the brushes but the ones meant for eyeshadow, that is the first 2 just poke my eyes too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable very soft ...</li>
            <li> the top brush is very soft but dense.</li>
            <li> My favorite &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; brushes by far!</li>
            <li> Well made, beautiful, soft and the combo of natural and synthetic fibers really make a difference.</li>
            <li> The angled eyeliner brush is perfect for eyebrows because it&#x27;s slightly thicker and really soft</li>
            <li> I love that these brushes are affordable and super soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> (You must do the eyes first, like with any set of brushes, and then the foundation, in case you have to clean excess off your cheeks)</li>
            <li> The fine liner brush makes applying gel eyeliner so much easier.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and almost flimsy, and the brush I had been looking forward to the most, the deluxe crease brush, was too big to do anything but pack color on with.  </li>
            <li> Great little brush set.</li>
            <li> Another great little feature is the combination case/stand</li>
            <li> Great little brush set.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques products are all very good and have never let me down!</li>
            <li> I might buy another from this brand to see if the face brushes are any better, but this has certainly ruined my experience with Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> This little brushes and amazing , their my favorite to use when doing my eyes</li>
            <li> liner brush is perfect for liner and for eyebrow, not that hard but enough for doing a perfect job.&lt;br /&gt;The pointed brushes (the two little) can be used for concealer and pointed highlight.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The best thing is it comes with a nice little black folding case for travel/storage!</li>
            <li> I can also fit a foundation brush and blush brush (also from real Techniques) and a powder brush.  </li>
            <li> Great for everyday make up application.  </li>
            <li> Yeassssss theyre amazing the ONLY bushes I use for my makeup</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t shed, which is nice considering even some of the more popular and expensive make-up brushes tend to do so.</li>
            <li> I am a huge real Techniques fan and use them in almost all my youtube makeup tutorials.</li>
            <li> I prefer a round brush with longer bristles for the crease, like the Mac 219, or bdellium 781 (bdellium is a great line of cruelty-free brushes).</li>
            <li> I have both of the real Techniques kits with the cases, which are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Before I got these brushes I did do heavy research online and saw great reviews.</li>
            <li> Professional makeup artist, Samantha Chapman (the brush creator), has amazing videos on the Real Techniques website and on YouTube that show you how to use the brushes (You can also see her and her sister, Nic, on Pixiwoo on YouTube and on their blog).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this eyeliner brush in the set as lip brush, so useful after all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are soft, have not shed through washings, and have many uses.</li>
            <li> Real techniques brushes are the most affordable high quality brushes out there!</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the colors.</li>
            <li> This is the second set that I got, my favourite is de deluxe crease brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are well worth it.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s kind of a pain to put back the brushes in the holder.</li>
            <li> It softens everything you put into the crease to make a lovely, professional look.</li>
            <li> These brushes make a nice basic set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, so I&#x27;m glad.</li>
            <li> Have nice soft touch and blend very well.</li>
            <li> Most brush sets out there are complete face sets - powder brushes, contour brushes, etc.</li>
            <li> I have experienced zero shedding even after several washes, so far</li>
            <li> It honestly holds it own among the even more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I own a set of Urban Decay and some Mac brushes and</li>
            <li> I love real techniques so much,  that I dont want to use them on my clients.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money she says just for the crease brush.</li>
            <li> The brushes come in a nice portable case that can be folded back to stand upright.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about these brushes, or how they are so affordable, but they are worth every penny and them some.</li>
            <li> She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the full set of these brushes since they first launched in 2012.</li>
            <li> I love Real Techniques brushes however I really dont use any of these brushes except for maybe one.</li>
            <li> And while I rarely use the crease brush on my crease, I use it all the time as well.  </li>
            <li> The pixel point brush is one that I use very rarely only because I use eye liners with built in applicators, but again, if you needed a precision brush, it would do nicely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an economical way to figure out what your preference brushes are.</li>
            <li> buy more and the are really soft.</li>
            <li> Worth it</li>
            <li> They are a really nice quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I suppose you get what you pay for, so it&#x27;s reasonable good enough for what you pay.</li>
            <li> its well worth the price</li>
            <li> SO WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> worth the investment, seem to be washable.</li>
            <li> My personal favorites are the angled brush and the deluxe crease brush.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to complete my collection with some more of Samantha&#x27;s brushes.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was when the deluxe crease brush hairs separated from the brush itself.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They are much more better as I expected.</li>
            <li> Each one gets used daily, and the packaging for them helps to keep them nice and organized.</li>
            <li> I love the case they come in, and the brushes are so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This brand  is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Fun to have a colorful eyeshadow brush set.</li>
            <li> The primer that comes with these brushes are worth the price of the brushes.</li>
            <li> This kit is definitely a useful addition to makeup junkies.</li>
            <li> Worth the hype.</li>
            <li> However, set was still worth it.</li>
            <li> They are soft, great for blending shadows and applying eyeliner, super easy to wash and dry really fast.</li>
            <li> Good starter set, brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed so far.  </li>
            <li> Worth your money.</li>
            <li> I love them so much they apply everything very well.</li>
            <li> (But I rarely do that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it worth it?</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hair is soft and easy to clean after used&lt;br</li>
            <li> There just worth it</li>
            <li> I have an old slanted eyeshadow brush which I love for crease application.</li>
            <li> My eye brows look more natural than ever.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for packing color all over the lid, cutting the crease, and the baby one in the middle is actually perfect for getting eyeshadow right underneath your bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a very handy little carrying case that you can also use as a stand when you are not traveling.</li>
            <li> love these brushes work just as good as MAC if not better !</li>
            <li> They wash up very easily, and of course have this cute little carrying case if you travel.</li>
            <li> But that is ok, I can use it for many other things.</li>
            <li> Most of the other sets I was looking into had too many brushes.</li>
            <li> These are great makeup brushes and they were so much cheaper than getting them at Ulta or any other store.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the bristles and would really recommend it to anyone looking for new makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> These do the exact same thing, sometimes better and at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super soft and easy to hold</li>
            <li> I was really excited about purchasing these brushes as they seemed to be exactly what I was looking for (makeup brushes that were good enough to learn some makeup techniques with but cheap enough to avoid a costly investment if I sucked).  </li>
            <li> The case is good to use for travel with my other brushes.</li>
            <li> The other brushes are good size range and the bristles don&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li> The price is also right.  </li>
            <li> The sizes are just right</li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> They are just the right size and shape for defining and detailing eyes.  </li>
            <li> These eye brushes are just the right size for whatever look you are going for.</li>
            <li> They do not shed or lose their shape and they pick up just the right about of product.</li>
            <li> The brushes are well made and were priced just right.</li>
            <li> I now know why my makeup never came out looking like the youtube tutorials, because i didnt have the right tools.</li>
            <li> It was the right decision for me.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews on here right before purchasing and almost talked myself out of it...</li>
            <li> The bristles of these brushes have just the right springiness.</li>
            <li> The variety of bristle trims are just the right size for me.</li>
            <li> I have wanted these brushes for about a year but the price had never been right  adj when I saw them under $15</li>
            <li> I  jumped right on it.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I feel like I need to keep picking up color to get the right amount of eyeshadow on.</li>
            <li> Makes trying new styles easy.</li>
            <li> I usually just use cheap brushes with my makeup but this was definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Simple to clean, easy to apply, and quick to travel.  </li>
            <li> Great little brush set!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li> If only Real Techniques would sell the deluxe crease brush on its own, I&#x27;d definitely get myself another one.</li>
            <li> Not a single one has shed and they&#x27;re so easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes they are very soft and thick very nice.</li>
            <li> These are by far my most favorite makeup brushes, especially the angled eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for someone who&#x27;s just starting out with eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;-The shader brush is extremely soft and would probably work very well with mineral shadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish they sold a more complete brush set im buying more of these same brand but face brushes .</li>
            <li> The pointed eyeliner brush is amazing and everyone is saying it&#x27;s too long</li>
            <li> When I took off the plastic, everything looked pretty good; exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have large eyes and that brush does quick work of applying eyeshadow and blending.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, precise, inexpensive, and are more than enough to do a full eye look.</li>
            <li> I usually buy all high end brushes and my favorite is Trish McEvoy brushes but these brushes are fabulous for the price and even if they were a bit more they would still be worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> High quality brushes that does their job well, worth your $12!</li>
            <li> While they are really nice, I&#x27;m not positive I would have paid full price for these as in my opinion there are better options out there for the same price range.</li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to clean and they don&#x27;t shed(!)</li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Might be good as a gift to a young girl starting out trying makeup and learning how to care for brushes.</li>
            <li> This is soft, easy to use, durable.</li>
            <li> They clean up easily and I have not lost any bristles, even after daily use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and reasonably priced set of brushes for makeup beginners needing a basic brush kit.</li>
            <li> The final 2 brushes are the ones I don&#x27;t picture myself using, they remind me of the brushes you get with a huge cheap palette of eyeshadow or something.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the handles are easy to hold onto when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> The fibers are soft and the brushes are easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bust these out every few days to try again, but I&#x27;m not getting more satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I am a cosmetics professional and absolutely love the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> Product goes on easily with no waste.</li>
            <li> Soft and very blend able.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and apply the product easily.</li>
            <li> There is nothing remarkable about them and they don&#x27;t apply foundation well or generally fulfill basic requirements for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are very soft and don&#x27;t have a cheap or plastic feeling to them at all.</li>
            <li> Very soft and the brush is light.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected them to be and a lot more!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and more!</li>
            <li> This is pretty much why I bought the set; watching tutorials online, I noticed that most women use a soft domed brush for blending.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected,  real techniques is a good product, cheaper here .</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I found that the real Techniques line harnesses the same fantastic quality as those brushes for a much more reasonable price range.</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes are very light, and densely packed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fill in my brows with a brush very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough that the bristles won&#x27;t hurt the delicate skin under the eyes, I manage to achieve a more flawless coverage than I would using my ring finger to pat it in.</li>
            <li> The base shadow brush is more appropriate as a blending brush and the deluxe crease brush is better off as an under eye concealer brush.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t use the case when travelling, because many of my other brushes don&#x27;t fit, so I could take or leave the travel case.</li>
            <li> REAL TECHNIQUES BRUSHES NEVER FAIL TO IMPRESS ME!</li>
            <li> The deluxe crease brush is pretty large for a crease brush, too large for smaller eyes unless you are blending everything out.</li>
            <li> Even if you neglect to clean a brush after several uses they clean right up.</li>
            <li> These Real Technique brushes seem well made, very soft, easily cleaned</li>
            <li> Love these brushes they&#x27;re so soft with a high end quality but without the price tag.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of their travel lip brushes which are holding up good, no pieces on my lips which is exactly what happened the last time I bought brushes for a little more money.  </li>
            <li> almost like I&#x27;m a pro, and fast!  </li>
            <li> The whole line of brushes is the holy grail!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques makes great brushes for such low prices.</li>
            <li> I have since become a bit more skilled and I no longer use my Starter Set as I have purchased more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> at first.</li>
            <li> fact that they&#x27;re quite pretty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many ecotools&#x27; products which I actually found I prefer to use</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this!</li>
            <li> Really like these brushes!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques never disappoints!</li>
            <li> They are soft and smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li> These were my first brush kit</li>
            <li> The plastic outside looked pretty okay.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes especially the accent brush</li>
            <li> The brush material is soft to the touch on the skin and the light to hold.  </li>
            <li> I thought these brushes were going to be mediocre at best considering</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace my collection of e.l.f./forever 21 brushes which I didn&#x27;t like in the first place.</li>
            <li> These are my alltime favortie brushes and I really recomend it!</li>
            <li> Been hearing a lot mixed reviews and I have to say I love them.</li>
            <li> When i tried to do my eyeshadow, the brushes worked really well!</li>
            <li> I will buy more brushes from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I would get more eyeshadow use out of it if it was smaller, but I do like its applications as a face brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that they will last for years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that they will last for years to come.</li>
            <li> Out of all the real Technique brushes I own, this set is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the case and how it can lock open and stand up.  </li>
            <li> The handles are a pretty metallic purple and the have rubber tips on the end.</li>
            <li> So I like the brushes (which is why I bought these in the first place)</li>
            <li> I recommend this product everyone ;)</li>
            <li> The contour brush is my absolute fave!</li>
            <li> Would buy a second set if I didn&#x27;t have so many</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, along with her first eye-shadow palette.  </li>
            <li> Real Techniques &amp;#34; core collection &amp;#34; are my babies !</li>
            <li> As a general rule I LOVE real Technique brushes.  </li>
            <li> When this set wears out I&#x27;m going to re-purchase this exact set again.</li>
            <li> really not expensive</li>
            <li> This brush set at first seemed lacking.</li>
            <li> Got the softness and quality I would expect from Real Techniques brushes!  </li>
            <li> and I have higher end brushes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will buy more from the same brand!</li>
            <li> I really have no use for but the set was still worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> neither did I when I first got them.</li>
            <li> With these brushes I can do my eyes in like 5 minutes, and they look fantastic and natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Theses brushes are pretty</li>
            <li> Came in fast to!</li>
            <li> so i decided to buy them off amazon as they are in a such more affordable range.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed-Simple-</li>
            <li> I first learned of the set(s) from Samantha Chapman on youtube through her brother&#x27;s fiance Tanya Burr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> colors of the brushes are pretty.</li>
            <li> so i could get more precision when doing beards for cosplay, as i am a girl, and different eye makeup!</li>
            <li> I bought this when I first got my eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> so I know exactly what Im getting.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought these :D</li>
            <li> Love them and will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is I will they had more of a rounder shader brush kinda of like the E.L.F. C brush.</li>
            <li> these brushes never fail me.</li>
            <li> Ive purchased several more of these sets to give as gift and everyone raves about them.</li>
            <li> But in general yes good brush set to have especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fake as it&#x27;s says on reviews</li>
            <li> I will, definitely, purchase more.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li> I am a seasoned licensed cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> For the most part I find myself only using the largest 2 brushes.</li>
            <li> I love real techniques in general.</li>
            <li> I am obssesed with all real techniques brushes!</li>
            <li> They are real great for beginners as they have everything you might need and its not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I also bought a shading brush, which looks more practical for putting on shadows and such.</li>
            <li> I have used real Techniques brushes in the past, and thought they would be a great gift.  </li>
            <li> and I love these more than my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Those are the first eye brushes i ever bought.</li>
            <li> I think i will be starting to collct more brushes for higher-end results</li>
            <li> There is enough space for more brushes in the holder too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion they&#x27;re good</li>
            <li> Use them everyday, just as good as my sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I wanted some reasonable brushes to practice the looks my favorite YouTube beauty guru Jaclyn Hill did with the more expensive sigma brushes since I&#x27;m fairly new to more detailed make up application.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are super soft and a good size for average to larger-sized eyes/faces.</li>
            <li> I needed new brushed though, and I liked the look of these.</li>
            <li> As with all &amp;#34;real Techniques&amp;#34; brushes these are so super soft!!</li>
            <li> The bristles on all of the brushes are soft and dense, so you can easily apply and blend out shadow without much effort.  </li>
            <li> Soft brushes are gentle and make blending easy.  </li>
            <li> item came much more quickly than I expected.  </li>
            <li> OMG these brushes are so soft and perform their jobs like a pro!!!!</li>
            <li> They are soft and a nice weight and don&#x27;t feel cheap like a lot of other brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> so if there are any of you who want to create a winged liner or any type of eyeliner shape, i urge you to try using the first brush on the right, which is perfect for first time users, hard enough , and makes life so much easier, you can also use it to retouch and fill your eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Real Technique products and have always been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This was such a smart purchase for me, these brushes don&#x27;t disappoint :)</li>
            <li> the other ones are amazing.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes and great little carrying case that does sit upright like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for these over any other brushes I own.</li>
            <li> Plus, these brushes are incredibly soft and fun to brush on your face!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t really have a good sized general lid brush for packing on color.</li>
            <li> Budget friendly with professional results.</li>
            <li> The other brushes are quite nice.  </li>
            <li> theyre professional brushes but not expensive like most professional brushes are.</li>
            <li> eyeshadow brush picks up so much product with light pressure and its soft on the lids.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> , cant wait to use it, the hair is soft and it feels good when I tries to test on my face</li>
            <li> I love real Technique brushes, they are reasonably priced and last me a few years with good care.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really have no point of reference for what separates an awesome make up brush from a lame one.</li>
            <li> I feel like they are a good alternative for much more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Great addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup kit - be it professional makeup artist or just the everyday person.</li>
            <li> They are soft and smooth and work really well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and give me a more professional look when used.</li>
            <li> I would 100% consider purchasing more Real Techniques brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more real techniques brushes in the immediate future!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and quickly tossed my old ones and use only these.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are slightly bigger than I imagined, but that&#x27;s completely fine and more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li> they are super soft!</li>
            <li> These are super soft brushes!</li>
            <li> Now I am being asked by my friends to do their makeup on special events because they want that professional finish look.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and made very well!</li>
            <li> They are very soft and very pretty if you choose to display them on your makeup table.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft, easy to wash, quick to dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much all I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> first, i didn&#x27;t find use for the angeled brush because i was already using a much thinner  elf brush for my brows</li>
            <li> These were my first purchase of Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li> I have other brushed by them that work great also.</li>
            <li> In other tutorials she uses different brushes, so they must already know these brushes aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> I use the biggest brush for concealer, and pretty much don&#x27;t use the others.</li>
            <li> , first look what she does with them, and then think if you really need them.</li>
            <li> They work very well and are so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> They are soft, and full.  </li>
            <li> I feel pampered using these brushes and the quality is superior to brushes I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> some of the brushes in this set are not useful and/or kind of bristly on my skin.</li>
            <li> While the price may seem low these brushes are a very good quality better than any brushes that u have purchased previously from target or other drug stores.</li>
            <li> you are serious about makeup, I would probably recommend spending a bit more for better quality brushes.</li>
            <li> one main difference i noticed was that my mally brushes (that look similarly to these carry a bit more weight in my hand.)</li>
            <li> I have several brush sets from high end to lower priced sets and these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Each brush is labeled with its intended purpose to make it easy, but if you follow Sam&#x27;s blog, she suggests different ways to use each brush.</li>
            <li> but when it came to prom, I needed some basic brushes that would be easy use for a beginner.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft, I can&#x27;t wait to break them in.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft and they&#x27;re synthetic</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed and they are super soft.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft, and I have washed them twice now</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes that blend my make-up like butter.</li>
            <li> Super soft</li>
            <li> Trust the before reviews, these brushes are worth the money, soft and comparable to higher priced ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I DO think that this is quite a nice starter set, though I found the sizes of the brushes to be somewhat odd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather large and is more suitable for applying a thin line of shadow underneath the eye instead of for eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and seem worth it.</li>
            <li> A single MAC brush would cost more than all 5 of these brushes and in my experience, not hold up as well.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to spend more than $20 dollars on single brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll splurge on eyeshadow palettes all of the time, but I can&#x27;t stand dropping more than 10 bucks on a single brush.</li>
            <li> I decided to get them anyway because the price of the set was cheaper than most single brushes I had and figured I&#x27;d give them to a friend</li>
            <li> The brushes are too large.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles and are very high quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and gentle on my skin (even after constant use!), and are super easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> This is my second brush set - the first being a gift from my parents, a Kirkland (which is the generic brand for Costco) that I actually really liked.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft and hold the pigment very well.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re super soft and don&#x27;t shed much at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes and super low prices, you cannot go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and tried different kind of brushes on the maket, cheap and very expensive ones and nothing as good as these Real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques has a channel on You Tube where they post tutorials on how to use their brushes, how to achieve certain looks, etc.  </li>
            <li> I dig the brushes &amp; the little wallet-ish thing that holds them is nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;Accent Brush – A nice little brush.</li>
            <li> it is too thick, i can tell from the pic, so i ordered another Fine Liner Brush, and i am glad i did.</li>
            <li> and all who worked on making this a high quality not expensive</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush set,it comes with a base brush,and a deluxe crease brush,an accent brush,a fine liner brush,brow brush,and a panoramic case.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to find a good quality brow brush that evenly distributes product and gets inbetween the hairs.</li>
            <li> Although I love the brush quality, I feel like the two brushes on the right side (Pixel-Point Eyeliner Brush, Brow Brush) are a little large.  </li>
            <li> Second brush is great for blending harsh lines for eye shadow (transition).</li>
            <li> By far the best brushes that I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried some expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> but I ended up loving these brushes and giving away some of my more expensive brushes</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush doesn&#x27;t really work out.  </li>
            <li> Samantha Chapman + Real Techniques &#x3D;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It hold the product very will&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like it a lot, though I haven&#x27;t used it very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see the Real Techniques brand has been expanding</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it that much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> These brushes work really well.</li>
            <li> I got this time is much thiner</li>
            <li> The liner brush works well for applying a brown powder over my liner, I have&#x27;t really used the accent brush yet</li>
            <li> I purchased these from real techniques Amazon LLC.</li>
            <li> Absolutely impractical.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use this as my travel brush kit and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> Blends really well.</li>

            <li> Also, it works really well on blending your makeup.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that just one Mac brush costs as much as the whole set of these ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the brow brush though.</li>
            <li> and they really help with putting my eye-shadows on.</li>
            <li> They hold the products really well and apply evenly without dropping fallout everywhere.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve watched the videos and read on the real Techniques site, so I know what to do with each one, but they are just not hitting it for me.  </li>
            <li> I like a lot real techniques brushes .</li>
            <li> Very recommend this set to all.</li>
            <li> They are much sturdier.  </li>
            <li> Work very well and are durable.</li>
            <li> the brushes in this set are really nice&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> and she seems to really know her stuff.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use the stand much though</li>
            <li> they are real and not fact incase anyone was wondering.</li>
            <li> They are soft, don&#x27;t shed, and the case they come with is useful for storage.</li>
            <li> I already had some of the face brushes from Real Techniques</li>
            <li> Got them for my daughter who doesn&#x27;t use a ton of makeup and doesn&#x27;t want every brush shape available, but needed the essential brushes.  </li>
            <li> I really like all the brushes.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I found out about Real Techniques Brushes from Sam Chapman, who posts as Pixiwoo on youtube.  </li>
            <li> I have almost all the Real Techniques brushes</li>
            <li> own.&lt;br /&gt;The package is sleek enough to fit into a bag or a purse.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> thanks so much, deffinately deserves 5 stars</li>
            <li> Fast and on point..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been doing its job very well.</li>
            <li> brushs set , the eye set and blush brush  from Real Techniques</li>
            <li> Real Techniques has a travel set</li>
            <li> But these brushes have really improved my look when I do wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I am very out of practice with makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much space for things and this helps with space saving and keeps the brushes from any dust and being distorted</li>
            <li> The palette was the real gift; but she didn&#x27;t really have any brushes to use with it, so I just wanted to get her started.</li>
            <li> And the case is very convenient.</li>
            <li> its name ..for starter it&#x27;s really suit for beginner like</li>
            <li> real technique brush</li>
            <li> and really that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li> I really wished (with all myself)</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> Ordered for a friend, came on time, nothing broken, everything looked great.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> Apply cosmetics very well.</li>
            <li> also really like the travel case they come in.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely need to secure your brushes in the bands or else</li>
            <li> The Techniques Starter Kit really beat them ALL.</li>
            <li> I am really exited about this purchase</li>
            <li> really like the dome brushes in this set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put makeup on my eyebrows, so the eyebrow brush doesn&#x27;t get much use either.</li>
            <li> and you dont have any eye brushes i really recommend trying this set out before you purchase nicer ones.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have almost the whole set</li>
            <li> and they work really well with powder or cream.</li>
            <li> However these brushes are very multifunctional.</li>
            <li> The great thing is that there is a variety of brushes; it&#x27;s not like some kits where you get several that look very similar and are just different sizes.</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy these, and that this is helpful, especially since I know I&#x27;m rambling.</li>
            <li> After seeing a lot of makeup gurus on YouTube use this brush (well, all the Real Techniques brushes), I was sold on the fact that they seemed to work so well on camera and the affordable prices.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched Sam and Nic&#x27;s youtube videos (absolute recommend, they&#x27;re a godsend for people like me who aren&#x27;t very make-up savvy) and heard about them there.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush set.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> but I really like the standup case</li>
            <li> But alas, can&#x27;t use it that way, so I still need a replacement - however, otherwise the set is great and would buy again.</li>
            <li> They are very well made and work wonders.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I thought I was too flimsy and full to apply a smooth line, but once I loaded it up it made a really smooth, thin line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice starter set or sufficient brush set for regular daily use.</li>
            <li> I also own the ones for the base and they are great too.</li>
            <li> my clients love them especially how soft they feel on the skin</li>
            <li> The case is kind of a waste unless you plan to always keep them in a case or you travel a lot and need all of them.</li>
            <li> I love that the brushes are both universal and soft.</li>
            <li> The base shadow brush and deluxe crease brush are great.</li>
            <li> love all of the real techniques brushes very good quality, was shocked when i received them right the next day</li>
            <li> I never expected to find a use for the accent brush, but now I use it to apply color directly to my crease or make a strong V with it and then blend it out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not only super soft and easy to hold, but they apply my eye products seamlessly.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft but have just the right bounce in them.</li>
            <li> The case is great for drying the brushes (as they should dry upside down).</li>
            <li> They are freakishly soft, clean SUPER easily, never lose bristles, maintain their unique shapes...</li>
            <li> I love that these brushes are good quality and look and feel expensive - even though they are not!</li>
            <li> Very soft, manageable size, and really get the job done!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed (like the natural bristle bare escentuals brushes do) and I just love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> left my original review</li>
            <li> but I have bought other brushes from the core collection and prefer the utility of them more.</li>
            <li> Can be used for many purposes other than applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price, these are fantastic little brushes: soft, do not shed at all, do not absorb too much product, and easy to clean with a brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> better than expected!</li>
            <li> They hold up much better than my MAC and other brand brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall, this set is worth the price that you pay for it!</li>
            <li> I have since ordered some of the other brushes and now most of my brush collection consists of this brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They lose a few hairs in the first uses, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> (I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Body Wash or just regular Equate hand soap to clean mine.)</li>
            <li> I plan on buying a second one just to add to my collection, but even for the beginner or amateur this is a great set.</li>
            <li> It was really nice that it came with a case for the brushes, although I&#x27;m not sure how much she cared about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the small detailing brush is great for inner corner work</li>
            <li> (I was scared because they look too big) and it was easy, fast and look so professional.</li>
            <li> All the products I have purchased were amazing and for a little price!</li>
            <li> Other than that, the stand/case is useful and keeps everything clean and organised.</li>
            <li> I use them with both high end and mass market shadows and have been very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this set, high quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li> They work like high end brushes with out the high end price tag!</li>
            <li> Just make sure they dry completely or else</li>
            <li> I have had Mac brushes for more than 6 years and always found them shedding, these have not shed a single hair and they are so so soft and my skin goes all uhmmm</li>
            <li> Each brush is dense, gentle on delicate skin, and so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They are dense, soft, well-constructed, and they each do exactly what they&#x27;re designed to do.</li>
            <li> funny thing is that I dont have one complete make up set.  </li>
            <li> Better than your average &amp;#</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this groomer is not included in the set - I find it essential for perfect mascara application.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems at all, very soft, do a great job, no loose bristles, big ones will stand up on end on the counter.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t wear eyeliner on my daily makeup, so I use the very detailed brush for putting on glitter on the inner corner of my eyes and it can even blend it!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a permanent use for it, but I have used it to apply powder under my eyes and to add highlights on top my cheek bones and down my nose.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t like putting on eye makeup when I feel small stings from shadow brushes, so these are simply smooth and I dare say more feathery-er than a feather!&lt;br /&gt;The handles, the multi functional case where you can add even more brushes on the other side</li>
            <li> For those who are trying to start new with brushes or beginners these brush&#x27;s are what you are looking for!</li>
            <li> I purposely didn&#x27;t clean red OCC Lip Tar off of my lip brush for a month, and the lip tar came off as easily as any other product.</li>
            <li> I also love how soft these brushes&#x27; bristles are--they don&#x27;t feel prickly whatsoever on my lids (a peeve I have with other brands), and they pick up and distribute product very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to real techniques.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to eye shadow, and always thought that it would be complicated to use brushes for the application, but these are so easy to use and my shadow looks amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several brushes I&#x27;ve not seen before, including a teeny detail brush, which I love, because I tend to be more subtle with my eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> Love the lavendar color and velcro closure for black carrier.</li>
            <li> I have purchased better for less here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> two brushes are decent but they are not anything to write home about.</li>
            <li> a decent product.</li>
            <li> This particular set.</li>
            <li> I bought a few extra as Christmas gifts and the recipients loved them as well.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for concealer.</li>
            <li> I love how I can use different brush for different use.</li>
            <li> What you see are vibrant colors on your eyes</li>
            <li> Definitely all the most necessary brushes youll ever need</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the entire set and use it daily.</li>
            <li> since its a duo fiber brush (and its cut in layers..like hair would be) it allows for a decent amount of product to fall off the brush or not even get on the eyelid at all.</li>
            <li> and that is the main reason I bought it</li>
            <li> Exactly what you need to start being a little more professional about makeup application.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and spread eyeshadows really well.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> .the &amp;#34;eyebrow brush&amp;#34; is much wider than I expected, in fact too wide to get a really fine precise tip on my brows.  </li>
            <li> i reach for these more often than i do some of my very expensive brushes--these are great quality especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I dont exactly know how much does it cost every individual brush that real techiques sells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I do highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in buying high end brushes</li>
            <li> I discovered these brushes watching the creator&#x27;s YouTube makeup guide channel, Pixiwoo, which I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Just highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> These brushes are of a high quality for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> and I use high quailty make up ...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let people fool you into thinking you need high end brand names, you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY REC.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> highly recommended it for you</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product because I have been watching Sam Chapman´s Pixiwoo videos for a while</li>
            <li> I highly recommend RT</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand for brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest getting these</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> and they are definitely a high quality.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, and handles are long for comfortable using.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend you watch the videos, figure out which ones you want and buy them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to by this set.</li>
            <li> natural bristles can pack more powder and blending is extremely luxurious.</li>
            <li> I just wished they picked up and distributed makeup a little better.</li>
            <li> I would prefer if they came in a case like the Sigma brushes, or if they included a cute little bag to keep them in, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> these &amp; my eyes look a lot better than when I use to use those little spongy tips.</li>
            <li> once i opened the package, the brushes were soft, steady and seemed very tactile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like the colored handles because it makes them easy to differentiate and find the one I am looking for, making application slightly faster</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time having any kind of precision on my brows.  </li>
            <li> Work super well with both liquid and dry products which is what I love the most, but unfortunately the labeling rubbed off just after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I do not use the case because it&#x27;s hard to fit in my case, but overall, I love the brushes.</li>
            <li> These are decent for starters but I can already tell I will be wanting new brushes soon.</li>
            <li> The bristles were really soft on the skin and it catches the eyeshadows colour pigments really well.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> They work very well with everything I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li> I added these five brushes to the real Techniques Travel Essentials Set and now have a complete makeup set.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on high dollar brushes!</li>
            <li> I have been very plesantly surprised with them.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> so far they are holding up really well.</li>
            <li> But these brushes are soft and gentle.  </li>
            <li> They are so soft and very affordable.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft but they still pack on those shadows and allow you to really blow people away with your eyes.</li>
            <li> Soft, REALLY pick up the eye-shadows, and do their jobs.</li>
            <li> The fluffy crease brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I brought a HD blending set of brushes from sephora a while back for over $70 but for some reason I didn&#x27;t feel they were worth it.</li>
            <li> A few brushes that I don&#x27;t use yet but love the ones I do</li>
            <li> These have been in my collection for a long time now with many washes and they last and don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> I will be buying a few more as gifts.</li>
            <li> other than that I loved the other 2 that came with the set.</li>
            <li> only one brush is useful</li>
            <li> I use all of the different shapes (I didn&#x27;t think I would), and find the case quite useful (also a surprise).</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing a few more sets to use on jobs.</li>
            <li> she loves it, if they must wear it at least this keeps things tidy and sanitary and organized.</li>
            <li> Plenty of options for what I think most people need for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Real Techniques are triple better than does and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I had been meaning to order these brushes for a long time, and I am so glad that I finally did.</li>
            <li> and I use most of them everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally hopeless at doing makeup</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t care for the case because its hard to stick the brushes back in but other than that these are awesome!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not professional grade, but they&#x27;re damn good for anything LESS than professional grade.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any shedding, the bristles are super soft and pick up just enough product with any excess.</li>
            <li> They are amazing quality, really soft, and are relatively inexpensive compared to other brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush and several other of the real Techniques brushes and really love them.  </li>
            <li> I use the accent brush to highlight the inner corners of my eye and right under the brow.</li>
            <li> High quality, soft but steady.</li>
            <li> I have a few different sets love them!</li>
            <li> I would most certainly recommend these to any make up user, amateur or professional.  </li>
            <li> These brushes along with the larger real Techniques foundation brush live up to the positive reviews preceding mine.</li>
            <li> the Base Shadow Brush and Deluxe Crease Brush were smaller so that I can get a more precise application&lt;</li>
            <li> Since getting the full line of these, I have not purchased a single new brush.</li>
            <li> The large brush is perfect for my base color on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> A colleague that I have adopted into my family, is new to makeup.</li>
            <li> And cant wait to arrived my new sets of it..</li>
            <li> so I can try new things with my eyeshadow palettes.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re brand new.</li>
            <li> I am not a make-up pro by any means so not wanting to pay a lot of money for new brushes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for new blending brushes and came across this kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying out a new liquid eyeliner at the moment.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t live without the smudge brush; i use it every day.</li>
            <li> These are new brushes and I can already see where the letters are coming off.  </li>
            <li> I am not afraid to wash these since ether do hold up better than all of my other brands of brushes ( however I am still careful and conscious when I wash them.)</li>
            <li> If you want high-quality brushes, I seriously recommend all the brushes from the real Techniques brand because they are seriously the best.</li>
            <li> They also dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I use these every day and absolutely cannot recommend Real Techniques brushes and products enough.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush is a bit thick but the eyebrow brush is okay if you have thicker brows because it is much thicker than any angled eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> I really like the two left brushes and reach for them for eyeshadow, blending concealer a lot, they wash really well too</li>
            <li> I have used the stubby shadow brush a few times and need to play around with it a bit more -- it is quite round and well, stubby, but makes it easy to pack on color.  </li>
            <li> If you need new brushes at a reasonable price, you don&#x27;t have to go to that large company that begins with an &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; or the one that starts with an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34;, just go get yourself a set of Real Techniques brushes and you&#x27;ll never need to worry about those other high end brushes again.</li>
            <li> BUT: I found them very soft, applies make up well</li>
            <li> I gr8 s very soft</li>
            <li> I loveee these brushes they&#x27;re sooooo very soft.</li>
            <li> comparable to brushes from sephora very soft but sturdy</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and multipurpose.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and hold a lot of product.  </li>
            <li> It gives it a very soft effect.</li>
            <li> Although the blenders were not up to my expectations, the rest of the brushes weren&#x27;t to bad and all of them had good quality handles and are good for a little makeup bag on the go.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding of the bristles at all!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality of the brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> My favoriteeee brushes by far!</li>
            <li> I use them all pretty much daily except for the tapered brow, I have a brush I prefer to that.</li>
            <li> I find the brushes are solid and pretty versatile.</li>
            <li> definitely an added bonus from the creators of Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> They are also soooo soft!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes, I&#x27;m not big into makeup</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup artist, however I think this is one of the most comprehensive, yet not overwhelming eye shadow brush sets.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the liner brush for a small brown undereye line with powder.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend these any higher, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> so I could have one for dark eye shadows and light eye shadows without having to mix them.  </li>
            <li> They are all high quality items individually, and the set just makes it that much</li>
            <li> I personally found the eyeliner brush a bit wide for my taste, but it&#x27;s good for other things.</li>
            <li> they are nice and softly textured and dont feel rough or sharp.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush is firm and makes putting gel eyeliner on so easy.</li>
            <li> Mixed feelings good for someone just getting into makeup, but not good for professionals.</li>
            <li> The smaller eyeshadow brush is my favorite for doing the crease and using matte dark eyeshadow along the lash line.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that i was surprised on the size of the brushes they are pretty smal compared to others.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and were as expected.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and do no irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very soft and blend eye shadow to seamlessly.</li>
            <li> Not only did it cut my time in front of the mirror down by almost 10 min, but my make up looks so much better.</li>
            <li> As a bonus for those starting out with more serious makeup application, the brushes are labeled with their suggested use right on the handle.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be long, however, before you start replacing the brushes in this set with more expensive, better shaped brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with these and use at least one of them everyday!</li>
            <li> I will say the eyebrow brush is a little big if you have thinner brows and want a very precise line.</li>
            <li> Apparently the handles are cheap, hollow aluminum (or some kind of thin, flexible metal).  </li>
            <li> I have simply put these brushes in my large Shu Uemura brush case.</li>
            <li> though the liner one seems quite large, I have been using all of them for slightly different purposes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s certainly compact enough for travel.</li>
            <li> Given the positive reviews they have received and the reasonable price, they are worth at least trying out.</li>
            <li> is like a little free gift.</li>
            <li> I think people are more likely to want a fine brush because with a fine brush you can go thick or thin.  </li>
            <li> wear gel liner everyday and was pleasantly surprised by the fine liner brush.</li>
            <li> Wish the blending brush wasnt so thick and round and more &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; but it works fine</li>
            <li> but I actually do every day...pretty clever!</li>
            <li> Also, doing the crease/outer v is typically hard for beginners, and you&#x27;ll be able to do it like a pro with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Feels like hard plastic on my face, I tried to give it a second chance but my final makeup wasn&#x27;t good too.</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes.</li>
            <li> The crease brush and the accent brush, especially,  have really helped me to improve my eye makeup looks.  </li>
            <li> The brow brush is too soft to be of any use to me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s safe to say I use at least 4/5 every time I am applying eyeshadow on now.</li>
            <li> So far I have not noticed any brush bristles or hairs falling .</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SO SOFT</li>
            <li> I had been following Samantha and Nicola Chapmans&#x27; youtube video tutorials for years before Samantha began the Real Techniques brush collection.</li>
            <li> Did I mention that they are really soft on my eyes?</li>
            <li> Hairs completely fell out of another one.</li>
            <li> so it blends the color naturally into your eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> but it was the complete oposite.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of brushes I have purchased from real Techniques.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really do anything beyond basic eye makeup</li>
            <li> Just invest in the additional foundation brush, and you&#x27;re completely set.</li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> Soft, not scratchy, with no shedding.</li>
            <li> The only thing i can say is the lip brush doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> bristle is soft and dense.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> They are soft and do not she&#x27;d and all.</li>
            <li> (I find it too soft for the gel liner I use), but the blending/shadow brush are my favorites.</li>
            <li> Has everything you would need to complete an eye makeup look and the bristles are soft</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and retain their bristles even after a couple of washes.</li>
            <li> They work well, and so far haven&#x27;t had any shedding.</li>
            <li> I saw it all in action</li>
            <li> After washing animal hair brushes, you are supposed to condition them with an oil or conditioner so they stay soft and don&#x27;t get brittle.</li>
            <li> , they are soft.</li>
            <li> , they are soft.</li>
            <li> Also when I went to you the crease brush as a blender for my eye make up - it took off the makeup that took so long to apply in the first place.</li>
            <li> and yes they work the brushes are soft</li>
            <li> These are very high-end brushes, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> So soft and they pick up a lot of color.</li>
            <li> The only brush I don&#x27;t use often is the angled brush as I use a much thinner brush to apply my brow powder.  </li>
            <li> So soft.  </li>
            <li> the only thing I can think of that would really improve it would be the inclusion of a spoolie for working on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Got these eye make up brushes for my 18 year old daughter</li>
            <li> Professional quality.</li>
            <li> So far, none of the brushes have shed any hairs.</li>
            <li> They are soft AND they do the job.  </li>
            <li> I dropped one and stepped on it and it smashed completely.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li> it is too big and spreads out product too much.</li>
            <li> But I do like that they&#x27;re EXTREMELY soft, and the largest brush is like a mini stippling brush almost.</li>
            <li> I have washed them once and no shedding so far.  </li>
            <li> and they don´t seem to pick up humidity as much as natural bristle ones.</li>
            <li> The Real Techniques brushes offer the same quality at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Im surprised how soft they are.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and wash well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old and have never owned any make up brushes except my blush brush.</li>
            <li> The are definitely the real deal</li>
            <li> they are so soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I did without these professional brushes before.  </li>
            <li> and they fill so soft on my eyes.</li>
            <li> So soft, blends out any eyeshadow with ease.</li>
            <li> Professional quality.</li>
            <li> I like this set because I really don&#x27;t know the names/uses of all the different eye shadow brushes out there.  </li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes just blows my mind and they are just so soft i swear almost like a teddy bear.</li>
            <li> the brushes are soft and the bristles do not fall off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Brushes feel soft and brush hair does not have fall</li>
            <li> so soft and professionel</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles on all the brushes in this set are really soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> They are soft and allow a novice like me apply makeup like a pro.</li>
            <li> the brushes are so soft and they don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> and the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves them and uses them daily.</li>
            <li> soft, hold product well</li>
            <li> I did actually buy the buffing brush from ulta which I highly recommend as well!</li>
            <li> but i guess you only get what you paid for. hahaha</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, never shed and blend like a dream.</li>
            <li> The brushes are affordable and the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> Seems to grab just enough shadow powder and blends real well...</li>
            <li> The brushes are all soft, and none of the fibers have fallen out.</li>
            <li> , so I can actually see how much powder I&#x27;ve picked up.</li>
            <li> Too young for makeup in my opinion at 11</li>
            <li> They are soft and plush.</li>
            <li> The case is different from the one i ordered from Real Techniques online page.</li>
            <li> They are so soft, they do not shed.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are dense yet soft, and even though they DO pick up product well, I didn&#x27;t find the application amount to be satisfactory for me.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and blends color</li>
            <li> Professional makeup brushes at a non-professional price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are definitely soft however.</li>
            <li> you already have a pretty good grip on your eye make up skills, you might consider more expensive brushes, but if you just need a small, basic set for traveling or as an emergency back up, get it!</li>
            <li> I actually use the brow brush more to smudge my eyeliner when I want a smoky look, but it is firm and would do well when defining brows with powder.</li>
            <li> but i could only use like two of the most fluffy ones.</li>
            <li> The brow brush is quite thick and stout, but it works great for everyday use on your brows.</li>
            <li> Good quality handles (this might seem like a weird comment, but</li>
            <li> These are really good for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> I recommend them to anyone needing good make-up brushes but are unable to afford the pricier products.</li>
            <li> Kind of irritating</li>
            <li> The base shadow brush has become my crease&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li> The deluxe cream brush is much too big (for my eyes at least) to deposit color cleanly in the crease without making a big mess of the edges because the brush is not tapered at all.</li>
            <li> When they arrived, I got seriously jealous and bought some single brushes from Real Techniques for my own set.  </li>
            <li> I have washed the several times and still go right back into shape.  </li>
            <li> the crease blending brush is short and stiff, which is okay, but i prefer a fluffier version.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by other reviewers, my expectations weren&#x27;t that high when I first viewed the product.</li>
            <li> The brushes do not shed anymore than is to be expected with makeup brushes, in fact they shed less than other higher end makeup brushes I own.</li>
            <li> I find the accent brush works really, really well for filling in the brows, and I think the flat eyeshadow brush is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the dome blending brush had random long hairs sticking out of the top that I had to trim with scissors, which just made it seem cheap to me.</li>
            <li> The small brushes are definitely what I need and the skinny lightweight design of the handle helps me hold it so easily when doing things that require really steady hands.</li>
            <li> I actually just recently bought a few brushes from Sephora&#x27;s Pro line and they&#x27;re pretty great but also pretty expensive (between $24-40 per face brush)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is decent enough.</li>
            <li> This set is pretty great for just the crease brush and the base shadow brush.</li>
            <li> For the same price I bought the \\&quot;core collection\\&quot; set which is a better deal in my opinion, and has one small brush for applying eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I love the brushes, but the case they come in isn&#x27;t very practical for traveling (its a little bulky just to store those little brushes).</li>
            <li> These are sleek, high quality brushes with a low price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes and if they wear out I will definitely repurchase.  </li>
            <li> The case has additional elastic holders, I can fit a mascara in one and a small eye palate in another.</li>
            <li> I find that a thinner eye liner brush (I do not recall if it is called that, but I mean the long thin one) would have been great, the one included is a little clumsy, but I used it for applying highlighter at exact places and for that it is great.</li>
            <li> When I do need and angled brush, I prefer the Real Techniques brush to far more expensive brushes from MAC and Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I really love the deluxe crease brush for applying my base colors, although it&#x27;s way too big to use on your crease.</li>
            <li> I found these at Ulta while looking for a large domed shadow brush that was the same size or slightly smaller than my Sonia Kashuk one from target.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve NEVER experienced shedding with this, or the other Real Techniques set I own.</li>
            <li> I left the firts one I got for concealer and the new one for eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Brush fibers dry straight and don&#x27;t frizz.</li>
            <li> I just purchased another, not because my old one didn&#x27;t last, but because I prefer replacing old brushes rather than cleaning them.</li>
            <li> Sam does a tutorial at the real techniques site using all of the brushes and they look slightly smaller than what you actually get.  </li>
            <li> you can even fit in a few extra brushes if you need to.</li>
            <li> only eye liner brush is too fat for nice and thin gel eye line.</li>
            <li> I also thought the brow brush was too thick and big for the job, but I tried it and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> All brushes has very soft bristles &amp; has no problem in picking up products...except pixel- point brushes which havent discovered how to use as brush quite big for liner brush....</li>
            <li> They are very soft brushes, and I do not feel that they are too big for the intended purposes as some others have stated.</li>
            <li> For the same reason, they dry off very fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the first 3 brushes in the set, they&#x27;re very fluffy and dense.</li>
            <li> The other three brushes are very useful, and the small Accent Brush is fun to use to put highlight to the inner corner of the eyes.</li>
            <li> I use the angles brush for both eyebrow and eyeliner, the blending brush for applying concealer under my eyes and overall there are so many other uses to those brushes other than eyes.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the perks of living in a major city</li>
            <li> I was hoping the small angeled brush was a little less dense and more precise.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because I spend most of my time on my eye makeup everyday and wanted some other brushes besides e.l.f. brand brushes.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was faster than expected as I live very far from US.</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly fantastic brushes for less than the cost of a single brush.</li>
            <li> Specially the way it&#x27;s in one small kit.</li>
            <li> at some point of course you will want to invest in natural bristle brushes but for people on a limited income these will get the job done and are much nicer than anything else at this price or really anything i&#x27;ve found for less than $100.</li>
            <li> Her demonstration and other positive reviews about this product, made me decide to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> They are professional quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft that I don&#x27;t actually smudge well with</li>
            <li> They basically just absorb all your makeup and barely put any on you</li>
            <li> bristles are soft, I have recently compared them to my Ulta Collection.</li>
            <li> My old mac brushes lay untouched in the back of my drawer.</li>
            <li> that if you add anything else to the pack, you cannot close it barely.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like the brushes barely picked up the makeup.</li>
            <li> These brushes are far too big for eye makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I have washed them several times thus far without any of the hairs falling out.</li>
            <li> They barely pick up color and are rubbish at blending.</li>
            <li> They are every bit as soft as my Sigmas, and WAY above the quality of the ELF, Ecotools, and Sonia Kashuk brushes I started out with!  </li>
            <li> so far i&#x60;ve used only the blender brush.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to start doing my makeup like a grown-up, which meant throwing out the blue eye shadow (or at least hiding it in the back of the cabinet), picking up a nice, nude palette, and finally investing in some makeup brushes instead of those crappy, spongy applicators.</li>
            <li> I use the deluxe crease brush as my base shadow brush and vice versa as recommended by the creator because I have smaller eyes/lids and it works fantastic that way.</li>
            <li> which is kind of cheesy.</li>
            <li> its not a great set but two or three brushes are ok.</li>
            <li> and I stuck my RT expert face brush in there as well as use it to put my brushes in there and hang it upside down to dry when I clean them.</li>
            <li> There are only a few changes I would make to the book that holds them, like sealing all of the way around to prevent stuff from contaminating my brushes, but other than that I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Long live taklon!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> Yet it is less than that for a WHOLE SET!</li>
            <li> These same brushes sell in other department stores for a higher price.</li>
            <li> felt like it was flopping around when I put shadow on...and the eyebrow brush felt super soft...not stiff enough for my brows..</li>
            <li> Only con for me is the detail fine liner brush is too thick for me.</li>
            <li> No loose bristels</li>
            <li> so you do t end up with a hot mess of eyeshadow dust around the eye ( of yall</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this problem with any of the other Real Techniques brushes I have purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really convenient due to size and functionality to throw in your overnight bag.  </li>
            <li> the liner brush is okay, its a little too flimsy and doesn&#x27;t have a firm point.</li>
            <li> I can just feel a difference when I directly compare these to my more expensive brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got them at a small discount but would definitely pay full amount.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The base shadow, deluxe crease and the accent brush are worth buying the set for alone.</li>
            <li> too long , hard to use, and not stiff enough to provide you with the precise application with a gel liner.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any of the usual problems with these, such as hairs falling out, the metal around them becoming loose.</li>
            <li> the flat shadow brush picks up a decent amount of e/s..but not nearly as much as my really old maybelline brush (which I have had for about 10 years).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned and dried my brushes right before using them to do my makeup regularly.</li>
            <li> round blending brush is honestly very large for my tiny eyelids, so I use it for highlighting under my brow bone and sometimes I conceal my under eyes with</li>
            <li> I did not like the liner, eyebrow, or shadow brush...liner a bit too long, shadow to soft...</li>
            <li> quality is not bad, but the angled eyeliner is way too thick to be an angled eyeliner.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t keep it on my desk for daily use as the elastic is pretty tight</li>
            <li> The only negative I would have about this set is that the brow brush is a little too big and bulky for me, but for some reason I still use it at times, as it blends amazingly</li>
            <li> It visually stood out to me from other brushes that quite frankly, looked a little cheap.</li>
            <li> My mac brushes take hours (sometimes days) to dry completely, even if I wipe them against a sham first.</li>
            <li> I must say that they are not the same shape exactly, but I guess this happens a lot unless they are super expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I tend to be fairly hard on them and go through them rather quickly.</li>
            <li> But I know for certain that I wouldnt buy this again because it&#x27;s not cool to check the brushes that come in here and notice that they dont work how they are supposed</li>
            <li> I occasionally use the accent brush, but it&#x27;s a little sloppy (the fibers aren&#x27;t dense enough) to really do a good job.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t linger in the brush nearly as much it does on animal hair brushes, which lets me use less product.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t linger in the brush nearly as much it does on animal hair brushes, which lets me use less product.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Pixel-Point Eyeliner Brush&amp;#34; is definitely not for eyeliner, the bristles are too long and too soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this set after watching pixiwoo for such a long time and seeing these brushes in action.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because of the price, but I found that they are quite worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not live anywhere near an Ulta</li>
            <li> And last brush (angled) is actually really nice for applying black eye shadow as eyeliner for a less harsh look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use the 2 thing ones in the middle very often.</li>
            <li> I use the angled brush to shape and fill in my eyebrows, I use the pointed liner brush for my cream and gel eyeliners, I have several other similar brushes and I always come back to these two in particular.</li>
            <li> They come with a little stand case and are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li> I was searching for new shadows because I didn&#x27;t like the way they looked with other applicators and brushes.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it to blend my under-eye concealer and to cover up some small blemishes, and it does the job seamlessly.</li>
            <li> I learned that just because something is cruelty free, doesn&#x27;t mean there is no animal hair!</li>
            <li> only complaint is some of them are a little big, but otherwise they are lovely.</li>
            <li> but this collection were not good enough for me ,It&#x27;s contains 5 brushes but were not all useful to me , brow brush is thick for my eyebrows shaped and also the fine liner brush make draw the liner difficult and not beautiful , other than that they are excellent of quality and smoothness.</li>
            <li> Case is not really the type one might expect as it&#x27;s just a fold over with a velcro closure, for the price paid I can live with it as long as it protects the brushes.</li>
            <li> It certainly wasn&#x27;t small enough to use in your actual crease.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this as a traveling set, being that it is a mini-brush set with carrying case, but I use at least 2 of the brushes on a daily bases, even though I have other sets at home.</li>
            <li> I recommend this set to others BUT would prefer it myself if the set were completely enclosed in a zippered case, making it easier to carry other things with them.</li>
            <li> The only one i dont use much is the small eyeliner brush as it is too big for that purpose</li>
            <li> Price is little high.</li>
            <li> The only one I can&#x27;t see myself getting very much use out of is the very thin &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; brush, since I don&#x27;t really use gel or cream eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Have not owned them long enough to say how they last.</li>
            <li> if you have really small features they may be a tad large for you.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the liner brush I thought it was a ridiculous joke to even consider using for eye lining, unless a big fat line that covers your entire lid is the look you are going for.</li>
            <li> But I do wish that the brow brush to be softer as it is a bit hard, I wanted to use it as angle brush but kind of difficult because it is not as soft as others.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;liner\\&quot; brushes are far too big for eye liner and made a mess</li>
            <li> Usually when I blend, I find that the bristles will pick up some color and then deposit it elsewhere, so I really have to work the brush to not have a spotty crease color.</li>
            <li> I like the smallest flat detail brush.</li>
            <li> I find that they work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The base shadow brush would be nice to apply shadow to the lids, but it is fairly fluffy and useful as a crease blending brush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that it was always open and that my brushes weren&#x27;t sealed off from the outside environment when the case was closed.</li>
            <li> For me they actually came wayyy earlier than the expected date it said.</li>
            <li> they blend well and are soft yet firm enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the liner brush I use wet to apply shadow as a liner to the upper lash line.</li>
            <li> I love the base shadow brush so much.</li>
            <li> Eventhough I&#x27;m still in love with Face Expert brush from Real Techniques, this set I hate because of the bristles size.</li>
            <li> these brushes and they haven&#x27;t disappointed me!!The case is very practice for the double use of pochette and stand, with other space for more brushes or something else.</li>
            <li> These are the brushes I use every single time I do my makeup, above all others.</li>
            <li> Fluffy, soft &amp; don&#x27;t shed at all!  </li>
            <li> only really like the bigger fluffier one for doing blending and use the thin smaller one that&#x27;s pointed to carve my brows out after I do them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to put each brush back into a specific place, and I feel like this gets dirty and isn&#x27;t easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although they are made of artificial hairs they look like original soft ones.</li>
            <li> The shadow and blending brushes are both much larger than I was expecting, while the other brushes are tiny.</li>
            <li> The brushes are tapered and the smallest of the are very thin making it easy to control eye shadow application.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes for little money.</li>
            <li> these brushes really did not like the texture of your hair is synthetic hard you can not put an eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because the base shadow brush isn&#x27;t perfect; the bristles are a little uneven.</li>
            <li> how badly I wanted the deluxe crease brush, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a set of brushes that were not too cheap or extremely expensive.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and small enough to blend where you want.</li>
            <li> They are soft, yet firm and don&#x27;t scratch my eyes.</li>
            <li> She will have them for a long time</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to get them.</li>
            <li> I am a big-time Pixiwoo fan but hesitated about buying these for a long time...</li>
            <li> The brushes only have one piece of elastic in the center so the brushes go this way and</li>
            <li> I am not a professional makeup artist, but I&#x27;ve got some experience.</li>
            <li> The crease brush is bigger than I expected it to be but it makes blending a breeze.</li>
            <li> /&gt;then, the thin lip brush, didn&#x27;t seem useful...</li>
            <li> I previously paid almost $20 for a similar set, same brand from a brick and mortar store.  </li>
            <li> They have quickly become favorites among my extensive (and expensive) brush collection.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not able to compare, but these brushes are VERY soft and for specifically the shadow and contour brushes</li>
            <li> the liner brush is too thick to make a fine line, the brow brush is too thick as well.</li>
            <li> The synthetic hairs grab product so well, especially cream and other emollient based products.</li>
            <li> All my other brushes (I have 40 in total) are Mac</li>
            <li> and I WILL be purchasing other sets in the future.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars only because the crease brush is a little big</li>
            <li> I use these daily and have bought other brushes by the brand</li>
            <li> Better than my expensive makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> I have not used the other smaller brushes yet.  </li>
            <li> I definitely favor these brushes over my other ones.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase other brushes from this line.</li>
            <li> The elastic could be a little tighter on the left side (for larger brushes)</li>
            <li> I use the brow brush to make my thin eyebrows appear full, thick and natural.</li>
            <li> is kind of useless and hard to get the brushes in and out of it.</li>
            <li> I will be using these for a very long time to come.</li>
            <li> (that was my main complaint with the Sigma brushes).</li>
            <li> The only thing is that i wish it had a big fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> I use the second to smallest fluffy brush on a daily!</li>
            <li> I did not have any of the problems other people mentioned, except for the old eyeliner which was indeed too thick, unless you are going for a dramatic look, but it looks like they change it for the fine eyeliner to please the customers.</li>
            <li> The brush can be used for thick or thin lines depending on if you use the whole brush dipped into gel liner, I use only the tip of the brush with a normal quantity of gel liner and I usually use a thin line and it worked wonders, but the cat line was hard to do, because the hair in the brush is really soft and flexible.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the brushes I use them every time I apply eye makeup on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have the core collection and the Limited Edition Nics pics</li>
            <li> but i will buy every single brush they have  these</li>
            <li> and they haven&#x27;t shed a single hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the detailing brushes, but the larger ones were a bit sloppy in application.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for these brushes to be as amazing as the face brush, but was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Let me be clear, I do not have small eyelids or brow bones...</li>
            <li> Given the hideous process of returns I glued it back together rather than sending it back, but I am not impressed with these brushes, despite really wanting to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thin</li>
            <li> The base shadow brush is similar to the MAC 217, but slightly smaller, which I love.  </li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are just O.K., and the blenders were a definite let down.  </li>
            <li> I know the velcro is long and allows for it to be a little fatter, but the items can not be that big at all.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that after having there for a few months the bristles are kind of hard and can poke your delicate eye skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole eye makeup scene and was skeptical about using half of the brushes in this set</li>
            <li> if not better than more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> wet, dry, cream, gel, etc.....</li>
            <li> but I have no intentions of ever dropping a lot of money on super expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> These are very soft and even though I have small eyelids these brushes work for me!</li>
            <li> The angled one was to big for my taste , the eyeliner one was also a little thicker</li>
            <li> but I have the feeling that these brushes are a little too big for my eyes though...</li>
            <li> The eyebrow brush is a little big for my brows though</li>
            <li> You just cant get the same blending effect with the little sponge aplicatior that you can with a brush.</li>
            <li> its also a little too big for my crease.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and hardly any of the bristles come out.</li>
            <li> but I thought the case was soft, I don&#x27;t like hard cases</li>
            <li> Some were okay, some were bad.</li>
            <li> The base shadow brush is also an amazing blending brush.</li>
            <li> saw this set and figured that at such a reasonable price, I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s harder to do with the crease and blending brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the powder brush makes it just a bit harder to close but it will.  </li>
            <li> Recently bought a couple Sigma brushes because I was looking for a fluffy blending brush and also a pencil brush</li>
            <li> I never really had skills.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Use these everyday and have been for the last year.</li>
            <li> this set as expected, i saw it on YouTube, and i received what i wanted.</li>
            <li> This is starter kit is essential for everyday use and even for using on clients.</li>
            <li> Had minimal to zero shedding when washed.</li>
            <li> but if you dont know what to get and your a bit confused this is a very cost-effective set</li>
            <li> but no really, they are way too</li>
            <li> /&gt;And as I said, I dont use powder to fill in my eyebrows, so no really much use out of the angle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brow brush is thick so if you are looking for a thin brow brush for a precise skinny line then the brow brush is not for you.</li>
            <li> but i found 2  brushes the same!!!&lt;br /&gt;1- Base shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;2- deluxe crease Brush&lt;br /&gt;3- Accent Brush ( 2 pieces)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The deluxe crease brush and the base shadow brush are my two favorites.</li>
            <li> base shadow brush is a joke, as it is the deluxe crease one and the liner.</li>
            <li> Angle brush is very thick and too stiff to achieve a nice, thin line.</li>
            <li> The crease brush is a little big for my eyes, but I use it for other purposes.</li>
            <li> My one small gripe is that sometimes product can get stuck on the black grip part of these brushes, but that is hardly an issue since it cleans right off.</li>
            <li> My one small gripe is that sometimes product can get stuck on the black grip part of these brushes, but that is hardly an issue since it cleans right off.</li>
            <li> The downside of the case is that the elastic where the brushes are is really tight and it&#x27;s a bit hard to get them in after you used them, but I guess that is normal so the brushes don&#x27;t fall off the case.&lt;br /&gt;The bushes&#x27; quality</li>
            <li> I think it was mostly I was sick of the sponge aplicatior coming off all the time.</li>
            <li> the folder does help to keep brushes in place to dry upside down and keep water from ruining the adhesive of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, since Sam and Nic are so into natural looking brows and precisely drawn hairs in their tutorials, I&#x27;m honestly shocked by the size and thickness of the &amp;#34;brow brush.&amp;#34; It lacks precision and unless you already have very thick brows, this brush only serves to stamp a thick line of color in the vicinity of the brow rather than creating a natural effect.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m comparing these Real Techniques brushes with my long time, expensive Mac brushes.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other brushes since I got them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thin or small eyebrows by any means, but the bristles are packed pretty wide</li>
            <li> (I know it should be daily, but I just don&#x27;t have the time) and have not seen any loss of softness or excessive shedding.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try their other brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, i do know other people will find use for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other brushes are a MUST NEED now for my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I would repurchase, but just plan on using some other brush for my brows.</li>
            <li> The detailer brush that looks ridiculously small is actually a gem to work with when applying some color to the bottom eyelid without it looking too caked on/unprofessional.</li>
            <li> I have recommended them to other people I know.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too long for eyeliner application, too round and flexible for pinpoint concealing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these over any other brush on the market.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these over any other brush on the market.</li>
            <li> I tested it on the other eye  with my finger - one swipe and</li>
            <li> all - just put the brushes in a container standing up as I have lots of other</li>
            <li> I keep my eyelid primer and mascara under the elastic on the other side of the case, and it keeps everything organized and compact.</li>
            <li> And the small ones are tiny!</li>
            <li> other two brushes</li>
            <li> I have some other brushes</li>
            <li> other brushes in package.&lt;br /&gt;Package is easyily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its not first time trying out these makeup brushes</li>
            <li> I use the case the brushes came with to set my brushes apart from all my other make-ups.</li>
            <li> and for the price....it&#x27;s so cheaper than other stores like ultra...walmart</li>
            <li> will purchase other brushes by this company.</li>
            <li> Worked like expected!</li>
            <li> Unlike some other brushes I&#x27;ve had, these have never, ever shed on me.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because I already had the other brushes and didn&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> This has been extremely helpful, even the finest brush not used correctly can be unsatisfactory.  </li>
            <li> I give two stars because is pretty and looks like expensive</li>
            <li> My RT face brush takes about 30 minutes to dry if I leave it damp on a washcloth, and I can dry it almost completely in a few seconds if I rub the brush against a sham.</li>
            <li> actually the case arrived broken, not a big deal since it was the plastic one though I wonder if it could have damaged the product itself.</li>
            <li> I bought it as an open box, but the eye makeup brushes are not very good.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this pack because of the &#x27;Base Shadow&#x27; and the &#x27;Crease&#x27; brush which are just as amazing as expected, however the eyeliner brush is a bit too thick for applying winged gel liner as I usually would.</li>
            <li> I found the blending and shadow brush to be too large, and the thin liner brush a little too long and flimsy which makes it hard to apply my gel liner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to be unhappy with real tech tools!!</li>
            <li> real techniques has totally changed my view on buying only expensive brushes!!</li>
            <li> the case!&lt;br /&gt;it is really hard to back the brushes to its place</li>
            <li> I really adore this product and wish I knew of these before I bought my fake Mac brushes from China.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel like they were anything but average.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the case.</li>
            <li> It is clumsy and just overall a pain.</li>
            <li> I saw a complaint that the brushes were too big...</li>
            <li> one negative is that these brushes are only sold in a set.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the case.  </li>
            <li> Brush – I find this brush to be a bit too thick to use on my brows, but that is personal preference.</li>
            <li> I rated them 4 stars not 5 as hairs sometimes fall down while washing them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The domed brush has cut my makeup time down by 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The brow brush alone cut my time on eye makeup down.  </li>
            <li> eyeliner brush is a little broader than other liner brushes I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the little holder that it comes with since I have other brushes to carry around and use.</li>
            <li> In the past brushes this cheap were either really hard and not soft, and they would shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> This brush is not very fine - it will give you a thicker line.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush is a little to thick and not pointed enough to feasibly use with liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed these quite a few times already and there is no shedding of hairs or any other problems.</li>
            <li> The only thing I feel is missing from this is a plain paddle-shaped brush, which is usually used for packing on eyeshadow, or patting on glitters.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- less prone to breakage</li>
            <li> I use the smallest brush exclusively to apply liquid eyeliner (Make Up For Ever aqua black waterproof eyeshadow</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not super convenient to keep sliding them in and</li>
            <li> They pick up color with less fallout and blend like a dream.</li>
            <li> This has literally cut my application time in half.</li>
            <li> I had heard reviews and figured I would buy it, but when it came, I was a little let down.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing 5 brushes that would normally cost the amount of one.</li>
            <li> Really minor complaint though</li>
            <li> but I have no qualms that the bristles will come out, they look tight and well made.  </li>
            <li> Only one small complaint . .</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that, for some reason, I was not sent the liner brush in the set of 5 and was instead given 2 of the small accent eye brushes....</li>
            <li> Since getting them, I&#x27;ve used at least three of them every single day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush set at Ulta probably six months ago and in all honesty, I use at least one of these brushes every single time I put on makeup (5-6 times per week).  </li>
            <li> I use at least one of these brushes every single day in my make-up routine.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed from the packaging , The box was dirty and scratched but other than that it&#x27;s a good brushes</li>
            <li> I would prefer a brush with a handle that is made from wood or at the very least is solid.  </li>
            <li> The one minus is for the eyeliner brush, it is just hard to work with coz</li>
            <li> The base eyeshadow is too loose and doesn&#x27;t pick up the right amount of powder product, (which is what I use).</li>
            <li> The liner brush did have a few wayward hairs though.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am a free lance makeup artist and have a crap load of brushes.</li>
            <li> Waste if money.  </li>
            <li> These are not cheap drug-store brushes.</li>
            <li> but I recommend a fluffy crease brush as well.</li>
            <li> I have been eyeing out this set for a few months now</li>
            <li> A few of my classmates turned me on to these brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes are not cheap.</li>
            <li> this is a round brush.</li>
            <li> and I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll update in a few months on how well they hold up)</li>
            <li> so I never get harsh lines when I use the Anastasia Beverly Hills dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li> The eye ones are just barely missing the mark though.  </li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Everyday makeup essentials .</li>
            <li> I wash them weekly to some times every few days</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t want to waste a lot of money on brushes.</li>
            <li> I use one of these everyday.</li>
            <li> As a result, a lot of product gets wasted.</li>
            <li> I just wish they put an extra thin eye liner together with the bundle.</li>
            <li> Each brush is fluffy and well shaped.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use them everyday for everything from blush to brows to eye shadow to concealer.</li>
            <li> They are relatively heavy duty as well.</li>
            <li> But not too heavy.</li>
            <li> i bought it because i was missing a lot of the brushes it contains.</li>
            <li> I find them comparable/better to the few brushes I have that are twice the price.</li>
            <li> I have used these everyday since I received them.  </li>
            <li> Next, the base shadow brush works great for your base color.</li>
            <li> The base shadow brush is really the only one in this set that does what it&#x27;s labeled to do.</li>
            <li> The crease brush is too round and stiff</li>
            <li> They compare to sigma brushes at half the price!</li>
            <li> They are quite stiff.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the slanted brush is for eyebrows and therefore very stiff (e.g. hard bristles).</li>
            <li> The kit comes with an angled brush, a liner brush, two round fuller brushes for applying shadow or blush, and a small accent brush.</li>
            <li> I am very picky on the types of brushes that I use and always end up having to buy the very expensive one to get the look I want.</li>
            <li> I am going to be one of the few people who say that they did not love this set.</li>
            <li> The very thin eyeliner brush is not sturdy enough for use and it sprayed after a few washes too.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes to me were useless and too big to blend my makeup</li>
            <li> and I will never go back to expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m in a rush or feeling lazy</li>
            <li> no bacteria&lt;br /&gt;- unbelievable and streak</li>
            <li> , it could be a small bag or a cup like sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it to apply highligher or small contour (around the nose or chin).</li>
            <li> Three of them are just way to small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive brushes and inexpensive ones and this set is definitely high-quality.</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> We had MAC in the past but they cost a ton and are no better.  </li>
            <li> Being an Australian buying these brushes at priceline is just too expensive for me</li>
            <li> I have small eyes</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking o I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Some hairs come out, but not many.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday!</li>
            <li> this is a mediocre set, but i would invest in individual brushes instead of this set.</li>
            <li> Not sure why that would&#x27;ve happened, must&#x27;ve been a factory error or something.</li>
            <li> For example, I have a small eye crease, so I swap around the &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34; brush and the &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too thick and stiff.</li>
            <li> The brow brush is so thick and not at all stiff</li>
            <li> There have been very few of their brushes that haven&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used and washed these a lot and have not experienced shedding or any other problems.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not very good.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed with any of the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> and when I am in a hurry, slightly less frustrating.  </li>
            <li> They are way too hard.  </li>
            <li> Even that brush is hard to use because of the size.</li>
            <li> blending brush isn&#x27;t that hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe how inexpensive this set of brushes is.  </li>
            <li> Since the brushes have a sort of grip at the end, these are hard to get in and out of the elastic bands that hold the brushes in place.</li>
            <li> I can hardly get anything done with them at all.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to put the brushes in and out of the elastic.</li>
            <li> I thought the little thin brush for liner was going to be too think for eyeliner application</li>
            <li> I like the white tips of the bristles because you can see how dirty the brush is.  </li>
            <li> , this is the one that gets the least use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that complaint...</li>
            <li> This set has everything you need for eye shadow, at least as a beginner.</li>
            <li> If nobody had told me the prices, I would have guessed at least $20 each.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too thick.</li>
            <li> The angle brush is sturdy and thick so keep that in mind depending on what you use it for.  </li>
            <li> Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> The angled brush is too thick to use for eyeliner or your brows.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The angle brush too thick</li>
            <li> As someone who is not very experienced with eyeshadow brushes, i decided to get this set hoping that it would help me get started.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Pixel-point&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t small at all!  </li>
            <li> The case is a little difficult to deal with though as you have to hold it awkwardly in order to put the brushes back in.</li>
            <li> You seriously can not beat the price.</li>
            <li> brushes, that is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> case/ stand is useless because it is so difficult to put them back in you</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this set, the sizes are just a little bit &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Some people where saying that the eyeliner brush is a bit thick to use it, I thought it was going to be hard to try to do thin a thin line on my eyes</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase when these go bad.</li>
            <li> Not a good quality brush set.</li>
            <li> After I used these I felt so mad that I literally spent hundreds of dollars</li>
            <li> The first  brush in the set is too dense to apply powder make-up with, so I use it for concealer and the slanted brush and eyeliner are horrible :</li>
            <li> this angled brush seems too thick but its SOOOO NOT its a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> (its a little too small for this but its not too bad)</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how well they stand up to my rough use and cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I could do without the case because the brushes are so thin i just throw them in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> The base shadow brush I actually use for under eye concealing.</li>
            <li> I find the base shadow and the crease brushes to be absolutely essential to my cosmetics routine.  </li>
            <li> Even applying thick eyeliner was sort of difficult for me with this brush.  </li>
            <li> The base shadow brush works especially well for concealer under the eye.</li>
            <li> Nothing irritating about them in any way.  </li>
            <li> and I do think that the base shadow brush is similar to a MAC 217.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for a secret cupid Valentine&#x27;s Day gift exchange with a makeup/skincare Facebook group</li>
            <li> I really only use the base shadow brush, and the crease brush (but for my under eyelid to give it definition).</li>
            <li> Also cleaning them isn&#x27;t as bad as other brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought brushes for $60 prior and hated them because they would shed all over however these brushes don&#x27;t shed and applies makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> I have found synthetic brushes to be irritating and uncomfortable for use in the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to use on my small features.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a few weeks now and they havent disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Base Shadow Brush – Just to clarify since the picture is a little</li>
            <li> but BOY WAS I WRONG.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> My wife sad</li>
            <li> GO WRONG</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I am definitely unable to use for crease at all...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with purple.&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance or the cleaning of the brushes is standard.&lt;br /&gt;Store</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong getting this kit.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow brush seems essentially useless.</li>
            <li> the eyeliner brush in useless.</li>
            <li> This one is fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don´t use all brushes.</li>
            <li> So, when I came across this kit, I was skeptical yet intrigued.</li>
            <li> I never knew I was doing it so wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick!!!</li>
            <li> They just might look a bit dirty after rolling around in your makeup bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They just might look a bit dirty after rolling around in your makeup bag.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Obsessed with these brushes!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I bought these brushes.  </li>
            <li> They make makeup application impossible.  </li>
            <li> (the bad reviews),</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an eye-makeup novice like me and looking for a set to get you started, this isn&#x27;t a bad way to go.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed .</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at the size of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I found the &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; brushes are stupid.</li>
            <li> board that comes with the brushes is stupid.</li>
            <li> The base shadow brush is my favourite, I use it the most.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use the base eyeshadow brush to pack on color on the lid and blend.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to buff up my eye brush collection and the crease brush, the accent brush, and the base shadow brush have become a permanent part of my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> havent yet figured out how to use the base shadow brush</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product .-.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by these brushes, considering the price and the hype about them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The base shadow brush is heaven sent!</li>
            <li> And the price is insane!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this set of makeup brushes! It has had, for me, almost everything I&#x27;ve needed as I&#x27;ve grown into using makeup more and getting better at it as well. The only thing I feel is missing from this is a plain paddle-shaped brush, which is usually used for packing on eyeshadow, or patting on glitters. That&#x27;s harder to do with the crease and blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do highly recommend this set. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and I&#x27;ve NEVER experienced shedding with this, or the other Real Techniques set I own. The brushes are never scratchy and are easy to clean. I feel for the money, this is the best eye set on the market--at least that I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, or if you know of a better deal, let me know!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes. Great way to get those pieces for your eye makeup. Blending is key.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes to me were useless and too big to blend my makeup</li>
            <li> Love them. I haven&#x27;t used any other brushes since I got them. They&#x27;re soft, blend wonderfully and really pack on the shadow. The base shadow brush is my favourite, I use it the most.&lt;br /&gt;I wear gel liner everyday and was pleasantly surprised by the fine liner brush. When I first got it I thought I was too flimsy and full to apply a smooth line, but once I loaded it up it made a really smooth, thin line.&lt;br /&gt;I love them, and I&#x27;m defiantly looking to buy more real techniques brushes</li>
            <li> these are not my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brushes. They are quite stiff.</li>
            <li> All of the real Techniques brushed worked wonderful. Be sure to watch the instruction video from the link on the box (they are helpful)!</li>
            <li> I love real techniques. Good brushes for the price. They&#x27;re not pokey like Elf brushes.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes - would definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes. Great quality.</li>
            <li> It is of great quality.  I love each of them.  The eyeliner brush doesn&#x27;t really work out.  I haven&#x27;t found where to use it.  Anyway it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I will buy another set for face.  Also I am in China.  It only cost me $3 for shipping.  It is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They do the job of brushes costing way more than these.</li>
            <li> Loved it. What I&#x27;ve been looking for at a great price. Thanks for a great product. Will return for more.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find that these are Authentic Real Techniques brushes. I would repurchase!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They have totally changed how I apply eye makeup. I went from not having a clue to doing it almost like I&#x27;m a pro, and fast!  The video on their website that gives a tutorial on these is a must watch. The whole line of brushes is the holy grail! Better than brushes costing 2-3x as much.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and easily cleaned.  The stand/holder is great for when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning and not having to dig through my bag for the right one.</li>
            <li> Love these. There have been very few of their brushes that haven&#x27;t worked for me. The liner brush did have a few wayward hairs though.</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes in this set! Real Techniques makes great brushes for such low prices. I want to buy every brush that they make!</li>
            <li> The one minus is for the eyeliner brush, it is just hard to work with coz it is too thick, i can tell from the pic, so i ordered another Fine Liner Brush, and i am glad i did. I use this eyeliner brush in the set as lip brush, so useful after all. Other  brushes are all great, i especially love the eye brow brush, it is just easy to work with, and great results with eye brow powder.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend, and she just loves them! She uses them daily, and always talks about how great they are!</li>
            <li> Although I love the brush quality, I feel like the two brushes on the right side (Pixel-Point Eyeliner Brush, Brow Brush) are a little large.  The &amp;#34;Pixel-point&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t small at all!  It&#x27;s rather large and is more suitable for applying a thin line of shadow underneath the eye instead of for eyeliner.  The same thing goes for the brow brush.  I don&#x27;t have thin or small eyebrows by any means, but the bristles are packed pretty wide and I have a hard time having any kind of precision on my brows.  I end up using that one to apply shadow to my top lash line and I blend it upwards.  The other three brushes are very useful, and the small Accent Brush is fun to use to put highlight to the inner corner of the eyes.</li>
            <li> Samantha Chapman + Real Techniques &#x3D; Best Bargain Brushes&lt;br /&gt;I am a free lance makeup artist and have a crap load of brushes. Since I&#x27;ve received these it&#x27;s pretty much all I&#x27;ve been using. The synthetic hairs grab product so well, especially cream and other emollient based products. The base shadow brush is heaven sent! I&#x27;ve used this brush for concealer under the eyes, to highlighting on the bridge of the nose and forehead, to spot concealing and it the delivery makes skin look airbrushed. Kudos to Mrs. Chapman &amp; Real Techniques for a brilliant collabo!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes.  The case is great for packing these up for travel and the brushes are easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed.  The price is also right.  I travel a bit for business and find that the case protects these brushes well.  I can also fit a foundation brush and blush brush (also from real Techniques) and a powder brush.  However, the powder brush makes it just a bit harder to close but it will.  I also wash these 3 times a week (I know it should be daily, but I just don&#x27;t have the time) and have not seen any loss of softness or excessive shedding.</li>
            <li> Learning to do eye make up was much more challenging until I stumbled upon these bruses! I have since become a bit more skilled and I no longer use my Starter Set as I have purchased more expensive brushes. But I still recommend these to anybody looking to wade out the waters. They are very effective brushes. They do their job and they will give you a basic range of effects to practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find them slightly coarse compared to my &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; brushes. But I never noticed a roughness when I was using only these. I can just feel a difference when I directly compare these to my more expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, definitely, I would recommend these if you&#x27;re starting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have a pretty good grip on your eye make up skills, you might consider more expensive brushes, but if you just need a small, basic set for traveling or as an emergency back up, get it!</li>
            <li> It is a really good brush&lt;br /&gt;It hold the product very will&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s super soft and easy to hold</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Waste if money.  They are way too hard.  They make makeup application impossible.  Yuck.  My shadow goes everywhere and it&#x27;s wasteful.  They dig into my eyeshadow and specks my foundation with color when I&#x27;m applying my eyemakeup.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  Helps with applying and blending eye shadow. Works well with either cream or powder eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the brow brush, accent brush &amp; pixel-point eyeliner brush that came in this set. The bristles were really soft on the skin and it catches the eyeshadows colour pigments really well.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had the chance to try out all of the brushes yet.</li>
            <li> These brushes are of great quality. They are soft, yet firm and don&#x27;t scratch my eyes. The eyeliner brush is firm and makes putting gel eyeliner on so easy. I use the accent brush to highlight the inner corners of my eye and right under the brow. It is the perfect size for that. I actually use the brow brush more to smudge my eyeliner when I want a smoky look, but it is firm and would do well when defining brows with powder. The base shadow brush would be nice to apply shadow to the lids, but it is fairly fluffy and useful as a crease blending brush. It is soft and small enough to blend where you want. The deluxe crease brush is pretty large for a crease brush, too large for smaller eyes unless you are blending everything out. I have yet to find a permanent use for it, but I have used it to apply powder under my eyes and to add highlights on top my cheek bones and down my nose. It might be good for contouring if you want a more defined look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are soft, have not shed through washings, and have many uses. This is a great eye set to try. The price was very reasonable. Their face brush set was also very good quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!  The crease brush and the accent brush, especially,  have really helped me to improve my eye makeup looks.  Before this set, I was using the generic brushes from Walgreen&#x27;s, which aren&#x27;t the greatest for contouring the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed these in shampoo before using them and they held up well during washing.  They seem well made and come in a handy case.  The sizes are just right and they apply product evenly.  This is a great set for a great price.  I can&#x27;t wait to try their other brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note: Real Techniques has a channel on You Tube where they post tutorials on how to use their brushes, how to achieve certain looks, etc.  I&#x27;ve found them helpful and entertaining to watch.</li>
            <li> I love this set so much! Every brush inside is there &amp;#34;for a reason&amp;#34;, and you can actually use them for different ways, I don&#x27;t wear eyeliner on my daily makeup, so I use the very detailed brush for putting on glitter on the inner corner of my eyes and it can even blend it! And the other brushes are very good too!</li>
            <li> I own these brushes and love them. A colleague that I have adopted into my family, is new to makeup. She&#x27;s just getting her routine in order and needs brushes. I ordered this for her. She&#x27;s only using foundation samples and a kit she got from Sephora. These are $11+ with Prime ($17.99 in store) so I grabbed them for her for xmas. She will have them for a long time and I know she will enjoy them.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good eye brush set, this is a perfect place to start!</li>
            <li> Really well designed and nice length</li>
            <li> Wife loves it what more can you ask for</li>
            <li> I love these brushs!! Great value and quality!! I&#x27;ve yet to be unhappy with real tech tools!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes, they&#x27;re vert soft and comfortable. Loved them</li>
            <li> I could do without the case because the brushes are so thin i just throw them in my makeup bag. But, i do know other people will find use for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, i didn&#x27;t find use for the angeled brush because i was already using a much thinner  elf brush for my brows but BOY WAS I WRONG. this angled brush seems too thick but its SOOOO NOT its a miracle worker! Total holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then, the thin lip brush, didn&#x27;t seem useful...at first. i use it for my concealer now, to define brows and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the other brushes are a MUST NEED now for my eyeshadow. they blend so well and my favorite is the smudge brush. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They hold product well, application is lovely (and easy), they&#x27;re soft, and they don&#x27;t shed. They&#x27;re just good quality brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that they&#x27;re quite pretty (I love how Real Techniques brushes are colorful) doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> I you are new to makeup brushes and are looking for a good set to get you started for eye makeup, this is the kit for you! You get everything you need to do eye makeup.  The bristles on all of the brushes are soft and dense, so you can easily apply and blend out shadow without much effort.  The handles make these brushes easy to store and grip.  It&#x27;s a great set!</li>
            <li> I love this brush set! It has a good variety for blending and lining. They are soft and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding of the bristles at all! Real techniques brushes are the most affordable high quality brushes out there!</li>
            <li> The brow brush is too soft to be of any use to me. the big eye brush is too big and scratchy. The very thin eyeliner brush is not sturdy enough for use and it sprayed after a few washes too.&lt;br /&gt;Only two brushes are decent but they are not anything to write home about. I guess if you can save up, you should buy higher-end brushes such as Bobbi brown and Mac. For Mac, choose individual brushes, not their holiday sets. natural bristles can pack more powder and blending is extremely luxurious. To be cruelty free, you can consider Too faced for synthetic fibers.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. This is my second brush set - the first being a gift from my parents, a Kirkland (which is the generic brand for Costco) that I actually really liked. But that was years ago and it was time for an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These I found recommended by a lot of YouTube makeup gurus, and they were made by YouTubers! They are soft and easy to use. I find the accent brush works really, really well for filling in the brows, and I think the flat eyeshadow brush is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the silicone eyeliner brush as an add-on to this and I like it a lot, though I haven&#x27;t used it very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no expert but I think these brushes are very, very good for what you pay for. Excellent beginners brushes. I see the Real Techniques brand has been expanding and I&#x27;m excited to see where they go :)</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes! Fair price, and they are very easy to use. I would recommend to someone who is a makeup starter, or someone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on the brushes.</li>
            <li> These are by far my most favorite makeup brushes, especially the angled eyebrow brush. I lost mine and miss it so much, it was slightly larger and perfect for filling in my brows. Great brushes!</li>
            <li> love these brushes! good quality and my face looks flawless</li>
            <li> I like these brushes, they are good quality, soft, blend makeup well, and are easy to clean. Only one small complaint . . .the &amp;#34;eyebrow brush&amp;#34; is much wider than I expected, in fact too wide to get a really fine precise tip on my brows.  I would repurchase, but just plan on using some other brush for my brows.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are super soft and easy to clean. There are two brushes in here that I don&#x27;t use so I can&#x27;t speak for all of them. the eye shadow brush is too big for my eye so I use an E.L.F brush for eye shadow instead. I liked how the handles were labeled so you know what each brush is, however after only a week of use the label on the handle is coming off and you can no longer read it. These brushes are light weight and look cheap but they are really great brushes. The blend shadows nicely.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes.  At first I was skeptical because of the price, but I found that they are quite worth it.&lt;br /&gt;They are slightly bigger than I imagined, but that&#x27;s completely fine and more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I love Sam and Nic&#x27;s tutorials, and honestly, I&#x27;m not as impressed with this set as I was expecting to be. Right out of the box the dome blending brush had random long hairs sticking out of the top that I had to trim with scissors, which just made it seem cheap to me. Furthermore, since Sam and Nic are so into natural looking brows and precisely drawn hairs in their tutorials, I&#x27;m honestly shocked by the size and thickness of the &amp;#34;brow brush.&amp;#34; It lacks precision and unless you already have very thick brows, this brush only serves to stamp a thick line of color in the vicinity of the brow rather than creating a natural effect. I do like the smaller brushes, as I use them for detail concealing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the brushes in this set.  Not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or flimsy.  They work very well with everything I have tried so far.  I like the case as well.</li>
            <li> very nice product in a good price and a high quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole eye makeup scene and was skeptical about using half of the brushes in this set but it&#x27;s safe to say I use at least 4/5 every time I am applying eyeshadow on now. The detailer brush that looks ridiculously small is actually a gem to work with when applying some color to the bottom eyelid without it looking too caked on/unprofessional.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. They are so soft and hardly any of the bristles come out. It also comes in a very handy little carrying case that you can also use as a stand when you are not traveling. Over all these brushes are quite spectacular.</li>
            <li> Good set for a starter, for sure.Excellent for travel.</li>
            <li> I am now in LOVE with real Techniques brushes! I actually just recently bought a few brushes from Sephora&#x27;s Pro line and they&#x27;re pretty great but also pretty expensive (between $24-40 per face brush) I found that the real Techniques line harnesses the same fantastic quality as those brushes for a much more reasonable price range. They&#x27;re easy to clean and they don&#x27;t shed(!) and they kept their quality after being washed multiple times :)) Not to mention they&#x27;re beautiful! I&#x27;ve loved Pixiwoo makeup tutorials for awhile now, Samantha Chapman knows her stuff and I can tell she worked really hard on crafting the most optimal brush set with some pretty awesome innovations i.e. the multi-folding case/display! This was such a smart purchase for me, these brushes don&#x27;t disappoint :)</li>
            <li> Perfection. Love these brushes. Wish I could buy the dome shadow brushes all by themselves</li>
            <li> Nice starter set or sufficient brush set for regular daily use. I&#x27;m not a makeup artist so these brushes are working just fine for me.  Case is not really the type one might expect as it&#x27;s just a fold over with a velcro closure, for the price paid I can live with it as long as it protects the brushes.</li>
            <li> I sooo love these brushes the whole line ... the best . I really don&#x27;t use the stand but the quality of the brushes are the best .</li>
            <li> Soft brushes and great little carrying case that does sit upright like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> These are better quality than brushes you&#x27;d spend hundreds on at sephora. Real techniques for the win!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes.  Looks good, case holder is good,  Good price.  Would purchase again.  Now I need to find the larger brushes that match this set.  I recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li> These are called the &amp;#34;You Tube&amp;#34; brushes because MUA&#x27;s on youtube use them. I love this brushes . They are soft and easy to manage. So far I have not noticed any brush bristles or hairs falling . Great for someone who is just learning how to put on makeup</li>
            <li> I only use the brow brush. Even that brush is hard to use because of the size. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone who wants nice brushes. Might be good as a gift to a young girl starting out trying makeup and learning how to care for brushes. the folder does help to keep brushes in place to dry upside down and keep water from ruining the adhesive of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Good quality fibers and well constructed. This brand has a nice weight and heft to the brush. Easily cleaned with water and a drop of shampoo. Brush fibers dry straight and don&#x27;t frizz. I&#x27;m a hairdresser, and for the money this brand is a good deal. Applies makeup well, easy care, and bacteria resistant, and nice case for protection and hygiene. I recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great quality, purchased for my daughter and now I want one</li>
            <li> I got these brushes and I fell in love right away. I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the finished results after I apply my make-up in the morning. I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to get them.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! The fluffy crease brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> REAL TECHNIQUES BRUSHES NEVER FAIL TO IMPRESS ME! I LOVE IT! IT WORKS AMAZINGLY! IT&#x27;S SO SOFT AND THE APPLICATION IS SO AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Great for everyday make up application.  Went on website for tutorials and loved them!  Want to buy an extra one.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just what I wanted!love them!</li>
            <li> I had been following Samantha and Nicola Chapmans&#x27; youtube video tutorials for years before Samantha began the Real Techniques brush collection. They feel soft, hold product well without taking it back off of your skin, and create a flawless finish. Each brush is labeled with its intended purpose to make it easy, but if you follow Sam&#x27;s blog, she suggests different ways to use each brush. These did excellent for me, and I was happy to get them with my super saver discount!</li>
            <li> I like them but I thought the case was soft, I don&#x27;t like hard cases</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They&#x27;re fantastic.  They&#x27;re very soft and spread eyeshadows really well.  This is a great set for eyes. You can use some of the brushes to apply concealer too.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t like a good quality but they are useful</li>
            <li> Love the brushes so nice</li>
            <li> These are not cheap drug-store brushes. They are excellent quality and just the right sizes for all sorts of different looks. Easy to wash and the storage case is very handy. Great price for this quality.</li>
            <li> great brushes and great price compare to SIGMA. I bought this set and the core collection set. love them. I don&#x27;t believe in buying high end brushes cuz I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, but real technique is a really good investment. they help you achieve the perfect look honestly.</li>
            <li> I like this brush set but I don&#x27;t use it that much. I think they&#x27;re just a bit too big for my eyes? I dunno&lt;br /&gt;You can read my review here: [...]</li>
            <li> She love it! she&#x27;d rather more buy and probaby looking for &amp;#34;halloween&amp;#34; makeup like smooth makeup. And all it good is</li>
            <li> I love this set so much! My favorite brush is the brow brush. I love the eye shadow ones as well but it&#x27;s hard to find a good quality brow brush that evenly distributes product and gets inbetween the hairs. eyeshadow brush picks up so much product with light pressure and its soft on the lids. My eyelids don&#x27;t water when I apply shadow cause I don&#x27;t need to put pressure on the lid when I apply. Amazing brush line and I will never go back to expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these brushes they are such a steal for the price, amazing quality. I have worked with sigma brushes before and these are up there in greatness</li>
            <li> I thought brushes of this quality were way beyond my budget. Even when I saw that Samantha and Nicola Chapman (makeup artists known as Pixiwoo on YouTube) had produced and were using their own line of brushes I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to afford them....then I researched the price her on Amazon....and now they&#x27;re mine!&lt;br /&gt;These are well constructed brushes, all synthetic and vegan friendly. They come in a wonderful holder that serves as a stand, and quite simply I couldn&#x27;t be without them.&lt;br /&gt;Give yourself a treat and get these.and your makeup application will improve beyond imagination. A bargain at twice the price so my fave buy of this year.</li>
            <li> sorry but i found 2  brushes the same!!!&lt;br /&gt;1- Base shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;2- deluxe crease Brush&lt;br /&gt;3- Accent Brush ( 2 pieces)&lt;br /&gt;4- Brow Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what can i do???</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing quality at a very affordable price. The packaging also tells you which brushes should be used for what and it&#x27;s very useful. I&#x27;ve used them with two of my Urban Decay Naked palettes and gotten flawless looks.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very good quality.  All my other brushes (I have 40 in total) are Mac so I&#x27;m comparing these Real Techniques brushes with my long time, expensive Mac brushes.  I will definitely buy more Real Techniques brushes. They are just the right size and shape for defining and detailing eyes.  I use them with both high end and mass market shadows and have been very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is conceptually a good idea in that it has a self stand, however the materials that it is made from is a bit flimsy so I don&#x27;t use the case.  I have simply put these brushes in my large Shu Uemura brush case.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not only super soft and easy to hold, but they apply my eye products seamlessly. Everyone should have these as some of their go to brushes.</li>
            <li> everything i knew they would be, love them and will buy the rest of the set</li>
            <li> I receive on time. Very good! Thanks</li>
            <li> These brushes work really well. They are great quality and feel like good brushes. Have not owned them long enough to say how they last. Not crazy about the colors. I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes are very light, and densely packed.  I like the white tips of the bristles because you can see how dirty the brush is.  I haven&#x27;t used the case, but it would be very useful when I travel.  I&#x27;ve used the liner brush and liked it.  I&#x27;ve been rolling the brush in a gel liner so that the bristles come to more of a point.</li>
            <li> I had purchased these before &amp; lost them, but I still love them as much now as I did then!</li>
            <li> I bought the product just to try it out. I had very low expectations but was very surprised to find that these brushes are great!</li>
            <li> Angle brush is very thick and too stiff to achieve a nice, thin line. Maybe good for eyebrows, not for eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the second set that I got, my favourite is de deluxe crease brush. I left the firts one I got for concealer and the new one for eyeshadows. I must say that they are not the same shape exactly, but I guess this happens a lot unless they are super expensive brushes. Fortunatly, they brow brush I got this time is much thiner and the result is sharpper, I like that one too.</li>
            <li> I discovered these brushes watching the creator&#x27;s YouTube makeup guide channel, Pixiwoo, which I highly recommend.  The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed (like the natural bristle bare escentuals brushes do) and I just love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several brushes I&#x27;ve not seen before, including a teeny detail brush, which I love, because I tend to be more subtle with my eyeshadow.  I also use it for creating effects like age spots for stage makeup.  The larger brush is great for blending.</li>
            <li> Overall these brushes do a wonderful job though I&#x27;ve noticed the brushes hold onto product and does not deposit it.  However these are a great alternative to some other brands.  I wanted some reasonable brushes to practice the looks my favorite YouTube beauty guru Jaclyn Hill did with the more expensive sigma brushes since I&#x27;m fairly new to more detailed make up application.  However these and ecotools are produced by the same company.  I&#x27;ve purchased many ecotools&#x27; products which I actually found I prefer to use but that may just be a prejudice since I&#x27;m used to ecotools.  Overall I would recommend these especially for learning how to blend but I recommend a fluffy crease brush as well.</li>
            <li> Very good for beginners. High quality brushes that does their job well, worth your $12!</li>
            <li> These are really nice brushes, I was able to pick these up on prime day so they were on sale. While they are really nice, I&#x27;m not positive I would have paid full price for these as in my opinion there are better options out there for the same price range. In all I am happy with these and they do a nice job of picking up cream products, especially colourpop products.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this! She was very happy with this as a present for her Xmas. Even though she doesn&#x27;t need to wear makeup I&#x27;m glad i could still make her happy!</li>
            <li> Great little brush set. Helps me get the job done!</li>
            <li> Love these, great starter kit and the price was amazing!</li>
            <li> These brushes are well worth it. They are professional quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> Perfect tools to create any makeup look.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful! Great quality and very soft! I haven&#x27;t had any of the usual problems with these, such as hairs falling out, the metal around them becoming loose. The price is perfect as well!</li>
            <li> I dig the brushes &amp; the little wallet-ish thing that holds them is nice so they don&#x27;t get messed up.</li>
            <li> Love the feel, haven&#x27;t used it yet but I have used my core collection and I love it so I could imagine how awesome these are!!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, they case they come in is kind of useless and hard to get the brushes in and out of it.</li>
            <li> I really adore this product and wish I knew of these before I bought my fake Mac brushes from China. These are very soft and even though I have small eyelids these brushes work for me! The brow brush is thick so if you are looking for a thin brow brush for a precise skinny line then the brow brush is not for you. I use the brow brush to make my thin eyebrows appear full, thick and natural. I use the deluxe crease brush as my base shadow brush and vice versa as recommended by the creator because I have smaller eyes/lids and it works fantastic that way. Did I mention that they are really soft on my eyes? lol. The liner brush works well for applying a brown powder over my liner, I have&#x27;t really used the accent brush yet but it would work well as a smudger for my liner or precise detailing/highlighting. The case/stand/holder is very useful for storage and standing up but if I&#x27;m in a rush or feeling lazy then it&#x27;s kind of a pain to put back the brushes in the holder. I purchased these from real techniques Amazon LLC. I reccomend these. I purchased these over the eco tools eye essentials and Glad I did.</li>
            <li> great quality brushes for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Will return. HUGE brushes. Impossible to use on my small features. Absolutely impractical.  No no no. Ok I did not end up returning. I like the smallest flat detail brush. Hairs completely fell out of another one. The brushes are too large.</li>
            <li> You know what, reviews don&#x27;t lie. I have been eyeing out this set for a few months now but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I am willing to pay that much for just eye brush set. Well I finally came to my senses after reading all the reviews on Amazon and I have to say boy, those brushes are AHHHMAZING! I have had ecotool eye brush set before which I used for over a year and they were wonderful. This set reminds me of it and also since they are made by the same company the quality is obviously GREAT! I did not experience any shedding, the bristles are super soft and pick up just enough product with any excess. I use all five brushes! I use the angles brush for both eyebrow and eyeliner, the blending brush for applying concealer under my eyes and overall there are so many other uses to those brushes other than eyes. I am VERY happy with my purchase, the price and quality. I will definitely repurchase when these go bad.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes and super low prices, you cannot go wrong with these. I use the angled brush for applying highlight under my brow bone.</li>
            <li> Am loving these brushes!  Recently bought a couple Sigma brushes because I was looking for a fluffy blending brush and also a pencil brush and I&#x27;ve heard this brand name come up quite a bit from makeup artists. So they&#x27;re ok and all but I won&#x27;t be buying that brand anymore, the quality wasn&#x27;t as good as I was expecting for their price. These Real Technique brushes seem well made, very soft, easily cleaned and I&#x27;d had no bristle fallout at all (that was my main complaint with the Sigma brushes). Would definitely repurchase these!  Plus I&#x27;ve recently gotten into watching makeup tutorials on YouTube and Pixiwoo is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these. The angled eyeliner brush is perfect for eyebrows because it&#x27;s slightly thicker and really soft so it blends the color naturally into your eyebrow hairs. All the other brushes are equally wonderful. The blending brush is magic. It softens everything you put into the crease to make a lovely, professional look. I find myself reaching for these over any other brushes I own. Not a single one has shed and they&#x27;re so easy to clean, too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  I previously paid almost $20 for a similar set, same brand from a brick and mortar store.  I was happy to find them on Amazon for less $$.</li>
            <li> The packaging is really cool, I love the brushes&#x27; color, as well as the case they come with. The downside of the case is that the elastic where the brushes are is really tight and it&#x27;s a bit hard to get them in after you used them, but I guess that is normal so the brushes don&#x27;t fall off the case.&lt;br /&gt;The bushes&#x27; quality is also great. I like that they are soft, they work great. Some people where saying that the eyeliner brush is a bit thick to use it, I thought it was going to be hard to try to do thin a thin line on my eyes but it was the complete oposite. The brush can be used for thick or thin lines depending on if you use the whole brush dipped into gel liner, I use only the tip of the brush with a normal quantity of gel liner and I usually use a thin line and it worked wonders, but the cat line was hard to do, because the hair in the brush is really soft and flexible.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the brushes I use them every time I apply eye makeup on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I use this as my travel brush kit and it works really well. I like that I have space for the essential brushes I need and it turns into a stand.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes. No loose bristels</li>
            <li> They work perfectly! The brushes are made of great materials, they feel nice to the skin and they work great. I used them to do my own make up for a friend&#x27;s wedding and I was super pleased with the precision and the results. The crease brush and the liner brush are my favorites, they are superior compare to other brushes of that kind that I had before.</li>
            <li> From left to right: First brush (biggest) is amazing for blending concealer!!! Second brush is great for blending harsh lines for eye shadow (transition). Third is perfect for highlighting inner corners and bottom lash line. Fourth brush haven&#x27;t used yet! And last brush (angled) is actually really nice for applying black eye shadow as eyeliner for a less harsh look. I am in love with this set along with the many other Real Techniques brushes I own. I own nearly all of them!</li>
            <li> I like it so much, cant wait to use it, the hair is soft and it feels good when I tries to test on my face</li>
            <li> These were my first purchase of Real Techniques.  Delighted with them.  Soft on the skin, easy to wash, love the long&lt;br /&gt;handles.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of brushes I have purchased from real Techniques. I bought these to add to the array of shapes in my brush collection. I find that they work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Blends really well.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect makeup brushes.  I love them and will not use anything else.  I am shocked at how well they stand up to my rough use and cleaning.  They don&#x27;t shed at all and have kept their shape for months.</li>
            <li> I never used makeup brushes before. But after watching makeup videos on Youtube I just had to have some. Thankfully these are really nice and well worth it!</li>
            <li> Heard alot about these brushes and decided to purchase. They are pretty good and amazing price. Wish the blending brush wasnt so thick and round and more &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; but it works fine</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. They are cruelty free, animal hair free (yes apparently those are TWO different things) and they are effective! I bought these because I&#x27;m allergic to animal hair so I had to have synthetic brushes. I learned that just because something is cruelty free, doesn&#x27;t mean there is no animal hair! Anyway I found these brushes which were affordable, cute, and animal free, I decided to buy them and I have been happy for many many months! They wash up very easily, and of course have this cute little carrying case if you travel. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget or seeking 100% cruelty free and animal hair free brushes.</li>
            <li> Really like these brushes!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting them forever!  I just got them and i love them! They don&#x27;t shed- they are super soft!</li>
            <li> Great value for money!</li>
            <li> Very nice brush set! I have the core collection and the Limited Edition Nics pics and I love them all! Real Techniques never disappoints!</li>
            <li> I found the &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; brushes are stupid. The others are great though. They need to be washed before used or else they wont pick up any product</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for someone who&#x27;s just starting out with eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;-The shader brush is extremely soft and would probably work very well with mineral shadows.&lt;br /&gt;-The round blending brush is honestly very large for my tiny eyelids, so I use it for highlighting under my brow bone and sometimes I conceal my under eyes with it.&lt;br /&gt;-The tiny smudge brush is great for using shadow to set your eyeliner (keeps it from smudging). The bristles are so soft that I don&#x27;t actually smudge well with it.&lt;br /&gt;-The eyeliner brush is a little broader than other liner brushes I&#x27;ve seen. I use this for spot-concealing with either liquid or mineral concealers and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;-The brow brush has firm but not scratchy bristles, and perfect for filling in and shaping brows.</li>
            <li> I L O V E my R T brushes so much&#x60; i even get the stippling brush, Core set, Foundation brush, &amp; now i ordered the Travel Set Brush &amp; Powder Brush.&lt;br /&gt;Im planning to get all of this R T brushes... And cant wait to arrived my new sets of it.. Just highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Got these for my sister and she loved them!!</li>
            <li> Only really liked one brush from this set to be honest ! The angled one was to big for my taste , the eyeliner one was also a little thicker which I didn&#x27;t like so it&#x27;s really a preference to be honest but they are nice quality over all</li>
            <li> These brushes make a nice basic set. I don&#x27;t really do anything beyond basic eye makeup so I don&#x27;t use all of the brushes, but this set works for me. I really like the detailing brushes, but the larger ones were a bit sloppy in application. I like it, but I&#x27;m not going to run out and tell everyone I know to buy it.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite brushes in the world. I have yet to pick up my MAC or sephora brushes since I got these and I look forward to having the whole collection before the end of this year. Not to mention they are SO fairly priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. A bit of shedding. I have MAC brushes and then I have lower end ELF brushes, and I prefer those honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is decent enough. Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase from Real Techniques. But they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Would definitely recommend.  I thought they wouldn&#x27;t be so great because of how cheap they were.</li>
            <li> Perfect starter set for eyes. Good quality.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price.  This is an upgrade to the brushes I was using.  This is soft, easy to use, durable.</li>
            <li> Essential for any girl, i am planning to buy core set cuz they are work great , thanx for pixiwoo youtube channel !!!</li>
            <li> These brushes pick up and distribute product perfectly.  The hairs don&#x27;t skew like cheaper brushes do and they are fairly easy to keep clean and maintain.  I like the case as well, though it is a bit bulky for traveling.</li>
            <li> I got this as a christmas present for my roommate because I had gotten her some makeup. I was surprised at the quality of the brushes for the price! She loves them!</li>
            <li> Love this brand! These eye brushes are just the right size for whatever look you are going for. Blends to perfection !</li>
            <li> One of the best make up brush sets I&#x27;ve ever owned. I am a make-up beginner. I never really had skills. This set allows me to use what skills I have to finally master basic techniques and look &amp;#34;well put together&amp;#34;. The brushes are sturdy, do not shed and the whole set is attractive. The case has additional elastic holders, I can fit a mascara in one and a small eye palate in another. You can manipulate the case into a stand with ease.</li>
            <li> Awesome for starters and they also blend nicely!</li>
            <li> Great quality I love it and the case/stand is also great! The brushes are labeled for beginners which helps out a lot with all the different brushes</li>
            <li> Excelent product, good quality, good deal, you pay a fare price  for an excelent product. It also has a kit with many options</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the brushes: they look great, feel great and the overall packaging looks very fancy to my young teen!</li>
            <li> I love real techniques and I love these brushes</li>
            <li> These brushes are good quality, but they are rather large for the eye area.</li>
            <li> My wife sad that&#x27;s just perfect!!! High quality, soft but steady. Complete tools for a nice eyes make up. She recomends it!!!</li>
            <li> Have purchased them for others because they are so good. This is all you need for make-up brushes. Just invest in the additional foundation brush, and you&#x27;re completely set.</li>
            <li> Each brush is uniquely designed to fulfill many tasks.  They are easy to use for perfect styling. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> The real Techniques Starter Set is a great addition to my makeup toolbox. I added these five brushes to the real Techniques Travel Essentials Set and now have a complete makeup set. These brushes work beautifully for eye applications. As a bonus for those starting out with more serious makeup application, the brushes are labeled with their suggested use right on the handle. There are also bonus videos and how to&#x27;s on their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brushes themselves, they are good quality, apply shadows smoothly and evenly, and are soft and easy to use. They clean up easily and I have not lost any bristles, even after daily use.</li>
            <li> I looooove this set for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- synthetic feels \\&quot;softer\\&quot; than real bristles&lt;br /&gt;- bristles do not absorb makeup&lt;br /&gt;- no bacteria&lt;br /&gt;- unbelievable and streak free application&lt;br /&gt;- less prone to breakage&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that ...&lt;br /&gt;- the Base Shadow Brush and Deluxe Crease Brush were smaller so that I can get a more precise application&lt;br /&gt;- this was sold without the case, I don&#x27;t use it. Perhaps that would lower the price :)</li>
            <li> I love that these brushes are affordable and super soft. If you aren&#x27;t in the market for having to purchase individual brushes at the makeup counters then these are a great alternative. they blend eyeshadows and powders beautifully. They come with a little stand case and are very sturdy. They lose a few hairs in the first uses, it&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s a bunched up ball of hairs, it happens. especially with the big powder brushes. Love these brushes!!</li>
            <li> Saw these brushes on youtube.  Thought I would give them a try.  Love them. Soft. Durable. Perfect.  Get some for gifts as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Pixiwoo gals. These brushes are soft, so I&#x27;m glad. Cause I&#x27;d be pissed, you know? If they were like &#x27;we use these brushes that we came up with&#x27; but in reality they were s***.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same Bobbi Brown brushes for years - I thought they were great, until I used them. They are great! They are soft and smooth on your skin. Very nice - I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> These were my first brush kit and I&#x27;m in love with them! Buying more whenever I can! I didn&#x27;t like the case, it could be a small bag or a cup like sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> best brushes i bought, im crazy for them i going to buy all the collection , cant wait to have them all</li>
            <li> As expected.. great price and great products</li>
            <li> works well with picking up eye shadow, love the dome brush and the liner brush! I get really good controll especially when putting on gel liners. ^_^ awesome product!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s not such a goodkit I was looking forward to I bt I was very disappointed in this product .-.</li>
            <li> The plastic outside looked pretty okay. When I took off the plastic, everything looked pretty good; exactly what I expected. My friend loved the brushes! ^_^&lt;br /&gt;-Mich</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE TOO GOOD YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG GO TOO YOUTUBE SHE HAS HOW TOO USE THEM I LOVE WATCHING MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> Very good quality brushes. Have nice soft touch and blend very well. Great for both powder and creamy products. Easy to use, wash and store. Love them!</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup brushes!  Works great and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They basically just absorb all your makeup and barely put any on you</li>
            <li> Good selection of brushes for eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month. They&#x27;re good quality, wash well. Feels like they&#x27;ll last ages. The case is hand for propping them up. The base shadow brush I actually use for under eye concealing. They&#x27;re all well sized. The brow brush is intense, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Mixed feelings good for someone just getting into makeup, but not good for professionals. I like sigma better.</li>
            <li> These work sooop well. None of my bristles have fallen out. I absolutely loveeee them. I also got the core collection. My favoriteeee brushes by far!</li>
            <li> This set of brushes are great! I follow Pixiwoo on Youtube which is how I learned of them. The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t feel cheap. Best of all, they&#x27;re affordable!</li>
            <li> I love real Technique brushes, they are reasonably priced and last me a few years with good care.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this set just for the deluxe crease brush! All are just great.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I still use other brushes to supplement but specifically the deluxe crease brush and other shadow brush are awesome!</li>
            <li> i found it very effective and i also have recommended to others to get more benefit out of it. Keep it up</li>
            <li> I like this product. Price is little high. shipping and packing was good. a decent product. Easy to use and give nice and clean look.</li>
            <li> Nice can&#x27;t wait to use them!!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing. I love the pixiwoo youtube channel and wanted to try their brand of brushes. My favorites are the two larger brushes, and I use them to apply/blend concealer like the girls do on their youtube videos. Amazing! They clean up really nicely too. Would definitely repurchase these.</li>
            <li> Thank You so much . It&#x27;s really amazing 👌😍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a compete newbie in make up so idk how good brushes should feel BUT: I found them very soft, applies make up well ( it holds the eyeshadow dust pretty nicely so you do t end up with a hot mess of eyeshadow dust around the eye ( of yall know what I&#x27;m talking about)). Also I have yet to see fallout from the brushes!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are some of my favorite brushes, and this is an amazing set for anyone who loves eyeshadow. Soft, not scratchy, with no shedding. A dream.</li>
            <li> Goody buy!  I use them all the time.</li>
            <li> Great set of makeup brushes! Real Techniques has amazing quality brushes and this set is perfect. Most brush sets out there are complete face sets - powder brushes, contour brushes, etc. But there&#x27;s a limit to how many of those brushes you really need. What I always find myself needing is more eye brushes so I can try new things with my eyeshadow palettes. This is a great set to add onto anything you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are really soft and the weight of the brush is great. I have great control when I use these brushes. Definitely recommend adding this set to your collection.</li>
            <li> I have watched Samantha Chapman on YouTube for quite awhile so I was excited when she came out with these brushes. I do not live anywhere near an Ulta so I took to the internet to try and find these starter sets. I purchased this one as well we the face brushes with the gold handles and I use them every day. They do not shed or lose their shape and they pick up just the right about of product. Very good quality!</li>
            <li> This is a great starter set! Do not waste your money on high dollar brushes! These are just as good and a great price! Love the purple metallic but i don&#x27;t care for the case because its hard to stick the brushes back in but other than that these are awesome! Definitely worth the 12 bucks!</li>
            <li> These brushes are not very good. The brushes are too thick and stiff. They were very inexpensive so I thought I would try them. I would be better served to get the good brushes, pay the extra, and get brushes that work for me. I do use the one brush to make my eyeliners more rubbed in rather than a straight line. The case is good to use for travel with my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I really love real techniques brand brushes.  The bristles are soft and feel nice on the skin.  For the price, this is an excellent set which includes all the necessary eye brushes.</li>
            <li> Great set.  Works well.  Love the color and softness of bristles.</li>
            <li> As a 21 year-old student who is beginning to learn about makeup, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this starter set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this set and figured that at such a reasonable price, I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. I wanted the best quality but simply couldn&#x27;t afford the $50-per-brush that a lot of companies charge, and this set is a happy medium. There&#x27;s a nice variety of brushes and the bristles are great quality, hold product well, and haven&#x27;t shown the slightest sign of shedding. Another great little feature is the combination case/stand that&#x27;s helpful when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes.  These makeup brushes have great reviews on YouTube, which pushed me to buy them. They pick up makeup pretty easy and give great amounts of even coverage.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS AUTHENTIC AS I HAVE COMPARED IT TO STORE BOUGHT REAL TECHNIQUE BRUSHES AND THEY LOOK FEEL AND PERFORM THE SAME.</li>
            <li> Very soft and good travel sizes! I love this product makes my make up look perfect and brings all together</li>
            <li> Good brushes. Many washes ...good wear</li>
            <li> Great if youre looking for make up brushes at an affordable price! I love them, they don&#x27;t hurt my skin, and i have experience the hair falling out yet. The only thing i can say is the lip brush doesn&#x27;t work very well. For blush, foundation brush, etc. you would have to buy the gold brush set, which i also brought and love to use</li>
            <li> Love my brushes especially the accent brush</li>
            <li> These brushes are of a high quality for an affordable price. The case design is great for standing up, or folding up.  These same brushes sell in other department stores for a higher price. Very glad I checked on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Real Techniques brushes and I absolutely love this brush set. They are super soft, blend amazingly and are very affordable! I have absolutely no complaints. I have experienced zero shedding even after several washes, so far and they feel really sturdy. I am very happy with these.</li>
            <li> For this price, it does not get any better. It honestly holds it own among the even more expensive brushes. I&#x27;ve always told myself to stop buying cheap tools but a makeup artist Friend of mine told me to give this a try and I love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I&#x27;m glad it labels each brush for its use.</li>
            <li> I love this product I gr8 s very soft and it works perfect I haven&#x27;t had a problem using it or when I wash all my brushes.I recommend this product plus the shipping was fast it said 2day shipping and it came the next day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soooo many brushes over the years. I tend to be fairly hard on them and go through them rather quickly. I was so happy to be introduced to these. You seriously can not beat the price. My favorite &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; brushes by far!</li>
            <li> Eventhough I&#x27;m still in love with Face Expert brush from Real Techniques, this set I hate because of the bristles size. You can cannot use them to apply and blend your eyeshadow properly. I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m supposed to do with this set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a set of brushes that were not too cheap or extremely expensive.  This set is perfect.  The brushes are well made and were priced just right.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes they&#x27;re so soft with a high end quality but without the price tag.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love every brush in this set. The angled one is my favorite. Super soft bristles and are very high quality. Definitely recommend these. Makes trying new styles easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and am very happy.  I love to large brushes.  Pair it with quality makeup and you have a great combination.</li>
            <li> Great value.&lt;br /&gt;Good service.&lt;br /&gt;Plus discounted price on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Like the brush very much.&lt;br /&gt;The bristle is soft and dense.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job for my eye makeup</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this set, high quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li> No complaints with the brushes, they have held up well and work nicely.</li>
            <li> These are spectacular brushes. They hold shadow perfectly, blend easily and never shed bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Yeassssss theyre amazing the ONLY bushes I use for my makeup and I use high quailty make up ... works well the brisols didnt come off . I recommend these brushes to everyone</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Great quality and work well with all type of high end to low end makeup. The case is a little difficult to deal with though as you have to hold it awkwardly in order to put the brushes back in.</li>
            <li> I love Real Techniques brushes. They are soft and do not she&#x27;d and all. I have washed the several times and still go right back into shape.  I also recommend the gold foundation set with blush brush, concealer brush etc. Such a great value for the money!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing quality. They&#x27;re super soft, easy to wash, quick to dry. I&#x27;ve had mine for over four years and they&#x27;re holding up incredibly well - it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re brand new.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Great quality at a very affordable price. I didn&#x27;t think I would make use of the case as a stand but I actually do every day...pretty clever! They are very soft and very pretty if you choose to display them on your makeup table. My makeup just looks so much better when using quality products.</li>
            <li> Very good price, love these brushes !!</li>
            <li> This set is really nice. The brushes are soft and the handles are great.  The stand is also nice to keep the brushes in place.</li>
            <li> Great little brush set. I would say I only use 3 brushes out of the 5 but they blend eyeshadow wonderfully and they are easy to clean. I also really like this company.</li>
            <li> I do not have a lot of experience with make up brushes and a friend recommended I try these.  The brush material is soft to the touch on the skin and the light to hold.  They are synthetic but they hold make up and move the product nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a beginner with doing fancy eyeshadow stuff (meaning using more than one color) and I LOVE this set! The brushes are super soft, easy to hold, and the bristles DON&#x27;T fall out, which is great because a lot of drugstore  brushes have bristles that fall out. These are sleek, high quality brushes with a low price. The only downside for me is that the crease brush is a tad too big I think. DEFINITELY get this brush set!</li>
            <li> I had never tried any of these brushes and theyre good I just wish they sold a more complete brush set im buying more of these same brand but face brushes .</li>
            <li> These brushes are superb. They exceed my expectations. I primarily use brushes from top of the line companies but I decided to give these a try, and I&#x27;m in love. They are dense, soft, well-constructed, and they each do exactly what they&#x27;re designed to do. If you want eye shadow in the crease to be applied and well-blended at the same time, the crease brush does the trick. When using the eyebrow brush with powdered brow colors, it puts the color on quickly and smoothly (for mid-grade brow powders). I also have their blush brush and it&#x27;s wonderful, I feel like I&#x27;m using the cadillac of brushes. If you need new brushes at a reasonable price, you don&#x27;t have to go to that large company that begins with an &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; or the one that starts with an &amp;#34;S&amp;#34;, just go get yourself a set of Real Techniques brushes and you&#x27;ll never need to worry about those other high end brushes again. These do the exact same thing, sometimes better and at a much more reasonable price. I don&#x27;t have all the brushes that come in the collection but I have this eye set and the one blush brush and I WILL be purchasing other sets in the future. Oh, they don&#x27;t shed either.</li>
            <li> love this set!! it made me feel like a pro because i applied everything so smoothly with these brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;also the nice purse that changed into a stand!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like these brushes. The bristles don&#x27;t hold a lot of the eyeshadow on it, therefore wasting a lot of my eye shadow</li>
            <li> These work so well, I love them!</li>
            <li> I love the accent brush for applying smudgey powder / liner to my lower lash line &amp; also for precise eyeshadow crease application. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Well made, beautiful, soft and the combo of natural and synthetic fibers really make a difference. I use all 5 of them every day.</li>
            <li> I love love love these brushes! I brought a HD blending set of brushes from sephora a while back for over $70 but for some reason I didn&#x27;t feel they were worth it.I heard about these brushes and brought them immediately. After only one use I FELL IN LOVE these are so amazing and for the price!</li>
            <li> Great brushes at a nice price! I wanted a nice set of brushes to replace my drugstore ones. I did not want to pay 50+ dollars&lt;br /&gt;for brushes, that is ridiculous. These were affordable and they work perfect! I own a set of Urban Decay and some Mac brushes and&lt;br /&gt;these work just as good. Don&#x27;t let people fool you into thinking you need high end brand names, you don&#x27;t. I got 3 sets so my girls could have a set and we all love them. I have been wearing makeup for 30 years and these are perfect I am telling ya.</li>
            <li> Great product, good how to use videos, great seller, and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I love real techniques so much,  that I dont want to use them on my clients.  I Will buy more</li>
            <li> All my RT brushes are fantastic. This is a good set. I can do my wash, crease and brows with it. I don&#x27;t typically use the 2 thing ones in the middle very often. I also don&#x27;t use the case when travelling, because many of my other brushes don&#x27;t fit, so I could take or leave the travel case.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful. The bristles are very soft and apply the product great. I have recommended them to other people I know.</li>
            <li> These are good quality brushes at a good price. If you are looking for an eye makeup starter set, I&#x27;d go wtih these.</li>
            <li> I got this because I had heard good things about real techniques. But a lot of the brushes were impractical for what they are meant to be used for. The brow brush is so thick and not at all stiff so you can&#x27;t fill in your eyebrows with it. The crease brush is too round and stiff so i just use it for precise contouring. The eyeliner brush it too thick(unless you like that look).</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent! I thought these brushes were going to be mediocre at best considering they were very affordable, but they have exceeded my expectations. The quality of the brushes is very good and is soft to the skin. They also don&#x27;t shed, which is nice considering even some of the more popular and expensive make-up brushes tend to do so. I have used all but the fine liner brush, (I find it too soft for the gel liner I use), but the blending/shadow brush are my favorites. I originally purchased this as a traveling set, being that it is a mini-brush set with carrying case, but I use at least 2 of the brushes on a daily bases, even though I have other sets at home.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush set.  Compared to Sigma and other high-end brush sets it is a great value and the set is nice.</li>
            <li> I think these brushes deserve all what were said about them I am so in love , now I am planning to try the face brushes too</li>
            <li> I love this set. The large brush is perfect for my base color on the eyelid. The quality is very good. I purchased one of these sets about four years ago and I&#x27;m still using it. I just purchased another, not because my old one didn&#x27;t last, but because I prefer replacing old brushes rather than cleaning them.</li>
            <li> I love it ,, these brushes are fantastic ...</li>
            <li> Perfect product for my gf she&#x27;s happy all it matters!</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes and would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Low in price but awesome quality!</li>
            <li> Nice case for handbag and brushes very good quality</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes. They are amazing quality, really soft, and are relatively inexpensive compared to other brushes. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> All good. Worth way more than what we pay for this set. Hold up well after daily washing. Only con for me is the detail fine liner brush is too thick for me. But that is ok, I can use it for many other things.</li>
            <li> I love all my Real Technique brushes. They are very soft, wash up great and no shedding. I will repurchase these in the future!</li>
            <li> Very nice set especially since it comes with a travel case. Has everything you would need to complete an eye makeup look and the bristles are soft so you don&#x27;t feel like poking your eye out.</li>
            <li> The lady loves them. Well worth the money she says just for the crease brush. She says it&#x27;s great for beginners, or traveling.</li>
            <li> A great starter kit. I usually just use cheap brushes with my makeup but this was definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anybody love it tens all across the board</li>
            <li> This is a nice and reasonably priced set of brushes for makeup beginners needing a basic brush kit. The brushes are soft and retain their bristles even after a couple of washes. The brushes come in a nice portable case that can be folded back to stand upright. The kit comes with an angled brush, a liner brush, two round fuller brushes for applying shadow or blush, and a small accent brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect Set! Love the Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes, variety is great, holder is great</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. High quality, beautiful, and easy to travel with and clean. HIGHLY REC.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this starter set. I&#x27;ve never really worn makeup before, so this kit is perfect for my needs. The quality is great and the case is extremely useful. I would definitely buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li> A very nice makeup brush kit. So far so good with staying together and hairs not falling out. Love the lavendar color and velcro closure for black carrier. Good quality. I am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes....I am not a make-up pro by any means so not wanting to pay a lot of money for new brushes. These are a great deal and the price is perfect. A must buy!!!</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. Nicest I have ever had and an AMAZING value for the price. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this set of eye shadow brushes. I use them on a daily basis. While the price may seem low these brushes are a very good quality better than any brushes that u have purchased previously from target or other drug stores. These are also great brushes if you are a beginner in the makeup world.</li>
            <li> I am a big-time Pixiwoo fan but hesitated about buying these for a long time...I&#x27;m so glad I did! These brushes are GREAT! Very soft, manageable size, and really get the job done! I feel like I&#x27;m participating in their YouTube tutorials when I use them. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The real Techniques Starter Set did not cost a lot and they were nice brushes and work well. They were a great bargain.</li>
            <li> great quality. i love these brushes!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I now know why my makeup never came out looking like the youtube tutorials, because i didnt have the right tools. Makes my eye makeup flawless</li>
            <li> If you need a lot of eye brushes and don&#x27;t mind a stand that slides all over this may be for you.  The brushes only have one piece of elastic in the center so the brushes go this way and that.  Don&#x27;t buy just for the case.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!  I&#x27;ve always struggled finding makeup brushes that I actually like.  I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to brushes and am so happy I discovered this brand.</li>
            <li> A few of my classmates turned me on to these brushes. We all love them and use them on oursleves and our clients. I love.the face brushes more but these are still worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because I spend most of my time on my eye makeup everyday and wanted some other brushes besides e.l.f. brand brushes.  These looked perfect!  I had heard reviews and figured I would buy it, but when it came, I was a little let down.  The brushes are very soft and almost flimsy, and the brush I had been looking forward to the most, the deluxe crease brush, was too big to do anything but pack color on with.  It certainly wasn&#x27;t small enough to use in your actual crease.  I was very disappointed by these brushes, considering the price and the hype about them.  I might buy another from this brand to see if the face brushes are any better, but this has certainly ruined my experience with Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> Best. Brushes. Ever. Seriously. I love these brushes so much. The bristles never fall out, and they are so easy to clean! Just make sure they dry completely or else the where the bristles meet the brush might rust.</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace my collection of e.l.f./forever 21 brushes which I didn&#x27;t like in the first place. These are so much better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for new blending brushes and came across this kit. Love the feel and texture of these brushes and their pricetag!</li>
            <li> I just got this and I love love it! Very easy to use... fool-proof! It was what I have been waiting for for eye make-up brushes. You don&#x27;t have to be a pro in blending (and I am not!) My purchase was really worth it!</li>
            <li> I am very picky on the types of brushes that I use and always end up having to buy the very expensive one to get the look I want. I am a makeup artist and this paint so well I have no complaints with them. I will continue buying and recommending this product to everyone I  know!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how cheap these brushes are for the quality they offer. Soft,No shedding, and Sturdy great brushes. I will be buying every real techniques brush I see now</li>
            <li> I really like this set. The brushes are great and the case is convenient.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great! cheaper here than in kohl&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> the brushes are amazing and they clean nicely and feel very soft. i love useing them whenever i need to.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes for the price. They&#x27;ve held up over dozens of washings. I&#x27;m giving another set to a friend as a gift.</li>
            <li> A few brushes that I don&#x27;t use yet but love the ones I do</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected,  real techniques is a good product, cheaper here .</li>
            <li> I like it, very cute and pretty. I just hope the liquid liner brush can be firmer and the angle brush could be a bit sharper though.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not professional grade, but they&#x27;re damn good for anything LESS than professional grade.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied. The price does not affect the quality.</li>
            <li> Great product for people just starting to wear more detailed eyeshadow. Great quality brushes, that allow amazing control and precision.</li>
            <li> These are my alltime favortie brushes and I really recomend it! It came at a reasonable time too. They are soft, and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very nice and perfect starter set. I&#x27;m new to real techniques. Heard all great things about it so decided to buy this to give it a try. Brushes are not cheap. Metal handle with rubber for a nice grip. Love all the brushes and find uses for all of them. If you want a great starter set- get these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the crease brush. Works wonders for blending!</li>
            <li> Been hearing a lot mixed reviews and I have to say I love them. Worked great and the case is great.</li>
            <li> Really like these brushes.  The set includes multiple sizes for all your make up application needs.  Bristle are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of collecting all of Sam Chapman&#x27;s brushes. Every brush lived up to expectation! Plus the brushes can be used for more than one intent, love em!</li>
            <li> Everything you need for beautiful eye makeup. I use these with the lorac pro and naked 3 palettes, and it works beautifully.  The smallest brush I use with my gel liner and it makes beautiful smooth lines. I also love that when I clean them there is no fallout. I am in love with the real techniques brushes and now own them all. They are better than the $50 mac brushes I had before.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed from the packaging , The box was dirty and scratched but other than that it&#x27;s a good brushes</li>
            <li> I love how colorful these brushes are. They work well, and so far haven&#x27;t had any shedding. I also like the feel of the handles and of the bristles.</li>
            <li> As someone who is not very experienced with eyeshadow brushes, i decided to get this set hoping that it would help me get started. The bristles are very soft and gentle on the skin. When i tried to do my eyeshadow, the brushes worked really well! The eyebrow brush left my eyebrows looking really good, not to mention that it was way easier to use this brush. The only thing is that i wish it had a big fluffy brush. Other than that i think its a great set to have in your collection whether your a beginner or not.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing. They are so soft, really pack color on for great pigmentation, and blend effortlessly. I have a makeup brush obsession and have accumulated quite a collection, and I have to say I reach for these every day. I find myself using Samantha Chapman brushes over my MAC and Smashbox brushes of the same design. I don&#x27;t know what it is about these brushes, or how they are so affordable, but they are worth every penny and them some. I can honestly say that, for me, these are comparable to Sigma brushes. They really do so much of the work for you. I can&#x27;t rave about these brushes enough. If you&#x27;re considering buying them DO IT; you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> i love it so much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the hair of the brushes never falls&lt;br /&gt;and the price is very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing that i didn&#x27;t like about it the case!&lt;br /&gt;it is really hard to back the brushes to its place</li>
            <li> Bought these for a gift for my SO. Package came in quick and the brushes are great quality for the sell price. She enjoys them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes!! They are great quality and I especially love the eyeshadow brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a present so I only saw it like that and didn&#x27;t used it but the person told me (and show me) how it was PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;The blending brush isn&#x27;t that hard so it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you blend the eyeshadow (unlike the Urban Decay one that comes with the NAKED 2) and it works well for setting powder or highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;The liner brush is perfect for liner and for eyebrow, not that hard but enough for doing a perfect job.&lt;br /&gt;The pointed brushes (the two little) can be used for concealer and pointed highlight.&lt;br /&gt;The basic brush can be used for powder, eyeshadow and blending also.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good Set and make you be able to do an awesome job. I saw it all in action and it was great!!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, just buy it, it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li> Love these versatile brushes, great quality and inexpensive. Whether your a rookie makeup junkie or a pro makeup artist these brush are a great addition to your collection.</li>
            <li> I recommend all RT brushes they are fantastic for makeup you can see them on Pixiwoo videos.. Do not hesitate to buy them.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes to add to any collection! I went from using elf to these and I was totally impressed!</li>
            <li> this is a terrific brush set for eyes. contains everything you could need. i want to buy another set to have for different shades.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! Flimsy case, bristles coming out,this could have been a much better value, next time I&#x27;ll spend more</li>
            <li> This set was everything I needed and the price is wonderful. I&#x27;m very happy I bought this. I don&#x27;t use 2 of the brushes but it was still worth it to me and the quality is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable very soft ...I love it so much ...highly recommended it for you girls don&#x27;t hesitate go for it now .</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! I use them, along with the Core collection set, whenever I travel or am in a huge rush. The synthetic fibers are perfect for blending and applying the perfect amount of color. I recommend these to everyone who is looking for a great travel kit or even just starting out with makeup.</li>
            <li> These are excellent makeup brushes!  Very soft and very easy to clean.  I really enjoy the lightweight handles and travel case.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are easy to use and easily washed.  What a great find!  Affordable brushes that are useful and durable!</li>
            <li> I use these every day. Maybe not the gel liner brush, but that is bc I&#x27;m trying out a new liquid eyeliner at the moment. bristles are soft, I have recently compared them to my Ulta Collection.</li>
            <li> Loved it, soft and light in weight, have not tried yet however i have a feeling that i will really enjoy it</li>
            <li> I really love the real techniques brushes! They are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had and I would always repurchase them.&lt;br /&gt;A positive factor about them is that they are easy and quick to clean. When I use them my eye makeup turns out to be really nice but I have the feeling that these brushes are a little too big for my eyes though...&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes to everybody who wants high quality brushes for a really good price.</li>
            <li> This set has a great selection of brushes for eye make-up and real Techniques brushes are so well priced for the quality you get.</li>
            <li> Samantha Chapman is a makeup genus. She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  These are multi functional brushes and can be used on any facial feature and with any type of make up!  I can not get enough of these brushes.</li>
            <li> I must say that I just love love love my brushed from Teal Techniques. I have had Mac brushes for more than 6 years and always found them shedding, these have not shed a single hair and they are so so soft and my skin goes all uhmmm and aaahhh when I use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the set; almost everything you need. The crease brush is a little big for my eyes, but I use it for other purposes. I find that a thinner eye liner brush (I do not recall if it is called that, but I mean the long thin one) would have been great, the one included is a little clumsy, but I used it for applying highlighter at exact places and for that it is great. I use this set a lot.</li>
            <li> Perfect set for your kit. I am a huge real Techniques fan and use them in almost all my youtube makeup tutorials. You can&#x27;t beat the texture, quality and durability of these brushes for the price.  A++ brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok. I&#x27;m trying to get into makeup again. They do the job and they have a traveling case. I just wished they picked up and distributed makeup a little better. But for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I really loved this set of brushes! I&#x27;m not really a daily user of makeup but when it came to prom, I needed some basic brushes that would be easy use for a beginner. These brushes are spot on! I really love how they tell you what each brush are used for because it was incredibly helpful for someone that is starting to learn how to apply makeup. Plus, these brushes are incredibly soft and fun to brush on your face! Also, it works really well on blending your makeup. Would recommend this to any makeup starters/lovers!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter.  She picked out the item and is familiar with the brand.  She would definetely order this brand again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they work, but it&#x27;s real magic! These brushes are elastic but not weak, takes as much shadows as I need for a perfect makeup. And it&#x27;s very pleasant to touch all real Techniques tools, easy to store and clean them</li>
            <li> i bought this for my sister i personally did not use them so i dont know how is but she told me to give it a 5 star before she asked me to buy it for her she read  alot of reviews and watch many videos on youtube so finally i bought them for her and now she is so happy with them she cant stop wearing makeup just to use them</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brush brands. They work great and are super affordable.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Specially the way it&#x27;s in one small kit.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Just as good as MAC brushes!</li>
            <li> Nice way to keep all the make up brushes. I have been learning to use these brushes with the on-line video. As far as I can tell they are pretty good quality and they work well.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I bought these brushes.  I read all of the reviews that said they were great and I just didn&#x27;t think they could possibly be as good as others I had bought for 3 or 4 times the price.  I have been very plesantly surprised with them.  I find that I reach for them first among all of my brushes, most of which cost a lot more.  They apply makeup wonderfully and they wash well.  I will buy more brushes from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> Base Shadow Brush – Just to clarify since the picture is a little unclear-- this is a round brush. I use this brush on a weekly basis, and it&#x27;s really nice. I never use it to apply eyeshadow, because it&#x27;s just too big. I use it mostly as a blending brush for my crease shadow. It&#x27;s also great for concealer if you have a large spot to cover, as you can use it as a mini stipling brush. Sometimes I use it to apply highligher or small contour (around the nose or chin). It&#x27;s also great for applying a wash of color anywhere above the lid. Admittedly, I would get more eyeshadow use out of it if it was smaller, but I do like its applications as a face brush. Great for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deluxe Crease Brush – I don&#x27;t use this as a crease brush. I prefer a round brush with longer bristles for the crease, like the Mac 219, or bdellium 781 (bdellium is a great line of cruelty-free brushes). I use this brush for blending and sometimes applying to the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accent Brush – A nice little brush. Works nicely on brows, eyeliner, or pinpoint applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pixel-Point Eyeliner Brush -  Out of my entire set of RT brushes, this is the one that gets the least use. The bristles are too long for eyeliner application, too round and flexible for pinpoint concealing. I have no use for this brush. I recommend the bdellium 710 for eyeliner and pinpoint concealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brow Brush – I find this brush to be a bit too thick to use on my brows, but that is personal preference. I don&#x27;t fill in my brows with a brush very much. I use this brush for blending eyeliner or shadow on my lashline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panoramic 2-in-1 brush case/stand – Meh, I tossed this because I found it a pain to use. I didn&#x27;t like that it was always open and that my brushes weren&#x27;t sealed off from the outside environment when the case was closed. I would prefer if they came in a case like the Sigma brushes, or if they included a cute little bag to keep them in, but that&#x27;s just me. I don&#x27;t like having to put each brush back into a specific place, and I feel like this gets dirty and isn&#x27;t easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could do my entire face with these three brushes. I would say that this is my favorite set of brushes out of all the RT brush sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the full set of these brushes since they first launched in 2012. Since getting them, I&#x27;ve used at least three of them every single day. That&#x27;s two years of constant use, and they look and preform the same way they did the day I received them. Since getting the full line of these, I have not purchased a single new brush. My old mac brushes lay untouched in the back of my drawer. Not to mention that just one Mac brush costs as much as the whole set of these ones. Did I mention that you can now buy these at Walmart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are superior to animal hair brushes in every way. They are cruelty free. They are extremely easy to clean-- I timed myself, and I can wash twenty brushes in seven minutes. They do not get stained. I purposely didn&#x27;t clean red OCC Lip Tar off of my lip brush for a month, and the lip tar came off as easily as any other product. (I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Body Wash or just regular Equate hand soap to clean mine.) They  don&#x27;t hold any funky smells or bacteria after washing, since the bristles aren&#x27;t porous, unlike animal hair bristles. For the same reason, they dry off very fast. My RT face brush takes about 30 minutes to dry if I leave it damp on a washcloth, and I can dry it almost completely in a few seconds if I rub the brush against a sham. I&#x27;ve cleaned and dried my brushes right before using them to do my makeup regularly. My mac brushes take hours (sometimes days) to dry completely, even if I wipe them against a sham first. Another advantage of the non-porous bristles is that you don&#x27;t have to condition them. After washing animal hair brushes, you are supposed to condition them with an oil or conditioner so they stay soft and don&#x27;t get brittle. If you don&#x27;t, your brushes will start shedding. The RT brushes don&#x27;t need to be conditioned, and they don&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, they are soft. Softer than animal hair. They pick up product and dispense it with ease. Product doesn&#x27;t linger in the brush nearly as much it does on animal hair brushes, which lets me use less product. Truly a pleasure to use and apply makeup with. My one small gripe is that sometimes product can get stuck on the black grip part of these brushes, but that is hardly an issue since it cleans right off. They just might look a bit dirty after rolling around in your makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are so durable and have held up better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever had before. As I said before, I&#x27;ve been using them for two years already and they look and feel the same way they did the day I got them. I&#x27;m sure that they will last for years to come. I would give these to a friend. I would repurchase. Affordable, durable, just a great product. These would be a great gift to anyone that wears makeup. I would recommend these over any other brush on the market. I feel that this is a truly superior product in every way.t, your brushes will start shedding.

            <li> I love the kit except the angled brow/eyeliner brush. It&#x27;s so thick!!!</li>
            <li> i love these brushes.. the shadow brushes blend really well. the bristles are super soft and a good size for average to larger-sized eyes/faces. if you have really small features they may be a tad large for you. i can&#x27;t live without the smudge brush; i use it every day. the eyebrow brush is soft and thicker than your typcial eyebrow brush, it&#x27;s great for filling your eyebrows in quickly but you can&#x27;t make it draw fine lines to resemble hair follicles, so it&#x27;s better for people who just want to fill them in. i&#x27;ve used and washed these a lot and have not experienced shedding or any other problems. i reach for these more often than i do some of my very expensive brushes--these are great quality especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I like the brushes. I don&#x27;t really use the brow brush though. And the eye liner brush had to be replaced cuz the bristles mysteriously disappeared! We couldn&#x27;t find them as if they&#x27;d fallen out, and I couldn&#x27;t see them in he handle. This happened while i was cleaning them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes do work well though.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit, a definitely must-have.  All these brushes are great.  I use them all pretty much daily except for the tapered brow, I have a brush I prefer to that. Oh and I lost the eyeliner brush somehow but I used it a couple times and really liked it.  A great deal on great brushes!</li>
            <li> My Daughter also requested this and she said she loves them,  She has recommended them to me and to her friends</li>
            <li> love these brushes work just as good as MAC if not better !</li>
            <li> Obsessed with these brushes! They work beautifully and the carrying case is a fantastic bonus that will make travel so much easier.</li>
            <li> Out of all the real Technique brushes I own, this set is my least favorite. Let me explain: I really like the first 3 brushes in the set, they&#x27;re very fluffy and dense. They wash well and no dyes came from any of the brushes. They also dry quickly. They&#x27;re great for packing color all over the lid, cutting the crease, and the baby one in the middle is actually perfect for getting eyeshadow right underneath your bottom lashes. The final 2 brushes are the ones I don&#x27;t picture myself using, they remind me of the brushes you get with a huge cheap palette of eyeshadow or something. The &amp;#34;Pixel-Point Eyeliner Brush&amp;#34; is definitely not for eyeliner, the bristles are too long and too soft. You will not have good control using this brush. I&#x27;ve also found the &amp;#34;brow brush&amp;#34; is too big for anything: using it to fill your brows, applying eyeliner to the lashline, lining the lashline.. it&#x27;s just too thick. All in all, I&#x27;d say this is a good set for a beginner but I wasn&#x27;t too impressed. I&#x27;ll be using the eyeshadow brushes more than anything else in the set. However, I do highly recommend the real Techniques face brushes, they are great quality and I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> I love how easily you can apply eye shadow with these brushes! And you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price</li>
            <li> After getting one of this type, bought the set.  Seen at ULTA for more.</li>
            <li> The only eyeshadow/eyebrow set I use.</li>
            <li> i use these brushes every day! first they are awesome quality. with the quality of the brush you would expect a much higher price but these brushes are so so so cheap.</li>
            <li> This is an almost perfect brush set.  I love the case and how it can lock open and stand up.  What I dont like it that if you add anything else to the pack, you cannot close it barely.  I know the velcro is long and allows for it to be a little fatter, but the items can not be that big at all. I recommend this set to others BUT would prefer it myself if the set were completely enclosed in a zippered case, making it easier to carry other things with them. Overall though, GREAT design!  UPDATE 04/2017: I am still using these brushes, still in great condition and they really help with putting my eye-shadows on.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by stating I am in no way a makeup artist, cosmetologist, blah blah. I really have no point of reference for what separates an awesome make up brush from a lame one. I needed new brushed though, and I liked the look of these. I wanted a set that was pretty nice- but I have no intentions of ever dropping a lot of money on super expensive brushes. These ones seem nice though (I&#x27;ll update in a few months on how well they hold up) The handles are a pretty metallic purple and the have rubber tips on the end. The bristles are super soft, I can&#x27;t wait to break them in. The only downside is the case. You have to bend it to make it stand up as pictured..which is kind of cheesy. So I like the brushes (which is why I bought these in the first place) I am going to switch them to a more ascetically pleasing case though.</li>
            <li> All these brushes are amazing for eye makeup application.  The angle brush is sturdy and thick so keep that in mind depending on what you use it for.  The other brushes are good size range and the bristles don&#x27;t shed.  I plan on buying a second one just to add to my collection, but even for the beginner or amateur this is a great set.</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;He makes beautiful makeup&lt;br /&gt;The hair soft and good handle&lt;br /&gt;The bag also&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and also face brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. I bought it as an open box, but the eye makeup brushes are not very good. It seemed like the brushes barely picked up the makeup. I put on 3 coats before something finally showed up on my lid. I tested it on the other eye  with my finger - one swipe and the makeup was there. I was told you needed makeup brushes and the reviews on this product made it seem like a great purchase, but since I used an open box product there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m able to send it back. Also when I went to you the crease brush as a blender for my eye make up - it took off the makeup that took so long to apply in the first place.</li>
            <li> I like most of the brushes in this brush set.  The bristles are soft and the handles are easy to hold onto when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought the face brushes to try them out and I loved them now I bought these to try out and yes they work the brushes are soft but they pick up the shadows wonderfully the angle brush is my favorite it just works great and really shaps my eyebrows love love BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect starter set for me. I am not a makeup but merely someone who is trying to get better in makeup application. These brushes work great with out me having to a spend an arm and leg to get one.</li>
            <li> Love it! real Techniques Starter Set is just perfect! It&#x27;s very easy to use. I recommend this product everyone ;)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the case or the feel of the bristles.  Don&#x27;t feel like they were anything but average.  Feel the reviews are a bit over-rated.  Gave them to my daughter and invested a Sigma set!  It was the right decision for me.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and gentle on my skin (even after constant use!), and are super easy to hold and use. A great quality product that I dare say is better than some of the higher end brushes I&#x27;ve used (Napoleon Perdis, MAC etc). They hold the products really well and apply evenly without dropping fallout everywhere. If you&#x27;re just getting started in makeup, these brushes are an extremely worthwhile investment without burning a hole through your wallet. I have both of the real Techniques kits with the cases, which are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes!! When it comes to brushes I don&#x27;t know much of what I should have  but these brushes are all you basically need! For me, a beginner, they were perfect! They were so easy to use and the hairs don&#x27;t even come off! GREAT QUALITY! Also cleaning them isn&#x27;t as bad as other brushes. Hairs don&#x27;t come off and they clean easily with makeup coming off efficiently. They&#x27;re fun to experiment with and these do a really great job! Plus the mini travel stand is so useful and helpful!! Not to mention I love purpe! I would definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They work so good for eye shadow and eye brow filling.</li>
            <li> Love this set and the price really good</li>
            <li> Swear by these brushes!</li>
            <li> Great set and I like the carrying case because it isn&#x27;t bulky. Works really well and the price is awesome</li>
            <li> Great brush set.The contour brush is my absolute fave! The eyebrow brush is a little big for my brows though</li>
            <li> awesome awesome awesome</li>
            <li> I had bought another set of brushes that I love but needed more eye brushes. This kit fit the bill. These are my first Real Techniques​ brushes and I have to say that I love the quality. They are easy to clean without worrying about getting water beneath the metal part and they&#x27;re purple. I am now eyeing the face set as well as one of the fluffier ones for powder. A girl can never have too many brushes, right?</li>
            <li> 5 stars except for the eye liner brush. But I wouldn&#x27;t take away a star just for that one. Everything else is perfect! Love the slanted brow brush the most!</li>
            <li> I love Real Techniques brushes however I really dont use any of these brushes except for maybe one. Three of them are just way to small.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this set! I am not a professional makeup artist, but I&#x27;ve got some experience. This set is a perfect starter set for everyday use.  They are sturdy and I&#x27;ve not had them fray or fall apart. I feel like they are a good alternative for much more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Great addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup kit - be it professional makeup artist or just the everyday person. These are very high-end brushes, especially for the price! I use these every day and absolutely cannot recommend Real Techniques brushes and products enough.</li>
            <li> I love that these brushes are good quality and look and feel expensive - even though they are not! Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use the case, but it&#x27;s a nice bonus. I am so excited about these brushes!</li>
            <li> So I got the face brushes from ulta just on a whim and i loved them! I realized that there were loads of good reviews online about the brushes. They compare to sigma brushes at half the price! These have been in my collection for a long time now with many washes and they last and don&#x27;t shed at all. The brushes are all soft and have the name for the use on the brush which is awesome for starters. If you don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on brushes these are number one in my book!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. They are soft and smooth and work really well. The price is perfect too. Would buy a second set if I didn&#x27;t have so many already lol</li>
            <li> if you over wash them the bristles will fall out...  other wise great!</li>
            <li> I loveee these brushes they&#x27;re sooooo very soft. They also blend really nicely. The only concern that a person might have with them is that they can be chunky and too big for their eye. But don&#x27;t worry you&#x27;ll get used to the chunkiness and the size just really helps it blend</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice and I would say they&#x27;re worth buying.</li>
            <li> fine brush. perfect for all cosmetic use. i love it. the top brush is very soft but dense. thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, along with her first eye-shadow palette.  This set makes it much simpler for her to to experiment and practice with shades and techniques.</li>
            <li> Nice eye starter set.  Soft brushes are gentle and make blending easy.  I really like the standing case too. I will be buying a few more as gifts.</li>
            <li> ok, so this set....I did not like the liner, eyebrow, or shadow brush...liner a bit too long, shadow to soft...felt like it was flopping around when I put shadow on...and the eyebrow brush felt super soft...not stiff enough for my brows..other than that I loved the other 2 that came with the set.</li>
            <li> I owned a few Real Technique brushes before I purchased these and I have no complaints about any RT products yet.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes. I haven&#x27;t used the liner brush or angled brush a lot, but I love the shadow brushes. The fibers are soft and the brushes are easy to handle. The travel case is a nice touch and does keep the brushes snugly in place within your purse or luggage. I would definitely recommend these to someone looking for an affordable eye brush kit.</li>
            <li> Very Good Brushes For The Right Price!</li>
            <li> Obsessed with these brushes! They are the perfect quality and at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! They are super soft and made very well! The case that comes with it is also very nice! Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Cheap brushes. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning how to apply eye makeup and these tools are helping me progress well! The brushes don&#x27;t shed, and the cut is precise and NOT uneven, so you&#x27;ll get a good amount of product everytime.</li>
            <li> Great products for newbies and make up addicts!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for my niece and she loves them! Great set for eyes...and some could even be used for contour/highlighting. I will say the eyebrow brush is a little big if you have thinner brows and want a very precise line. It works better for filling in fuller brows. RT brushes are great quality and affordable.</li>
            <li> Best make-up brushes I&#x27;ve ever tried. Love the information on the package</li>
            <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
            <li> I really like this set.  They are really soft, they did not shed after washing and applies makeup pretty good.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Just love, love their brushes</li>
            <li> Quality of brushes was great! but i could only use like two of the most fluffy ones. The others i don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> only one brush is useful</li>
            <li> Happy wife, happy life!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the various brush tips in this kit.  I haven&#x27;t had any of the bristles shed and the brushes do a good job of getting the makeup (shadow and liner) in the right places.  I also appreciate the way the cover can be made to stand up so you can easily grab the brush you need.  The instructions that came with the set were informative.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! So soft and they pick up a lot of color. The crease brush is bigger than I expected it to be but it makes blending a breeze. The base shadow brush is also an amazing blending brush. I never expected to find a use for the accent brush, but now I use it to apply color directly to my crease or make a strong V with it and then blend it out. The pointed eyeliner brush is amazing and everyone is saying it&#x27;s too long but it&#x27;s perfect to me, so easy to make wings with my gel liner. The only negative I would have about this set is that the brow brush is a little too big and bulky for me, but for some reason I still use it at times, as it blends amazingly so I never get harsh lines when I use the Anastasia Beverly Hills dipbrow pomade. The case is also very cute and convenient as it has extra slots to put brushes in and I stuck my RT expert face brush in there as well as use it to put my brushes in there and hang it upside down to dry when I clean them.</li>
            <li> Good brushes! Really soft and none of the bristles have come out,I&#x27;m just not crazy about the travel case,but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love, defintiely for anyone who is just starting to use and learn about makeup products..you must buy product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe how inexpensive this set of brushes is.  I love this set &amp; have recently purchased 2 more to give as stocking stuffers to my sisters.  The only brush I don&#x27;t use often is the angled brush as I use a much thinner brush to apply my brow powder.  I use the smallest brush exclusively to apply liquid eyeliner (Make Up For Ever aqua black waterproof eyeshadow is my go to).  I love the accent brush for applying smudgey powder / liner to my lower lash line &amp; also for precise eyeshadow crease application.  It&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two eyeshadow brushes are awesome.  Fluffy, soft &amp; don&#x27;t shed at all!  I don&#x27;t use the case at all - just put the brushes in a container standing up as I have lots of other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you have to try this.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like the different sizes of brushes that you can pick from.</li>
            <li> I love the quality and the softness of these brushes. They came nicely packaged in their little case but most importantly they work great. They don&#x27;t shed either. If you are looking for nice and inexpensive brushes, buy these.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set!!  I don&#x27;t much care for the case they came in, so I tossed that, but for the brushes - they are amazing!!  Now granted, I had only used store-bought brands (like Sonia Kashuk) but these are highly superior to those, and at a great price!  I use all of them in one capacity or another.  Just wish you could buy them separately!</li>
            <li> very nice i like it !</li>
            <li> Eh the carrying case is too bulky for the number of brushes it holds and the brushes are ok.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really delightful. This is my second or third set and I&#x27;m still using all of them.</li>
            <li> These are amazing, it was what I wanted</li>
            <li> I honestly bought this on impulse because I didn&#x27;t really need this brush set, but I bought it anyway mostly because of how badly I wanted the deluxe crease brush, and just partly because I know I&#x27;d use the rest of the brushes every now &amp; then anyway. If only Real Techniques would sell the deluxe crease brush on its own, I&#x27;d definitely get myself another one. I mainly use it to blend my under-eye concealer and to cover up some small blemishes, and it does the job seamlessly. I also love how soft these brushes&#x27; bristles are--they don&#x27;t feel prickly whatsoever on my lids (a peeve I have with other brands), and they pick up and distribute product very well. The quality of these brushes is amazing and you just can&#x27;t beat the price. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This was a stocking stuffer for my daughter for Christmas.  She enjoys using it, and was very happy because it was part of her AMAZON wish list items.</li>
            <li> Bought these brushes and don&#x27;t regret doing so at all. Everything I expected them to be and a lot more!</li>
            <li> this is amaizing in every way love it perfect i went back and bought another one because i loved it so</li>
            <li> Just received these today ! I can already tell that they are good . I just finished washing them and no shedding . I ordered Friday and today is Monday . I plan on using them tonight before i step out . Real Techniques &amp;#34; core collection &amp;#34; are my babies ! I just know these will be too . Excellent product . I recommend them to MUAs just beginning or pro . You will not be disappointed .</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous line of brushes by Makeup Artist Samantha Chapman in England. The bristles are soft, easy to clean and have minimal shedding. The handles fit nicely in the hand and are easy to use. She and her sister Nicola have some of the best makeup videos on You Tube so it&#x27;s great for beginners in makeup application as well. I have a set of my own and like them so much, I got a set for my sister ....her favorite color is purple so the purple handle color was a bonus. Love them!</li>
            <li> So soft.  The angled brush works amazing with eyeliner or shadows.  Love them - great travel case too.  Well priced.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes amazing qaulity</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on perfect on time! I definitely would buy this again and recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> Easy to use for the eyes. Buying some for my besties!!</li>
            <li> This set is pretty great for just the crease brush and the base shadow brush. I don&#x27;t really like the remainder of the brushes as much but I would buy this again for those two brushes alone</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, great quality, amazing brushes, well worth the money, love love love</li>
            <li> They have the best brushes and are awesomely inexpensive. I have other brushed by them that work great also. Very soft and seem worth it.</li>
            <li> I just got this set in today and it&#x27;s excellent! It has just about every brush you could want for your eyes - the only thing I can think of that would really improve it would be the inclusion of a spoolie for working on your eyebrows. The only one I can&#x27;t see myself getting very much use out of is the very thin &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; brush, since I don&#x27;t really use gel or cream eyeliner. I have found the angled brush to be perfect for both brows and, if using the thinner part of the brush, eye liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are very soft and don&#x27;t have a cheap or plastic feeling to them at all. The case they come in turned out to be handier than I had imagined and I&#x27;m glad that I have it. I washed them and didn&#x27;t lose any hairs. I will update if the set turns out to not be long-lived, but the quality feels really solid.</li>
            <li> These babies rock! they are soft, good quality and work like they should! I would say you get what you pay for, but these are so inexpensive, that you&#x27;re defiantly getting a great deal!</li>
            <li> Use these everyday and have been for the last year. They are amazing.</li>
            <li> Very good quality make-up brushes. I just had to buy an extra one to have all I need for eye make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive brushes and inexpensive ones and this set is definitely high-quality. I love the feel of the bristles and would really recommend it to anyone looking for new makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> This starter set is one of the best sets . I recommend every one to buy from them :)  thank you</li>
            <li> All brushes has very soft bristles &amp; has no problem in picking up products...except pixel- point brushes which havent discovered how to use as brush quite big for liner brush....but With the amount paid &amp; get 5 brushes, its worth it!</li>
            <li> The Real Techniques are the best ( reasonably priced) range around.  Got these eye make up brushes for my 18 year old daughter and she is really happy with them.</li>
            <li> These are very nice quality for the price. I was looking for some eye shadow brushes but didn&#x27;t want to break the bank or get yukky ones that fell apart. These are just perfect! I use them every day and would recommend to anyone! Ginger/Chicago    PS. They come with the holder/stand! nice touch! easy to store.</li>
            <li> Has all the brushes needed for day to day use in a handy case.  Professional quality. I highly recommend this brush set!</li>
            <li> This is great starting set because it includes everything you would need to buy separately.  They are all high quality items individually, and the set just makes it that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the traveling kit is cool and stylish.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. The quality is very nice. I thought the little thin brush for liner was going to be too think for eyeliner application but it works well for it. It&#x27;s pretty thin so it works. I love these brushes it s a must have ladies.</li>
            <li> Like others, I heard about these brushes on YouTube and in the never ending search of the perfect brushes I asked for them for by bday. My husband purchased these for me and while I&#x27;ve only been using them for a week, I like them a lot. My only complaint is the case. Since the brushes have a sort of grip at the end, these are hard to get in and out of the elastic bands that hold the brushes in place. I simply put them in another brush case I had and threw away the one it came with. Other than that I&#x27;m happy with these. They are soft and a nice weight and don&#x27;t feel cheap like a lot of other brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> Although they are made of artificial hairs they look like original soft ones. Very good price compared to ones having original hairs. I rated them 4 stars not 5 as hairs sometimes fall down while washing them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush set at Ulta probably six months ago and in all honesty, I use at least one of these brushes every single time I put on makeup (5-6 times per week).  The brushes are great quality.  The bristles are super soft and they&#x27;re synthetic so they don&#x27;t soak up products and are especially great at applying any creamy products (cream eye shadows, concealer, etc).  I wash mine 2-3 times per week and they don&#x27;t shed at all and have kept their shapes beautifully.  I find the base shadow and the crease brushes to be absolutely essential to my cosmetics routine.  The base shadow brush is similar to the MAC 217, but slightly smaller, which I love.  It is so useful!  And while I rarely use the crease brush on my crease, I use it all the time as well.  I use the crease brush to apply/blend cream products.  I use it on cream eyeshadows, cream eye bases, eye primers, concealers, etc.  I use the accent brush less often, but it is great for any type of detailed application.  When I do need and angled brush, I prefer the Real Techniques brush to far more expensive brushes from MAC and Sephora.  The pixel point brush is one that I use very rarely only because I use eye liners with built in applicators, but again, if you needed a precision brush, it would do nicely.  All in all, these brushes are a GREAT deal.  A single MAC brush would cost more than all 5 of these brushes and in my experience, not hold up as well.  I love these brushes and I really wish Amazon would restock this line so I could purchase some more brushes.</li>
            <li> Except for the accent brush, I&#x27;ve used everything in this set and it helped me improve on doing my eye make up.</li>
            <li> Great value.  I find the brushes are solid and pretty versatile. It&#x27;s an economical way to figure out what your preference brushes are. Clean after every use and they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes!  They  make the blending easy!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and I love my brushes. They are a bit smaller in person, but they&#x27;re perfect for your eyes. The case is also great and durable Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes for the price, def worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more and the are really soft. Worth it</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a gift for a friend. She had no complaints and loved the tutorials! The quality if it is great!</li>
            <li> Good brush set for the eyes. If you like to blend eye shadows like I do, this has every brush you could need.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars only because the crease brush is a little big and it doesn&#x27;t come with an eyebrow brush/comb.&lt;br /&gt;The case that accompanies the brush set is like a little free gift. I don&#x27;t really use it too much but I don&#x27;t travel much either. I think overall the set is great though.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques makes great quality brushes, I use them every day in my make-up routine. I would recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft, and this is a perfect starter kit for someone just beginning to play around with eyeshadow. I use all of the different shapes (I didn&#x27;t think I would), and find the case quite useful (also a surprise). I keep my eyelid primer and mascara under the elastic on the other side of the case, and it keeps everything organized and compact. So far, none of the brushes have shed any hairs.</li>
            <li> As a general rule I LOVE real Technique brushes.  By far the best brushes that I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried some expensive ones.  The eye ones are just barely missing the mark though.  Let me be clear, I do not have small eyelids or brow bones...plenty of canvas to go around, if you will.  But dang, the big brushes are TOO BIG.  I can hardly get anything done with them at all.  And the small ones are tiny! I&#x27;ve watched the videos and read on the real Techniques site, so I know what to do with each one, but they are just not hitting it for me.  I reverted back to my Mary Kay/Clinique eye brushes because they are easier for me to use.  I bust these out every few days to try again, but I&#x27;m not getting more satisfied.  Oh well, still love this brand.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetics professional and absolutely love the Real Techniques brushes. They are a really nice quality, especially for the price. They hold up well after washing, fit comfortably in your hand, and do a great job of applying! Make sure you check out the pixiwoo video tutorials on youtube... definitely an added bonus from the creators of Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> When I read these real technique brushes were Mac quality, I said to myself I have to try them, they are great, I love them more than my sigma ones.</li>
            <li> These are my absolute favorite brushes of all time. This particular set. These are the brushes I use every single time I do my makeup, above all others. I use the angled brush to shape and fill in my eyebrows, I use the pointed liner brush for my cream and gel eyeliners, I have several other similar brushes and I always come back to these two in particular. The smaller eyeshadow brush is my favorite for doing the crease and using matte dark eyeshadow along the lash line. The medium eyeshadow brush is perfect for doing eyeshadow, and the larger for blending. This set is absolutely priceless, I have been using them about a year and I still use them above the others. They are still in great shape, the only one that looks a bit messed up is the angled brush and it still works just fine for my eyebrows. When this set wears out I&#x27;m going to re-purchase this exact set again. You won&#x27;t regret buying these brushes!</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeddd thesseeeee! Awesome quality!!! Might get the others from this brand.</li>
            <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li> Those makeup brushes are amazing, I&#x27;m in love with them. Perfect finish, definitely usefull. Perfect for a amateur makeup artist and a pro too. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Very soft, impressed with these brushes.</li>
            <li> My daughter raves about these brushes.</li>
            <li> I got them in really nice deal and they are so good!!</li>
            <li> Love my new brushes! Very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this brushes</li>
            <li> very good product, exactly what I ordered, fast shipping, loved my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! then are affordable and really good quality for the price. I Love them so very much</li>
            <li> I like a lot real techniques brushes . but this collection were not good enough for me ,It&#x27;s contains 5 brushes but were not all useful to me , brow brush is thick for my eyebrows shaped and also the fine liner brush make draw the liner difficult and not beautiful , other than that they are excellent of quality and smoothness.</li>
            <li> this set as expected, i saw it on YouTube, and i received what i wanted. Very recommend this set to all.</li>
            <li> Love love this set they are very convenient,, specially the dome shaped brush i like using it for under eye or blemish concealing</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brush sets! The only problem I had was the eyeliner brush broke on me. It was such a good brush. The bristles came out when I washed it. I used it maybe 4 times.</li>
            <li> This brushes are great but I don&#x27;t think it has a good eye lid brush the eye brow brush is amazing so is the eye liner brush all in all its a good brush set</li>
            <li> Perfect brushes.  I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> really not expensive and it works really good. I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good product at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> good set... i just wish they included a spooly.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush set for the price</li>
            <li> I think they are good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy about this brush set. I wish I knew about this brand earlier. Awesome awesome brushes! I will be getting the foundation brush soon!</li>
            <li> very good for traveling and the brushes work well</li>
            <li> Who would have known that you could get such great brushes for so cheap?! In the past brushes this cheap were either really hard and not soft, and they would shed like crazy. real techniques has totally changed my view on buying only expensive brushes!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best!  They are soft AND they do the job.  Perfectly designed for the face and the needs of properly applying make up.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> its not a great set but two or three brushes are ok.</li>
            <li> This brush set at first seemed lacking. But, as I began to work with them, I found that each brush has many possible (and often surprising) uses. Each brush is dense, gentle on delicate skin, and so easy to clean. They have quickly become favorites among my extensive (and expensive) brush collection. As a MUA, I am not averse to spending $30+ on one brush in this size range. These are surprisingly fantastic brushes for less than the cost of a single brush. I plan on purchasing a few more sets to use on jobs.</li>
            <li> UPDATE, UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these brushes.  I have found that the quality is not as good as I originally thought.  I dropped one and stepped on it and it smashed completely.  Apparently the handles are cheap, hollow aluminum (or some kind of thin, flexible metal).  I usually do take very good care of my things but I didn&#x27;t know that the brush had fallen on the carpet so I did step on it.  I had to throw it away.  I would prefer a brush with a handle that is made from wood or at the very least is solid.  I love the Pixiwoo sisters but I do not recommend these brushes anymore.  For inexpensive brushes I recommend ECOTOOLS.  They are made by the same company but they have solid bamboo handles.  They are much sturdier.  For VERY good brushes, go with SIGMA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left my original review below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I bought these brushes because I was a fan of the Pixiwoo channel on Youtube.  I really love these brushes.  They are very similar in quality to the Ecotools brand (both are made by Paris Presents).  The bristles are soft.  I like all the brushes except the eyeliner brush.  I wish this set came with the FINE eyeliner brush.  Even applying thick eyeliner was sort of difficult for me with this brush.  I understand that part of if is my lack of skills, but I did watch the tutorial.  I think people are more likely to want a fine brush because with a fine brush you can go thick or thin.  I ended up buying the fine liner brush separately for an additional $6.  Also, the writing on the brushes isn&#x27;t as good as the Ecotools brand.  These are new brushes and I can already see where the letters are coming off.  It&#x27;s really not a big deal, but I would prefer the letters to be engraved so that they do not rub off.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> these brushes really did not like the texture of your hair is synthetic hard you can not put an eyeshadow it does not like me wanted them back but forget to return them for my work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok brush set. I suppose you get what you pay for, so it&#x27;s reasonable good enough for what you pay. I liked the face brushes, not the eye ones. Will not repurchase the eye set. The first  brush in the set is too dense to apply powder make-up with, so I use it for concealer and the slanted brush and eyeliner are horrible :s The others are ok...</li>
            <li> I bought this set because of the deluxe crease brush. Its an amazing and dense brush to use for the under eye area or spot concealing blemishes with my full coverage foundation/concealer. It also comes with a brush case which is good for travelling! I have used better brow brushes though...</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Great quality for a great price. I will be purchasing more brushes from them soon.</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are just O.K., and the blenders were a definite let down.  I have purchased better for less here on Amazon.  Although the blenders were not up to my expectations, the rest of the brushes weren&#x27;t to bad and all of them had good quality handles and are good for a little makeup bag on the go.  I am kind of in the air as to whether I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I love all the brushes but the ones meant for eyeshadow, that is the first 2 just poke my eyes too much. The fat crease brush I am definitely unable to use for crease at all... it is too big and spreads out product too much. It may be good for concealer or something else though. the other ones are amazing. Work very well and are durable.</li>
            <li> Amazon accidently sent me two and charged me. That was their mistake, but the brushes are great.</li>
            <li> Really good brushes, very soft. Work super well with both liquid and dry products which is what I love the most, but unfortunately the labeling rubbed off just after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I saw many people recommend those brushes, and now I see why, they a really good, and cheap!</li>
            <li> The base eyeshadow is too loose and doesn&#x27;t pick up the right amount of powder product, (which is what I use). The crease brush (smallest rounded head) works alright, but my Revlon smokey eye duo brush works a lot better and was way cheaper than this brush. But I do like that they&#x27;re EXTREMELY soft, and the largest brush is like a mini stippling brush almost.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect to create a smokey eye and actually any kind of eye make up.&lt;br /&gt;It has all the essentials you need for a professional finish</li>
            <li> very soft and great application; I use all of them and they are very good.  I have washed them once and no shedding so far.  good value</li>
            <li> i like tis product ,i reseve it on time&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it to my frinds&lt;br /&gt;i use it every day</li>
            <li> I like the set because its easy to get the looks I want. Most of the other sets I was looking into had too many brushes. I love the case they come in that has a toggle to stand them upright. The only thing that was a problem was the toggle on mine. The knots wouldn&#x27;t hold (easy fix).</li>
            <li> the brushes in this set are really nice&lt;br /&gt;and its well worth the price&lt;br /&gt;the base shadow brush is great for concealer&lt;br /&gt;if your on a budget its a nice set</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product because I have been watching Sam Chapman´s Pixiwoo videos for a while and she seems to really know her stuff. I was not disappointed! These brushes are so soft on the skin, really good pick up of product, precise application and they don´t seem to pick up humidity as much as natural bristle ones. I love the eyeliner brush, it gives really good control for gel liner. They´re all great and versatile. I will be getting the rest of the collection for sure.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome! I don&#x27;t use the little holder that it comes with since I have other brushes to carry around and use. The fluffy brush is excellent for blending out shadows and the crease brush worked its wonders as well. I bought a few extra as Christmas gifts and the recipients loved them as well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased good price</li>
            <li> I LOVE this set.i use that crease brush to apply eyeshadow, crease, everything. I lobe it</li>
            <li> Everyday makeup essentials . Like the eye shadow brushes the most.</li>
            <li> Case is super cheap. I love the brushes they are very soft and thick very nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a very excellent product it is asmal pic can you take any waer and it is esye take</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much I bought two sets. The brushes are so soft and give me a more professional look when used. Works great. I would recommend to anyone looking for some good brushes.</li>
            <li> I am going to be one of the few people who say that they did not love this set. My biggest problem with these brushes are the size. The base shadow brush is more appropriate as a blending brush and the deluxe crease brush is better off as an under eye concealer brush. The deluxe cream brush is much too big (for my eyes at least) to deposit color cleanly in the crease without making a big mess of the edges because the brush is not tapered at all. If you look at the Real Technique tutorials, the deluxe crease brush is often used as a concealer brush by both the ladies of Pixiwoo. The eyeliner brush is a bit thick but the eyebrow brush is okay if you have thicker brows because it is much thicker than any angled eyeliner brush. I kept the set but I have bought other brushes from the core collection and prefer the utility of them more.</li>
            <li> I needed some new brushes that would hold up better and give me a better finish/application. I am not afraid to wash these since ether do hold up better than all of my other brands of brushes ( however I am still careful and conscious when I wash them.) I wash them weekly to some times every few days ( depends on the brushes I use and their how often they are used)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The board that comes with the brushes is stupid. It is hard to put the brushes in and out of the elastic. It is clumsy and just overall a pain. I keep my brushes in a jar instead.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine not having these in my makeup drawer!  I&#x27;m so glad I got these as well as the rest of the collection!</li>
            <li> This set is great! The brushes are very soft, and they pick up a good amount of powder (you can tell cause when you start, they&#x27;re white, which is handy if you wash the bristles between every use to make sure they won&#x27;t carry over between applications). Blending is very easy to do. Good quality handles (this might seem like a weird comment, but I&#x27;ve bought brushes where the handle literally falls apart while I use it).</li>
            <li> These brushes are far too big for eye makeup application.  When I first saw the liner brush I thought it was a ridiculous joke to even consider using for eye lining, unless a big fat line that covers your entire lid is the look you are going for. Sam does a tutorial at the real techniques site using all of the brushes and they look slightly smaller than what you actually get.  I also noticed that this is the only tutorial where she uses the liner and brow brushes from this set.  In other tutorials she uses different brushes, so they must already know these brushes aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very good and soft for the price. My fav is the crease brush and the eyebrow brush. :)</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!! So soft and easy to use, and great, even results. Expansion to the collection.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash as well.</li>
            <li> Got the softness and quality I would expect from Real Techniques brushes!  I saw a complaint that the brushes were too big...I don&#x27;t have that complaint...you have to learn how to apply make up properly and you don&#x27;t have to load the entire brush with product.  The angle brush is PERFECT for using on eye brows and the eye liner brush is great for giving you that soft line with gel liner.  The larger shadow brush you can also use for concealing.  Great set.  I recommend this set with the core collection set.  Love that the case doubles as a stand.  GENIUS design!</li>
            <li> I love samantha chapman and her brushes are a great reflection of hard work she puts into her followers. good price and great quality</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, precise, inexpensive, and are more than enough to do a full eye look. If you&#x27;re looking for inexpensive brushes that aren&#x27;t low in quality, I&#x27;d get these. The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t really have a good sized general lid brush for packing on color. While you can do it with one of the blendy-er brushes, I just think a flat shader would have been a good addition.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a few weeks now and they havent disappointed me. I have used lots of different brushes, including high-end ones. The Real Techniques brushes offer the same quality at a fraction of the price. I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Nice design. Can be used for many purposes other than applying eyeshadow. Very soft and the brush is light. Very easy to clean. Delivery was faster than expected as I live very far from US. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love the online instructional video.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I like them, it is good.</li>
            <li> Second purchase.. Love these rushes</li>
            <li> I have tons of makeup brushes from sigma to bobbi brown to saphora but I always seem to use these the most . Easy to clean and work wonders . I highly recommend RT</li>
            <li> high quality brushes, very nice colour too</li>
            <li> SO WORTH THE MONEY THEY ARE AMAZING! I LOVE THEM! I PURCHASED BRUSHES BEFORE. AND THEY ARE JUST AMAZING BRUSHES</li>
            <li> I recently needed to upgrade my make up brushes.  Seeing several Utube videos raving about this brush line, I decided to give them a try. I ordered this brush and several other of the real Techniques brushes and really love them.  They are soft and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> For the that i paid the starter set is perfect. Im surprised how soft they are. I recommend them</li>
            <li> Soft brushes for little money. Not made of animal hair, nevertheless of good quality. It&#x27;s a great set for starters, but pros will love them too. This set is for the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a part-time makeup artist and always looking for great brushes at a decent price. These are superb. I&#x27;ve been ranting about them since the day I got them, and will continue to buy RealTechniques brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> I love every one of these brushes and I have almost all of them! They clean up great and are so easy to use!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and wash well. I haven&#x27;t had any fall out. These are really good for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price, these are fantastic little brushes: soft, do not shed at all, do not absorb too much product, and easy to clean with a brush cleaner. I use them all the time and I have higher end brushes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the stand much though, it&#x27;s nice for when you travel but I wouldn&#x27;t keep it on my desk for daily use as the elastic is pretty tight and it&#x27;s not super convenient to keep sliding them in and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have their face stipling brush (it&#x27;s a brush for applying gel or liquid blush and foundation) and love it so much. I will buy more from the same brand!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the brush that came with the Naked 2 palette and finally decided to pick these up. They are very soft brushes, and I do not feel that they are too big for the intended purposes as some others have stated. A great value, I would recommend to others looking for a quality eye brush set at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very good one. I got this brushes for my wife and she liked it very much and told me that it&#x27;s very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is valuable for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest it.</li>
            <li> The best ever tried, you should buy them, very good. They don&#x27;t lose hair, very easy to clean. Very useful.</li>
            <li> I give 5 start cause it works for me.. definitely better than the elf brushes I was using.. I rather save the bucks and put it toward this brushes.I will definitely be buying another pack of this soon for extra brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set with the realTechniques Lash/Brow Groomer and the Core Collection and I love them all! The handles are bright and colorful in my makeup bag which makes them easy to find. The brushes are soft and pick-up color nicely. Great brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old and have never owned any make up brushes except my blush brush. To be honest, I dont even know what prompted me to want any in the first place. I think it was mostly I was sick of the sponge aplicatior coming off all the time. I couldnt be more happy with these. I got them because the price was good and they come in a case so there not just floating around my make up bag. Not only did it cut my time in front of the mirror down by almost 10 min, but my make up looks so much better. You just cant get the same blending effect with the little sponge aplicatior that you can with a brush. I dont use the little one ment for liner because my gel liner brush is very good and I use the brow brush for my under eye concerler - works great! If your looking for a good kit of brushes at a good price, this one is great. My make up looks so much better that I had a co-worker ask me if I took lessions!! I didnt change my make up colors or brands, just the way I put it on.</li>
            <li> These are better than any of my high end brushes. After I used these I felt so mad that I literally spent hundreds of dollars o brushes and I prefer to use these that are so inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The domed brush has cut my makeup time down by 10-15 minutes. I wish they sold this seperately,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner brush is the most amazing eyeliner brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I wish they sold this seperately as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrowbrush is really good and easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the other two brushes I really have no use for but the set was still worth every penny.</li>
            <li> she loves it, if they must wear it at least this keeps things tidy and sanitary and organized. worth the investment, seem to be washable.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. They are soft, have great color payoff, and haven&#x27;t shed. They area great price compared to other brands and the angled brush is great for filling in my eyebrows! This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> these brushes are easy to clean. holds the product well. so far they are holding up really well. love this</li>
            <li> I was in the search of a set like this for my eyes, I&#x27;m not a makeup pro so I wouldn&#x27;t want to waste a lot of money on brushes. There are great quality, size and work excellent! better than expected!</li>
            <li> I love all of the real Techniques brushes. They are very soft and do no irritate my sensitive skin. They apply make-up perfectly! I highly recommend this brand for brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are very versatile, I use them for eye shadow, contouring my face, highlighting my face,  setting powder under my eyes, eyeliner, eyebrows, just everything! Love love love these brushes, now I just wanna collect them all lol. They are also soooo soft!</li>
            <li> Very good brushes! The big ones are great to apply concealer and eyeshadow. Real Techniques products are all very good and have never let me down! All the products I have purchased were amazing and for a little price!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, they work as good as my mac brushes do.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, worth the money! The are definitely the real deal</li>
            <li> Love these brushes yes they are real and not fact incase anyone was wondering.</li>
            <li> nothing extraordinary.. a case with brushes. actually the case arrived broken, not a big deal since it was the plastic one though I wonder if it could have damaged the product itself.</li>
            <li> i use these almost every day for my make up. they are so soft. the only thing is that i was surprised on the size of the brushes they are pretty smal compared to others. but other than that very nice quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to eye shadow, and always thought that it would be complicated to use brushes for the application, but these are so easy to use and my shadow looks amazing. They are soft, don&#x27;t shed, and the case they come with is useful for storage. Only downside was that I paid around $14 for the set here on amazon and then saw it in walmart for $10..which isn&#x27;t a big difference but still.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! I love these brushes! I also love how they come in the holder which also turns into stand for them!!!! I recommend to everybody!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! I was so glad to see these selling on Amazon for an affordable price! I already had some of the face brushes from Real Techniques but I just had to try these out! I really love the blending eye shadow brushes and that fine liner brush! They are amazing quality and hold up really well. No brush bristles falling out and no problems or complaints from me! The stand is also quite handy and helpful if you plan to travel with it. Overall an amazing kit, its affordable, works great what more could you want?</li>
            <li> I cant attest totally to the performance of these brushes because I don&#x27;t have alot to compare them to. This is my first legit set of eye brushes and I bought these because of the great reviews and low price. I do feel as though these brushes allow me to get better looks from my makeup and I am very glad I brought these brushes. They do their job perfectly and I look forward to expanding my RT collection.</li>
            <li> The best brushes EVER!!! I Use daily!!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They are exactly as described.  I don&#x27;t know how I did without these professional brushes before.  Makes applying make-up a breeze.</li>
            <li> Not sure but my Mom liked it!!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> It came in a nicely packaged box, brand new,great price.</li>
            <li> These have been great. they came really quick I was very excited to try them and have been so impressed by them. the come in a nice case so its easy storage and they fill so soft on my eyes. I have some other brushes but I think I am going to change all my brushes out to this brand. and they are really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have been dying to buy these brushes and am not disappointed whatsoever. They were in the original packaging, never been opened, and packaged securely! So happy to have these in my brush collection!</li>
            <li> Love these awesome brushes! :)</li>
            <li> These are some of favorite brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased. They are incredibly soft and are just perfect for each of the tasks at hand. My personal favorites are the angled brush and the deluxe crease brush. The others are fantastic, but I find those two stand out. I personally found the eyeliner brush a bit wide for my taste, but it&#x27;s good for other things. All in all, a fantastic purchase. Can&#x27;t wait to complete my collection with some more of Samantha&#x27;s brushes.</li>
            <li> love these brushes, I use them every single day and they make my eye shadow go on flawlessly. they are nice and softly textured and dont feel rough or sharp. They feel like soft bristle feathers really and make it so easy to apply flawlessly.</li>
            <li> These brushes along with the larger real Techniques foundation brush live up to the positive reviews preceding mine. I think they are a good value.</li>
            <li> Loving these! So soft, blends out any eyeshadow with ease.</li>
            <li> These brushes blend makeup effortlessly.  Great quality for the price.  I have washed them several times thus far without any of the hairs falling out.</li>
            <li> These type of brushes need to pick up product well, be soft and effective on the sensitive eye area, and wear well (wash up nice, and not shed). These brushes score well across the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base shadow, deluxe crease and the accent brush are worth buying the set for alone. These  brushes work well for applying cream shadows as well as powder. The base shadow brush works especially well for concealer under the eye. The deluxe crease brush applies and blends shadow very well. The accent brush works well around the tear duct area or the cupid&#x27;s bow (&#x27;dip&#x27; just above your upper lip.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own nearly 100 brushes, and these are used regulary by me. They are a great deal, and perform better than brushes costing much more. I hope soon to add another set to my collection.</li>
            <li> These brushes give me life</li>
            <li> My daughter picked this out for its well known quality</li>
            <li> I have a house full of daughters.  We had MAC in the past but they cost a ton and are no better.  I tried Sigma and they are excellent as well but tend to come in larger sets.  These are excellent.  Got them for my daughter who doesn&#x27;t use a ton of makeup and doesn&#x27;t want every brush shape available, but needed the essential brushes.  Absolutely no problems at all, very soft, do a great job, no loose bristles, big ones will stand up on end on the counter.  Excellent buy for the $$$.</li>
            <li> I could not, for the love of all good things, do a good job applying eye shadow. I had no idea what to do. Even after watching tutorials on YouTube, my work did not look as good, at all. That was until I got these brushes!!! I went to watch the video on how to use the brushes (I was scared because they look too big) and it was easy, fast and look so professional. I was really pleased. The crease brush looks very big but if you use it as intended it works wonderfully. I recommend to watch the video on how to use the brushes. It seems like some people did not know what to do with them  (the bad reviews), neither did I when I first got them. Now I am being asked by my friends to do their makeup on special events because they want that professional finish look. With these brushes I can do my eyes in like 5 minutes, and they look fantastic and natural. (You must do the eyes first, like with any set of brushes, and then the foundation, in case you have to clean excess off your cheeks) I did not have any of the problems other people mentioned, except for the old eyeliner which was indeed too thick, unless you are going for a dramatic look, but it looks like they change it for the fine eyeliner to please the customers. Nice! :)&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do recommend these brushes even for beginners (just like me), but make sure you watch the instructional video. The video is quick and easy to understand, and it is easy to find on YouTube too. The price is very good for what you can accomplish with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes for a good price</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes!!!  I read some of the reviews on here right before purchasing and almost talked myself out of it...I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t!  I love the Pixiwoo YouTube channel with the makers&#x27; videos, where they DO use these brushes along with other brands, and I have been incredibly happy with them.  The brow brush alone cut my time on eye makeup down.  I highly recommend these.  I also use MAC and IT cosmetic brushes, but these are, honestly, better.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for these brushes to be as amazing as the face brush, but was sorely disappointed. They barely pick up color and are rubbish at blending. The \\&quot;liner\\&quot; brushes are far too big for eye liner and made a mess and I&#x27;m pretty fantastic at liner. I use the biggest brush for concealer, and pretty much don&#x27;t use the others. They are nicely made and dense, they just don&#x27;t work very well for their intended purposes.</li>
            <li> I really like all the brushes. I do not have an issue with shedding when I wash them. They are good for the price, and just good period. I could see these going for double the price. I have more fun putting on make-up now that I have better \\&quot;tools\\&quot;. If you are still in the consideration phase, don&#x27;t be, go for it.</li>
            <li> These set of brushes are great!  Professional quality. Works well with picking up eye shadow! This is absolutely &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! They are soft with a great price tag! I&#x27;ve bought brushes for $60 prior and hated them because they would shed all over however these brushes don&#x27;t shed and applies makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  I will probably purchase these for myself when my current set of MAC brushes are replaced.</li>
            <li> I use one of these everyday. They are the best, never shedding, bleeding, or losing their shape. Everyone should have a set.</li>
            <li> The smoothness of these brushes is amazing. Long live taklon!&lt;br /&gt;Even though the liner one seems quite large, I have been using all of them for slightly different purposes. I actually don&#x27;t like putting on eye makeup when I feel small stings from shadow brushes, so these are simply smooth and I dare say more feathery-er than a feather!&lt;br /&gt;The handles, the multi functional case where you can add even more brushes on the other side, everything is lovely and very well thought!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Samantha Chapman! and all who worked on making this a high quality not expensive well thought product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy 3 more just to have enough for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li> I found out about Real Techniques Brushes from Sam Chapman, who posts as Pixiwoo on youtube.  Her demonstration and other positive reviews about this product, made me decide to purchase it.  I think these Taklon synthetic brushes are amazing. I have found synthetic brushes to be irritating and uncomfortable for use in the eye area.  But these brushes are soft and gentle.  The deluxe crease brush and the base shadow brush are my two favorites. They are both versatile with many uses.  I like the deluxe crease brush to apply concealer. It gives a beautiful finish.  It can also be used to apply eyeshadow in the crease. I also use the base eyeshadow brush to pack on color on the lid and blend.  The tiny smudger brush can be used to highlight the inner corner of the eyes or to smudge eyeliner for a smoky effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative is that these brushes are only sold in a set. I really wanted just the deluxe crease brush and the base eyeshadow brush individually.  I haven&#x27;t used the gel eyeliner brush and the brow brush isn&#x27;t as good quality as the others in this set.  The only problem I had was when the deluxe crease brush hairs separated from the brush itself. I don&#x27;t know why that happened. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with any of the other Real Techniques brushes I have purchased. The packaging isn&#x27;t great, but works well for travel purposes. I also purchased the Expert Face Brush and the Core Collection set. I love these brushes! If you are looking for great quality synthetic brushes that will get the job done for a reasonable price, this is for you.</li>
            <li> The brushes are perfect for a starter kit. I don&#x27;t use them as noted by the company but they&#x27;re perfect for everyday eye looks!</li>
            <li> The brushes picks up a lot of shadow, however it doesn&#x27;t apply it well to the lid. As a result, a lot of product gets wasted. Not a good quality brush set.</li>
            <li> OMG these brushes are so soft and perform their jobs like a pro!!!! Would have given a better review if some of the brushes weren&#x27;t all scratched up right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The quality matches the price - still appreciate the promotion!</li>
            <li> No brush fallout soft beautiful brushes. Product goes on easily with no waste.</li>
            <li> Soft and good quality</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes at a fraction of the cost. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great little brush set!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques brushes are just awesome!  They are soft, and full.  They blend well.  I&#x27;ve found uses for some I thought i&#x27;d never use. I highly suggest getting these</li>
            <li> Love all of real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> i love to buy make brush sets (mac, laura mercel, mally ect).  funny thing is that I dont have one complete make up set.  i manage to lose a brushs here and there.  Ive seen and read the reviews on these brushes on youtube and amazon.  And my verdict is.....&lt;br /&gt;Theses brushes are pretty awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;the brushes are super soft and applies just as good as make up brushes cost 5x&#x27;s as much as this one.&lt;br /&gt;the one main difference i noticed was that my mally brushes (that look similarly to these carry a bit more weight in my hand.) these feels like the stick part of these brushes are hallo.&lt;br /&gt;but what ever for the price and brush quality why not, i plan to buy face set next.</li>
            <li> Really good brushes from Sam Champan of Pixiwoo on YouTube. I wish it came with two shading/blending brushes though as you really need more than one to create a smoky eye.</li>
            <li> These brushes were fine for what I needed them for and the carry well in my purse.</li>
            <li> Love this brush set!!</li>
            <li> I always used the cheap brushes that came with the cheap makeup. But I went out on a limb and bought some pricy eye shadow and this set of nice starter brushes to go with it. I use all of my brushes every morning. Its amazing what a difference a set of good brushes will make. There is a video online that shows you how to use each brush too!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Budget friendly with professional results. Came in fast to!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who has never used brushes in her makeup application. When they arrived, I got seriously jealous and bought some single brushes from Real Techniques for my own set.  These are of great quality.  They are soft, do not shed, and blend beautifully.  She better love these or I&#x27;m renditioning them back to my collection!</li>
            <li> I love the base shadow brush so much. I mainly use it for concealer. I also love the deluxe crease brush. It&#x27;s better than MAC 217 because I have average lid space and this applies and blends my crease color perfectly. I have a full review of this set here: [...]</li>
            <li> These make up brushes are AMAZING.. You cant beat the price.. I have almost all the Real Techniques brushes.. Will be buying all the ones I dont already have..</li>
            <li> I use these daily and have bought other brushes by the brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am impressed with such a good quality, very lightweight and much softer then my Mac and Makeupforever  make up brushes !!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! They are a great introductory set to eyes and super soft!</li>
            <li> if you love make up and are awiz at applying and if you are looking for brushes that are high qaulity without breaking the bank well start buying this brand...they have tons and are at a great vlaue price....these brushes can be compared to Sigma and MAC brushes they hold the color in the bristles and they are very smooth and durable for cleaning them....I have a few different sets love them!</li>
            <li> The bristles of these brushes have just the right springiness. The variety of bristle trims are just the right size for me.</li>
            <li> brushes are nice and soft</li>
            <li> I like this set because I really don&#x27;t know the names/uses of all the different eye shadow brushes out there.  It&#x27;s nice to have a variety to chose from, and through experimentation, I&#x27;ve figured out which ones are the best for which purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the variety, I find these brushes to be very good quality.  Better than your average &amp;#34;drug store brand&amp;#34;. They don&#x27;t shed;  the ones that are supposed to be soft stay soft; the ones that are supposed to be firmer stay firm.  Nothing irritating about them in any way.  I don&#x27;t know how they compare to the more expensive/designer &amp;#34;department store brand&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t ever intend to spend that much money on makeup brushes, so these are perfect for me.</li>
            <li> These brushes gotta be the best and affordable set  of professional brushes in the market, i think these are better than Sigma.</li>
            <li> These are very good brushes, better than I expected. I recommend them to anyone needing good make-up brushes but are unable to afford the pricier products.</li>
            <li> Being an Australian buying these brushes at priceline is just too expensive for me so i decided to buy them off amazon as they are in a such more affordable range. For me they actually came wayyy earlier than the expected date it said.It came 5 days earlier than I thought. The quality of these brushes just blows my mind and they are just so soft i swear almost like a teddy bear. I also purchased the travel essentials set, core collection and expert face brush and i think amazingly of all the brushes.</li>
            <li> at forst when i saw the set i thought that they gave you some unnescesary brushes, but when i got it i was finding myself using every last one of them! My favorite is the crease brush so versatile! and you will actually use the brow brush in this kit!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, very ease to use. And the price is even better. I will always buy this item again in the future.</li>
            <li> The material and style is great. The carrying case is perfect for traveling and the diversity of brushes is for beginners.</li>
            <li> Soft and very blend able. Good quality and low cost. Like the pixiwoo girls glad they deliver with quality products! The brushes are tapered and the smallest of the are very thin making it easy to control eye shadow application.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed-Simple- the brushes are soft and the bristles do not fall off.  A great and easy starter kit.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. Best eye brush set Ive ever owned. If you are looking for something that will last you, this is it.</li>
            <li> The purple brushes are for your eyes and come with a case to store them and it allows them to stand as well while you use them! The brushes are well made and the only brand I buy now!</li>
            <li> my sister loved it she bought some of these brushes and i loved them to because of the packaging its two in one</li>
            <li> Great quality and very affordable. Best brush set I have tried yet. I like some of these brushes more than my mac brushes.</li>
            <li> Not the quality I was hoping for and the &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; has a cheep look and feel, but they are adequate.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes (bought both these and the core collection set) and I love them both.</li>
            <li> This brush set is great! I first learned of the set(s) from Samantha Chapman on youtube through her brother&#x27;s fiance Tanya Burr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Brushes feel soft and brush hair does not have fall out.&lt;br /&gt;The package is nice for travel and standing up on its own.&lt;br /&gt;The package is sleek enough to fit into a bag or a purse.&lt;br /&gt;Each brush has a different function. For 20.00$ or less it is a great price.&lt;br /&gt;The colors of the brushes are pretty. You can&#x27;t go wrong with purple.&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance or the cleaning of the brushes is standard.&lt;br /&gt;Store other brushes in package.&lt;br /&gt;Package is easyily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get out of product package (you need both hands)!&lt;br /&gt;No other complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good budget brushes for price and as a moderate make up user they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> This Brush set is everything I could ever need. The quality of the brushes is outstanding, very good brushes for beginners as they make the application of the eye shadow super easy to blend out and they pick up the pigment beautifully. The fine liner brush makes applying gel eyeliner so much easier. I will be using these for a very long time to come.</li>
            <li> I Love this brushes. didn&#x27;t expect to get this quality for this money. will buy more. I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> A good starter kit for eye make up brushes that anyone can have. Not so attractive to use at first but once you give it a try you&#x27;ll find some of its good use some brushes are of no use to me. I just wish they put an extra thin eye liner together with the bundle.</li>
            <li> Perfect brushes, does what it says, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> this item came so quickly and arrived when i wanted it to. once i opened the package, the brushes were soft, steady and seemed very tactile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought these so i could get more precision when doing beards for cosplay, as i am a girl, and different eye makeup! thanks so much, deffinately deserves 5 stars</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing these. You honestly get a great product for a small price. If you buy these you will be happy.</li>
            <li> Fast and on point..its not first time trying out these makeup brushes and I must say it does amazing work!!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very good. I&#x27;ve been following Sam on Pixiewoo for a bit now and am so happy for her and Nic but more so for the quality products they have put out. I literally saw a difference in how smooth my eyeshdow went on when using their brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this starter set! I bought this when I first got my eye shadow palette. Each brush is fluffy and well shaped. I love how I can use different brush for different use. I use the case the brushes came with to set my brushes apart from all my other make-ups. It&#x27;s been doing its job very well. It was definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> i recieved my brush kit in the mail today. I was disappointed at the size of the brushes. I also feel like the carry case/ stand is useless because it is so difficult to put them back in you canr do it without knocking the stand over . The price is cheap. But like the saying goes you get what you pay for. I will purchase a couple of the bigger  brushes like the setting brush and the face brush but at my local Wal mart so I know exactly what Im getting. I would have sent them back but it would cost more than what I paid fir them.</li>
            <li> I never had a set of nice brushes. I would always buy one brush at a time. I saw thes on many rivew on  you tuob  and  i decided to treat myself. They are awesome brush set with soft fibers,i also bought  tha face  brushs set , the eye set and blush brush  from Real Techniques they are amazing  too.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes, I&#x27;m not big into makeup but I like to wear eyeshadow once in awhile and these work great. Don&#x27;t know a whole lot about brushes but these have worked well for me :)</li>
            <li> very nice! so soft and professionel</li>
            <li> Bought 3 of these, great brush set, great price.</li>
            <li> Love my new make up brushes!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift but is very nice</li>
            <li> I love this set!  I use it everyday.  Plenty of options for what I think most people need for everyday use.  Real Techniques has a travel set but I take this set with me traveling and it&#x27;s certainly compact enough for travel.</li>
            <li> This little brushes and amazing , their my favorite to use when doing my eyes ive let my friends use them a couple of times and they love them as well the brush is smooth and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Despite these brushes don&#x27;t have natural bristles, they are good also with powder product.</li>
            <li> My son purchased this for my daughter-in-law off her wish list for Christmas. She loved them and had been asking for them for 2 years.</li>
            <li> The price for this set was great. The bristles are soft. They are much more better as I expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to spend more than $20 dollars on single brush. The set quality is amazing. They don&#x27;t shed and they are super soft.  And the price is insane! Love them!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! I use the Deluxe Crease Brush every day for applying shadow to my crease. The bristles on all the brushes in this set are really soft and don&#x27;t shed. They pick up and apply product wonderfully! These have to be some of the best eye brushes I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Excellent these brushes are soft and detailing they add perfection for a flawless finish. There are no streaks they glide on beautifully they do not eat up your shadows. What you see are vibrant colors on your eyes remember to use a primer before makeup application.</li>
            <li> Price is affordable, the brushes are great, totally recommend!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and do exactly what she says they will. Great product. I use them every day. The best part is that they are the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. Definitely recommend buying these if you need a set of brushes, and the case is so handy for travel! I love them and they&#x27;re so soft and nice to use. I use the eyeshadow ones more than the detail and eyeliner brushes, but definitely worth it! You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought these :D</li>
            <li> i loved the quality and the pacakaging ,i didnt use them yet but i will do shortly they are perfect and i wish if i can have a full set for real techniques brushes but didnt found them all together but i will buy every single brush they have  these are perfect brushes .</li>
            <li> I have wanted these brushes for about a year but the price had never been right  adj when I saw them under $15 I  jumped right on it.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier so I  brought the cute set too.  They came the next day I fuse that&#x27;s the perks of living in a major city but yes I love them and they are more than worth their value.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these brushes!! They are every bit as soft as my Sigmas, and WAY above the quality of the ELF, Ecotools, and Sonia Kashuk brushes I started out with!  My only wish is that they were sold as individual pieces so I could pick up a couple extra of my favorites!</li>
            <li> I am a first time makeup brush user, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about the brand, if they would meet my needs, etc. I absolutely LOVE these brushes. I have small eyes so the crease brush is a little too large for my creases, but it works wonderfully as a blender and brow highlighter brush. I haven&#x27; used the brow brush, but I have used the liner brush to set my cream eyeliner. The detail brush is wonderful for lining the lower lash line and shadowing the inner corner of the eyes. The brushes are super soft, and I have washed them twice now and they haven&#x27;t shed a single hair. Love them and will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Love , I just did a review on the face Real Techniques brushes. I own nearly all of them and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these brushes. The only thing I would change is I will they had more of a rounder shader brush kinda of like the E.L.F. C brush. I still use my E.L.F. brushes for that. Also the larger doom shaped brush is really good for blending concealer, highlighter..</li>
            <li> Good brushes,buy with Core Collection Set,competent for daily use.</li>
            <li> these brushes never fail me. I use them on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Great set, for a great price</li>
            <li> Better than my expensive makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Amazing value! I&#x27;m a fan of this brand and their creators. Precise application. The contour brush, eye shadow blending brush, the concealer brush and stippling brush are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Good price, good brushes :)</li>
            <li> This is a very good starter kit for beginners. The bristles are soft and apply the product easily. The shipping was quick. Overall, great transaction.</li>
            <li> I am VERY particular over what type of brushes I use, and these are, by far, the best I&#x27;ve come across - for a very reasonable price. Each one gets used daily, and the packaging for them helps to keep them nice and organized. You won&#x27;t go wrong getting this kit.</li>
            <li> One of the best brush set out there. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup expert &amp; don&#x27;t wear it on a regular basis. But these brushes have really improved my look when I do wear makeup. I love the case they come in, and the brushes are so soft to the touch. I recommend this item!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. They don&#x27;t lose fibers when being used. They are the perfect length and weight for daily use.</li>
            <li> I really like the two left brushes and reach for them for eyeshadow, blending concealer a lot, they wash really well too</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best one I ever had. I buy ones from Sephora, it was a Smokey eyes kit and witch is 4 brushes. The price was almost 50 dollars. Real Techniques are triple better than does and the price is unbelievable. I also own the ones for the base and they are great too. I strongly recommends this brushes if you&#x27;re looking to have nicely done make up in your eyes. Another thing Samantha will show you how to use them on her web site. If you&#x27;re thinking o I&#x27;m not sure, first look what she does with them, and then think if you really need them.</li>
            <li> item came much more quickly than I expected.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  I am very out of practice with makeup application.  these brushes give me a smooth, lovely look. they are a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.... they blend well and are soft yet firm enough to do the job. They hold up much better than my MAC and other brand brushes. The only one i dont use much is the small eyeliner brush as it is too big for that purpose but i use it instead to do my inner eye highlight and to smudge out my eyeliner lines. Ive purchased several more of these sets to give as gift and everyone raves about them.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. Glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Best eyeshadow brushes/detail brushes I’ve used. They’re perfect for the everyday eyeshadow users. The brow brush is perfect and gentle.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! They are soft and allow a novice like me apply makeup like a pro. Totally worth the price as you would pay quite a bit more in the drugstore or even Walmart.  I highly recommend these brushes and if they wear out I will definitely repurchase.  These are really great brushes.</li>
            <li> this is the second time I buy it</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice (as in soft and fairly dense, but the case is brilliant! It protects the brushes and keeps cosmetic dust from getting rubbed all over a bag, AND it is a handy stand. (I got two separate sets!)</li>
            <li> The brushes are FABULOUS! They are really good for blending and application. Hold product very and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> For the price of these brushes they exceed all of my expectations they are great quality and the pectin and the performance of these brushes are superb these are definitely a must buy if you want to start your makeup collection and maybe even kit as an makeup artist i use these on clients and my clients love them especially how soft they feel on the skin</li>
            <li> i love the packaging of this item. it was well organized and well wrapped. the brushes were as displayed in the picture on the website.  i recommend it for all make up lovers. the brushes are so soft and they don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> I find the blending brush even better than mac 207 . great work samantha , i am such a big fan of yours. :)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to get 1 set to try it out. Not bad for the price and the bristles are really soft. But I do wish that the brow brush to be softer as it is a bit hard, I wanted to use it as angle brush but kind of difficult because it is not as soft as others.</li>
            <li> I love and use all of the brushes the stand is even great! I don&#x27;t have much space for things and this helps with space saving and keeps the brushes from any dust and being distorted</li>
            <li> I have several brush sets from high end to lower priced sets and these are my favorite. They are super soft, easy to clean, dont shed hairs and work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I am quite fond of the eye brow brush because it applies my brow shadow so evenly.  The other brushes are quite nice.  I think I would have liked one of the shadowed brushes to have a beveled edge but otherwise happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot of good things about Real Techniques brushes, as far as being good quality and affordable. So I bought these for my sister to go with an eye shadow palette I was giving her. The palette was the real gift; but she didn&#x27;t really have any brushes to use with it, so I just wanted to get her started. The shadow and blending brushes are both much larger than I was expecting, while the other brushes are tiny. The eyebrow brush seems essentially useless. Overall, the quality is what I was expecting for the price and they seem to work for her. It was really nice that it came with a case for the brushes, although I&#x27;m not sure how much she cared about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are serious about makeup, I would probably recommend spending a bit more for better quality brushes. However, if you&#x27;re like my sister and don&#x27;t care all that much about makeup these will be good for you.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow has never gone on so evenly. I was searching for new shadows because I didn&#x27;t like the way they looked with other applicators and brushes. These brushes have totally changed my mind. Love them!!! I may buy a second set just because!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my gf and she absolutely loves them and uses them daily. If you want to make your lady happy these are a good pick.</li>
            <li> Love this Set! The brushes are amazing - my favorite eye brushes! I use them ALL! And the case is very convenient. you can even fit in a few extra brushes if you need to. LOVE these!</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of brushes, but low price, these are the best I&#x27;ve had. I love them.</li>
            <li> Great to get you started</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eye brush ever&lt;br /&gt;Like its name ..for starter it&#x27;s really suit for beginner like me.&lt;br /&gt;I found it easy to make my eye look brilliant !,&lt;br /&gt;Never expected this could be so awesome&lt;br /&gt;Love real technique brush</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect. Really great quality for a very affordable price.  If you want high-quality brushes, I seriously recommend all the brushes from the real Techniques brand because they are seriously the best.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set and have been using it about a week.  So far so good.  I really live the contouring/crease brush -- it has a nice taper to it that makes getting highlighting shadow into the corners of my eye really precise.  I have used the stubby shadow brush a few times and need to play around with it a bit more -- it is quite round and well, stubby, but makes it easy to pack on color.  The liner brush is nice and providers a smudgy line.  I have not used the other smaller brushes yet.  As with all &amp;#34;real Techniques&amp;#34; brushes these are so super soft!!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Everything I expected and more! Comes as described with 5 brushes for your eye makeup. Definitely all the most necessary brushes youll ever need and they are definitely a high quality. Love this brand; a great brand to go with if youre unsure. The best thing is it comes with a nice little black folding case for travel/storage! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have tried many make up brushes from high end to more economical. This brand  is by far my favorite. Application is perfect, not scratchy and very reasonably priced! The stand is really handy</li>
            <li> These are super soft brushes! The case is a great idea but probably not something I will find myself utilizing much.</li>
            <li> Love this kit and ALL of Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes that blend my make-up like butter.</li>
            <li> love all real technique brushes. soft, hold product well</li>
            <li> I love all the real technique products so these are just as amazing! I bought this ad the travel set and really that&#x27;s all you need. I did actually buy the buffing brush from ulta which I highly recommend as well!</li>
            <li> this definitely did not meet my expectations. with its price, i should have just gotten myself a sigma brush. the liner brush is too thick to make a fine line, the brow brush is too thick as well. the shader brush for eyeshadow application is to big for one&#x27;s eyes. i regret buying this. but i guess you only get what you paid for. hahaha</li>
            <li> I really wished (with all myself) these brushes and they haven&#x27;t disappointed me!!The case is very practice for the double use of pochette and stand, with other space for more brushes or something else. The brushes are light with very softness (cruelty-free) bristles!!</li>
            <li> I bought this set after watching pixiwoo for such a long time and seeing these brushes in action. As a big fan I couldn&#x27;t wait to get both this and another set of theirs... Just a week in and one brush came apart. Given the hideous process of returns I glued it back together rather than sending it back, but I am not impressed with these brushes, despite really wanting to be. There is nothing remarkable about them and they don&#x27;t apply foundation well or generally fulfill basic requirements for me. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes!  They&#x27;re soft, never shed and blend like a dream. I bought them to use on my clients but, can&#x27;t seem to stop using them on myself!  I WILL be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Best eye brushes out there. excellent quality, great value!</li>
            <li> extremely soft brushes , great quality , amazing price , apply make up perfectly ,, i love hoe they are color coded .. sam did a great job .. i recommend them to everyone</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They work very well and are so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Gooood quality ..i love them</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much, I would recommend to all buy this stuff, you Will not regret.</li>
            <li> YES, the brushes are real!&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes and at this price. Ulta sells them for $18, so I thought that it would be a better bargain here. The shipping was fast too. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better deal.</li>
            <li> I had been meaning to order these brushes for a long time, and I am so glad that I finally did. These brushes are fantastic and a great price! I would 100% consider purchasing more Real Techniques brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> All products as described. Amazing brushes! Delivered in time. Just great!</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes. Exactly what you need to start being a little more professional about makeup application. I watch pixiwoo and that&#x27;s how i came to buy these brushes.</li>
            <li> This is the best 15$ I ever spent. The eye liner brush is so so perfect. I don&#x27;t ming if it falls apart in a couple months I&#x27;ll buy another set. Great brushes</li>
            <li> Love these brushes &amp; use them every day. Great quality.  Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. Super soft and they don&#x27;t shed. I use them everyday for everything from blush to brows to eye shadow to concealer. Great price too</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup artist, however I think this is one of the most comprehensive, yet not overwhelming eye shadow brush sets. Really easy to blend colors and get the right look.</li>
            <li> Ordered for a friend, came on time, nothing broken, everything looked great.</li>
            <li> Just received this today and I&#x27;m already in love. The brushes are affordable and the bristles are soft. The best part is the case, it keeps the brushes in tact.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes!  They&#x27;ve held up well and I don&#x27;t have the problem with these that I&#x27;ve had w/ some cheaper brushes, of the hairs falling out.  These are soft, hold the makeup well and work great!</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They are good quality and I do think that the base shadow brush is similar to a MAC 217. The deluxe crease brush is good for apply concealer. The liner brush is not the best but its ok. The angled and detailer brushes are good for gel and eyeshadow to line the eyes. Now I do think that this an ideal set for beginners. For some reason I feel like I need to keep picking up color to get the right amount of eyeshadow on. I think it&#x27;s because they are made from synthetic bristles. I did get used to it but it&#x27;s something you should consider. Overall good brush set. Fun to have a colorful eyeshadow brush set. They are relatively heavy duty as well. But not too heavy. They do not shed at all. I would recommend watching and reading reviews to see what they&#x27;re like in order to make a choice. But in general yes good brush set to have especially for the price. I got it from Iherb.com along with the blush bush and the core collection from amazon.com, Iherb got this to me in 3 days which is fantastic. Whereas amazon shipped in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> love these brushes. applies the makeup so well. theyre professional brushes but not expensive like most professional brushes are. love this brand</li>
            <li> Marvellous and softest brushes i ever use.. Easy to use and blend perfectly.. Recommended to buy, really a wonderful product..</li>
            <li> The primer that comes with these brushes are worth the price of the brushes. I have enjoyed the entire set and use it daily. Brushes are very nice and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> This have become my favorite brushes. Very good value, i would purchase real Techniques product again. Some of the reviews said the brushes were a bit big, i disagree. I think they are a great size for mod/detailed make up application.</li>
            <li> love the brushes, soft bristles use every brush the case is great to have to keep brushes separate fast shipping great deal</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by several friends and it really is great. Brushes are nice and light and pick up make up very well..Price is great too!</li>
            <li> Love the way the make up goes on! I never bought make up brushes before. I&#x27;m glad I waited and bought this product.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft bristles with nice packaging. Applies eye shadow effectively. It has a variety of brushes for a newbie like me.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, use them daily, and really like them.</li>
            <li> I Love these brushes so much. I wish they would come out with more types of eye brushes. They are so soft and very affordable. I definitely plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fake as it&#x27;s says on reviews</li>
            <li> this brushes are great especially the eyeliner one.....i applied loreal eye gel with this liner brush and the finishing was gr8....and for the price....it&#x27;s so cheaper than other stores like ultra...walmart......u can get this kit at $17.99 but i got this exact  brush here at $15.60 and free shipping too..........amazing............</li>
            <li> LOVE. They are so easy to clean and I use most of them everyday. I&#x27;m not a makeup novice, nor an expert, these are great for everyone. The hairs are the best I&#x27;ve ever used, they never clump and they&#x27;re very precise. Such a good price too. After each use I just wipe them off with a makeup remover wipe and they&#x27;re good as new. Even if you neglect to clean a brush after several uses they clean right up.</li>
            <li> All Real Techniques brushes so far I purchased are great editions to my collections, they are very soft and smooth. Apply cosmetics very well. Great brushes.</li>
            <li> Some hairs come out, but not many. Very good product and affordable. The littlest brush doesn&#x27;t do much for me, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a good use for it.</li>
            <li> This is starter kit is essential for everyday use and even for using on clients. I absolutely love them. They&#x27;re so soft but they still pack on those shadows and allow you to really blow people away with your eyes. Best of all they got here in 2 &amp; a half days !</li>
            <li> Good brushes. I think they do they&#x27;re job well. That&#x27;s all I could ask for. The purple is nice too, so it&#x27;s got two things going for them!</li>
            <li> This is a great value!  I purchased this to buff up my eye brush collection and the crease brush, the accent brush, and the base shadow brush have become a permanent part of my makeup routine.They are all very soft and I have experienced no shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the travel case they come in.  It&#x27;s really convenient due to size and functionality to throw in your overnight bag.  7-8 brushes fit comfortably and safely.  You&#x27;ll definitely need to secure your brushes in the bands or else they&#x27;ll go flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes!!! Cheap price too!!!</li>
            <li> I originally received this set as a gift and loved all the brushes, and the quality was amazing. I recently purchased this set again for mother&#x27;s day, and my mother loved it as well. The brushes are very multipurpose- as with most of the real Techniques line, and are very easy to clean. The brushes do not shed anymore than is to be expected with makeup brushes, in fact they shed less than other higher end makeup brushes I own. Would definitely recommend the set for yourself or a gift.</li>
            <li> comparable to brushes from sephora very soft but sturdy I will be filling out my collection with more of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price. I&#x27;d purchase them again.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft. The quality is great and the price is excellent and they came within the allotted time.</li>
            <li> It is awesome, thank y</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes for a decent price!</li>
            <li> All the brushes are amazing. The eyebrow brush isn&#x27;t something I reach for, but it&#x27;s still a great product. I don&#x27;t use the deluxe crease brush on my eyes, but it&#x27;s great for blending in concealer.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for the price.  They are very soft and multipurpose. The case is kind of a waste unless you plan to always keep them in a case or you travel a lot and need all of them.</li>
            <li> Thank you, thank you, thank you for making AFFORDABLE, QUALITY, BEAUTIFUL brushes!!!  I have tried numerous types of make up brushes before. Some were okay, some were bad. The Techniques Starter Kit really beat them ALL. I haven&#x27;t had one piece of hair from the brush stick to my face yet! This is usually what frustrates me the most about the brushes I have purchased in the past. Also, my make up goes on smoother without, noticeable, streaking. Thank you, again, for creating these AWESOME brushes that I can , actually, afford.  I will, definitely, purchase more.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes! Great starter kit and got here in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> Fantastic. I Recomended. x x x x x x x ccx x x x xxx xx xxx x x x x x xx x xx x x</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loves them!!!! Quality is really good too!!!</li>
            <li> I am a seasoned licensed cosmetologist. As mentioned by other reviewers, my expectations weren&#x27;t that high when I first viewed the product. Trust the before reviews, these brushes are worth the money, soft and comparable to higher priced ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase other brushes by this company.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great brushes and I wish I would&#x27;ve discovered them sooner. They&#x27;re multi-task and easy to use, as well as clean. You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing 5 brushes that would normally cost the amount of one.</li>
            <li> I loved all the brushes except the eyeliner ones. Too thick. But so worth it anyways for the first 3 brushes, theyre amazing.</li>
            <li> Really nice quality and well designed. The travel wallet that they come in is handy&lt;br /&gt;As good if not better than more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes make a huge difference in the pplication of eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. Before I got these brushes I did do heavy research online and saw great reviews. I love that the brushes are both universal and soft. They are great quality without breaking the bank. Thanks real techniques for good quality brushes at such a good price.</li>
            <li> i really liked this brushs . it&#x27;s help me with conselar and eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;and shadow also, i like the price</li>
            <li> I initially bought this pack because of the &#x27;Base Shadow&#x27; and the &#x27;Crease&#x27; brush which are just as amazing as expected, however the eyeliner brush is a bit too thick for applying winged gel liner as I usually would. I am sure I can find another use for it. Other than that, the stand/case is useful and keeps everything clean and organised. This kit is definitely a useful addition to makeup junkies.</li>
            <li> I admit I&#x27;ve never used MAC or more high end brushes so I&#x27;m not able to compare, but these brushes are VERY soft and for specifically the shadow and contour brushes I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be straying from this brand. Soft, REALLY pick up the eye-shadows, and do their jobs.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes.  I just ordered another set and a couple of extra ones individually.  Once you try these brushes, you will use no others.  It comes with a case that is multifunctional and will also hold additional brushes if desired. Wonderful and a must have for anyone who applies makeup.</li>
            <li> The angled brush is too thick to use for eyeliner or your brows.  Overall, this set is worth the price that you pay for it!</li>
            <li> Real techniques brushes are the best I use them all the time, soft, easy to clean love them all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product. The brushes are very soft and pleasant to us.  I am really exited about this purchase</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of all things make-up and these brushes are a good set for beginners or pros in my opinion.  They are very decent quality and give a nice variety for a decent price.  I use at least one of these brushes every single day in my make-up routine.</li>
            <li> really like the dome brushes in this set. Seems to grab just enough shadow powder and blends real well...</li>
            <li> These brushes are so boss I love them</li>
            <li> I recently decided to start doing my makeup like a grown-up, which meant throwing out the blue eye shadow (or at least hiding it in the back of the cabinet), picking up a nice, nude palette, and finally investing in some makeup brushes instead of those crappy, spongy applicators. Because I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience doing my makeup nicely, I didn&#x27;t want to blow a hundred bucks on a set of professional brushes. This set seemed like a good starting point until I understood a bit more about applying makeup and could decide what types of brushes were worth investing in. For the most part I find myself only using the largest 2 brushes. The eyeliner brush is a little to thick and not pointed enough to feasibly use with liquid eyeliner. I don&#x27;t put makeup on my eyebrows, so the eyebrow brush doesn&#x27;t get much use either. I occasionally use the accent brush, but it&#x27;s a little sloppy (the fibers aren&#x27;t dense enough) to really do a good job. I really love the deluxe crease brush for applying my base colors, although it&#x27;s way too big to use on your crease. It&#x27;s nice and stiff so it makes a good blending brush too. The base shadow brush is really the only one in this set that does what it&#x27;s labeled to do. I will say that for the price I&#x27;m not disappointed with this set. The brushes are all soft, and none of the fibers have fallen out. I like that the tips are light colored, so I can actually see how much powder I&#x27;ve picked up. If you&#x27;re an eye-makeup novice like me and looking for a set to get you started, this isn&#x27;t a bad way to go. It won&#x27;t be long, however, before you start replacing the brushes in this set with more expensive, better shaped brushes.</li>
            <li> I got one of this pack and I loved it then I got 4 for my sisters and friends ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are HQ and very soft and they blend your eyeshadow effortlessly :D</li>
            <li> I bought the set and the 3 shading brushes are great, I would love to buy more but I just need the shading brushes and I don&#x27;t need extra eye liner and the angled liner brushes. The smallest brush is just amazing and makes highlighting the inner corner so easy, it can be also used for precise application, smudging eyeliner or applying shadow on the lower lash line.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my niece for Christmas.  Very nice for those starting out &amp; good quality!  I have a couple of their travel lip brushes which are holding up good, no pieces on my lips which is exactly what happened the last time I bought brushes for a little more money.  I was confident that this brand wasn&#x27;t going to fall apart because of that as I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on them since she is too young for really good brushes!  Too young for makeup in my opinion at 11 but I&#x27;m just the Aunt so they were a big hit!  I can&#x27;t speak as to how well they apply make up but she does a pretty good job with them!</li>
            <li> Getting this brush set was a nice surprise... high quality bristles, nice design, very useful and versatile pouch&lt;br /&gt;I liked these brushes so much that I kept them for me instead of adding them to my Professional kit :-)</li>
            <li> Great quality product.</li>
            <li> best set out there for the price point these are at. if you are just starting with make up and you dont have any eye brushes i really recommend trying this set out before you purchase nicer ones. at some point of course you will want to invest in natural bristle brushes but for people on a limited income these will get the job done and are much nicer than anything else at this price or really anything i&#x27;ve found for less than $100.</li>
            <li> Love all the real techniques brushes</li>
            <li> Although I feel like I can&#x27;t give an accurate review since I&#x27;m just a beginner, i do love this brush set and the case it comes in! I feel like the brushes are helping me learn to put on eyeshadow. In my humble opinion they&#x27;re good</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful!  the bristles do not fall out and the makeup application is flawless!</li>
            <li> These are great makeup brushes and they were so much cheaper than getting them at Ulta or any other store.</li>
            <li> So quick and easy! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this set. I love real techniques in general. If you want a good set of brushes and don&#x27;t want to spend MAC or Segmia money I recommend real techniques. I use the second to smallest fluffy brush on a daily!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bigger than what i used</li>
            <li> Great eye set. The brushes are amazing quality and very easy to clean. I use these almost every day, and loved the fact that it came in such a convenient set.</li>
            <li> I lost this kit and actually repurchased it. It&#x27;s the best ever</li>
            <li> Very good brush..... Thank  you  amazon for making shopping easy.</li>
            <li> All their brushes are really good for the money</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re not a pro at applying eye makeup then these are for you! I&#x27;ve been practicing with these &amp; my eyes look a lot better than when I use to use those little spongy tips. Ladies, you&#x27;ll be happy you bought these.</li>
            <li> Also purchased the core collection set and bought these after receiving and trying the core set. I feel pampered using these brushes and the quality is superior to brushes I have had in the past. The case is nice too, nothing flashy- very sturdy &amp; serviceable as case and stand which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I use mineral makeup for my face and eyes. And should say these brushes are perfect for that! They are very soft, and handles are long for comfortable using. The set also has a great pouch, which is very practical. Quality is great for the price of  15$! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This set is amazing, you can create so many awesome looks with only this 5 brushes and look beautiful. Worth the hype.</li>
            <li> these brushes are of amazing quality.&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;- hairs dont fall off (meaning that you dont have to collect the hair bristles off your face, nothing falls off)&lt;br /&gt;- you can check sams youtube chanel if you want to double check the usage of each brush.&lt;br /&gt;- absolutly adore the first brush on the left, it is great for applying concealer, and i felt that the concealer stays put for a longer time when i use the brush.. much better than fingers.&lt;br /&gt;- the second brush to the left, is great for blending (although not as great as MAC 217 brush, but still good if you are looking for an affordable alternative)&lt;br /&gt;- affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; the eyeliner brush in useless. too long , hard to use, and not stiff enough to provide you with the precise application with a gel liner. so if there are any of you who want to create a winged liner or any type of eyeliner shape, i urge you to try using the first brush on the right, which is perfect for first time users, hard enough , and makes life so much easier, you can also use it to retouch and fill your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thats it, overall its a good brush set.. if the eyeliner brush was better i would have given it a 5 star!</li>
            <li> I am obssesed with all real techniques brushes! They work like high end brushes with out the high end price tag!</li>
            <li> Great price for some really nice brushes. The base shadow brush and deluxe crease brush are great. The eyeliner brush and angle brush for brows are too big for those purposes in my opinion. However, set was still worth it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. They are very soft and hold a lot of product.  Had minimal to zero shedding when washed.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday! The bristles are so soft but have just the right bounce in them. I love the bleeding brush as well. I don&#x27;t really use the eyeliner and brow brushes because they seem really fluffy, but have used them with no problems. I mostly use the liner brush for a small brown undereye line with powder. It gives it a very soft effect. I also LOVE the precision brush. Get these, now!</li>
            <li> I love this set! There are only a few changes I would make to the book that holds them, like sealing all of the way around to prevent stuff from contaminating my brushes, but other than that I&#x27;m pleased. It has been almost a year and I&#x27;m still using them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing. The bristles are super soft and hold the pigment very well. You don&#x27;t have the shedding problem you have with cheaper brushes, but they are in a nice affordable price range. I love these brushes and haven&#x27;t used anything else since they arrived.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set. The quality is superb and you can pick and choose what you wish to use each brush for. They are soft and plush. I&#x27;m not as fond of the liner brush in this kit because it doesn&#x27;t give me the fine line that I like but otherwise, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> recommended 👍 top quality</li>
            <li> You get for what you pay.&lt;br /&gt;Brush quality is not bad, but the angled eyeliner is way too thick to be an angled eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes for the price - they&#x27;re very versatile and perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This one is fake. The case is different from the one i ordered from Real Techniques online page. Just go to the official website to purchase it. Those brushes work so much better than these fake ones.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic quality! They are real great for beginners as they have everything you might need and its not too expensive. Of course, the brushes are versatile so you don&#x27;t have to use them for their specific reasoning. Nonetheless, really great value and quality.</li>
            <li> Basically, I went to ulta to take a closer look at these brushes.  I have been lusting after all of these brushes for awhile and went to stalk them some more.  When I looked at them closely most of the brushes in this pack were too...fuzzy.  I was looking for something with cleaner lines for my eye makeup.  I really like the quality of these brushes, which is why I think they are STILL a very good deal if you have a lot of makeup and wear it all the time, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.  For the same price I bought the \\&quot;core collection\\&quot; set which is a better deal in my opinion, and has one small brush for applying eye makeup.  I also bought a shading brush, which looks more practical for putting on shadows and such.</li>
            <li> okay, this set is mediocre. i bought it because i was missing a lot of the brushes it contains. the flat shadow brush picks up a decent amount of e/s..but not nearly as much as my really old maybelline brush (which I have had for about 10 years). since its a duo fiber brush (and its cut in layers..like hair would be) it allows for a decent amount of product to fall off the brush or not even get on the eyelid at all. the crease blending brush is short and stiff, which is okay, but i prefer a fluffier version. its also a little too big for my crease. the small detailing brush is great for inner corner work and i also use it sometimes for cream e/s (its a little too small for this but its not too bad) the liner brush is okay, its a little too flimsy and doesn&#x27;t have a firm point. so its great for cream eyeliners and a not-so-precise look. the brow brush i use as my eyeliner brush because it gives a finer line. the case they come in is flimsy and i will never use it honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall this is a mediocre set, but i would invest in individual brushes instead of this set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and great price! I have almost the whole set and they work really well with powder or cream.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to recieve these brushes as I seen alot of youtube beauty gurus use them but I was bummed to find out that they do shed. However these brushes are very multifunctional. You can use them very many different ways.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, I own several Real Techniques brushes, this set was the latest addition to my collection and did not disappoint. They are soft, great for blending shadows and applying eyeliner, super easy to wash and dry really fast. I have not had any problems with the hairs falling out at all. I love the brushes, but the case they come in isn&#x27;t very practical for traveling (its a little bulky just to store those little brushes).</li>
            <li> love all these brushes they are def top quality and they work with all kinds of shadows....wet, dry, cream, gel, etc.....they clean very easily too. i even use the shadow brush for concealer bc it works perfectly under my eyes</li>
            <li> I love real techniques brushes; I think they are great value for money. This set has everything you need for eye shadow, at least as a beginner. I gave 4 stars because the base shadow brush isn&#x27;t perfect; the bristles are a little uneven. I would still definitely recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes. Love them</li>
            <li> Got these not as starters but to just add smaller brushes to my collection. Real techniques are great and affordable!</li>
            <li> They are so soft, they do not shed.  I think these brushes are amazing.  I hope to own all of them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these along with the set of larger brushes.  They arrived quickly and were as expected.  I only give 4 stars because I want to see how they hold up.  I do not see any shedding (but I have only had them a week).  They seem sturdy and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very pretty and light weight.  I recommend these to anyone starting out experimenting in the makeup world</li>
            <li> awesome brushes...worth buying if you ask me....have almost the entire collection...so happy I purchased these brushes...will order more when I need them</li>
            <li> Good starter set, brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed so far.  I was hoping the angle brush would be stiffer so I could use it for eyebrow pomade, would be 5 stars if it was.</li>
            <li> I definitely favor these brushes over my other ones. So mach so that I actually gave away many of my old brushes to a good friend. I use these brushes almost daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is some of them are a little big, but otherwise they are lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received my starter set and core collection set today and I&#x27;m very excited to try all of them ! Packing is very good and the quality of the brushes is awesome ,  THANKS :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush set,it comes with a base brush,and a deluxe crease brush,an accent brush,a fine liner brush,brow brush,and a panoramic case.This set is good for traveling,the brushes are soft,and the color purple is pretty.I would recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li> These are so very lovely. They pick up color with less fallout and blend like a dream. I find them comparable/better to the few brushes I have that are twice the price. I will definitely purchase other brushes from this line.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques if a great company for make-up brushes.  Simple to clean, easy to apply, and quick to travel.  I have purchased other Real Technique products and have always been very satisfied.  These are great for begginers as well!  If you go to the Real Techniques website creator Sam Chapman gives you fantastic, simple styles in which to use her tools for a great finish.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I totally love these brushes. I got them at a small discount but would definitely pay full amount.  This is a great starter set!  I have used these everyday since I received them.  They apply evenly and there has been no brush fall out when I wash them.  Great brand. I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased feedback</li>
            <li> All the brushes are soft with great color and smooth for application. The stand is a good feature and the brushes are really nice to use!</li>
            <li> Good brushes! I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> love all of the real techniques brushes very good quality, was shocked when i received them right the next day</li>
            <li> Good and soft brushes. Unfortunately I don´t use all brushes. For two of the brushes I don´t have any use. The eyeliner brush and the eyebrow brush could be better...</li>
            <li> I was really excited about purchasing these brushes as they seemed to be exactly what I was looking for (makeup brushes that were good enough to learn some makeup techniques with but cheap enough to avoid a costly investment if I sucked).  They came as expected, the brushes are of a good quality and help create beautifully blended makeup looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that after having there for a few months the bristles are kind of hard and can poke your delicate eye skin.  Kind of irritating but hey, for the price I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! For the price, its definitely a great buy! My make up looks great.</li>
            <li> amazing, works well, is a perfect tarter kit. I will be buying more real techniques brushes in the immediate future!</li>
            <li> Great set for travel. All brushes are easy to use, clean, and store. The case is great for drying the brushes (as they should dry upside down).</li>
            <li> Love these! They don&#x27;t shed and blend colors precisely.</li>
            <li> Use them everyday, just as good as my sigma brushes</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift &amp; the recipient loved them.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes!!!  I purchased these as a gift for a secret cupid Valentine&#x27;s Day gift exchange with a makeup/skincare Facebook group I am a member of.  I have used real Techniques brushes in the past, and thought they would be a great gift.  She loved them!  And they come in a great little fabric case that would be great for traveling.  Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this brand!</li>
            <li> My full  review was written in the Core Collection set!  Excellent buy, soft, easy to blend with and give a lovely make up finish.  Mrs Paul Hammond</li>
            <li> By far one of the best make up sets I&#x27;ve purchased,  the price is an added bonus!!!!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE these brushes. I&#x27;ll splurge on eyeshadow palettes all of the time, but I can&#x27;t stand dropping more than 10 bucks on a single brush. So, when I came across this kit, I was skeptical yet intrigued. It visually stood out to me from other brushes that quite frankly, looked a little cheap. The bristles are dense yet soft, and even though they DO pick up product well, I didn&#x27;t find the application amount to be satisfactory for me. However, you can use a cheap eyeshadow brush and it&#x27;s fine. However, it is undebatable that the brushes distribute the shadow perfectly and evenly. Usually when I blend, I find that the bristles will pick up some color and then deposit it elsewhere, so I really have to work the brush to not have a spotty crease color. This is pretty much why I bought the set; watching tutorials online, I noticed that most women use a soft domed brush for blending. Yup! The base shadow brush has become my crease&#x27;s best friend. The great thing is that there is a variety of brushes; it&#x27;s not like some kits where you get several that look very similar and are just different sizes. If you are even considering buying brushes, I&#x27;d get these. The great thing, especially if you are a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34;, is that there is a website by the designer with tutorials, so you can learn how to do makeup with the very brushes you own. I wish I had that luxury in the beginning. Also, doing the crease/outer v is typically hard for beginners, and you&#x27;ll be able to do it like a pro with these brushes. I&#x27;ve gotten good at it on brushes that take me so much longer to do it. This has literally cut my application time in half. I hope you enjoy these, and that this is helpful, especially since I know I&#x27;m rambling.</li>
            <li> Love this brush set! I use every brush almost daily and I love these more than my more expensive brushes. I am convinced that Real Techniques is the best affordable brush brand out there right now!</li>
            <li> These brushes work wonderful! I recommend them!</li>
            <li> Worked like expected!</li>
            <li> After seeing a lot of makeup gurus on YouTube use this brush (well, all the Real Techniques brushes), I was sold on the fact that they seemed to work so well on camera and the affordable prices. I&#x27;ve been using this brush for well over a month, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all the brushes work very well, my absolute favorite in this set is the Deluxe Crease Brush. I use this to blend out my concealer. It&#x27;s soft enough that the bristles won&#x27;t hurt the delicate skin under the eyes, I manage to achieve a more flawless coverage than I would using my ring finger to pat it in. I&#x27;ve washed these quite a few times already and there is no shedding of hairs or any other problems. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes.  Best ever.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!! I discovered these brushes friom one of the youtube videos and I had to try!!!! I was not disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and blends color well</li>
            <li> it was a gift and the receiver loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and tried different kind of brushes on the maket, cheap and very expensive ones and nothing as good as these Real technique brushes. I&#x27;m normally hopeless at doing makeup and now I start to get compliments when I go out for flawless makeup. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These are decent for starters but I can already tell I will be wanting new brushes soon.</li>
            <li> Those are the first eye brushes i ever bought. They are very comfortable and usable for many purposes. I think i will be starting to collct more brushes for higher-end results but if you dont know what to get and your a bit confused this is a very cost-effective set</li>
            <li> Hmm... What to say... I DO think that this is quite a nice starter set, though I found the sizes of the brushes to be somewhat odd. I found the blending and shadow brush to be too large, and the thin liner brush a little too long and flimsy which makes it hard to apply my gel liner. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this set, the sizes are just a little bit &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not displeased with them though, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, I love it</li>
            <li> This has become my go-to brush set. I can&#x27;t rave enough about these. I&#x27;ve watched Sam and Nic&#x27;s youtube videos (absolute recommend, they&#x27;re a godsend for people like me who aren&#x27;t very make-up savvy) and heard about them there. After reading some very positive reviews I decided to buy my own set and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the two largest brushes the most for my shadow application. The biggest one is a dream for blending. I also really love the liner brush. Unlike some other brushes I&#x27;ve had, these have never, ever shed on me. I couldn&#x27;t recommend these any higher, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT AND THE SUPER PACKAGING VERY VERY FAST DELIVERY&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> This is such a great buy!!! I had bought it at Ulta and was so impressed with the quality and specially the price I went ahead and bought more as gifts. :)</li>
            <li> Just loving my real technique brushes wouldn&#x27;t trade them in for nothing.  The price is right angles on with my make up very smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> The best brushes at a great price. The company also has instruction on line.</li>
            <li> Great brushes worth the miney</li>
            <li> some of the brushes in this set are not useful and/or kind of bristly on my skin. overall good set and good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for the price. I really only use the base shadow brush, and the crease brush (but for my under eyelid to give it definition). No bristles have fallen out after washing. But they all get the job done if needed</li>
            <li> only really like the bigger fluffier one for doing blending and use the thin smaller one that&#x27;s pointed to carve my brows out after I do them.  The eyeliner brush is trash, I guess these would be really good for someone who&#x27;s just started out with brushes who has never used better brushes like mac or sigma. The face brushes are GREAT! If you&#x27;re looking for some good powder and foundation blender etc. brushes then def go for them!</li>
            <li> Great brushes at a great price!</li>
            <li> These are great, I think they could be a little bit better quality, but they work well</li>
            <li> I really like this brush set.  The bristles are nice and soft, and it does a good job of applying makeup in the exact places you want it to.  I haven&#x27;t cleaned the brushes yet but I have no qualms that the bristles will come out, they look tight and well made.  My only complaint is the case.  I don&#x27;t like having to use two hands to get the brushes back in.  Really minor complaint though and nothing to do with the brushes though.  Great set at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes. I have this set (the starter set) and the &amp;#34;core collection&amp;#34; set. They are freakishly soft, clean SUPER easily, never lose bristles, maintain their unique shapes...and..oh yeah...they&#x27;re actually affordable. Professional makeup artist, Samantha Chapman (the brush creator), has amazing videos on the Real Techniques website and on YouTube that show you how to use the brushes (You can also see her and her sister, Nic, on Pixiwoo on YouTube and on their blog).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Professional makeup brushes at a non-professional price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and the case is super cool too :D</li>
            <li> Brushes are beautiful, work very well and do not shed. I would most certainly recommend these to any make up user, amateur or professional.  My only complaint would be that, for some reason, I was not sent the liner brush in the set of 5 and was instead given 2 of the small accent eye brushes.... Not sure why that would&#x27;ve happened, must&#x27;ve been a factory error or something. BUT STILL! Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> I found these at Ulta while looking for a large domed shadow brush that was the same size or slightly smaller than my Sonia Kashuk one from target. I have large eyes and that brush does quick work of applying eyeshadow and blending. I wanted another one but wanted a different colored handle so I could have one for dark eye shadows and light eye shadows without having to mix them.  I went to sephora and ulta and could not find any.  This set was the only one that had something similar to what I was looking for. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because I already had the other brushes and didn&#x27;t need them. I decided to get them anyway because the price of the set was cheaper than most single brushes I had and figured I&#x27;d give them to a friend but I ended up loving these brushes and giving away some of my more expensive brushes instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the colored handles because it makes them easy to differentiate and find the one I am looking for, making application slightly faster and when I am in a hurry, slightly less frustrating.  They are soft, don&#x27;t seem to shed, are easy to clean and offer great coverage.  I love the versatility of the brushes and the website offers great instructional videos on application and the various ways you can use them. This has been extremely helpful, even the finest brush not used correctly can be unsatisfactory.  I have since ordered some of the other brushes and now most of my brush collection consists of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you watch the videos, figure out which ones you want and buy them. Given the positive reviews they have received and the reasonable price, they are worth at least trying out.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the small angeled brush was a little less dense and more precise. I wanted to use it for my brows. Overall good quality brushes at a good value.</li>
            <li> Love it. Good quality. Worth your money. I am happy woth the decision I made. I recommend the product for all cosmetic lovers.</li>
            <li> These have lasted me a couple of years. I love them so much they apply everything very well.</li>
            <li> I usually buy all high end brushes and my favorite is Trish McEvoy brushes but these brushes are fabulous for the price and even if they were a bit more they would still be worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Also she has a link that you can go online and she shows you how to use the brushes properly!</li>
            <li> Really nice. The small brushes are definitely what I need and the skinny lightweight design of the handle helps me hold it so easily when doing things that require really steady hands. Love them.</li>
            <li> quality is perfect, so soft, smooth and easy to clean and dry ! only eye liner brush is too fat for nice and thin gel eye line. I&#x27;m using it for lips. Highly recommend to by this set.</li>
            <li> I dont exactly know how much does it cost every individual brush that real techiques sells. But I know for certain that I wouldnt buy this again because it&#x27;s not cool to check the brushes that come in here and notice that they dont work how they are supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that the only brush in this kit that does what it says it&#x27;s the accent brush. Because it has just the perfect size, cut and amount of bristles to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base shadow brush is a joke, as it is the deluxe crease one and the liner. Really? How big do you think human eyelids are? They are massive. (Yeah, I like to exaggerate... but no really, they are way too big).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could say that the brow brush is too big too, but I think is still usable if you apply shadow to fill in your eyebrows (I dont, I use a pencil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, My re-use?:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Deluxe crease brush to apply concealer, I think it really works for this, it has a great size and pressure to blend in creamy-liquidity concealers under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I havent yet figured out how to use the base shadow brush but I think it could work for applying liquid concealers around the face. (But I rarely do that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liner? Well, that thing is just too big. You could use it to line up your eyelids in halloween, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as I said, I dont use powder to fill in my eyebrows, so no really much use out of the angle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then do the math, I paid $15.50 for 2 brushes that I can definetely use and one that maybe I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth it? Better ask yourself before buying this kit.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with these brushes. I use the deluxe crease brush for concealing flaws. It is dome-shaped and blends out cream products quite nicely, and it works just as well to blend eyeshadow. Next, the base shadow brush works great for your base color. It is tapered, so you can use it as a blending brush as well. The smallest brush is great for applying shadow to my lower lash line or highlighting the tear duct area. The brow brush is quite thick and stout, but it works great for everyday use on your brows. Lastly, the liner brush I use wet to apply shadow as a liner to the upper lash line. This brush is not very fine - it will give you a thicker line. Overall, I am very happy with these and use at least one of them everyday!</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for my sister and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> The brush&#x27;s quality is perfect&lt;br /&gt;The hair is soft and easy to clean after used&lt;br /&gt;The angle brush too thick</li>
            <li> Lacking a blending brush but they&#x27;re super soft and don&#x27;t shed much at all. Nice for beginners. I watch pixiwoo all the time on youtube and didn&#x27;t realize this was their product until I read the back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned M.A.C., Sephora, IPSA, Shu Uemura brushes. Real Techniques brushes is the best overall. If nobody had told me the prices, I would have guessed at least $20 each. Yet it is less than that for a WHOLE SET! The crease brush is heavenly... And I just love how they are color-coded (purple for eye brushes, gold for face). Don&#x27;t even THINK about it. BUY NOW!</li>
            <li> I never knew I was doing it so wrong. These brushes aare the best.</li>
            <li> Feels like hard plastic on my face, I tried to give it a second chance but my final makeup wasn&#x27;t good too. I give two stars because is pretty and looks like expensive but you can buy the cheapest brush ever and will do the same work.</li>
            <li> Very soft and blend eye shadow to seamlessly. And it comes with a cute case. For those who are trying to start new with brushes or beginners these brush&#x27;s are what you are looking for! There just worth it</li>
            <li> I do not use the case because it&#x27;s hard to fit in my case, but overall, I love the brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem nice but I really like the standup case and that is the main reason I bought it so it could stand up on the vanity area where I use my makeup.  The elastic could be a little tighter on the left side (for larger brushes)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and quickly tossed my old ones and use only these.  Super quality, easy to clean, do the job wonderfully.  My only complaint is that the slanted brush is for eyebrows and therefore very stiff (e.g. hard bristles). I was hoping it&#x27;d be softer and thus I could use it for eyeshadow - I have an old slanted eyeshadow brush which I love for crease application. But alas, can&#x27;t use it that way, so I still need a replacement - however, otherwise the set is great and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love all of these brushes. They are very well made and work wonders. The case is very handy, too, I can fit 3 large brushes (powder, blush, and foundation) in addition, and the eyelash/brow groomer (not included). My only complaint is that this groomer is not included in the set - I find it essential for perfect mascara application. Also I will add - I don&#x27;t necessarily use each brush for what is specified on its handle. For example, I have a small eye crease, so I swap around the &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34; brush and the &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; brush. You just have to play around with them and find what works best for you!</li>
            <li> These were a great value for the money spent. I have not been disappointed with any of the Real Techniques brushes. I will continue to purchase more for my collection</li>
            <li> These brushes are labeled and easy to use. There is enough space for more brushes in the holder too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m especially happy with the eye brow brush. My eye brows look more natural than ever.</li>
            <li> great to slip in your bag for a weekend getaway but not the best for my use. they are definitely soft however. so far i&#x60;ve used only the blender brush.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with all the Real Techniques brushes I own. This set is probably my favorite of the ones I own and I use it daily. I was concerned that the deluxe crease brush was too big for the crease, but it actually works beautifully and buffs eye shadow out like a dream for a smokey eye. I also thought the brow brush was too thick and big for the job, but I tried it and it was fantastic! Such a steal for the price, too!</li>
