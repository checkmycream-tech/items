            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>This was a pleasant exception, however --</li>
            <li>Definitely a favorite!</li>
            <li>the beautiful scent was true to its source.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>I s, going to attempt to make my own Goddess body wash.  </li>
            <li>Love the Egyption Goddess perfume and thought this would be a good compliment.  </li>
            <li>It has a beautiful soft scent that is great for layering.</li>
            <li>it is very good i am enjoying it very well and hope you will keep up the good work</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of Egyptian Goddess perfumed oil from Auric Blends and was thrilled to see they had a complementary bath soap.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Goddess is one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>The soap is light and makes a nice foam, without a &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>In 40 years of wearing perfumes, I&#x27;ve never had more compliments than I&#x27;ve gotten in the 2 years I&#x27;ve been wearing Egyptian Goddess.</li>
            <li>I have this brand Egyptian Goddess Oil and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay, the smell isn&#x27;t as strong for a soap.</li>
            <li>Does not have strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a nothing kind of purchase.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smells then this is a good soap for you.</li>
            <li>has a great smell that lingers long throughout the day.</li>
            <li>You feel clean and refreshed after using it.  </li>
            <li>But the bar dissolves somewhat quick.</li>
            <li>Goes quick though.</li>
            <li>Vendor shipped items quickly.</li>
            <li>Better to use the R Goddess perfume oil as a body moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Vendors, sellers and drug stores have lowered the price of the large E Goddess perfume oil dowm to as little as $17 with free shipping which is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was able to find a seller here on Amazon who had more than a few bars available for sale.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very nice to use at night after a long day; it leaves just a gentle scent all over -- not too strong, but definitely noticeable and enjoyed by those close by.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a special cachet using Auric Blends blends and they are very affordable.</li>
            <li>rcommend anyone interested in the E Goddess soap try it</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My money would have been better suited to be saved towards my next bottle of oils.</li>
            <li>I am partial to the Auric Blends products and use a Somali Rose roll on oil made by another Amazon seller as a personal deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And will to the same with LOVE which is a white amber version of E Goddess.  </li>
            <li>this soap smells so good.i always get compliments.it is not strong and leaves a light fresh scent on your skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS HIGH FOR A BAR OF SOAP</li>
            <li>The scent is not exactly the same as the perfume but still nice.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent, just wish the scent had been a little stronger.  </li>
            <li>I bought the bar thinking I could get a little more of that scent on me, but it seems to have no affect at all.</li>
            <li>soap smelled different  at first out of packaging but after the air  git to it</li>
            <li>I am usually hesitant to buy soaps of my favorite scents, as they always seem to disappoint me by altering the scent with the nature of the soap.  </li>
            <li>I only wish the bar were larger -- it goes fairly quickly, so be sure to let it dry thoroughly between uses.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is a soft, buttery bar that leaves my skin feeling well-moisturized.  </li>
            <li>this tome on the E Goddess soap has enlghtened you and that you are able to get yor hands on st least ONE bar to try.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like no other.</li>
            <li>It does the job well and is not harsh like Irish Spring or anti bac bars,  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It was very small.  It doesn&#x27;t have any perfume scent to it and I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great but it is a little drying and I did purchase a larger size at shop in Cape May Nj for $10</li>
            <li> soap smelled different  at first out of packaging but after the air  git to it n it was wet the beautiful scent was true to its source.</li>
            <li> I am usually hesitant to buy soaps of my favorite scents, as they always seem to disappoint me by altering the scent with the nature of the soap.  This was a pleasant exception, however -- it imparts a delicate essence of the exact scent of Egyptian Goddess oil to my skin.  The soap itself is a soft, buttery bar that leaves my skin feeling well-moisturized.  It perfumes the air nicely during my shower too, making mornings a little less painful!  It&#x27;s also very nice to use at night after a long day; it leaves just a gentle scent all over -- not too strong, but definitely noticeable and enjoyed by those close by.  Highly recommended.  I only wish the bar were larger -- it goes fairly quickly, so be sure to let it dry thoroughly between uses.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have purchased it elsewhere and they arrived with no fragrance.  This one smells like it is supposed to and I received it earlier then I anticipated.</li>
            <li> it is very good i am enjoying it very well and hope you will keep up the good work bye.</li>
            <li> has a great smell that lingers long throughout the day. But the bar dissolves somewhat quick. Love this fragrance. It&#x27;s like no other.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is one of my favorite fragrances. It has a beautiful soft scent that is great for layering. Using the soap together with the oil/perfume is not overpowering. Soap feels and smells like a luxury. Definitely a favorite!</li>
            <li> Got as a gift for my mother. She likes it. Nice smell. Just like the perfume oil. Goes quick though.</li>
            <li> this soap smells so good.i always get compliments.it is not strong and leaves a light fresh scent on your skin</li>
            <li> Obtaining this Egyptian Goddess soap is close to impossible.  Fortunately I was able to find a seller here on Amazon who had more than a few bars available for sale.&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, the Auric Blends site is out of stock for the Goddess soap as wel as the soap for LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is small considering thr price.  I purchased an inexpensive wood soap to prevent it from shrinking futher.&lt;br /&gt;And will work further with it,&lt;br /&gt;As with the Goddess perfume oil, there little if any scent.  Now you smell it..now you don&#x27;t.  It does the job well and is not harsh like Irish Spring or anti bac bars,  You feel clean and refreshed after using it.  Pricewise, there are more expensive imported soaps on the market.  I am partial to the Auric Blends products and use a Somali Rose roll on oil made by another Amazon seller as a personal deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have an issue using the Goddess as the Abdul Kareem Egyptian Musk oil is uni-sex.&lt;br /&gt;There is a special cachet using Auric Blends blends and they are very affordable. I s, going to attempt to make my own Goddess body wash.  And will to the same with LOVE which is a white amber version of E Goddess.  Both of thosr scents work well&lt;br /&gt;when mixed together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rcommend anyone interested in the E Goddess soap try it ar least once,,it won&#x27;t break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;As the bars are small a wooden soap soap will help conserve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try it being I like Auric Blends products in general.&lt;br /&gt;My every day soap is a 2/$5 shea butter soap I get from the African store. It comes in a yellow box and they also&lt;br /&gt;have an inexpensive organic shea butter in a yellow tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Goddess lotion.  It&#x27;s just ok.  Better to use the R Goddess perfume oil as a body moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Vendors, sellers and drug stores have lowered the price of the large E Goddess perfume oil dowm to as little as $17 with free shipping which is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this tome on the E Goddess soap has enlghtened you and that you are able to get yor hands on st least ONE bar to try.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for readkng my review.</li>
            <li> Love the Egyption Goddess perfume and thought this would be a good compliment.  The scent is not exactly the same as the perfume but still nice.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of Egyptian Goddess perfumed oil from Auric Blends and was thrilled to see they had a complementary bath soap. They&#x27;ve matched the scent perfectly! The soap is light and makes a nice foam, without a &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34; feeling. Each bar lasts as long as a comparably-sized bath soap. In 40 years of wearing perfumes, I&#x27;ve never had more compliments than I&#x27;ve gotten in the 2 years I&#x27;ve been wearing Egyptian Goddess. I hope the company never goes out of business! I&#x27;ll continue to buy the soap AND the perfumed oil from now on.</li>
            <li> Does not have strong fragrance.  The soap left my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, just wish the scent had been a little stronger.  Vendor shipped items quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay, the smell isn&#x27;t as strong for a soap.</li>
            <li> I was not not impressed with this product. It was too expensive (for a bar of soap). It arrived in a timely manner, however I will pass next time.</li>
            <li> I have this brand Egyptian Goddess Oil and absolutely love it. I bought the bar thinking I could get a little more of that scent on me, but it seems to have no affect at all. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference since using it. It&#x27;s really a nothing kind of purchase. My money would have been better suited to be saved towards my next bottle of oils.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess has become my signature smell. I only wish the soap was stronger with the scent. It&#x27;s okay. If you are sensitive to smells then this is a good soap for you.</li>
            <li> NO SENT WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN THE PRICE IS HIGH FOR A BAR OF SOAP BUT THEY SHIPPED FINETHE PRODUCT IS NOT GOOD  NOT THE SHIPPER</li>
