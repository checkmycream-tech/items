    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The hood arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best quality</li>
            <li>This bonnet is one of my best purchases ever.  </li>
            <li>This worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li>Great price for it</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>very handy and portable.  </li>
            <li>I love this bonnet!</li>
            <li>Very light weight.</li>
            <li>I wish though it had a  better string to adjust the cap.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit all hair dryers and it burnt a hole in the Bonnett at the end that covers the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up nicely and i only have to be there for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I had to laugh when I saw myself trying to wrangle this thing to make it stay on.</li>
            <li>love how inexpensive it is , as apposed to purchasing an actual dryer stand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heat is not distributing evenly, some spot gets way too hot.</li>
            <li>My hair dryer was too much for the bonnet -It just blew off!</li>
            <li>Better to use with a low temp setting on the hair drier to avoid getting too hot in the bonnet.</li>
            <li>Only with I had ordered more than one.</li>
            <li>You cannot beat the price and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>The nozzle of my dryer was too large for the end of this bonnet and the elastic end did not even stretch to acomodate the size of it.</li>
            <li>This works really well for my protien treatments!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>only downside I can detect so far is that the air blows all the way to the top of the hood and not too much on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>It works for me until I can get a real one.</li>
            <li>My blow dryer has 3 settings, (low, medium and high) And even on the lowest setting, this dryer cap blows straight off my head.</li>
            <li>Took to long to come other than that I was satisfied</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ll have to do is condition with a heating cap &amp; go back to blow-drying gently.</li>
            <li>I have locs and I am able to dry my thick long hair so much faster now!</li>
            <li>the hood is too small to fit my head after with my big rollers on.</li>
            <li>The string that is supposed to tighten it down on the head is really a joke as well.</li>

            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> It holds the heat in and is not hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It does not stay on your head properly and I had to cut it a little to get it around my small blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Just not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> This never worked and it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this.</li>
            <li> The bonnet does not fit on a hood style hairdryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if they reversed the tail part of the bonnet, the wider end close to bonnet and the narrow part at the end.  </li>
            <li> I have a way of leaving stuff behind and don&#x27;t want this to happen and not have a back up at home.  </li>
            <li> the connect loop for the blow dryer is way too tight, very hard to get it on and stay on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use with my blow dryer but attached instead to my bonnet dryer that was broken where the bonnet that came with it could no longer attach.</li>
            <li> so I am unable to use it.  </li>
            <li> I started tying a hairband around the base of the hood and Bobby pins to keep it on my head.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t stay on my head at all</li>
            <li> This never worked and it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> This works really well for my protien treatments!&lt;br /&gt;I love how inexpensive it is , as apposed to purchasing an actual dryer stand.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up nicely and i only have to be there for 30 minutes. I would suggest buying this product instead of one of tose thermal head turbans if you are trying to make a decision between both.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can detect so far is that the air blows all the way to the top of the hood and not too much on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that , it is portable and it get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
            <li> This did not stay on my head nor the hair dryer. I had to hold everything in place and then my hair was fuzzy afterward. This may work for some but did not for me.</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money! It doesn&#x27;t stay on Your head while in use.</li>
            <li> the hood is too small to fit my head after with my big rollers on. The heat is not distributing evenly, some spot gets way too hot. the connect loop for the blow dryer is way too tight, very hard to get it on and stay on. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this.</li>
            <li> It does not stay on your head properly and I had to cut it a little to get it around my small blow dryer. Great price for it but I guess you get what you pay for. It took forever to be delievered to me!!!</li>
            <li> The hood arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I would use these buyers again.</li>
            <li> My hair dryer was too much for the bonnet -It just blew off! What I&#x27;ll have to do is condition with a heating cap &amp; go back to blow-drying gently.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit all hair dryers and it burnt a hole in the Bonnett at the end that covers the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It fried my hairdryer!</li>
            <li> Took to long to come other than that I was satisfied</li>
            <li> The nozzle of my dryer was too large for the end of this bonnet and the elastic end did not even stretch to acomodate the size of it.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. It didn&#x27;t cost a lot, thank God! My blow dryer has 3 settings, (low, medium and high) And even on the lowest setting, this dryer cap blows straight off my head. The only way it will stay on if if I hold the front and back of this cap down on my head. The string that is supposed to tighten it down on the head is really a joke as well. For me the idea was to dry my hair without a lot of extra hassle. If that&#x27;s what you are looking for, this is not it. I had to laugh when I saw myself trying to wrangle this thing to make it stay on. Just not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Product is everything I hoped for.  Better to use with a low temp setting on the hair drier to avoid getting too hot in the bonnet.</li>
            <li> The bonnet does not fit on a hood style hairdryer so I am unable to use it.  It&#x27;s as if they reversed the tail part of the bonnet, the wider end close to bonnet and the narrow part at the end.  Just the opposite of my current bonnet.  It will work on a blower but that doesn&#x27;t serve my purpose.</li>
            <li> It flies off your head, even with the blow dryer on low. I started tying a hairband around the base of the hood and Bobby pins to keep it on my head. It&#x27;s not the best quality but you get  what you pay for. It works for me until I can get a real one.</li>
            <li> This bonnet is one of my best purchases ever.  I purchased this to use with my blow dryer but attached instead to my bonnet dryer that was broken where the bonnet that came with it could no longer attach. OMG! This worked perfectly.  I plan to purchase another one for travel. I have a way of leaving stuff behind and don&#x27;t want this to happen and not have a back up at home.  Shipping was slow but well worth the wait. It holds the heat in and is not hot to the touch.  Very light weight. Just can&#x27;t say enough! Love it!! Only with I had ordered more than one.</li>
            <li> I love this bonnet! You cannot beat the price and it does exactly what it says. I have locs and I am able to dry my thick long hair so much faster now! I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> very handy and portable.  I wish though it had a  better string to adjust the cap.  The stopper for the string does not stay put.</li>
