            <li>This is a great all around product.  </li>
            <li>Still happy with it.</li>
            <li>So happy I discovered it.  </li>
            <li>Good for cuts, fungus, and scars.</li>
            <li>just a good ozonated olive oil.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS GEL!</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing  used it for co2 after care  very good</li>
            <li>It has very strong sense</li>
            <li>/&gt;This wasn&#x27;t in gel form, it was more like Aquaphor/petroleum consistency.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the most phenomenal skin cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It clears burns, pimples, staph, cuts, etc better and faster than anything else besides prayer.</li>
            <li>It took some time to get used to the smell, but now I love it.  </li>
            <li>the muscles seem to heal better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smelled WAY to strong.</li>
            <li>While it does have a strong ozone smell, that goes away.  </li>
            <li>Ozene has been helping to heal my breakouts tremendously!</li>
            <li>but im sure great for other stuff</li>
            <li>Amazing natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I got poison ivy and this helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>It seems to work fairly well as a deodorant, if one is normally active.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it for that and think I would have to mix in some essential oil to make it smell better.  </li>
            <li>However, my most recent order of 2 jars came with both jars smelling rancid.</li>
            <li>Lest you think I&#x27;m just smelling the &#x27;Ozene odor&#x27;, I want to assure you that the rancid Ozene is also less effective.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried (and for me, about as effective as regular deodorant).  </li>
            <li>I think very highly of it as a toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very hydrating product.</li>
            <li>It works very well--</li>
            <li>On hot days the gel in the jar will liquify but it will reharden when cool again with no apparent loss of effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>The odor is very strong and a little unbearable.</li>
            <li>While I like Ozene better than the PUR 03 brand, the PUR 03 seller I&#x27;ve ordered from sends their Ozonated olive oil in a refrigerated package, they keep it in a cooled storage facility, and their product costs less.</li>
            <li>It does reek but that doesn&#x27;t bother me, especially since I mostly use this on my feet for softness and the occasional athlete&#x27;s toe (haaa) or nail issues.</li>
            <li>worked great for any minor sports injuries I had when I started running, like small pains, just rub some on and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I bought this cream for my husband, he had developed some rashes on his face from the sun.  </li>
            <li>My gums are much healthier after a few weeks of a tiny smear on the front teeth and then brushing with my electric brush, and no bad breath at all.</li>
            <li>I kind of feel bad leaving a not so stellar review on a natural product, but I had to return</li>
            <li>It takes such a small amount of this product, I purchased a jar a couple of months ago and even after using regularly I still have more than 80% of the jar left.</li>
            <li>Although it took some time to get past the \\&quot;ozone\\&quot; smell when using this, I was amazed at how well and quickly it worked to heal a boo-boo.  </li>

            <li> and I usually like unusual ...</li>
            <li> - however I opened the first one in this order and it is runny and not a good</li>
            <li> I have been using Ozene for a long time.</li>
            <li> Acne on the face, back or any other part of the skin, rashes, cuts, bruges, scars, torn nails...</li>
            <li> I used it again that morning and again overnight and by the second morning it was all healed up, a tiny flake of dry skin came off and you could hardly tell where the bite had been.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get by applying it every other day though.  </li>
            <li> a bit cheaper than some other ones you might get.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell to product.</li>
            <li> I use about a jar in 30 days; keep the lid on tight so the oxygen stays in the solution.  </li>
            <li> Also I think it actually Made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> But after a few days of using this cream, they have gone away.</li>
            <li> Well this stuff immediately relieves the pain and the bump is gone within a day or two without a scar left behind.  </li>
            <li> just wish it were a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order Ozene again, I wish this hadn&#x27;t happened.</li>
            <li> Three  weeks of use and the scar is at least 60 percent gone.</li>
            <li> I also use it when I get those painful, inflammed red bumps on my legs or bra line from sweat.  </li>
            <li> I had to return this cream because ozone is not good for people, even in cream</li>
            <li> and they leave scars behind after they are gone.  </li>
            <li> Feels stickie and smells weird...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately had no impact on my problem.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could contact someone as this is almost useless in this form!</li>
            <li> I have skin problems in my groin areas and it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> Hate this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>

            <li> Hate this stuff!  Feels stickie and smells weird...and I usually like unusual ... NOT THIS!</li>
            <li> I kind of feel bad leaving a not so stellar review on a natural product, but I had to return this.&lt;br /&gt;It smelled WAY to strong. I used it at night when my husband was away. There is no way I&#x27;d use when he&#x27;s here, or again, period.&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t in gel form, it was more like Aquaphor/petroleum consistency.  Also I think it actually Made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> Excellent for rashes and all manner of skin irritations. I got poison ivy and this helped tremendously. It also helps your skin heal from burns, heat rash, and cuts. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately had no impact on my problem.  I have skin problems in my groin areas and it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I&#x27;m &amp;#34;fortywhatever&amp;#34; and still battle with acne. Ozene has been helping to heal my breakouts tremendously!</li>
            <li> It has very strong sense</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing  used it for co2 after care  very good</li>
            <li> After using this i can happily say that this is a great quality product.  I would buy this again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Speeds healing !&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t heal my psoriasis but im sure great for other stuff</li>
            <li> I had a scar on my arm from a botched dermatology procedure. It was awful. It did not improve at all over 4 months of unassisted healing. The day after I started using this, my husband noticed the change . Three  weeks of use and the scar is at least 60 percent gone. Going to keep this up.</li>
            <li> Product works. There is a slight smell to product. I call it the ozonated smell :-)&lt;br /&gt;May be greasy to some individuals.</li>
            <li> This is probably the most phenomenal skin cream I have ever used. While it does have a strong ozone smell, that goes away.  It&#x27;s a very hydrating product. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my husband, he had developed some rashes on his face from the sun.  He works outdoors.  But after a few days of using this cream, they have gone away.</li>
            <li> Although it took some time to get past the \\&quot;ozone\\&quot; smell when using this, I was amazed at how well and quickly it worked to heal a boo-boo.  I had scratched a mosquito bite so much it left a wound, when I used this (just a tiny dab) overnight it was visably starting to heal when I checked it in the morning.  I used it again that morning and again overnight and by the second morning it was all healed up, a tiny flake of dry skin came off and you could hardly tell where the bite had been.  My neighbor swears by this for controlling under arm odor...I have not tried it for that and think I would have to mix in some essential oil to make it smell better.  It takes such a small amount of this product, I purchased a jar a couple of months ago and even after using regularly I still have more than 80% of the jar left.</li>
            <li> This stuff is literally like a skin miracle elixir.  It clears burns, pimples, staph, cuts, etc better and faster than anything else besides prayer.</li>
            <li> Good for cuts, fungus, and scars. Won&#x27;t do a THING for molluscum, just FYI. It does reek but that doesn&#x27;t bother me, especially since I mostly use this on my feet for softness and the occasional athlete&#x27;s toe (haaa) or nail issues. I THINK it helps fade/heal scars, as well.</li>
            <li> best deodorant  ever - however I opened the first one in this order and it is runny and not a good situation- I wish I could contact someone as this is almost useless in this form!</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever!!</li>
            <li> This is a great all around product.  I use it as deodorant since the oxygen kills the bacteria that make you smell when you sweat!  Awesome to not have a bunch of chemicals!  I also use it when I get those painful, inflammed red bumps on my legs or bra line from sweat.  They are almost like a boil--ouch they hurt--and they leave scars behind after they are gone.  Well this stuff immediately relieves the pain and the bump is gone within a day or two without a scar left behind.  Practically a miracle!  I use about a jar in 30 days; keep the lid on tight so the oxygen stays in the solution.  On hot days the gel in the jar will liquify but it will reharden when cool again with no apparent loss of effectiveness.  It works very well--just wish it were a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> I am on my second tub of Ozene.  It seems to work fairly well as a deodorant, if one is normally active. However, I would not agree that it can &amp;#34;go several days in between applications&amp;#34;. I use it daily. I also have begun to use this as a toothpaste after reading that it can heal gum disease and cavities.  My gums are much healthier after a few weeks of a tiny smear on the front teeth and then brushing with my electric brush, and no bad breath at all. I think very highly of it as a toothpaste. Also it works almost immediately on skin irritations and rashes.  I used this on a diaper rash that was unresponsive to calendula cream, and it went away by the next diaper change.  I will always have Ozene on hand.</li>
            <li> I had to return this cream because ozone is not good for people, even in cream</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use as deodorant.  It took some time to get used to the smell, but now I love it.  It works better than any other natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried (and for me, about as effective as regular deodorant).  Can&#x27;t get by applying it every other day though.  Still happy with it.</li>
            <li> Amazing natural deodorant.  So happy I discovered it.  It doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or leave any residue.  works great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the miracle gel. We put it on everything skin related. Acne on the face, back or any other part of the skin, rashes, cuts, bruges, scars, torn nails... you name it. It&#x27;s our go to gel. EVERYONE should have this in your house and office. LOVE THIS GEL!</li>
            <li> The odor is very strong and a little unbearable.</li>
            <li> great for skin rashes/dry skin/itchy skin!</li>
            <li> just a good ozonated olive oil. a bit cheaper than some other ones you might get. worked great for any minor sports injuries I had when I started running, like small pains, just rub some on and the muscles seem to heal better.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ozene for a long time. I LOVE this product. However, my most recent order of 2 jars came with both jars smelling rancid. Lest you think I&#x27;m just smelling the &#x27;Ozene odor&#x27;, I want to assure you that the rancid Ozene is also less effective. Use caution when ordering. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order Ozene again, I wish this hadn&#x27;t happened. While I like Ozene better than the PUR 03 brand, the PUR 03 seller I&#x27;ve ordered from sends their Ozonated olive oil in a refrigerated package, they keep it in a cooled storage facility, and their product costs less. I&#x27;m definitely in a quandary.</li>
