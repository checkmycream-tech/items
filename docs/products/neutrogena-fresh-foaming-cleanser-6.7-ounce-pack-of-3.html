    <ol>
            <li>The price is excellent.</li>
            <li>Best face cleanser I ever used.</li>
            <li>I have used this cleanser for over five years and it&#x27;s the best cleanser for removing makeup.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena products are very good !</li>
            <li>Best cleanser I had so far!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price for the quality.</li>
            <li>This is truly a great cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was delighted with the way this cleanser works on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>A lot of my friends recommended it and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I took 1 star off as it does not foam a lot even though the name says \\&quot;Foaming\\&quot;) and we tend to use more than we ideally would have liked to for every use.</li>
            <li>Of all the make-up removers that I have tried, Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser has proven to me to be the best make-up remover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin, great for all skin types and also great for removing even waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>We liked that too, but it was a touch too moisturizing for our skin.</li>
            <li>And Amazon offers for a great price too!</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>When used more than once a day with my skin it dries it out.</li>
            <li>But it was and for many of us the abrasion isnt necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one based on Paula Begoun&#x27;s review....and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many cleansers, including Olay Foaming Face Wash (which I dislike), but I am now sticking with this product.</li>
            <li>After years of searching, I read some consumer testing that this was the best facial cleanser</li>
            <li>All in all, very good reasons to trust that this would be my dream facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>but true !  </li>
            <li>And this one is a very good deal coming at a little more than 4 bucks for a bottle whereas in the store it&#x27;s 6-7 dollars per bottle.</li>
            <li>It is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It turns out all of the \\&quot;acne\\&quot; products I&#x27;d used through my teen years did more DAMAGE to my skin than good - still</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying, doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy, and rinses completely clean.</li>
            <li>It does clean the mascara from my lashes, but no matter what I do</li>
            <li>1-It is very gentle &amp; non-drying; 2-It thoroughly removes make-up; 3-It suds up nicely; 4-The price is quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li>, Purpose Gentle Cleanser by Johnson and Johnson is much better.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a better gentle cleanser I recommend Purpose, you can find it at walmart, target, or any drugstore</li>
            <li>It thoroughly cleans my face with a soft sudsy foam that works up fairly quickly and rinses off nicely leaving my skin feeling moisturized and not &#x27;crinkly&#x27;</li>
            <li>Their Oil Free Eye Makeup Remover is much better at mascara removal and does not sting or irritate sensitive skin around eyes.</li>
            <li>Because of this I always try to use a product I know to be hypo-allergenic and mild on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I even asked my dermatologist if using this product was OK versus using something prescribed or some high end cosmetic counter cleanser</li>
            <li>It lathers better and is soap free, so it does not dry or irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light and it works great without drying the skin and without irritating the eyes.</li>
            <li>I found that my skin remained sticky after using the Fresh Foaming Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>A rare combination.</li>
            <li>but IMO it works far better and leaves the skin feeling cleaner when used with water.  </li>
            <li>Additonally the 3 pack is an economical way to buy the product.</li>
            <li>It removes my makeup, rinses nicely, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I am an older red-head with very fair, sensitive skin and have rosacea as well as a couple of other skin problems.  </li>
            <li>I have recently found a better cleanser though</li>
            <li>Funny ....</li>
            <li>Several reasons why I love this cleanser:  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for over a year and it is absolutely my favorite facial cleaner</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I will be keeping this as a staple in my beauty box for a LONG time :)</li>
            <li>There are only two products to which I am fiercely loyal, and this is one of them!  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I came across this cleanser while searching for gentle washes.  </li>
            <li>Cleans without  drying too much.    </li>
            <li>really takes off all make up,</li>
            <li>It is even reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>it and recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Mary Kay forever and this really cleans and leaves your fact soft.</li>
            <li>I am in the market for a new skin care line.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product for someone with no skin problems who wants a reliable gentle cleanser for daily use.  </li>
            <li>but sometimes  arrived as single packs, requiring you to ask them for  a refund or re-shipment (of which they quickly obliged)    </li>
            <li>Black tiny spots on my nose went away, it  even removes mascara easily!</li>
            <li>It does remove daily grime, oil and make-up pretty well.</li>
            <li>and he told me that it was a solid product, so with that and my experiences with the product and the discount I can find here on Amazon, I have no trouble recommending this product with high praise!</li>
            <li>We have been using this as our daily face wash for a while now and really like it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>I will say that I gave if 4 out of 5 stars because it does not remove all of my eye makeup, mascara and liner pencil specifically, completely.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find my usual Oil Free Eye Makeup Remover in the store</li>
            <li>I tend to have very sensitive skin, especially around my eyes, and lot of things sting them.  </li>
            <li>The pump dispenses one use and does not contamnate the unsed product in the bottle which is why jar packaging or bar soaps are poor choices for most skin</li>
            <li>This is a dependable cleanser from Neutrogena which works well on normal to dry skin without any abrasion or exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>, it gets my face the cleanest and does not dry my face nor make it feel tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the side effects of Accutane is severely dry skin - this cleanser did not burn, sting, or otherwise irritate my sensitive skin the way other cleansers certainly would have.</li>
            <li>I tried to keep using it, thinking maybe my skin just needed to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; to the new cleanser, but my face would not clear up, so I quit using it and went back to Purpose.</li>

            <li> the moment I have dried it.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a well respected brand and reviews are usually favorable for their products.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my experience was very different.  </li>
            <li> In the past, some amazon  3-packs of shampoo/soap were listed as 3-packs</li>

            <li> However, when I started using it, my face broke out really bad.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There are only two products to which I am fiercely loyal, and this is one of them!  It removes all of my makeup, including my L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous mascara (the other product), in one step.  It&#x27;s not drying, doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy, and rinses completely clean.</li>
            <li> I am in the market for a new skin care line.  I am an older red-head with very fair, sensitive skin and have rosacea as well as a couple of other skin problems.  Neutrogena is a well respected brand and reviews are usually favorable for their products.  Additionally, a co-worker swears by this facial cleanser.  All in all, very good reasons to trust that this would be my dream facial cleanser.  Unfortunately, my experience was very different.  I found that my skin remained sticky after using the Fresh Foaming Cleanser.  No matter how much water I used; no matter what method I used, my face always was sticky--even after using a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed for myself.  The price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Alittle stronger than I expected from a face wash.  Also smells stronger than expected, as opposed to a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent.  Says you can remove eye make-up with it, but I wouldn&#x27;t.  Seems like it would burn or sting eyes.  Wanted to try something different, but I&#x27;ll stick to Dove.</li>
            <li> Of all the make-up removers that I have tried, Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser has proven to me to be the best make-up remover.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find my usual Oil Free Eye Makeup Remover in the store so bought this instead.Stings and not helpful removing waterproof eye makeup as claims on back. Their Oil Free Eye Makeup Remover is much better at mascara removal and does not sting or irritate sensitive skin around eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. I figured out that i can only use it on my oil areas (nose, chin, and forehead). When used on my cheeks it dries it way up. Also i use it once a day ONLY! When used more than once a day with my skin it dries it out.</li>
            <li> Best face cleanser I ever used. You can get it in your eyes and it doesn&#x27;t burn, and it removes all your make-up. It is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for over five years and it&#x27;s the best cleanser for removing makeup. Believe me I have tried plenty of products in between and I always return to this. The scent is very light and it works great without drying the skin and without irritating the eyes. It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin, great for all skin types and also great for removing even waterproof makeup. A rare combination. It&#x27;s a great price for the quality. I really recommend it. This is truly a great cleanser.</li>
            <li> I came across this cleanser while searching for gentle washes.  I have used it for 4 weeks now and I had to finally stop, it left my skin feeling dry and looking dull.  I have recently found a better cleanser though, Purpose Gentle Cleanser by Johnson and Johnson is much better.  It lathers better and is soap free, so it does not dry or irritate my skin at all.  If you are looking for a better gentle cleanser I recommend Purpose, you can find it at walmart, target, or any drugstore but it is a little bit cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> We have been using this as our daily face wash for a while now and really like it. It is gentle yet deep cleaning. I took 1 star off as it does not foam a lot even though the name says \\&quot;Foaming\\&quot;) and we tend to use more than we ideally would have liked to for every use. It does remove daily grime, oil and make-up pretty well. And Amazon offers for a great price too!</li>
            <li> I tend to have very sensitive skin, especially around my eyes, and lot of things sting them.  Because of this I always try to use a product I know to be hypo-allergenic and mild on the eyes.  I was delighted with the way this cleanser works on my skin.  It thoroughly cleans my face with a soft sudsy foam that works up fairly quickly and rinses off nicely leaving my skin feeling moisturized and not &#x27;crinkly&#x27; the moment I have dried it.  I will say that I gave if 4 out of 5 stars because it does not remove all of my eye makeup, mascara and liner pencil specifically, completely.  It does clean the mascara from my lashes, but no matter what I do I have that mini raccoon look around my eyes.  So, to combat this, I use an eye makeup remover (see my review list to check out the product that works well for me) BEFORE washing with this face wash and I am thrilled with the results.  I even asked my dermatologist if using this product was OK versus using something prescribed or some high end cosmetic counter cleanser and he told me that it was a solid product, so with that and my experiences with the product and the discount I can find here on Amazon, I have no trouble recommending this product with high praise!</li>
            <li> It works well for my normal-to-dry skin. Cleans without  drying too much.    Can&#x27;t beat the price (cheaper than walmart/target)    Also, it *does* come in a 3-pack. In the past, some amazon  3-packs of shampoo/soap were listed as 3-packs but sometimes  arrived as single packs, requiring you to ask them for  a refund or re-shipment (of which they quickly obliged)    Super-saver shipping arrived via USPS (from Washington here  to California). They mailed it Saturday, I got it Tuesday.</li>
            <li> The girlfriend loves it !  I bought for her and she takes it everywhere !  Funny .... but true !  Neutrogena products are very good !</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I had so far!&lt;br /&gt;It really takes off all make up, even waterproof mascara and eyeliner and without effort!&lt;br /&gt;Great!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this for about 10 years. We both have combination/oily skin. It removes my makeup, rinses nicely, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It is even reasonably priced. I can&#x27;t think of a downside. Once we tried Olay&#x27;s version. We liked that too, but it was a touch too moisturizing for our skin.</li>
            <li> This is a dependable cleanser from Neutrogena which works well on normal to dry skin without any abrasion or exfoliation.  It supposedly works on dry (aka not wet) skin or skin moistened with water before use but IMO it works far better and leaves the skin feeling cleaner when used with water.  The pump dispenses one use and does not contamnate the unsed product in the bottle which is why jar packaging or bar soaps are poor choices for most skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was used to cleansers with grains it took a little while to feel that my skin was cleaned without the abrasion.  But it was and for many of us the abrasion isnt necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product for someone with no skin problems who wants a reliable gentle cleanser for daily use.  Additonally the 3 pack is an economical way to buy the product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I&#x27;ve used Mary Kay forever and this really cleans and leaves your fact soft. I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one based on Paula Begoun&#x27;s review....and fell in love with it. Black tiny spots on my nose went away, it  even removes mascara easily! And this one is a very good deal coming at a little more than 4 bucks for a bottle whereas in the store it&#x27;s 6-7 dollars per bottle.</li>
            <li> Several reasons why I love this cleanser:  1-It is very gentle &amp; non-drying; 2-It thoroughly removes make-up; 3-It suds up nicely; 4-The price is quite reasonable.  I have tried many cleansers, including Olay Foaming Face Wash (which I dislike), but I am now sticking with this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this cleanser.  A lot of my friends recommended it and loved it.  However, when I started using it, my face broke out really bad.  I tried to keep using it, thinking maybe my skin just needed to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; to the new cleanser, but my face would not clear up, so I quit using it and went back to Purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for over three years now, and won&#x27;t even think about trying something different. As someone who suffered from moderate to severe cystic acne in my late teens, I went on Accutane and started using this cleanser as recommended my my dermatologist. One of the side effects of Accutane is severely dry skin - this cleanser did not burn, sting, or otherwise irritate my sensitive skin the way other cleansers certainly would have. It turns out all of the \\&quot;acne\\&quot; products I&#x27;d used through my teen years did more DAMAGE to my skin than good - still to this day I avoid any product with Salicyclic Acid or Benzoil Peroxide as the active ingredient. Since completing my Accutane treatment, I get occasional \\&quot;stress\\&quot; breakouts, but I have continued to use this cleanser because it works! It does remove makeup, and dirt, and oil, and whatever else comes in contact with your face! It does remove eye makeup! Maybe not as well as Neutrogena&#x27;s eye makeup remover pads, but it does the job to the point you won&#x27;t have black streaks on your pillowcase in the morning. I don&#x27;t find that this cleanser makes my face feel \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; as some of the other reviewers did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will be keeping this as a staple in my beauty box for a LONG time :)</li>
            <li> After years of searching, I read some consumer testing that this was the best facial cleanser so I tried it. I was not disappointed. It removes all traces of dirt and makeup (even mascara). You can even test it by using a skin toner and a cottonball afterwards and your cottonball will be clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for over a year and it is absolutely my favorite facial cleaner, it gets my face the cleanest and does not dry my face nor make it feel tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it and recommend highly.</li>
