    <ol>
            <li>The best blade on the market.</li>
            <li>Best DE blades I have tried yet.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect storm for crappy shaving.</li>
            <li>For me, in the end, Feather is the best performing and my go-to brand.</li>
            <li>These are the BEST blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>best blade I have used.</li>
            <li>Price is best for performance, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>but these seem to work best for my skin type, so experiment and see what works best for you.</li>
            <li>having this \\&quot;forgiveness\\&quot; to help me improve my technique without having to be perfect is great.    </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>So, to get a great shave with this blade sold me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many blades and Astra are the sharpest I have found, plus they has a very great price to boot.</li>
            <li>My top recommendation is to pick up a sample pack and find out the best blade for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your reasons are mostly frugal however, Astra may be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>in all the Astra seems to have the best of both worlds and a fine blade for not a lot of money.</li>
            <li>a good shave in my muhle r89.  </li>
            <li>Good blades for a close shave without donating blood from your cheeks.</li>
            <li>I tend to have to do 4-5 passes on my neck to get a good shave</li>
            <li>So far,so good.</li>
            <li>I have found what blade my Futur likes me to use by the good shave I get and</li>
            <li>Astra superior Platinum -</li>
            <li>these do have a tendency to irritate my face a fair</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Great blades and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>and I own a 1964 (J2)</li>
            <li>Blades are good, the feathers work better for my face</li>
            <li>feel these blades are really nice.  </li>
            <li>and these gave me a nice 3 pass shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So for people with normal hair - this should be perfect.  </li>
            <li>this was a very good razor but it really chewed up my face when I used it.</li>
            <li>while this wasnt the particular razor for me, it was still a very good looking razor.</li>
            <li>What more do need in a razor blade?</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I think Wilkinson sword a a tad sharper but cost more.</li>
            <li>Better than wall mart brand.</li>
            <li>My top three blades and reasons follow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite blade.</li>
            <li>but Astra tends to be a lot more affordable, so</li>
            <li>While blades work differently for everyone, these have been the best I&#x27;ve tried and will be using them exclusively.</li>
            <li>As many reviews will tell you, the blade you like isn&#x27;t necessarily the blade that&#x27;s best for everyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only time will tell if this blade remains my favorite.  </li>
            <li>They give a shave close enough for my liking, yet do not require perfect shaving technique to avoid burn and cuts.  </li>
            <li>In my estimation as well (Wilkinsons and Personan&#x27;s are both supposed to be sharper, Derby&#x27;s not), Astras stay sharper longer and continue to do the job comforgably for more shaving sesions than anyof the brands mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great blades first one out of the box, I like then already, might be my number one choice user friendly too</li>
            <li>I have moderately sensitive skin and get cut up pretty easily by the sharper blades, but this one seems to suit me perfect.</li>
            <li>It made for an easy purchase for me.    </li>
            <li>But most importantly the service was fabulous.</li>
            <li>The perfect balance of smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li>in comparing with Derby, Wilkinsons, and Personna&#x27;s - this hits the sweet spot of always being comfortable and enjoyable and getting the job done NEARLY perfectly (i have extremely strong/thick hair</li>
            <li>would be great for a medium growth face and someone starting de shaving.</li>
            <li>Great razors do the job and last.</li>
            <li>They gave a smooth shave with no nicks.</li>
            <li>These Astra blades were not as smooth as Feathers.  </li>
            <li>all being said, this is a fantastic razor blade.</li>
            <li>If you do not have sensitive skin they will probably be a good cheaper alternative to Feathers.</li>
            <li>My razor came packaged with some Derby brand blades, but I had heard that many appreciated Astra SP better.  </li>
            <li>These are great blades, I have tried a half dozen blades from around the world and these were my top pick.  </li>
            <li>are only good for one shave for me though because of my wirey beard</li>
            <li>These blades are nice, I bought a sample pack to try out, I&#x27;m new to straight/safety razors so wanted to find the right blade for my face.</li>
            <li>I used the blade for the first time last night and got a near perfect shave.  </li>
            <li>This blade is sharp and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great sharp blades, cut well.</li>
            <li>If nothing else you should give them a try as this pack was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>It just seemed wasteful to buy a bunch of different blades, and potentially have many go unused as I found I didn&#x27;t like them, or found I liked others better.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but all beards are different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been DE shaving for a couple months, so I&#x27;ve only tried a couple brands, but these blades have been pretty much perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It is also incredibly smooth and does not take too much of my skin along with the hair.</li>
            <li>They work far better than any of the plastic razors I have tried.</li>
            <li>Used only 2-3 times so far,I get a nice shave with them.</li>
            <li>These have been the best overall blades for my face, somewhat forgiving, close shave, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other blades, and this works the best for me.</li>
            <li>but 2 passes down my face to get nice a smooth every time.</li>
            <li>I have tried about 10 different types of DE blades and this is the best that I have tried thus far and is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li>A little bit duller than Feather, these are good to learn with.</li>
            <li>Ok, first the standard disclaimer.</li>
            <li>First off, I (and my face)</li>
            <li>First time user.</li>
            <li>I get a consistently close shave with these blades without all the nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>Personna Reds - Great blades but do not last very long for me.</li>
            <li>For the novice shaver or someone who doesn&#x27;t have enough experience in wet shaving, this is a great blade.</li>
            <li>that can completely make me clean without irritating/tearing up my skin..  </li>
            <li>Certainly would buy&#x27;em again.</li>
            <li>Well first off let me say all razors in my opinion have a different feel, action, angle cut, feeling grip, balance, weight distribution and they all work better with a blade that works in them on your face.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, very smooth across my fair Irish skin with a coarse beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i expected a bit more</li>
            <li>service was fast and no hastle.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to the Merkur blades that came with my razor.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most DE blades leave my face irritated and red.</li>
            <li>My other favorite was Lord Platinum, and I have to say,</li>
            <li>Decent shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid performer and my second favorite brand by a close margin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this blade from this retailer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably look for another brand that is a little more aggressive....</li>
            <li>The first few uses they are smooth &amp; they give a close shave, but expect to use a new blade afterwards.</li>
            <li>Blades are entirely subjective and certain blades work well for certain people.</li>
            <li>Not quite as sharp but just about as smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still relatively new to DE shaving, so</li>
            <li>Even barbers comment that I&#x27;m a big challenge for them haha!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone out there looking for a clean blade razor, sharp</li>
            <li>not as sharp as the other popular ones... i.e. Bic, Persona, Feather, Wilkinson</li>
            <li>I have a coarse dark beard and sensitive skin on top of that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting a large pack of these next.</li>
            <li>fortunately these 5 blade packs let you try a few to see if you like them.</li>
            <li>DE blades are very user specific and what works for might not be for a everyone.</li>
            <li>All I can say is they arrived quickly and they are very sharp.  </li>
            <li>Right price, sharp.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still cheaper than buying disposable razor sets like you&#x27;d normally see in stores &amp; overall</li>
            <li>What I really appreciate is the ability to buy a single 5 pack to try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review as a first time user of any razor blades, so I can&#x27;t compare these vs any other brand.  </li>
            <li>I have a very coarse beard, with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I first got into wet shaving I tried a lot of different brands of blades.</li>
            <li>Both do the job admirably, but I feel the Astra is a little more aggressive, requiring fewer passes and less twisting and skin-stretching to get to that &amp;#34;I can no longer say with certainty that there was EVER hair here&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>new hi nor does it last as long.</li>
            <li>Not quite as sharp as a feather blade, but absolutely sharp enough to get through my extra coarse hair really smoothly.</li>
            <li>Feather - Really sharp and cut through my facial hair really well.</li>

            <li> Both do the job admirably, but I feel the Astra is a little more aggressive, requiring fewer passes and less twisting and skin-stretching to get to that &amp;#34;I can no longer say with certainty that there was EVER hair here&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> new hi nor does it last as long.</li>
            <li> Not quite as sharp as a feather blade, but absolutely sharp enough to get through my extra coarse hair really smoothly.</li>
            <li> Feather - Really sharp and cut through my facial hair really well.</li>
            <li> In fact, my only other blade so far is [[ASIN:B0016SPGMC Derby]].</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought.</li>

            <li> For me they did not live up to the expectations left by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> These blades last me 4-5 shaves using a typical 3 pass shave.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;ll last a few shaves.</li>
            <li> seems to be not as sharp as the feather</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as the Merkur blades it came with, but for a beginner like me it was a plus.</li>
            <li> Then again my Gillette like other blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely sharp blade and recommend it in an adjustable</li>
            <li> Sharp and affordable.</li>
            <li> I have never cut myself with these and they do not leave any irritation that I would get with some other blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp edge.</li>
            <li> Have not compare it to other brand, yet.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit sharper than the astra but not much.</li>
            <li> It is not a very smooth shave however.</li>
            <li> These blades, though very sharp have given me three shaves already</li>
            <li> I tried a few other blades on the market</li>
            <li> Less aggressive than Feathers.</li>
            <li> Feathers are too aggressive - lots of little nicks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> seems to be not as sharp as the feather new hi nor does it last as long.</li>
            <li> a good shave in my muhle r89.  not as sharp as I need as i have thick growth.  would be great for a medium growth face and someone starting de shaving.</li>
            <li> Great blades and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great razors do the job and last. What more do need in a razor blade? Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many blades and Astra are the sharpest I have found, plus they has a very great price to boot.</li>
            <li> Just tried these blades and I&#x27;ve only shaved one time with them. They gave a smooth shave with no nicks. My perception is that Personna Med. Prep blades were smoother, however I did nick myself with the Personna.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review as a first time user of any razor blades, so I can&#x27;t compare these vs any other brand.  All I can say is they arrived quickly and they are very sharp.  They work far better than any of the plastic razors I have tried.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as the Merkur blades it came with, but for a beginner like me it was a plus.</li>
            <li> These are great blades, I have tried a half dozen blades from around the world and these were my top pick.  Very sharp, very smooth across my fair Irish skin with a coarse beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually done a video review of all the blades I tried.  You can check it out here and I give details about all the blades I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/FFF_wJgcYUk</li>
            <li> Astra is one of my go-to blades. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 50 yrs. Quality, consistency, and sharpness. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> great product. I would recommend to anyone out there looking for a clean blade razor, sharp but i expected a bit more</li>
            <li> A little bit duller than Feather, these are good to learn with.</li>
            <li> Only blades I&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> Less aggressive than Feathers. Good blades for a close shave without donating blood from your cheeks.</li>
            <li> Decent shave. Nothing revolutionary, it works well for me but i cant go against the grain without cutting myself up. I tend to have to do 4-5 passes on my neck to get a good shave but 2 passes down my face to get nice a smooth every time.</li>
            <li> I would rather use Feather or Derby. For me they did not live up to the expectations left by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> The best blade on the market.</li>
            <li> Best DE blades I have tried yet. Arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> So far,so good.Used only 2-3 times so far,I get a nice shave with them.</li>
            <li> I just got back into using a double edge razor ie; Murker Futur Adjustable and I own a 1964 (J2) Gillette Slimboy adjustable DE. Well first off let me say all razors in my opinion have a different feel, action, angle cut, feeling grip, balance, weight distribution and they all work better with a blade that works in them on your face. I have found what blade my Futur likes me to use by the good shave I get and no cut or nicks. Then again my Gillette like other blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely sharp blade and recommend it in an adjustable so it can be made how aggressive it is on the skin.</li>
            <li> Sharp and affordable. I think Wilkinson sword a a tad sharper but cost more. These will do though. Better than wall mart brand.</li>
            <li> These Astra blades were not as smooth as Feathers.  If you do not have sensitive skin they will probably be a good cheaper alternative to Feathers.</li>
            <li> No disrespect to this blade or to the manufacturer, I&#x27;m just saying for my beard and my growth, they are not for me.</li>
            <li> Ok, first the standard disclaimer. Blades are entirely subjective and certain blades work well for certain people. My top recommendation is to pick up a sample pack and find out the best blade for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all being said, this is a fantastic razor blade. I have a coarse dark beard and sensitive skin on top of that. It is the perfect storm for crappy shaving. Because of this I have tried countless combinations of shaving products. I have tried about 10 different types of DE blades and this is the best that I have tried thus far and is definitely a keeper. My top three blades and reasons follow.&lt;br /&gt;1. Astra superior Platinum - My favorite blade. Not quite as sharp as a feather blade, but absolutely sharp enough to get through my extra coarse hair really smoothly. It is also incredibly smooth and does not take too much of my skin along with the hair. I have never cut myself with these and they do not leave any irritation that I would get with some other blades.&lt;br /&gt;2. Personna Reds - Great blades but do not last very long for me. They are sort of a second tier Astra on my face. Not quite as sharp but just about as smooth. They worked well for me for some time.&lt;br /&gt;3. Feather - Really sharp and cut through my facial hair really well. It is a little bit sharper than the astra but not much. It is not a very smooth shave however. If I want a closer shave these do have a tendency to irritate my face a fair amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all the Astra seems to have the best of both worlds and a fine blade for not a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Trying blades to find the right one for you can be an expensive and frustrating process. Some blades are sold in packs of 100 so if you don&#x27;t like them, you&#x27;re stuck. fortunately these 5 blade packs let you try a few to see if you like them. service was fast and no hastle.</li>
            <li> When I first got into wet shaving I tried a lot of different brands of blades. I find in my research that different blades work well for different people. For me, in the end, Feather is the best performing and my go-to brand. Astra however, gives it a run for its money. It&#x27;s a solid performer and my second favorite brand by a close margin. Not only that but Astra tends to be a lot more affordable, so overall I think Astra is probably #1 for me in terms of performance vs. cost. I went into wet shaving not only because it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run but also to make shaving not feel like such a chore. If your reasons are mostly frugal however, Astra may be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> These have been the best overall blades for my face, somewhat forgiving, close shave, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> this was a very good razor but it really chewed up my face when I used it. while this wasnt the particular razor for me, it was still a very good looking razor. as with everything i suggest at least trying</li>
            <li> While blades work differently for everyone, these have been the best I&#x27;ve tried and will be using them exclusively. I use them with a Parker 92R and I am African American. I only use them for 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> not as sharp as the other popular ones... i.e. Bic, Persona, Feather, Wilkinson</li>
            <li> I bought a [[ASIN:B004UIZFQW razor blade sampler pack]] recently with seven 5-packs, just so I could get an idea of what I like.  As many reviews will tell you, the blade you like isn&#x27;t necessarily the blade that&#x27;s best for everyone. It will depend on your hair, your skin, and your personal preference.  If you see a review that claims &amp;#34;Best, period.&amp;#34; or uses the phrase &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34;, skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I haven&#x27;t gone though the sampler pack yet.  In fact, my only other blade so far is [[ASIN:B0016SPGMC Derby]]. I prefer the Astra to the Derby. Both do the job admirably, but I feel the Astra is a little more aggressive, requiring fewer passes and less twisting and skin-stretching to get to that &amp;#34;I can no longer say with certainty that there was EVER hair here&amp;#34; level of smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell if this blade remains my favorite.  I&#x27;ve got five others that I have yet to try in the sampler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been DE shaving for a couple months, so I&#x27;ve only tried a couple brands, but these blades have been pretty much perfect for me. I have moderately sensitive skin and get cut up pretty easily by the sharper blades, but this one seems to suit me perfect. Very comparable to the Merkur blades that came with my razor. Using with Proraso shaving soap.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST blades I&#x27;ve ever used. The perfect balance of smooth and sharp. I have a very coarse beard, with sensitive skin. The worst combination. Even barbers comment that I&#x27;m a big challenge for them haha! My other favorite was Lord Platinum, and I have to say, I think this beats those. I can shave across the grain, with a 5 day beard! It&#x27;s crazy. And they&#x27;ll last a few shaves. I&#x27;ll be getting a large pack of these next.</li>
            <li> best blade I have used. wow!</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but all beards are different. Certainly would buy&#x27;em again.</li>
            <li> Blades are good, the feathers work better for my face but these were a close second</li>
            <li> The first few uses they are smooth &amp; they give a close shave, but expect to use a new blade afterwards. There&#x27;s really nothing bad about these Astra&#x27;s but they didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought. They&#x27;re still cheaper than buying disposable razor sets like you&#x27;d normally see in stores &amp; overall they last longer, but I&#x27;m considering a different Astra / brand.</li>
            <li> Right price, sharp. I&#x27;ll probably look for another brand that is a little more aggressive....but I can&#x27;t complain given the price!</li>
            <li> First off, I (and my face) feel these blades are really nice.  They give a shave close enough for my liking, yet do not require perfect shaving technique to avoid burn and cuts.  I&#x27;m still relatively new to DE shaving, so having this \\&quot;forgiveness\\&quot; to help me improve my technique without having to be perfect is great.    What I really appreciate is the ability to buy a single 5 pack to try.  I contemplated the multibrand \\&quot;samplers\\&quot;, but just couldn&#x27;t get myself to go that route. It just seemed wasteful to buy a bunch of different blades, and potentially have many go unused as I found I didn&#x27;t like them, or found I liked others better. My razor came packaged with some Derby brand blades, but I had heard that many appreciated Astra SP better.  So I wanted to try them out.    So, thank you to whoever is behind the decision to sell a single 5 pack of these. It made for an easy purchase for me.    Each blade is wrapped individually in paper, and the stack of blades is in a box slightly larger than the stack of blades.</li>
            <li> My go to blade. I have sensitive skin and most DE blades leave my face irritated and red. These blades last me 4-5 shaves using a typical 3 pass shave. DE blades are very user specific and what works for might not be for a everyone. These work for me using a EJ DE89 razor and Proraso shaving cream.</li>
            <li> great blades first one out of the box, I like then already, might be my number one choice user friendly too</li>
            <li> These blades, though very sharp have given me three shaves already and I commend the product. I will keep a supply of ASTRA blades in my shaving repertoire from now on.</li>
            <li> in comparing with Derby, Wilkinsons, and Personna&#x27;s - this hits the sweet spot of always being comfortable and enjoyable and getting the job done NEARLY perfectly (i have extremely strong/thick hair so i have not found a razor yet that can completely make me clean without irritating/tearing up my skin..  this one ALMOST gets me there without any irritation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for people with normal hair - this should be perfect.  In my estimation as well (Wilkinsons and Personan&#x27;s are both supposed to be sharper, Derby&#x27;s not), Astras stay sharper longer and continue to do the job comforgably for more shaving sesions than anyof the brands mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying Feathers next.  It has a lot to prove to make me not choose AStras as my full-time blade.</li>
            <li> These blades are nice, I bought a sample pack to try out, I&#x27;m new to straight/safety razors so wanted to find the right blade for my face. My beard is thick and likes to grow every which way and these gave me a nice 3 pass shave.&lt;br /&gt;They are only good for one shave for me though because of my wirey beard so I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a razor that would a couple shaves</li>
            <li> First time user. Sharp edge. Used with Muhle R89 Grande, so shave effort is minimum. Have not compare it to other brand, yet. Shaving feeling is really different than with cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I used the blade for the first time last night and got a near perfect shave.  I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and have had some bad experiences with other blades. So, to get a great shave with this blade sold me.  If nothing else you should give them a try as this pack was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other blades, and this works the best for me. Feathers are too aggressive - lots of little nicks. Persona&#x27;s feel like I&#x27;m using a cheese grater. Price is best for performance, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This blade is sharp and does a great job. For the novice shaver or someone who doesn&#x27;t have enough experience in wet shaving, this is a great blade. But most importantly the service was fabulous. I highly recommend getting this blade from this retailer.</li>
            <li> they look like reproduced or refurbished blades.</li>
            <li> If you like the Derby brand, then you&#x27;ll definitely like these blades. I get a consistently close shave with these blades without all the nicks and cuts. I tried a few other blades on the market but these seem to work best for my skin type, so experiment and see what works best for you. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Great sharp blades, cut well.</li>
