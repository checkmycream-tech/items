            <li>I bought this for my face because I love Olay product and I have never had any reason to doubt their product.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and makes my face feel really smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li>Love this cream..</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice non greasy and leave skin smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It really feels great as I put it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found my favorite night cream.  </li>
            <li>I have been using them for many year and at 59, I can use all the help I can get.  </li>
            <li>Most people think I&#x27;m still in my 40s.  </li>
            <li>Love all the Olay products.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love Olay products and have been using them for years.</li>
            <li>Have not seen the wrinkle disappear, but I love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li>It does seem to bring more fullness to the skin, thereby reducing the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>It has a great feel to it and is NOT harsh.</li>
            <li>I still use a combination of the Oil of Olay Regenerist products and Professional products for daytime use to diminish the wrinkles, but nothing seems to make my skin so happy as this night cream.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, so I was delighted to find a night cream that was inexpensive and made my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>non greasy, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>We live in the desert and this cream is really good.  </li>
            <li>a difference in fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Life, experience and age bring on fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This softens the fine lines and moisturizes without clogging pores (believe me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about halfway  thru the container, and I can see a visible reduction in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer of many Olay products.</li>
            <li>Would you have a fragrant free night cream?  </li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy this</li>
            <li>The lotion is smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>love the smell, and how soft it leaves you skin, I will be ordering more when I need it :)</li>
            <li>Light fragrance.</li>
            <li>works as advertised and is a light alternative to some heavier night creams</li>
            <li>Smells good, has a silky feel, not heavy cream.</li>
            <li>I love the scent - soothing right before bed.</li>
            <li>Very nice night cream , very gentle and keeps face soft.</li>
            <li>With regular use, it has really made a huge difference in the texture and tone of my very fair skin.</li>
            <li>Originally it seemed to be lighter.</li>
            <li>Olay has never disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to go to bed feeling and SMELLING clean.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, love how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li>but loving how my skin feels so far.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs a good night moisturizer.</li>
            <li>As a young sun loving California girl, I baked, burned, tanned and peeled for years.</li>
            <li>money, buy from the sellers here as they get it to you quickly</li>
            <li>If this had the classic Oil of Olay scent that I love, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Did do a good job in correcting some minor imbalances in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>LIVE IT LOVE</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for several years and love it!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone interested in purchasing from Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft, smooth, and comfortable, even if I skip a night.</li>
            <li>Look for the triangle lid to get the right one....</li>
            <li>I am African American and it works beautifully for me.</li>
            <li>Just pure goodness!</li>
            <li>Of course, I eat and drink many healthy foods/drinks like fruit, vegetables, fish oil, green tea, and lemon water to help my skin, too; nevertheless, this cream makes the color of my skin look the prettiest of all the moisturizers.</li>
            <li>very true to its label and love olay product since it makes my skin soft and younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>What works best for my skin turns out to be touching it as little as possible; I don&#x27;t use cleansers anymore and instead simply splash my face with water once a day.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>sure if provided the same effect as my go-to night cream.</li>
            <li>I use this as my day cream and am pleased with results; but it&#x27;s not the only cream I use.</li>
            <li>Love this product second time reordering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Olay products for 5 years  and received many compliments for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>my face is smooth and soft after using it....</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It did make me break out the first two times I used it at night.</li>
            <li>Love the entire line of Olay products.  </li>
            <li>Apart from the fact that this Olay product really does improve my skin, I can also state that this particular moisturizer leaves no mess on my favorite bed pillow.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it came in a larger container though, as I&#x27;m sure much of the expense goes into the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Although PIH is temporary, it takes a long time to heal, and some of the darker marks make me more self-conscious.</li>
            <li>This has helped a lot, in addition to avoiding certain foods and eating a healthier diet.  </li>
            <li>I think it is as effective as the more expensive creams.</li>
            <li>After buying this, I ended up buying the whole line..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell much about</li>
            <li>I wants cancel my order.thanks.</li>
            <li>but I really needed some ingredients in this to help my dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast service  </li>
            <li>Made my skin feel like sand paper and the product is very sticky.</li>
            <li>Not so much seeing of the tone correction, but it does nourish my skin well</li>
            <li>though - way too soon to really tell.    </li>
            <li>this works really well</li>
            <li>cant really tell if it works or not, didnt take a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; photo</li>
            <li>She always wants practical things for Christmas.</li>
            <li>its really didn&#x27;t help will not buy again</li>
            <li>Not sure if my dark spots are fading, but this is a wonderful night time moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>So far, pleased with product, too soon to tell of lasting benefit.</li>
            <li>Even more, this cream doesn&#x27;t break me out, whereas a lot of other products irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>It refines and evens skin tone, which is what makes you look older really.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and even though I am prone to real outs</li>
            <li>Love this for night time it does not feel grease or heavy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several alternative creams, but have found that Olay still the best…thick, creamy, and readily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I do feel like the toning could be a potential success</li>
            <li>Clear your face very well for a young look  but is very important a humectant in the morning especially for dry skin like mine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave a film and my skin (really dry) absorbs it quickly.</li>
            <li>While I have purchased the most expensive creams, this reasonably priced cream is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>After suffering from acne for many years and trying all sorts of generic to dermatologist-prescribed harsh cleansers &amp; creams to no avail, I am largely disillusioned with the usefulness of any of them.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Smells heavenly and my skin is soft in the AM.</li>
            <li>It evens my skin tone and keeps it soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am 50, I figured it was time to upgrade to mature skin care</li>
            <li>I get complements all the time that I do not look my age, and have adult children.</li>
            <li>and I like the soft smell.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this \\&quot;tone correcting\\&quot; moisturizer to see if it could help the PIH heal faster, not expecting that it would, and have been happily surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have wicked fussy, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>There is a sparkle to it and so far my skin does not like it.</li>
            <li>I have used Olay Complete skin moisturizer under makeup for years.  </li>
            <li>Works well so far even though I frequently forget to use it.</li>
            <li>Does what it says so far but didn&#x27;t know it had a shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>I think they work as good as the expensive department stores brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead with VERY sensitive skin, and I have looked high and low for a night lotion that would 1)</li>
            <li>the creams but the jar for the Olay is very small and will require ordering more oftern</li>
            <li>winter arrives and the heat comes on in the house AND the skin dries out, we all need a little extra boost to keep skin (especially &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin) healthy.  </li>
            <li>(In fact, most products make my sensitive skin worse.)  </li>
            <li>Purchased this early for Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I simply apply it before bed after I&#x27;ve splashed my face with water &amp; gently patted it dry.  </li>
            <li>I love how it instantly revitalizes tired skin</li>
            <li>This product appeared on store shelves for a short time only, but then the Luminosity label shifted to the Regenerist Line and stores went back to the old Olay night cream without the luminosity ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Olay products for a while - they&#x27;re less expensive than some and fairly good quality.</li>

            <li> Correcting Night Moisturizer has become my favorite solution.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my face because I love Olay product and I have never had any reason to doubt their product.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and makes my face feel really smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li> Love this cream..</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice non greasy and leave skin smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It really feels great as I put it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found my favorite night cream.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them for many year and at 59, I can use all the help I can get.  </li>
            <li> Most people think I&#x27;m still in my 40s.  </li>
            <li> Love all the Olay products.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love Olay products and have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> Have not seen the wrinkle disappear, but I love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li> It does seem to bring more fullness to the skin, thereby reducing the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> It has a great feel to it and is NOT harsh.</li>
            <li> I still use a combination of the Oil of Olay Regenerist products and Professional products for daytime use to diminish the wrinkles, but nothing seems to make my skin so happy as this night cream.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so I was delighted to find a night cream that was inexpensive and made my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> non greasy, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> We live in the desert and this cream is really good.  </li>
            <li> a difference in fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Life, experience and age bring on fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This softens the fine lines and moisturizes without clogging pores (believe me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about halfway  thru the container, and I can see a visible reduction in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer of many Olay products.</li>
            <li> Would you have a fragrant free night cream?  </li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy this</li>
            <li> The lotion is smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> love the smell, and how soft it leaves you skin, I will be ordering more when I need it :)</li>
            <li> Light fragrance.</li>
            <li> works as advertised and is a light alternative to some heavier night creams</li>
            <li> Smells good, has a silky feel, not heavy cream.</li>
            <li> I love the scent - soothing right before bed.</li>
            <li> Very nice night cream , very gentle and keeps face soft.</li>
            <li> With regular use, it has really made a huge difference in the texture and tone of my very fair skin.</li>
            <li> Originally it seemed to be lighter.</li>
            <li> Olay has never disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to go to bed feeling and SMELLING clean.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, love how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> but loving how my skin feels so far.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs a good night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As a young sun loving California girl, I baked, burned, tanned and peeled for years.</li>
            <li> money, buy from the sellers here as they get it to you quickly</li>
            <li> If this had the classic Oil of Olay scent that I love, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Did do a good job in correcting some minor imbalances in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> LIVE IT LOVE</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for several years and love it!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone interested in purchasing from Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft, smooth, and comfortable, even if I skip a night.</li>
            <li> Look for the triangle lid to get the right one....</li>
            <li> I am African American and it works beautifully for me.</li>
            <li> Just pure goodness!</li>
            <li> Of course, I eat and drink many healthy foods/drinks like fruit, vegetables, fish oil, green tea, and lemon water to help my skin, too; nevertheless, this cream makes the color of my skin look the prettiest of all the moisturizers.</li>
            <li> very true to its label and love olay product since it makes my skin soft and younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> What works best for my skin turns out to be touching it as little as possible; I don&#x27;t use cleansers anymore and instead simply splash my face with water once a day.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> sure if provided the same effect as my go-to night cream.</li>
            <li> I use this as my day cream and am pleased with results; but it&#x27;s not the only cream I use.</li>
            <li> Love this product second time reordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Olay products for 5 years  and received many compliments for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> my face is smooth and soft after using it....</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It did make me break out the first two times I used it at night.</li>
            <li> Love the entire line of Olay products.  </li>
            <li> Apart from the fact that this Olay product really does improve my skin, I can also state that this particular moisturizer leaves no mess on my favorite bed pillow.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it came in a larger container though, as I&#x27;m sure much of the expense goes into the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Although PIH is temporary, it takes a long time to heal, and some of the darker marks make me more self-conscious.</li>
            <li> This has helped a lot, in addition to avoiding certain foods and eating a healthier diet.  </li>
            <li> I think it is as effective as the more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> After buying this, I ended up buying the whole line..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell much about</li>
            <li> I wants cancel my order.thanks.</li>
            <li> but I really needed some ingredients in this to help my dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Fast service  </li>
            <li> Made my skin feel like sand paper and the product is very sticky.</li>
            <li> Not so much seeing of the tone correction, but it does nourish my skin well</li>
            <li> though - way too soon to really tell.    </li>
            <li> this works really well</li>
            <li> cant really tell if it works or not, didnt take a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; photo</li>
            <li> She always wants practical things for Christmas.</li>
            <li> its really didn&#x27;t help will not buy again</li>
            <li> Not sure if my dark spots are fading, but this is a wonderful night time moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> So far, pleased with product, too soon to tell of lasting benefit.</li>
            <li> Even more, this cream doesn&#x27;t break me out, whereas a lot of other products irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> It refines and evens skin tone, which is what makes you look older really.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and even though I am prone to real outs</li>
            <li> Love this for night time it does not feel grease or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several alternative creams, but have found that Olay still the best…thick, creamy, and readily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I do feel like the toning could be a potential success</li>
            <li> Clear your face very well for a young look  but is very important a humectant in the morning especially for dry skin like mine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave a film and my skin (really dry) absorbs it quickly.</li>
            <li> While I have purchased the most expensive creams, this reasonably priced cream is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> After suffering from acne for many years and trying all sorts of generic to dermatologist-prescribed harsh cleansers &amp; creams to no avail, I am largely disillusioned with the usefulness of any of them.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and my skin is soft in the AM.</li>
            <li> It evens my skin tone and keeps it soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am 50, I figured it was time to upgrade to mature skin care</li>
            <li> I get complements all the time that I do not look my age, and have adult children.</li>
            <li> and I like the soft smell.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this \\&quot;tone correcting\\&quot; moisturizer to see if it could help the PIH heal faster, not expecting that it would, and have been happily surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li> I have wicked fussy, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> There is a sparkle to it and so far my skin does not like it.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Complete skin moisturizer under makeup for years.  </li>
            <li> Works well so far even though I frequently forget to use it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says so far but didn&#x27;t know it had a shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> I think they work as good as the expensive department stores brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with VERY sensitive skin, and I have looked high and low for a night lotion that would 1)</li>
            <li> the creams but the jar for the Olay is very small and will require ordering more oftern</li>
            <li> winter arrives and the heat comes on in the house AND the skin dries out, we all need a little extra boost to keep skin (especially &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin) healthy.  </li>
            <li> (In fact, most products make my sensitive skin worse.)  </li>
            <li> Purchased this early for Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I simply apply it before bed after I&#x27;ve splashed my face with water &amp; gently patted it dry.  </li>
            <li> I love how it instantly revitalizes tired skin</li>
            <li> This product appeared on store shelves for a short time only, but then the Luminosity label shifted to the Regenerist Line and stores went back to the old Olay night cream without the luminosity ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products for a while - they&#x27;re less expensive than some and fairly good quality.</li>
            <li> Considering the dry air from our central HVAC systems, it&#x27;s an obvious necessity to use good-quality skin moisturizers daily.  </li>
            <li> that being said, as with every other lotion I have tried, my eyes are wiggin out the next day like I have major eye allergies.</li>
            <li> However, although less frequently, I still experience mild-to-moderate breakouts, which often lead to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) or red spots.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing that and providing the usual gentle, not greasy affect I expect.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to notice if if does anything for my complexion, and I don&#x27;t think I will.</li>
            <li> However, I tried it on 3 separate occasions as instructed (in the evenings) and each morning I woke up with a few new zits.</li>
            <li> not a new person or years younger, but has helped with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a sample I received and it&#x27;s not exactly the same.</li>
            <li> This keeps me from those yucky dry flakes without causing me to break out.  </li>
            <li> does help dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, and this made me break out with small pimples.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the regular Total Effects night cream.</li>
            <li> I Have spent lots of money on creams and anti aging lotions and potions</li>
            <li> Not much differencein</li>
            <li> Will probably try something else when the jar is empty.</li>
            <li> but I have  saw no difference in tone, or anything that I expected from a well known Company.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so silky, and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I prefer other products over this one.  </li>
            <li> Correcting Eye Treatment *use day and night, never makes your eye makeup smudge, smear like other eye products</li>
            <li> The first couple of nights, I thought something had gone terribly wrong in my bedroom, as I could not locate where that smell was coming from.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this does anything different.</li>
            <li> Usually buy several at a time.</li>
            <li> Overall, the film it left on my skin was just too frustrating.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s other effects yet, but i wish this product is less oily.</li>
            <li> Seems like they may have changed this slightly.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even complimented me and a few days after I started using this duo, he asked if I had been to my Esthetician at my day spa.</li>
            <li> Creamy lotion, but not so heavy that it makes me sweat.</li>
            <li> no huge wrinkles to speak of...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will mix with a little of my base so it goes on much smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive here on Amazon than other places.</li>
            <li> and you hardly know it is on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past four nights now!</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 with a little dryness &amp; you won&#x27;t believe how it feels on your face!!!</li>
            <li> it beats all the expensive ones I have tried, including a $125.00 one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I use these two products every night without fail.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mousturize my face at all, it&#x27;s sticky, and it has this weird shimmery stuff in it, which is useless.</li>
            <li> Not make me break out like crazy,</li>
            <li> Needless to say this cream was a pore-clogger!</li>
            <li> This one hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is the worst in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Olay product is the worst of the line.</li>
            <li> but it just feels awful.</li>
            <li> and it is just disgusting.</li>
            <li> This leaves a terrible film on your face and doesn&#x27;t seem to soak into your skin.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Use it daily, it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer of many Olay products. I usually use the regular Total Effects night cream. Just to change things up, I bought the tone correcting version. I didn&#x27;t realize that it had some sparkle in the cream. It produces an unnatural glowing effect. Some people may like it but you may want to wash it off every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note sure if provided the same effect as my go-to night cream. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> My sister love this product and bought it around $10 with coupon and free prime shipping.. amazing deal.... i don&#x27;t think no one can beat this price!!!!! Excellent product..</li>
            <li> Love this night cream....it beats all the expensive ones I have tried, including a $125.00 one.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I have never had a breakout from using it....&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin look and feel wonderful but is light and you hardly know it is on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for several years and love it!  Look for the triangle lid to get the right one....there are others out there but not the same.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because of it&#x27;s smell alone! However, I tried it on 3 separate occasions as instructed (in the evenings) and each morning I woke up with a few new zits. Needless to say this cream was a pore-clogger!</li>
            <li> Use it every night.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is okay.  I&#x27;m only 28... no huge wrinkles to speak of... but I like to use a nice cream at night to keep my skin healthy.  I won&#x27;t buy this again - I prefer other products over this one.  I also don&#x27;t like products without a pump - you have to stick your finger in the pot to get product - I feel like I could contaminate the container.</li>
            <li> My tone has improved in just 2 weeks. Spots, freckles are diminishing and I have an overall clearer complection. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I never rec. this item, I did get the book but I didn&#x27;t get this product. I like to when when I should get it?</li>
            <li> Seems like they may have changed this slightly. Originally it seemed to be lighter. Now it is heavier (thicker). I still like it though.</li>
            <li> I use this as my day cream and am pleased with results; but it&#x27;s not the only cream I use.</li>
            <li> Used 2 nights in a row and my skin already looks better.</li>
            <li> very true to its label and love olay product since it makes my skin soft and younger looking skin. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it would be so fragrant.  Would you have a fragrant free night cream?  Mrs. L.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot.  Smells heavenly and my skin is soft in the AM.</li>
            <li> Easy and pleasant to use. Keeps my skin soft, smooth, and comfortable, even if I skip a night. I have only used it about a week but loving how my skin feels so far. Expecting some very nice results over time.</li>
            <li> I Have spent lots of money on creams and anti aging lotions and potions but I always come back to Olay total Effects. It evens my skin tone and keeps it soft and supple.  Best face cream I&#x27;ve found so far - and at a great price!</li>
            <li> I Was suppose to get two dollars off.  It didn&#x27;t come off. But still a good price. Not sure if it works but it moisterizes whichever is always good.</li>
            <li> I have used Oil Of Olay since I was a teen. Now that I am 50, I figured it was time to upgrade to mature skin care, this stuff is WONDERFUL, in fact the whole 7 in 1 effects line is wonderful. My skin looks so good, my husband even noticed it, and trust me he notices nothing if its not on his T.V. ..lol After buying this, I ended up buying the whole line..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so silky, and not sticky. I love how it instantly revitalizes tired skin and I keep this &amp; the Olay Total Efects 7 in 1 Tone Correcting Eye Treatment duo next to my bed and I use these two products every night without fail. I get so many compliments about how beautiful my skin tone, complexion is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save money, buy from the sellers here as they get it to you quickly and it is packaged perfectly, wrapped in cellophane and is simply divine. I feel 10 years younger when incorporating these nighttime beauty secrets into my evening regimen. My boyfriend even complimented me and a few days after I started using this duo, he asked if I had been to my Esthetician at my day spa. No, it our Oil Total Effects Correcting Night Moisturizer combined with Oil Total Effects 7 in 1 Tone Correcting Eye Treatment *use day and night, never makes your eye makeup smudge, smear like other eye products*.. I hope you enjoy this duo~ Others will notice and your skin will look radiant, bright, flawless!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products for a while - they&#x27;re less expensive than some and fairly good quality. I bought this based on a sample I received and it&#x27;s not exactly the same. It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave a film and my skin (really dry) absorbs it quickly. The fragrance is different from the sample (I&#x27;m not that fond of the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product) and I do have to apply it *every* night. I haven&#x27;t noticed the difference between their lower priced products and this so I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product second time reordering.</li>
            <li> I found the moisturizer satisfactory but I suspect I may return to &amp;#34;7&amp;#34;. Not much differencein the creams but the jar for the Olay is very small and will require ordering more oftern</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer.  It feels like silk on my face.  I can get it at a better price through amazon as well</li>
            <li> It refines and evens skin tone, which is what makes you look older really.  It has a great feel to it and is NOT harsh.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with VERY sensitive skin, and I have looked high and low for a night lotion that would 1) Not make me break out like crazy, 2) Not bleach my clothes &amp; sheets out, &amp; 3) Give me A LOT of moisture. When I found this product, the minute I put it on my skin it felt so creamy &amp; rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is it leaves a sort of tackiness on my skin, and when I lay my head on my pillow it feels weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs a good night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very smooth. I can&#x27;t tell much about it&#x27;s other effects yet, but i wish this product is less oily.</li>
            <li> Clear your face very well for a young look  but is very important a humectant in the morning especially for dry skin like mine</li>
            <li> If this had the classic Oil of Olay scent that I love, I would buy it again. However, it smells like fruit soaked cucumbers.  The first couple of nights, I thought something had gone terribly wrong in my bedroom, as I could not locate where that smell was coming from.  It does seem to bring more fullness to the skin, thereby reducing the appearance of fine lines. No difference in age spots after a couple weeks, but didn&#x27;t expect that miracle.  I just wanted to go to bed feeling and SMELLING clean. This isn&#x27;t going to work for me, only because of the smell!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my skin! Very light but also moisturizing. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I wants cancel my order.thanks.</li>
            <li> My skin looked a bit greasy after using this product and I noticed I broke out a bit. Did do a good job in correcting some minor imbalances in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Olay products for 5 years  and received many compliments for younger looking skin. If I could send in a picture of photo I would. Believe me you wouldn&#x27;t guess my age.&lt;br /&gt;Olay is an remarkably product.</li>
            <li> Way too perfumy, I had to give it away.</li>
            <li> The lotion is smooth and silky.  Don&#x27;t know about a tone corrector but will continue to use until gone.  Probably won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> non greasy, easy to apply.  use it every night.  not a new person or years younger, but has helped with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works well- and I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 months now and it has worked great. I get complements all the time that I do not look my age, and have adult children. I would recommend this product to all women 40 and over.</li>
            <li> As a young sun loving California girl, I baked, burned, tanned and peeled for years. Now I&#x27;m 58 and learning the error of my ways. I love all Olay products but this is excellent. With regular use, it has really made a huge difference in the texture and tone of my very fair skin. It&#x27;s less expensive here on Amazon than other places. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay for years! This is a change for me because I used the regular total effects but I really needed some ingredients in this to help my dermatitis. It&#x27;s doing that and providing the usual gentle, not greasy affect I expect.</li>
            <li> Cream feels excellent. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> Love this for night time it does not feel grease or heavy.  Love Olay</li>
            <li> It was okay but not that impressed.  I was looking for something that impressed me a bit more.  I guess I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this and was happy to find it on Amazon at such a good price.  It&#x27;s nice to put on at night because it isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t come off on the pillows.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I do Love this Olay night moustorizer,just order it again amazing results face,neck and chest!!..I do recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good night cream, not real thick, smells good, and I trust the Olay name ,been using their products for years !!!</li>
            <li> It works Great  and I like the soft smell. I  Use every night before go to bed.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products. Not sure if this does anything different.</li>
            <li> Love it.....my face is smooth and soft after using it....I will def. be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Fast service  and it arrived on time.It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and I like the product very much. I am now going to look for the daytime version of this product. I will buy again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Tone Correcting Night Moisturizer feels so incredibly beautiful on your clean skin! I&#x27;m 53 with a little dryness &amp; you won&#x27;t believe how it feels on your face!!! I&#x27;ve used it every night since I received it a week ago. NO greasiness! Just pure goodness! I&#x27;d buy it again and will! I thought the price was good plus Oil of Olay is a trusted brand so it was easy to decide which moisturizer to buy!</li>
            <li> great product and good price</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever for the woman of color, it does not dry out the akin it does as Says it does and revitalize your skin the correct way to look healthy</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past four nights now! I must say I am usually very happy with Olay products! This one has made me very pleased and happy. Within these four nights, I have seen a smoother, clearer and brighter complexion! I am acne prone, but haven&#x27;t had any issues for the longest! Will come back to my review with anything changes! Almost works like a vitamin C serum would!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years!!!</li>
            <li> I love the olay products.  We live in the desert and this cream is really good.  I appy it nightly and&lt;br /&gt;notice a difference in fine lines around my eyes.  Recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by stating that I am not one who likes to use skincare products, but I will continue to use this one!  After suffering from acne for many years and trying all sorts of generic to dermatologist-prescribed harsh cleansers &amp; creams to no avail, I am largely disillusioned with the usefulness of any of them.  (In fact, most products make my sensitive skin worse.)  What works best for my skin turns out to be touching it as little as possible; I don&#x27;t use cleansers anymore and instead simply splash my face with water once a day.  This has helped a lot, in addition to avoiding certain foods and eating a healthier diet.  However, although less frequently, I still experience mild-to-moderate breakouts, which often lead to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) or red spots.  Although PIH is temporary, it takes a long time to heal, and some of the darker marks make me more self-conscious. I decided to try this \\&quot;tone correcting\\&quot; moisturizer to see if it could help the PIH heal faster, not expecting that it would, and have been happily surprised with the results.  Although it is by no means a \\&quot;miracle cure,\\&quot; I do think this product has hastened the healing of my PIH and reduced its appearance.  Areas of redness that used to be on my cheeks and bother me seem much more faded, to the point where I don&#x27;t even think about it anymore.  Even more, this cream doesn&#x27;t break me out, whereas a lot of other products irritate my skin.  I like the way it looks, smells, and feels on my face.  I simply apply it before bed after I&#x27;ve splashed my face with water &amp; gently patted it dry.  It never leaves my skin feeling \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; the next morning either.  It&#x27;s great!  :)</li>
            <li> I began going into my wife&#x27;s cabinet and using this to try as I&#x27;m in my 30s now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it points for not making my face feel like there is paste or oil on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel prettier while putting it on, ok, that is exaggerated, but I see the emotional appeal of pampering my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, as with every other lotion I have tried, my eyes are wiggin out the next day like I have major eye allergies. Sunscreen is the worst in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;I simply must form the habit of washing my face in the morning, something else guys are just not accustomed to.</li>
            <li> this is really nice and my skin does feel smoother</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it….when winter arrives and the heat comes on in the house AND the skin dries out, we all need a little extra boost to keep skin (especially &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin) healthy.  I&#x27;ve tried several alternative creams, but have found that Olay still the best…thick, creamy, and readily absorbed.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the feel or look next day after using it the night before</li>
            <li> This Olay product is the worst of the line. Made my skin feel like sand paper and the product is very sticky.</li>
            <li> Olay has never disappointed.  I have tried all types of moisturizers that would also diminish blemish marks.  This works... noticeable difference within a week.</li>
            <li> Out of all the night moisturizers I have tried, this is my favorite. I love the scent - soothing right before bed. Creamy lotion, but not so heavy that it makes me sweat. I have seen some lightening of blotches, thank heavens!</li>
            <li> I have tried many Oil of Olay products and this Luminosity night cream may be my favorite. This product appeared on store shelves for a short time only, but then the Luminosity label shifted to the Regenerist Line and stores went back to the old Olay night cream without the luminosity ingredients. I am grateful to still be able to find this night cream on Amazon because when I wake up in the morning after using it, my face glows.  Of course, I eat and drink many healthy foods/drinks like fruit, vegetables, fish oil, green tea, and lemon water to help my skin, too; nevertheless, this cream makes the color of my skin look the prettiest of all the moisturizers. I still use a combination of the Oil of Olay Regenerist products and Professional products for daytime use to diminish the wrinkles, but nothing seems to make my skin so happy as this night cream.</li>
            <li> Not so much seeing of the tone correction, but it does nourish my skin well</li>
            <li> I HAVE PAYED MUCH MORE BUT HAVE NOT GOTTEN AND BETTER RESULTS THAN THIS, ADD YOUR OWN VIT E  AND VIT C LIQUID TO IT FOR THE BEST RESULTS!</li>
            <li> I have wicked fussy, sensitive skin.  This keeps me from those yucky dry flakes without causing me to break out.  &amp;#34;Win&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Have use d Olay products all my life and have never been disappoint. Nice fragence! Makes my face feel really smooth!</li>
            <li> Olay just has it!  No matter what I buy from them, it makes my skin radiant and beautiful.  I love this product, will be buying it again.  I am African American and it works beautifully for me.</li>
            <li> For those of us who have aging skin, I would say that something stronger, an anti-aging formula would be advisable. For that I like the Regenerist line by Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> I like this cream.  It&#x27;s moisturizing, but not so oily you can&#x27;t wear it under your makeup.  Has a pleasant smell, which I can say is a plus.  Some creams smell like they&#x27;re made for greasing vehicles not faces.  The price is unbeatable and I use it twice a day.  There is no such thing as a miracle cream. Life, experience and age bring on fine lines and wrinkles. This softens the fine lines and moisturizes without clogging pores (believe me I know, I see a dermatologist regularly, he would tell me!).  Try it, but wear your face and it&#x27;s character proudly!</li>
            <li> Good C/P value to keep skin smooth and moisture. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Good,try to remember to use each night.</li>
            <li> Considering the dry air from our central HVAC systems, it&#x27;s an obvious necessity to use good-quality skin moisturizers daily.  Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Tone Correcting Night Moisturizer has become my favorite solution.  Apart from the fact that this Olay product really does improve my skin, I can also state that this particular moisturizer leaves no mess on my favorite bed pillow.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> For lotion, it feel like BB cream. There is a sparkle to it and so far my skin does not like it. It is only the second night using it but it just feels awful. Lets just say I always feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup and can not wait to wash it off the following morning. I do feel like the toning could be a potential success though - way too soon to really tell.    Update: I have been using it for two weeks and it is just disgusting. When I rub my face the product rubs off onto me - it is literally like foundation instead of lotion. NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face because I love Olay product and I have never had any reason to doubt their product.</li>
            <li> Great night time moisturizer feels great on the skin about to reorder my second jar.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it!</li>
            <li> Not sure if my dark spots are fading, but this is a wonderful night time moisturizer!  It smells nice and makes my face feel really smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.. Leaves my skin feeling soft and even though I am prone to real outs this works really well</li>
            <li> While I have purchased the most expensive creams, this reasonably priced cream is just as good, if not better. I get compliments on my skin all the time despite the time i spend in the time living in Houston. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I like the effects of Olay products.  This one hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see any  visible improvement yet. Will probably try something else when the jar is empty. Wish I could stay with RetinA but the generic doesn&#x27;t do anything and Retin-A costs the moon, with no insurance to help.</li>
            <li> I use Olay products and have for years. This is a must have!</li>
            <li> love the smell, and how soft it leaves you skin, I will be ordering more when I need it :)</li>
            <li> cant really tell if it works or not, didnt take a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; photo</li>
            <li> This leaves a terrible film on your face and doesn&#x27;t seem to soak into your skin.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, and this made me break out with small pimples.  In addition, I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference.  Overall, the film it left on my skin was just too frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so I was delighted to find a night cream that was inexpensive and made my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Complete skin moisturizer under makeup for years.  Now that I&#x27;m getting older I decided to try this product.  I&#x27;m about halfway  thru the container, and I can see a visible reduction in fine lines.  I do wish it came in a larger container though, as I&#x27;m sure much of the expense goes into the packaging.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love it It&#x27;s nice non greasy and leave skin smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it works for tone correcting, but it moisturizes.  I can&#x27;t stop using it.  I love all of Olay&#x27;s night moisturizers and this one is as good as the others.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth.  I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet but it feels good to to have it on my face.</li>
            <li> Works well so far even though I frequently forget to use it. It did make me break out the first two times I used it at night. I actually put it on when I get out of the shower during the day now. Does what it says so far but didn&#x27;t know it had a shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, has a silky feel, not heavy cream. So far, pleased with product, too soon to tell of lasting benefit.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to notice if if does anything for my complexion, and I don&#x27;t think I will. It doesn&#x27;t mousturize my face at all, it&#x27;s sticky, and it has this weird shimmery stuff in it, which is useless.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on your skins. does help dry skin. but I have  saw no difference in tone, or anything that I expected from a well known Company.I have tried cheaper products and had the same results.</li>
            <li> This is the best night time moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used! Makes my skin baby soft and it smells great!  My husband likes it too.</li>
            <li> It really feels great as I put it on my skin.  And my skin feels nice.  I think it is as effective as the more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I  like Olay products and like having one jar arriving each month automatically.  It works well under makeup, as well as for night cream.</li>
            <li> Happy with this night cream.  I&#x27;ve used Olay products for years.  I think I&#x27;ve found my favorite night cream.  Not too greasy, but a deep moisturizer none-the-less.  Light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very nice night cream , very gentle and keeps face soft.</li>
            <li> LIVE IT LOVE IT USE IT</li>
            <li> Love the entire line of Olay products.  I have been using them for many year and at 59, I can use all the help I can get.  Most people think I&#x27;m still in my 40s.  So work it, work it, work it - OLAY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love all the Olay products. I think they work as good as the expensive department stores brand.</li>
            <li> Purchased this early for Christmas present. It is always on my daughters list. She has purchased this before and likes it alot. She always wants practical things for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Usually buy several at a time. LOVE LOVE this lotion.  Sometimes I will mix with a little of my base so it goes on much smoother.</li>
            <li> I use this faithfully every night. I love Olay products and have been using them for years. Your skin looks radiant in the morning after a good night&#x27;s sleep. I would recommend this to anyone interested in purchasing from Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Have not seen the wrinkle disappear, but I love the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, love how soft my skin feels. No complaints!</li>
            <li> works as advertised and is a light alternative to some heavier night creams</li>
            <li> its really didn&#x27;t help will not buy again</li>
    </ol>
