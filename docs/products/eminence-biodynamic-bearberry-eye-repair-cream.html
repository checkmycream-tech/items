            <li>I  love all of the Eminence Products.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I was beginning to notice some fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and felt the fine lines returning.</li>
            <li>Bearberry eye repair is supposed to help with fine lines and skin texture, but I haven&#x27;t seen this effect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for three months, and I honestly don&#x27;t think it is doing much except keeping the eye area moist.  </li>
            <li>Feels like a lotion, nothing special...</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this eye cream, and once it arrived (quickly shipped--thank you), I immediately opened it and tried it out.</li>
            <li>Love this product and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>It is very soft and therefore spreads easily without stretching the soft tissues around the eye area which I think is good.</li>
            <li>It has a light, fresh, natural scent, and it was filled to the top of the container.  </li>
            <li>Every product promises results, but it would be nice to actually see it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural eye cream than the one I use now, which is from a dermatology office.  </li>

            <li>Last year I started noticing fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was buying eye cream and got body lotion in a nice little eye cream jar.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t one of those products that has a large container but is only filled to 75%.  </li>
            <li>Found it here much cheaper for a 1 oz bottle (twice the amount of product).  </li>
            <li>I feel very ripped off.  </li>
            <li>All those organic ingredients must have been too much for her to</li>
            <li>And this time will be much more careful about where I leave it.</li>
            <li>very lightweight, scent-free cream.  </li>

            <li>I have sensetive skin and can&#x27;t use many other products.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m bummed that it didn&#x27;t live up to all the hype.</li>
            <li>Not sure that it&#x27;s any better than any other cream as far as wrinkles go, but it&#x27;s all natural, CRUELTY FREE and organic.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the spend, and environmentally responsible.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sleep deprived and probably dehydrated like 90% of the time and this STILL leaves me bag free and dark circle free.</li>
            <li>So far I like the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old.</li>
            <li>Purchased this because it is has natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I started using it early</li>
            <li>I have not found natural products that beat the ones sold in doctors&#x27; offices, but I keep trying.  </li>
            <li>Most eye creams are thick and emollient, so they stay in place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed, I&#x27;m not pleased</li>
            <li>It is really hard to rate this, as not enough time has laspsed to experience the full benefits!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s th e best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever found. I have sensetive skin and can&#x27;t use many other products. But this is very gentle and works beautifully!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price is great.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to rate this, as not enough time has laspsed to experience the full benefits! So far I like the product.</li>
            <li> I would love to but I don&#x27;t reveal my age; so let me just say, this product is wonderful.  Without a doubt the best eye cream (repair wear) I have ever used.  Pricey but a little goes a LONG way.  I bought 1/2 oz from my favorite spa and paid dearly.  Found it here much cheaper for a 1 oz bottle (twice the amount of product).  I hope I will always be able to afford this product.  Even my youngest son loves the smell of it when I am applying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an eye cream.  I&#x27;m not disappointed, I&#x27;m not pleased, it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s okay.  Will I buy again, no.  Feels like a lotion, nothing special...I&#x27;ll stick with my Eminence, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Maybe not special enough for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed. I heard a lot of ranting and raving about this product and also how some celebrities use it. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months now and haven&#x27;t seen the slightest difference. I wish there was a way to truly find out what products actually WORK. Every product promises results, but it would be nice to actually see it. I had high hopes for this product and I&#x27;m bummed that it didn&#x27;t live up to all the hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old. Last year I started noticing fine lines around my eyes. After using one pot of this cream I felt the difference. I stopped using it and felt the fine lines returning. I just purchased my second pot and plan to stick to it for a long while.</li>
            <li> The actual product and the box are two different items.  I feel very ripped off.  I was buying eye cream and got body lotion in a nice little eye cream jar.  Be very careful about buying from Earth Beauty Store.&lt;br /&gt;However within the same day, Earth Beauty has contacted me and is going to send out the correct product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when I got a free sample and was impressed with it. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I was beginning to notice some fine lines around my eyes. Purchased this because it is has natural ingredients and I don&#x27;t like using products with a lot of chemicals. I noticed a difference after only a couple of uses. Seems pricey for such a small amount, but you barely need even a small dot for it to spread around your eyes, so even though the jar is only 0.5 oz, it should last very long time. It is very soft and therefore spreads easily without stretching the soft tissues around the eye area which I think is good.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream!  Only need a tiny bit - jar lasts me 6 months.  Skin feels smooth and soft and really keeps wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I am extremely sleep deprived and probably dehydrated like 90% of the time and this STILL leaves me bag free and dark circle free. I started using it early and my mom started using it after trying everything and this has SAVED HER!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural eye cream than the one I use now, which is from a dermatology office.  I have not found natural products that beat the ones sold in doctors&#x27; offices, but I keep trying.  Why?  The dermatology products tend to be all chemicals.  But, they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot about Eminence online, so I decided to try the product line by ordering the Bearberry eye repair cream.  It has a light, fresh, natural scent, and it was filled to the top of the container.  It isn&#x27;t one of those products that has a large container but is only filled to 75%.  These are the good points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating this product only three stars, because I don&#x27;t think it works well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three months, and I honestly don&#x27;t think it is doing much except keeping the eye area moist.  I could get the same effect from a drug store product. Bearberry eye repair is supposed to help with fine lines and skin texture, but I haven&#x27;t seen this effect.  Also, the texture is too watery for eye cream.  Most eye creams are thick and emollient, so they stay in place.  Not this one.  The texture is more like a light daytime facial moisturizer.  It slowly seeps into my eyes while I sleep, causing me to wake with irritated eyes.  If I use the the product only under my eyes, this doesn&#x27;t happen.  Ultimately I want to condition my eyelids too and reduce wrinkles around my eyes.  So I went back to using my doctor&#x27;s office eye cream again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products from Eminence may be good, but I do not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this eye cream, and once it arrived (quickly shipped--thank you), I immediately opened it and tried it out. Velvety and creamy with a pleasant scent that wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I put the cream on the stairs, planning on taking it up to the bathroom on my next trip. Unfortunately, my dog managed to unscrew the lid and lick every last bit of cream out of the jar. All those organic ingredients must have been too much for her to resist.&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered it again. And this time will be much more careful about where I leave it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this eye cream.  I&#x27;ve been unable to find an eye cream I felt worked to combat puffy, tired, fine lined eyes without causing an allergic reaction (I seem to have a reaction to anything that has a &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; target, including my favorite brand of products from Aveda.).  This is an excellent product I found through a spa in Tulsa, and I&#x27;ve continued using it since.</li>
            <li> Not sure that it&#x27;s any better than any other cream as far as wrinkles go, but it&#x27;s all natural, CRUELTY FREE and organic.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the spend, and environmentally responsible.</li>
            <li> very lightweight, scent-free cream.  The skin above my eyelids and under my eye area was so dry and irritated; everything burned, but this eye cream did not.  It helped with the dryness.  I can even use it in the morning before I put on my eye make-up, and it won&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> I love this it makes your eyes just feel so good  I  love all of the Eminence Products.  You can&#x27;t go wrong using these</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly and feels good on the skin.  It&#x27;s great just like all Eminence products. It is not irritating to the skin and has almost no scent at all.</li>
