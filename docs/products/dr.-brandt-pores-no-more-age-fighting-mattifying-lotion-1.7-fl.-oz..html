            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the anti-aging thing because I thankfully have flawless wrinkle-free skin (one of the advantages to having oily skin).  </li>
            <li>B000CQPRBE Mary Kay Oil Mattifier]] works best at around two hours.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and it works great under&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very light and has no scent, which is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and wonderful and I don&#x27;t have to blot all day.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>So, it does what it advertises but make sure you moisturize at night after taking your makeup off.</li>
            <li>Came on time love the product...</li>
            <li>Love my Dr. Brandt anti aging mattifying lotion..</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and these ingredients are great</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for absorbing excess oil and helping me not get shiny throughout the day, while still being very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Mattifier SPF 15 1.7 oz]] to be the absolute best at oil control and lasting up to 6-8 hours.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge so will last for more than a year</li>
            <li>If I put this on first then my make up</li>
            <li>Definitely prevents shine while moisturizing.  :)</li>
            <li>I think I threw the first one out mistakenly.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my makeup routine because my skin is oily and this product helps with this problem.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this, but it just made me break out and didn&#x27;t have any effect on my pores or oiliness.</li>
            <li>I would say my skin is normally mild-moderately oily.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a 45 year old with very oily skin and have a hard time in the summer months with my skin - this product is great and a little goes a long way - it provides an all day matte finish that my makeup glides easily over..</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this lotion does not irritate it at all.  </li>
            <li>I am 43 years old.  </li>
            <li>So far the moisturizer does</li>
            <li>I use this every day under my make-up, sparingly, and it does a really great job at keeping your makeup from becoming nasty with oil or sweat.  </li>
            <li>old and thought I&#x27;d try something \\&quot;better\\&quot; and more expensive to see if there would be an improvement on wrinkles, dryness, and pore refinement than neutrogena or the cheaper facial lotions that you can find at the pharmacy.</li>

            <li> Amazing! Love this stuff - just spent all day outside in Texas and still not oily and sweaty like I would have been without this product. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It does a hood job controlling oil on my face.  I have sensitive skin, but this lotion does not irritate it at all.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I received a sample from IPSY and had to order it.  It really helps my makeup routine because my skin is oily and this product helps with this problem.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over 3 week and haven&#x27;t noticed anything. I bought all of the products for age and pore refining, from the cleanser, pores no more vacuum, refiner, mattifying lotion... But they were a rip off. I am 40 yrs. old and thought I&#x27;d try something \\&quot;better\\&quot; and more expensive to see if there would be an improvement on wrinkles, dryness, and pore refinement than neutrogena or the cheaper facial lotions that you can find at the pharmacy. Unfortunately, Dr. Brandt did nothing to clear pores, moisturize, or refine wrinkles. Just a rip off.</li>
            <li> This product is A MUST for those of us with oily skin.  It truly gives a mattified look that lasts all day.  I am 43 years old.  I can&#x27;t speak to the anti-aging thing because I thankfully have flawless wrinkle-free skin (one of the advantages to having oily skin).  My skin feels soft and wonderful and I don&#x27;t have to blot all day.  I put a bit of oil control gel on once or twice about mid-day but other than that, my face is PERFECTION. This product is worth EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! I have very oily skin and my make up never makes it through the day. If I put this on first then my make up it will stay on all day!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a 45 year old with very oily skin and have a hard time in the summer months with my skin - this product is great and a little goes a long way - it provides an all day matte finish that my makeup glides easily over..love it love it love it</li>
            <li> I use this every day under my make-up, sparingly, and it does a really great job at keeping your makeup from becoming nasty with oil or sweat.  It is very light and has no scent, which is perfect for me.  This bottle is huge so will last for more than a year (like I said, use sparingly; doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do the job).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Definitely prevents shine while moisturizing.  :)</li>
            <li> 30 y.o. caucasian female... used this for several days (sample from Sephora), and though it does mattify for a few hours, it doesn&#x27;t last, and my face looks like an oil slick. I would say my skin is normally mild-moderately oily. I prefer the Murad oil-controlling mattifier.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but it just made me break out and didn&#x27;t have any effect on my pores or oiliness.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for absorbing excess oil and helping me not get shiny throughout the day, while still being very moisturizing. I wear it day and night. I&#x27;m not sure about the anti-aging effects. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and these ingredients are great - the lotion seems to actually improve my skin.</li>
            <li> I found that this lotion did keep my skin matte under my makeup but I noticed it was drying. Every time I use it, the next day I have dry patches all over my cheeks, chin and forehead. So, it does what it advertises but make sure you moisturize at night after taking your makeup off.</li>
            <li> I purchased two TRIAL tubes of the Dr. Brandt Shincare pores no more anti-aging mattifying lotion thinking that because it says \\&quot;mattifying\\&quot; that it would keep the oil away.  Wrong.  It actually made my face oilier.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a week using after washing my face with my $200 Clarisonic Skin Care System and this product does not work for what I purchased it for and will throw it out.  Because of my oily skin I don&#x27;t have wrinkles at age 68.  I must say that for oil control [[ASIN:B000CQPRBE Mary Kay Oil Mattifier]] works best at around two hours.  I even purchased it twice.  I think I threw the first one out mistakenly.  I waited a couple of weeks and decided to try it again and searched high and low and unable to find the first tube, I purchased a second tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-4-14:  I have found [[ASIN:B001LNTNGC Murad Oil-Control Mattifier SPF 15 1.7 oz]] to be the absolute best at oil control and lasting up to 6-8 hours.  This one tube will probably last me the rest of my life.  It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after receiving a sample in my Ipsy bag. So far the moisturizer does it&#x27;s job and it goes on well. I wear it under my sunscreen and makeup daily. I do still get oily towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Well, I still have wrinkles, but I shouldn&#x27;t expect miracles at my age!</li>
            <li> Came on time love the product...</li>
            <li> Love my Dr. Brandt anti aging mattifying lotion..I have oily skin and it works great under&lt;br /&gt;my foundation..have been using it for over one year and a half..recommend it...</li>
