            <li>It&#x27;s a very light oil that&#x27;s good for massaging the scalp.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if I had a percentage off the price.  </li>
            <li>I cut my hair, it kind of look like a bob cut</li>

            <li>All of this helps keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>but I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found out a solution to make this smell any better</li>
            <li>Most of the time I use it at night before bed because it is oily.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you understand oil promotes hair growth</li>
            <li>If this product doesn&#x27;t work that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but it got thicker and my curl pattern looked more organized and healthy</li>
            <li>i love this product it works.</li>
            <li>I love gro aut oil because I&#x27;ve tried every thing and nothing worked for me but after 2 weeks I saw an inch of growth  and this product works well with my type of hair</li>
            <li>We would like more.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m liking this product even more</li>
            <li>I also love that the smell is not overbearing.</li>
            <li>It was okay.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>It works love love it</li>
            <li>Yet it&#x27;s safe for children?</li>

            <li>Gro-aut Hair Growth Oil has help my hair to grow faster and healthier, even though most of my hair is now gray.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known about this product many, many years ago.</li>
            <li>All in all, am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Going to buy some more.  </li>
            <li>but it works:)</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!!!</li>
            <li>It really works!!!!</li>
            <li>However, drinking plenty of water, healthy diet, exercise and taking a vitamin make a huge difference for healthy growing hair.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit strong, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it has grown.  </li>
            <li>I like this product and recommend it for healthy hear and smooth</li>
            <li>She is becoming herself again.</li>
            <li>it came early which was great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light comparing to many oils on the market.</li>
            <li>Hair hasn&#x27;t seen much growth, good applicator bottle though.</li>
            <li>when I open the box, it was securely wrapped in bubble wrap and when I took the cap off it had a protective seal on it which was very good.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove with just shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Assuming this could be an easy fix, I contacted Gro-aut Solutions.</li>
            <li>Easy to moisturize my hair</li>
            <li>but it seems to work just fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and makes the hair easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even wash it out of my fine hair,</li>
            <li>All the ingredients are all natural &amp; have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>i havent noticed any huge hair growth as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve seen youTube tutorials on this and people saying it really grew their hair out and to be honest I didn&#x27;t believe them.</li>
            <li>Is it still available?  </li>
            <li>Feels great, although I have not seen results yet and im in my second bottle.  </li>
            <li>I know it doesnt sound like a lot</li>
            <li>Please explain to me WHY my daughters hair turned light brown after trying this oil ONCE?</li>
            <li>My hair is growing like weed, awesome product I use it everyday</li>
            <li>This product is great within the first week or two my hair grew a complete inch.</li>
            <li>the order arrived super fast and was packaged nice.</li>
            <li>I love this product it does exactly what it says it will do promote hair growth.</li>
            <li>I feel like I use a lot and the bottle is still full with usage about 4 times a week.</li>
            <li>Solution seems good enough but the package was leaking and the bottle still leaks.</li>
            <li>Its cool.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone that wants silkier and healthy hair</li>
            <li>also when I use it it make a cool feeling in my head</li>
            <li>( but not bad)</li>
            <li>not bad</li>
            <li>And, the smell is sooo strong its just too much</li>
            <li>GOOD FOR DRY SCALP</li>
            <li>but I use the product at night because it does make my hair really greasy and the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>will order in the future for sure!  </li>
            <li>We both agree that this is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the amount of growth I receive (</li>
            <li>so I can get my money&#x27;s worth, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy the product again.</li>
            <li>I noticed growth with in a weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is quite noticeable, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is for a different kind of hair than mine -</li>
            <li>I use it as the directions says and it wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural and safe.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Yeah right.</li>
            <li>I started using it right away</li>
            <li>I like this product, my only issue is that it has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>The smell was too strong for me and it really didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>It is my first time using this product, but I have seen good results from this product on other people.</li>
            <li>She is so happy that her hair is starting to grow and is starting to put on make up again.</li>
            <li>im not even as consistent as i planned to have been and in 14 days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did research and stumbled across this product 💃💃💃 with the results I&#x27;m seeing at such a speedy rate, I think I will be able to finally stop wearing wigs before the year ends.</li>
            <li>My hair is at my is at the top of my spine bone on my back</li>
            <li>I am willing to try anything to get my hair back healthy, stronger and longer.</li>
            <li>Wish me luck.... will post more later.</li>
            <li>I had my first chemo</li>
            <li>2 inches since I first used it over a month ago.</li>
            <li>, I do my protein treatment with Megatek Cell Rebuilder, I hot oil with JBCO for 15 mins and  </li>
            <li>it has a funny smell but</li>
            <li>Not only does it encourage hair growth but it makes my kinky hair softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>there are other amazing products that will.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and really haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change, but I might need to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>I used a bit too much the first time</li>
            <li>and it had a long way to come. :)</li>
            <li>At first I put a bit too much on.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and full.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that my hair will be strong enough  to help me.</li>
            <li>I am so completely and utterly amazed and excited at how quick my grandmother&#x27;s hair grew while using the Gro-aut Hair Growth Oil.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would get the results that I have, fast growing, thicker, fuller hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and recommend it</li>
            <li>Nothing has worked as fast as this product.</li>
            <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t see much growth.</li>
            <li>and I have a very strict hair regimen.</li>
            <li>No results at this moment, of course is too fast, but let me tell you that is not that kind of oil that you put and starting coming out on the back of your head.  </li>
            <li>I bought this with my eyebrows in mind and it has worked really well.</li>
            <li>Fast ship.</li>
            <li>so much thank you</li>
            <li>I really like this hair oil.  </li>
            <li>It works very well after washing the hair.  </li>
            <li>But now, I use very little--which is what you are supposed to do</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking very oily</li>
            <li>The bottle isn&#x27;t the biggest but you also don&#x27;t use a whole lot</li>
            <li>I thought it would grow my daughter&#x27;s hair fast as it advertise</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It really hasn&#x27;t done any if the things mentioned</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>??? I think it doesn&#x27;t really work with my hair type?</li>
            <li>really like it.  </li>
            <li>so hoping this really works fast.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Did not like the smell, did really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I was really looking foward to a result but didnt get one</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks..  </li>
            <li>It has sort of an herbal scent, so I try not to use too much at once or before going to an event.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I really like it.</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients and especially the biotin!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how much, but significant enough for me to have to touch up my color this weekend.</li>
            <li>i have ben pleased with this product I just have to learned to not put so much on but other  </li>
            <li>Though, it is to soon to  actually provide an accurate rating; not quite enough time of has passed with usage for true results.  </li>
            <li>Had better luck with other hair growth oils.</li>
            <li>I use this daily,  I also add it to my special leave in conditioner with peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>For example: I normally wash my hair twice per week; but after using this product, it is more like every other day.</li>
            <li>I found it on a hair forum when I first went natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn locs for 6 years and I noticed slight thinning at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Washing my hair once a week kept my hair cleaning, and I feel the maintenance (more than the oil) caused the slight growth in my hair.</li>
            <li>It has more body and a lot less shedding.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll most likely only use it before I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I still have not heard from anybody it was not a full bottle most of it leaked out</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, it might take a little more time to see results.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and with a ton of moisture!!</li>
            <li>IT REALLY HAD MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINY...</li>
            <li>but im not sure I really saw results maybe if I bought more than one bottle butbits kinda steep in price.</li>
            <li>I normally use Minovol drops as a growth aid but the consistency is close to water</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help my hair grow any faster than normal either.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash this oil out of your hair once or a few times a week.</li>
            <li>This oil is really light compared to other hair growth oils that I&#x27;ve tried and the scent isn&#x27;t as offensive.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth yet</li>
            <li>product appears to be brand new,</li>
            <li>Your results probably won&#x27;t be as dramatic as others on YouTube report, but it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>It also makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>After using this product for more  than a year  I have seen very little results in  the length of my hair, maybe because I am post menopausal.</li>
            <li>Would definitely reorder product if results continue to be positive.  </li>
            <li>when you first apply it the scent is very pungent, but after a few minutes I am left with a fresh lavendar scent.</li>
            <li>; it actually arrived so fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this happen if the ingredients are supposedly all natural.</li>
            <li>Made it soft but did not grow my hair.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients</li>
            <li>(I have 4c natural hair)</li>
            <li>I got the product and using it every chance I get, so far I see progress</li>
            <li>Really soft hair tho(:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil for two weeks now along with doing the GHE for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t embrace the CG method 100%, I&#x27;m finding out what does work for my hair on this natural hair journey.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m unimpressed.</li>
            <li>After one application of this my hair felt soft and silky again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if it has produced any hair growth.</li>
            <li>I like this product, I had a thinning area near my temple and massaging the oil in the spot</li>
            <li>My wife can already tell the difference and so can I. Her hair is soft, no longer plagued with brittle hair caused by her Hashimoto disease.</li>
            <li>A real life saver as she was starting to lose her hair rapidly</li>
            <li>am going natural</li>
            <li>Sleep with a satin, silk scarf on at night to protect my natural hair from breakage and messing up.</li>
            <li>Great hair oil, light doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down or leave an unpleasant of chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Ladies, be careful of how you use this at first.</li>
            <li>You will have to wash your hair double the time you would normally wash it.</li>
            <li>My grandmother was depressed and I was desperate to get my happy go getter grandmother back.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural (no perm) and i normally wear it straightened or stretched out.</li>
            <li>unless using protection and get a micro fiber towel regular towels suck the oils out of your hair and dry it out use shampoo every other day and eat protein you could easily grow 2 inches a month this way</li>
            <li>Im using right now for less than a month</li>
            <li>I am 100% natural, no flat iron or relaxers.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really tell the results.  </li>
            <li>I have even noticed healthier growth, not really a difference in growth, but my hair grows fast</li>
            <li>but i have only used for about 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li>I use this as a deep conditioner on my hair, with kinky curly natural it helps to soften my hair</li>
            <li>When arrived, my protective seal had been broken and when I smelled it I realized it smelled more of olive oil</li>
            <li>and though the smell isnt heavenly its not bad.. its just a medicated smell in a few weeks check out my reviews for a conditioner that essentially softens my hair and unkinks it</li>
            <li>Love it, and I use this to mix it with my Jamaican Black Castor Oil Extra Dark.</li>
            <li>I have purchased gro-aut previously from the website, so I knew exactly what to expect.</li>
            <li>I am a woman of color and my scalp always feels dry, I use it mainly for deep moisture and it does the job on my bra strap length hair.</li>
            <li>I saw an improvement within the first few months and yes an increase in growth.</li>
            <li>So far it heals the dry scalp spots.</li>
            <li>It relieves not only my dry scalp, but also stimulates and completely eases any itchiness.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin color treated hair.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Which i love!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light oil that&#x27;s good for massaging the scalp.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if I had a percentage off the price.  </li>
            <li> I cut my hair, it kind of look like a bob cut</li>

            <li> My girls love this product</li>
            <li> I love that</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was my order...</li>
            <li> Amazon is my site of choice for most things</li>
            <li> Would like to order more.</li>
            <li> All of this helps keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> but I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found out a solution to make this smell any better</li>
            <li> Most of the time I use it at night before bed because it is oily.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you understand oil promotes hair growth</li>
            <li> If this product doesn&#x27;t work that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> but it got thicker and my curl pattern looked more organized and healthy</li>
            <li> i love this product it works.</li>
            <li> I love gro aut oil because I&#x27;ve tried every thing and nothing worked for me but after 2 weeks I saw an inch of growth  and this product works well with my type of hair</li>
            <li> We would like more.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m liking this product even more</li>
            <li> I also love that the smell is not overbearing.</li>
            <li> It was okay.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> It works love love it</li>
            <li> Yet it&#x27;s safe for children?</li>
            <li> I actually love the smell of this herbally solution.  </li>
            <li> Gro-aut Hair Growth Oil has help my hair to grow faster and healthier, even though most of my hair is now gray.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this product many, many years ago.</li>
            <li> All in all, am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Going to buy some more.  </li>
            <li> but it works:)</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!!!</li>
            <li> It really works!!!!</li>
            <li> However, drinking plenty of water, healthy diet, exercise and taking a vitamin make a huge difference for healthy growing hair.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit strong, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it has grown.  </li>
            <li> I like this product and recommend it for healthy hear and smooth</li>
            <li> She is becoming herself again.</li>
            <li> it came early which was great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light comparing to many oils on the market.</li>
            <li> Hair hasn&#x27;t seen much growth, good applicator bottle though.</li>
            <li> when I open the box, it was securely wrapped in bubble wrap and when I took the cap off it had a protective seal on it which was very good.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove with just shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Assuming this could be an easy fix, I contacted Gro-aut Solutions.</li>
            <li> Easy to moisturize my hair</li>
            <li> but it seems to work just fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and makes the hair easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even wash it out of my fine hair,</li>
            <li> All the ingredients are all natural &amp; have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> i havent noticed any huge hair growth as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve seen youTube tutorials on this and people saying it really grew their hair out and to be honest I didn&#x27;t believe them.</li>
            <li> Is it still available?  </li>
            <li> Feels great, although I have not seen results yet and im in my second bottle.  </li>
            <li> I know it doesnt sound like a lot</li>
            <li> Please explain to me WHY my daughters hair turned light brown after trying this oil ONCE?</li>
            <li> My hair is growing like weed, awesome product I use it everyday</li>
            <li> This product is great within the first week or two my hair grew a complete inch.</li>
            <li> the order arrived super fast and was packaged nice.</li>
            <li> I love this product it does exactly what it says it will do promote hair growth.</li>
            <li> I feel like I use a lot and the bottle is still full with usage about 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> Solution seems good enough but the package was leaking and the bottle still leaks.</li>
            <li> Its cool.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone that wants silkier and healthy hair</li>
            <li> also when I use it it make a cool feeling in my head</li>
            <li> ( but not bad)</li>
            <li> not bad</li>
            <li> And, the smell is sooo strong its just too much</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR DRY SCALP</li>
            <li> but I use the product at night because it does make my hair really greasy and the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> will order in the future for sure!  </li>
            <li> We both agree that this is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the amount of growth I receive (</li>
            <li> so I can get my money&#x27;s worth, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy the product again.</li>
            <li> I noticed growth with in a weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is quite noticeable, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is for a different kind of hair than mine -</li>
            <li> I use it as the directions says and it wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural and safe.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> Yeah right.</li>
            <li> I started using it right away</li>
            <li> I like this product, my only issue is that it has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li> The smell was too strong for me and it really didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> It is my first time using this product, but I have seen good results from this product on other people.</li>
            <li> She is so happy that her hair is starting to grow and is starting to put on make up again.</li>
            <li> im not even as consistent as i planned to have been and in 14 days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did research and stumbled across this product 💃💃💃 with the results I&#x27;m seeing at such a speedy rate, I think I will be able to finally stop wearing wigs before the year ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is at my is at the top of my spine bone on my back</li>
            <li> I am willing to try anything to get my hair back healthy, stronger and longer.</li>
            <li> Wish me luck.... will post more later.</li>
            <li> I had my first chemo</li>
            <li> 2 inches since I first used it over a month ago.</li>
            <li> , I do my protein treatment with Megatek Cell Rebuilder, I hot oil with JBCO for 15 mins and  </li>
            <li> it has a funny smell but</li>
            <li> Not only does it encourage hair growth but it makes my kinky hair softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> there are other amazing products that will.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and really haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change, but I might need to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> I used a bit too much the first time</li>
            <li> and it had a long way to come. :)</li>
            <li> At first I put a bit too much on.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and full.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that my hair will be strong enough  to help me.</li>
            <li> I am so completely and utterly amazed and excited at how quick my grandmother&#x27;s hair grew while using the Gro-aut Hair Growth Oil.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would get the results that I have, fast growing, thicker, fuller hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and recommend it</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked as fast as this product.</li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t see much growth.</li>
            <li> and I have a very strict hair regimen.</li>
            <li> No results at this moment, of course is too fast, but let me tell you that is not that kind of oil that you put and starting coming out on the back of your head.  </li>
            <li> I bought this with my eyebrows in mind and it has worked really well.</li>
            <li> Fast ship.</li>
            <li> so much thank you</li>
            <li> I really like this hair oil.  </li>
            <li> It works very well after washing the hair.  </li>
            <li> But now, I use very little--which is what you are supposed to do</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking very oily</li>
            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t the biggest but you also don&#x27;t use a whole lot</li>
            <li> I thought it would grow my daughter&#x27;s hair fast as it advertise</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It really hasn&#x27;t done any if the things mentioned</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> ??? I think it doesn&#x27;t really work with my hair type?</li>
            <li> really like it.  </li>
            <li> so hoping this really works fast.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell, did really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I was really looking foward to a result but didnt get one</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks..  </li>
            <li> It has sort of an herbal scent, so I try not to use too much at once or before going to an event.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I really like it.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients and especially the biotin!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much, but significant enough for me to have to touch up my color this weekend.</li>
            <li> i have ben pleased with this product I just have to learned to not put so much on but other  </li>
            <li> Though, it is to soon to  actually provide an accurate rating; not quite enough time of has passed with usage for true results.  </li>
            <li> Had better luck with other hair growth oils.</li>
            <li> I use this daily,  I also add it to my special leave in conditioner with peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> For example: I normally wash my hair twice per week; but after using this product, it is more like every other day.</li>
            <li> I found it on a hair forum when I first went natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn locs for 6 years and I noticed slight thinning at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Washing my hair once a week kept my hair cleaning, and I feel the maintenance (more than the oil) caused the slight growth in my hair.</li>
            <li> It has more body and a lot less shedding.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll most likely only use it before I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I still have not heard from anybody it was not a full bottle most of it leaked out</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , it might take a little more time to see results.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and with a ton of moisture!!</li>
            <li> IT REALLY HAD MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINY...</li>
            <li> but im not sure I really saw results maybe if I bought more than one bottle butbits kinda steep in price.</li>
            <li> I normally use Minovol drops as a growth aid but the consistency is close to water</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my hair grow any faster than normal either.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash this oil out of your hair once or a few times a week.</li>
            <li> This oil is really light compared to other hair growth oils that I&#x27;ve tried and the scent isn&#x27;t as offensive.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth yet</li>
            <li> product appears to be brand new,</li>
            <li> Your results probably won&#x27;t be as dramatic as others on YouTube report, but it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> It also makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> After using this product for more  than a year  I have seen very little results in  the length of my hair, maybe because I am post menopausal.</li>
            <li> Would definitely reorder product if results continue to be positive.  </li>
            <li> when you first apply it the scent is very pungent, but after a few minutes I am left with a fresh lavendar scent.</li>
            <li> ; it actually arrived so fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this happen if the ingredients are supposedly all natural.</li>
            <li> Made it soft but did not grow my hair.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients</li>
            <li> (I have 4c natural hair)</li>
            <li> I got the product and using it every chance I get, so far I see progress</li>
            <li> Really soft hair tho(:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for two weeks now along with doing the GHE for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t embrace the CG method 100%, I&#x27;m finding out what does work for my hair on this natural hair journey.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m unimpressed.</li>
            <li> After one application of this my hair felt soft and silky again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if it has produced any hair growth.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I had a thinning area near my temple and massaging the oil in the spot</li>
            <li> My wife can already tell the difference and so can I. Her hair is soft, no longer plagued with brittle hair caused by her Hashimoto disease.</li>
            <li> A real life saver as she was starting to lose her hair rapidly</li>
            <li> am going natural</li>
            <li> Sleep with a satin, silk scarf on at night to protect my natural hair from breakage and messing up.</li>
            <li> Great hair oil, light doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down or leave an unpleasant of chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Ladies, be careful of how you use this at first.</li>
            <li> You will have to wash your hair double the time you would normally wash it.</li>
            <li> My grandmother was depressed and I was desperate to get my happy go getter grandmother back.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural (no perm) and i normally wear it straightened or stretched out.</li>
            <li> unless using protection and get a micro fiber towel regular towels suck the oils out of your hair and dry it out use shampoo every other day and eat protein you could easily grow 2 inches a month this way</li>
            <li> Im using right now for less than a month</li>
            <li> I am 100% natural, no flat iron or relaxers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really tell the results.  </li>
            <li> I have even noticed healthier growth, not really a difference in growth, but my hair grows fast</li>
            <li> but i have only used for about 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li> I use this as a deep conditioner on my hair, with kinky curly natural it helps to soften my hair</li>
            <li> When arrived, my protective seal had been broken and when I smelled it I realized it smelled more of olive oil</li>
            <li> and though the smell isnt heavenly its not bad.. its just a medicated smell in a few weeks check out my reviews for a conditioner that essentially softens my hair and unkinks it</li>
            <li> Love it, and I use this to mix it with my Jamaican Black Castor Oil Extra Dark.</li>
            <li> I have purchased gro-aut previously from the website, so I knew exactly what to expect.</li>
            <li> I am a woman of color and my scalp always feels dry, I use it mainly for deep moisture and it does the job on my bra strap length hair.</li>
            <li> I saw an improvement within the first few months and yes an increase in growth.</li>
            <li> So far it heals the dry scalp spots.</li>
            <li> It relieves not only my dry scalp, but also stimulates and completely eases any itchiness.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this oil for over 6 months and haven&#x27;t seen any improvements, all it does is give me a heavy case of dandruff, really regret buying this product especially for so much money, total waste of time!</li>
            <li> at least 2in a mo) when I am consistent in my use of this oil mixed into my weekly overnight deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> other then natural growth</li>
            <li> i am Puerto Rican and African American and my hair had been very long until I went to cosmetology school</li>
            <li> , however, I find the gro-aut oil to be a little pricey, unfortunately I wont be able to order as frequently as I would like.</li>
            <li> Too much money to spend to get my usual results.</li>
            <li> Its not worse but not better.  </li>
            <li> I have a few gray strains that had been covered with henna, but I have about 1/4 inch of new growth on those strains in two weeks.</li>
            <li> I decided a wanted a bob cut &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; bad idea it like old cute</li>
            <li> Overall the oil has stopped the dryness problem I was having (due to dimethicone use), but I&#x27;ve also been using some Brahmi-Alma oil during my DC treatments, so I think its a combination of both oils and the GHE process to get my hair moisture balance back.</li>
            <li> Since then I have tried other products and various hair growth methods, but I always come back to this oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long long time and it does work.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using and see what results I get in the long haul.  </li>
            <li> I would order it again although it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but I way miss the long hair</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know that my hair could grow so fast, and so thick.</li>
            <li> I would dab a little of the gro-aut oil on my eyebrows, &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed the hair starting to grow back.</li>
            <li> I only gave this three stars because the other reviews saya it worked for them</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any major changes or even little changes -</li>
            <li> and they have piss-poor excuse for customer service!</li>
            <li> So I had very long wavy hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very long hair and gotten it cut plenty of times in a boy style</li>
            <li> It also helped with my hair breakage ,shedding and just helping it not be so dry..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll let it air dry</li>
            <li> I can say it does keep her hair from being dry.</li>
            <li> True story,my eyebrows became short &amp; thin due to waxing over the years, everyday or every other day</li>
            <li> However, the slight buildup is not enough to deter use.</li>
            <li> It did not really work.</li>
            <li> so I always use it when my hair is wet</li>
            <li> so you can only imagine what my hair is like air dried</li>
            <li> I saw no growth after two months, even used as expected</li>
            <li> it came empty because it spilled all over the envlope .</li>
            <li> I have noticed some shedding and my scalp is itching, but according to the gro-aut website this is expected.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was as expected</li>
            <li> I have thin, Caucasian, straight, hair and had to was my hair every morning after keeping it in all night.</li>
            <li> Not really any growth though.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day with dr. Miracles hair follicle creme, and I wash my hair with Groganics shampoo and conditioner weekly.</li>
            <li> Use every other day.  </li>
            <li> I use this every other day.</li>
            <li> You can use other products to help mask the smell of it if it truly does disturb you.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my ends twice a day and my roots every other day.</li>
            <li> A year ago my grandmother had to cut and shave off part of her hair due to brain surgery.</li>
            <li> Due to the radiation treatment her hair wasnt growing AT</li>
            <li> Other oils I&#x27;ve tried seem to soak in, this one did not for me.</li>
            <li> excessive shedding at first but after 4 days decreased</li>
            <li> I have thick course curly hair and this product has enhanced all of the above.</li>
            <li> Many people said they hate the smell, I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell of it once it dies down.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t drip all down your neck when you use it, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I usually use just use a leave-in-conditioner and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I do not use it everyday, just every other day.</li>
            <li> A very small amount massaged into my hair daily keeps tangles and breakage away!</li>
            <li> and I get a slight buildup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a month</li>
            <li> and I started using it and about a month in a half my hair already grew out.</li>
            <li> I am a mutt; I&#x27;m Puerto Rican,Cuban and Black</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe after 2 weeks of using this product my hair grew like a half an inch and then after 1 month it grew an inch and a half</li>
            <li> I grow an inch and a half because I have fastish growing hair</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve used about half of the bottle</li>
            <li> Came leaking and a mess.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s when my hair started to look a mess because of tons of , being over processed not having the time to take care of it</li>
            <li> It worked a little in a month time</li>
            <li> but however when I was my hair I put a little on my scalp, it does leave a cooling feeling.</li>
            <li> Although I did not achieve an inch I did, however, get a little over a centimeter of growth.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that I have little baby hairs growing.</li>
            <li> It may be a little pricey</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes along way and if used SPARINGLY, it leaves my twist out style shiny and fluffy.</li>
            <li> It came within a few days literally.</li>
            <li> I will not recommend to Anyone it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a few inches of growth in a 4 month time period.</li>
            <li> Dried my scalp, my scalp isn&#x27;t moisturized at all.</li>
            <li> every few days is helping its growth.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t take the pills everyday but they are working also</li>
            <li> not sure if its working haven&#x27;t seen a change in hair, has a smell that I do not like, but I still use it everyday to see if change will come?</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T STRESS because it will slow down the process.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t open the package because I thought it was something else until I got bored and opened it.</li>
            <li> I never rant or rave about hair products because nothing has helped with my hair loss problem since I was a small child..</li>
            <li> I will say I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the oil alone because I also take biotin</li>
            <li> I did notice my hair grow and some thickness, but I&#x27;m not sure if I can give the oil credit for that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the alternate oil did not absorb into my hair like the Gro-aut oil.</li>
            <li> All this oil did was make my hair greasy with just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re want</li>
            <li> also get it trimmed 1/8 of an inch every 12 weeks that will help also so your hairs not working so hard to fix split</li>
            <li> I will put another review in at least one month.</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a week</li>
            <li> and I shampoo my hair at least twice a week.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> My hair grows really slow</li>
            <li> my hairs also thick all around not so whispy on the ends</li>
            <li> And has made my hair thick at the roots</li>
            <li> Does it mean, its doing its job.</li>
            <li> BUT this time I used biotin and my hair grew like an inch in two weeks you need to take biotin with the oil seriously grow your hair and inch a month</li>
            <li> even if I silly use a few drops.</li>
            <li> I have bad shedding/breakage and my edges starting to thin.</li>
            <li> I have recommemded to others, very hard to find.</li>
            <li> You just have to be patient and another secret is if your tryna grow your hair out</li>
            <li> This product makes the hair too greasy and difficult to wash and to style.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it smells awful &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this - read the reviews and took a chance</li>
            <li> ill keep yall updated on how it works on my hair.</li>
            <li> Also I noticed my scalp would itch like crazy after I applied the oil.</li>
            <li> made my hair look greasy and dirty</li>
            <li> unbelievable!!!!</li>
            <li> duhhh!</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t to bad either</li>
            <li> The smell was as bad as some reviews.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> so I was shocked to see that Gro-aut were the suppliers for Amazon.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nasty and it stinks</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> So here I am, worst use of my money ever..</li>
            <li> I am stationed over in Afghan and the water is horrible.</li>
            <li> hate it!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After using this product for more  than a year  I have seen very little results in  the length of my hair, maybe because I am post menopausal.</li>
            <li> im not even as consistent as i planned to have been and in 14 days ive definately seen a inch of growth maybe more</li>
            <li> My girls love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several products, (the Gro-aut oil, shampoo &amp; herbal conditioner) &amp; each time I&#x27;ve never had to wait longer than 2-3 days for my order to arrive.  I love that; it actually arrived so fast I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was my order...lol!!!  I never thought I would get the results that I have, fast growing, thicker, fuller hair. All the ingredients are all natural &amp; have a pleasant smell. True story,my eyebrows became short &amp; thin due to waxing over the years, everyday or every other day I would dab a little of the gro-aut oil on my eyebrows, &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed the hair starting to grow back. I would have never thought in a million years my eyebrows would grow back....unbelievable!!!! I really like this product and recommend it, however, I find the gro-aut oil to be a little pricey, unfortunately I wont be able to order as frequently as I would like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product,</li>
            <li> This helps to strengthen your hair I needed a larger bottle. I only tried this once.</li>
            <li> This product makes the hair too greasy and difficult to wash and to style.</li>
            <li> I noticed growth. My roots were thicker and my hair had obviously grown. I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks now.</li>
            <li> I only gave this three stars because the other reviews saya it worked for them but im not sure I really saw results maybe if I bought more than one bottle butbits kinda steep in price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off with the packaging....when I open the box, it was securely wrapped in bubble wrap and when I took the cap off it had a protective seal on it which was very good. Now about the product...I used it for about 3 weeks or so and I haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth yet, it might take a little more time to see results. Also I noticed my scalp would itch like crazy after I applied the oil. I don&#x27;t understand why this happen if the ingredients are supposedly all natural. Maybe that&#x27;s  why the instructions say you should wash your hair every 3 days. That&#x27;s too often for my african american hair so I&#x27;ll most likely only use it before I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve seen youTube tutorials on this and people saying it really grew their hair out and to be honest I didn&#x27;t believe them. I&#x27;ve done gro-aut before and I thought it worked wonders, just took forever to arrive. Amazon is my site of choice for most things so I tried through them and yes!!!!! It came within a few days literally. I didn&#x27;t open the package because I thought it was something else until I got bored and opened it. I feel like I use a lot and the bottle is still full with usage about 4 times a week. I am a woman of color and my scalp always feels dry, I use it mainly for deep moisture and it does the job on my bra strap length hair. I have even noticed healthier growth, not really a difference in growth, but my hair grows fast so I don&#x27;t think there is a way to speed that up. I will continue buying this from amazon.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I&#x27;ve only had my bottle for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m seeing growth. Ive suffered from alopecia my entire life. Tried every pill, shampoo, hair grease.. You name it..  Nothing has worked as fast as this product. I introduced my mom to the product, she received hers last Friday and is seeing growth around her edges already. We both agree that this is worth every cent. I&#x27;ve already ordered my second bottle. I use this every other day with dr. Miracles hair follicle creme, and I wash my hair with Groganics shampoo and conditioner weekly. So far I&#x27;m impressed. (I just started this entire hair regimen 2 weeks ago).  I never rant or rave about hair products because nothing has helped with my hair loss problem since I was a small child.. I&#x27;m glad I did research and stumbled across this product 💃💃💃 with the results I&#x27;m seeing at such a speedy rate, I think I will be able to finally stop wearing wigs before the year ends. THANK YOU GROGANICS!!!</li>
            <li> Use every other day.  Hair is soft and full. Most importantly, it has grown.  Would like to order more. It would be nice if I had a percentage off the price.  I will be a regular user.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn locs for 6 years and I noticed slight thinning at the top of my head. I used Gro-aut Solutions and noticed hair growing in the thinning spot within a month of my initial use. I only apply the oil once per week and I get a slight buildup. This buildup is the reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars. However, the slight buildup is not enough to deter use. Remember, drink plenty of water, watch your diet, and ensure that you&#x27;re getting the proper vitamin intake. All of this helps keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> not sure if its working haven&#x27;t seen a change in hair, has a smell that I do not like, but I still use it everyday to see if change will come?</li>
            <li> I found gro aut on a YouTube review and decided to try. So far I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the amount of growth I receive (at least 2in a mo) when I am consistent in my use of this oil mixed into my weekly overnight deep conditioning treatment. I add one or two additional oils and conditioners but I like this oil because it has all the best growth oils combined. Will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> It did not really work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the oil. I tried it and there is no way I can use it, it makes my hair look like I haven&#x27;t had a shower in years, it&#x27;s nasty and it stinks I will not recommend to Anyone it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great oil for quick growth. I had seen women get results of an inch a month. I was not one of them. I do like the way it feels on my scalp however I will not be recommending or purchasing again. Too much money to spend to get my usual results.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results after about week. My hair started getting thicker and I can also see the change in length.. I will say I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the oil alone because I also take biotin but I love this oil. It also helped with my hair breakage ,shedding and just helping it not be so dry.. the smell isn&#x27;t to bad either</li>
            <li> i would like to order this product again</li>
            <li> I have purchased this oil three times from Amazon.  It&#x27;s a very light oil that&#x27;s good for massaging the scalp.  I like that you can apply it daily without having a build-up.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product... it works....</li>
            <li> I have heard many great things about the Gro-aut oil. My niece used it and her hair grew back in a month. I used the oil according to the bottle, not mixing anything with it and washing my hair once to twice a week. I did notice my hair grow and some thickness, but I&#x27;m not sure if I can give the oil credit for that. Washing my hair once a week kept my hair cleaning, and I feel the maintenance (more than the oil) caused the slight growth in my hair. Also, I didn&#x27;t see much growth. The oil may work for some, but I don&#x27;t feel it worked for me. I will continue to use it as an oil moisturizer so I can get my money&#x27;s worth, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy the product again.</li>
            <li> I used 2 bottles of this and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I noticed growth with in a weeks worth of use. Also my hair is healthier and softer than its been in a while. I have thick course curly hair and this product has enhanced all of the above.</li>
            <li> It worked a little in a month time</li>
            <li> its doesnt do what it says it does</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle and I have noticed a few inches of growth in a 4 month time period.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it, and I use this to mix it with my Jamaican Black Castor Oil Extra Dark.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day. I feel that it has enhanced my hair&#x27;s health and thickness. I will continue to use this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a month and I&#x27;ve already noticed growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is quite noticeable, but it&#x27;s worth it. You can use other products to help mask the smell of it if it truly does disturb you.</li>
            <li> Made it soft but did not grow my hair.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair a month ago I cut my hair, it kind of look like a bob cut and I started using it and about a month in a half my hair already grew out. My hair is at my is at the top of my spine bone on my back and it&#x27;s thick. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it smells awful &#x3D;_&#x3D;. But I think it&#x27;s worth a shot. You just have to be patient and another secret is if your tryna grow your hair out DON&#x27;T STRESS because it will slow down the process. Trust me I use to stress all the time about growing my hair out not I found a routine that I use to manage and grow my hair. Also remember that everyone&#x27;s hair grows out differently at a different pace. ^_^ I haven&#x27;t found out a solution to make this smell any better so I always use it when my hair is wet and I&#x27;ll let it air dry then I usually use just use a leave-in-conditioner and let it air dry. I am a mutt; I&#x27;m Puerto Rican,Cuban and Black lol so you can only imagine what my hair is like air dried lol. I hope you give it chance [:</li>
            <li> I used a bit too much the first time but it wore off. It feels great on my hair. I get a tingly sensation. When I get hair growth I will update my review.</li>
            <li> The smell was too strong for me and it really didn&#x27;t do much. I saw no growth after two months, even used as expected and I have a very strict hair regimen. oh well, guess it&#x27;s not for everyone. i also have 4c hair type if it matters</li>
            <li> I have been using this for only 3 weeks and I have not seen any improvement. Its not worse but not better.  And, the smell is sooo strong its just too much</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this - read the reviews and took a chance but no go. I have not noticed any major changes or even little changes - don&#x27;t like the smell and think I could fare just as well with castor oil.</li>
            <li> i would recommend that you do not put this is your hair before going to bed, duhhh! but it seems to work just fine but i have only used for about 2 weeks so far and my hair has grown some. thank u</li>
            <li> Solution seems good enough but the package was leaking and the bottle still leaks.</li>
            <li> No results at this moment, of course is too fast, but let me tell you that is not that kind of oil that you put and starting coming out on the back of your head.  Many people said they hate the smell, I don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s herbal scent. Easy to remove with just shampoo.  I will put another review in at least one month.</li>
            <li> it came empty because it spilled all over the envlope . DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Have not seen any hair growth with this product yet it&#x27;s been a month hopefully it will come through. .</li>
            <li> Does a good job strengthing hair can&#x27;t use a lot will be oily so use at bed time wash hair in morningdoes great</li>
            <li> To date, I see no noticeable difference (approx. one month usage).</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been using this for a long long time and it does work.  I do not use it everyday, just every other day. Most of the time I use it at night before bed because it is oily. For those who said it didn&#x27;t work.  You have to make sure you understand oil promotes hair growth but if you are not taking care of your hair properly you will not see the evidence that your hair is growing.  Also, hair vitamins are good products too and a good hair stylist to help you take of your hair.  If this product doesn&#x27;t work that&#x27;s okay there are other amazing products that will.  I love this product it does exactly what it says it will do promote hair growth.</li>
            <li> Great product, will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY HAD MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINY...GOOD FOR DRY SCALP AS WELL. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. GREAT</li>
            <li> I bought this with my eyebrows in mind and it has worked really well. Of course it is also great for your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  All natural ingredients and you can tell it&#x27;s working because your scalp gets all tingly.  My hair around the scalp line was not growing after being under a lot of stress for almost 2 years.  Myself and my hairdresser have notice that it&#x27;s finally growing!  I also have been  massaging  and applying a warm microwave pack after applying the oil and I think that has helped speed up the growth.</li>
            <li> This product is great within the first week or two my hair grew a complete inch. My hair grows really slow and I wanted something to boost the process this helped alot. Not only did my hair growth but it got thicker and my curl pattern looked more organized and healthy (I have 4c natural hair) I would recommend</li>
            <li> I have purchased gro-aut previously from the website, so I knew exactly what to expect. When arrived, my protective seal had been broken and when I smelled it I realized it smelled more of olive oil then anything so I was shocked to see that Gro-aut were the suppliers for Amazon. Assuming this could be an easy fix, I contacted Gro-aut Solutions. I received an automated response verifying the got my email.. and that was all. So here I am, worst use of my money ever.. and they have piss-poor excuse for customer service!</li>
            <li> Fast ship. But this products leave hair grease !</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe after 2 weeks of using this product my hair grew like a half an inch and then after 1 month it grew an inch and a half I will be continue using this product and I will purchase it again whoever made this thank you so much thank you</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!!! I will always purchase this product!! Leaves my hair soft and with a ton of moisture!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in growth. But, it does help moisturize well. The smell was as bad as some reviews. Its cool. It just smells medicated.</li>
            <li> Easy to moisturize my hair</li>
            <li> Great product!!! It really works!!!! If you&#x27;re experiencing hair loss or want your hair to grow my advice BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> the order arrived super fast and was packaged nice. product appears to be brand new,no problems.&lt;br /&gt;i gave it 4stars simply because i haven&#x27;t used it yet will come back and update after about 2weeks or so of use</li>
            <li> i love this product it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this prodict for about 2 weeks now and I am still on the fence about it.  I use it at least twice a week and I shampoo my hair at least twice a week.  I have noticed some growth, about 1/8\\&quot; and my hair strands do seem thicker, but I have not seen the drastic growth results that the people on Youtube have shown.  I have noticed some shedding and my scalp is itching, but according to the gro-aut website this is expected.  I will continue using and see what results I get in the long haul.  I like the smell of it once it dies down.  when you first apply it the scent is very pungent, but after a few minutes I am left with a fresh lavendar scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair oil.  It&#x27;s light and makes the hair easy to comb through.  I have not noticed any hair growth as of now.  It works very well after washing the hair.  While the hair is damp, just saturate a section of hair at a time and experience easier to manage hair.</li>
            <li> it keeps my hair moisturize but as for growth havent seen a difference yet</li>
            <li> Dried my scalp, my scalp isn&#x27;t moisturized at all. Very disappointed with the results. I do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> By using it my hair gel different and health even before an hour. I like this product and recommend it for healthy hear and smooth</li>
            <li> I put this on to help my hair grow after a bleaching disaster broke off chunks. It is too greasy for me to keep in. Can&#x27;t go anywhere with it on - had to use it at night but still ended up washing it out because it&#x27;s too greasy. Maybe it is for a different kind of hair than mine - I have fine, thin color treated hair. Maybe it&#x27;s meant for thicker, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I love gro aut oil because I&#x27;ve tried every thing and nothing worked for me but after 2 weeks I saw an inch of growth  and this product works well with my type of hair and I will say this what works for me may not work for you because you need to know your hair type and what your hair can handle that&#x27;s just my personal opinion</li>
            <li> Delivery was as expected</li>
            <li> Does what it claims.  I have recommemded to others, very hard to find. Is it still available?  We would like more.</li>
            <li> Feels great, although I have not seen results yet and im in my second bottle.  Still hopeful though.  For me it&#x27;s a Thyroid issue that I&#x27;m dealing with, resulting in hair loss.</li>
            <li> I just recieved mine last week. I am stationed over in Afghan and the water is horrible. I have bad shedding/breakage and my edges starting to thin. I am willing to try anything to get my hair back healthy, stronger and longer. Wish me luck.... will post more later. Oh the smell is pleasant and mine was packaged great, not open at all and it had a long way to come. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00CO94DDK Gro-aut Hair Growth Oil 4oz]]</li>
            <li> After the third use my hair fell off a lot and scared me so decided to discontinue.  And I didnt seen any results..</li>
            <li> I purchased one bottle and when I attempted to re-order, the product was out of stock so I selected &amp;#34;Doo Gro&amp;#34; product. Unfortunately, the alternate oil did not absorb into my hair like the Gro-aut oil. Gro-aut oil works well and keeps my braids moisturized. It relieves not only my dry scalp, but also stimulates and completely eases any itchiness. I love the natural ingredients and especially the biotin!</li>
            <li> At first I was very happy I was using it. And still am. At first I put a bit too much on. Greased out my hair it looked like my hair was washed with oil. But now, I use very little--which is what you are supposed to do and it&#x27;s fine.  Ladies, be careful of how you use this at first. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. ( lol )  Part your hair to the scalp and just dab a bit with your finger and spread it across your scalp in different areas. It works perfectly.  I would order it again although it lasts a long time. I DO see results.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THOSE PICTURES ARE STOLEN FORM HAIRFINITY.COM ...NOW THATS PROVEN TO MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW CHECK IT OUT!!!! YOU WONT REGRET IT</li>
            <li> It smells a bit strong, but not terrible.  It was oily.  I noticed no difference, then it occurred to me this picture could have come from anywhere.  I am dissatisfied w this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product would recommended to anyone looking to grow hair and it smells great</li>
            <li> I use this as a deep conditioner on my hair, with kinky curly natural it helps to soften my hair</li>
            <li> I got the product and using it every chance I get, so far I see progress so I&#x27;m liking this product even more</li>
            <li> So I had very long wavy hair I decided a wanted a bob cut &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; bad idea it like old cute but I way miss the long hair so I&#x27;m growing it back out I noticed after a month not much different in length other then natural growth so I kept using it BUT this time I used biotin and my hair grew like an inch in two weeks you need to take biotin with the oil seriously grow your hair and inch a month I grow an inch and a half because I have fastish growing hair my hairs also thick all around not so whispy on the ends also get it trimmed 1/8 of an inch every 12 weeks that will help also so your hairs not working so hard to fix split ends stop useing heat on your hair until your done growing it unless using protection and get a micro fiber towel regular towels suck the oils out of your hair and dry it out use shampoo every other day and eat protein you could easily grow 2 inches a month this way</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2  months now, and I have not seen  any visible results yet. I will continue to use it until it is all gone, and if no results  occur, I will not try it again.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking very oily I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and really haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change, but I might need to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> Does it mean, its doing its job. but it came in the package neatly. Not Opened, leaked . Just right. But I shall give this product some time to do what it got to do on my hair. I&#x27;ve had very long hair and gotten it cut plenty of times in a boy style but now I want all of my hair back. ill keep yall updated on how it works on my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like spices&lt;br /&gt;Which i love! Although it did make my hair a lot shinier and healthier i havent noticed any huge hair growth as I was hoping for. Really soft hair tho(:</li>
            <li> I cannot pronounce myself because I just started using it two weeks  ago and I only put it once a week .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now it didn&#x27;t make my hair grown</li>
            <li> I use this daily,  I also add it to my special leave in conditioner with peppermint oil. I also love that the smell is not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it makes hair grow yet.  I have only being using it a short time.  I will update in a month or so.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural (no perm) and i normally wear it straightened or stretched out. I normally use Minovol drops as a growth aid but the consistency is close to water so they cause my hair to revert back and that&#x27;s not what I want. So I tried this, thinking since it is an oil it&#x27;ll just moisturize my scalp and not make my hair revert while I&#x27;m trying to get some growth. It worked. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair revert at all. It also doesn&#x27;t drip all down your neck when you use it, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it last week and I definitely see growth already. I can&#x27;t say how much, but significant enough for me to have to touch up my color this weekend. My color has been growing out for a while now but of enough to touch up the roots. After using this, I definitely see its time to touch up the roots, so that&#x27;s a plus for me. The bottle isn&#x27;t the biggest but you also don&#x27;t use a whole lot so i think it&#x27;s a good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> It was okay.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am currently trying to grow out my hair, and I had watched some videos on YouTube praising it. So I decided to give it a go. I am glad I did. I haven&#x27;t seen any growth yet, but my hair is not breaking at the ends anymore and my roots are thicker. It does have a strong smell, but I love it. It smells like rosemary and lavender. I apply it to my ends twice a day and my roots every other day. I will definetly purchase it again. It was well packaged and it didn&#x27;t even leak during shipping.</li>
            <li> Came leaking and a mess.</li>
            <li> I thought it would grow my daughter&#x27;s hair fast as it advertise but it didn&#x27;t. I use it as the directions says and it wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected. I can say it does keep her hair from being dry. Her hair may have grown a quarter of an inch if that. I would get it again because I like it to keep her hair nicely oiled and shiny and it&#x27;s natural and safe.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product about a month a go, I don&#x27;t use it every day but however when I was my hair I put a little on my scalp, it does leave a cooling feeling. So when I began to see result I will write another review.</li>
            <li> This is a very good oil and my hair is getting thicker. This oil has a very pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li> I am so completely and utterly amazed and excited at how quick my grandmother&#x27;s hair grew while using the Gro-aut Hair Growth Oil. A year ago my grandmother had to cut and shave off part of her hair due to brain surgery. 3 Months after her surgery she began chemo and Radiation. Due to the radiation treatment her hair wasnt growing AT ALL. 4 months after the radiation treatment there was no sign of hair growth. My grandmother was depressed and I was desperate to get my happy go getter grandmother back. So I started looking into hair oils. She has been using this oil for a month and her hair has grown 1inch! I know it doesnt sound like a lot but after 4 months of NO capillary hair growth I was ecstatic! She is so happy that her hair is starting to grow and is starting to put on make up again. She is becoming herself again. This Product is amazing! &amp;lt;3 I recommend it to everyone give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uses it 3 times a week. Mon, Tues and Fri.</li>
            <li> It works love love it</li>
            <li> Please explain to me WHY my daughters hair turned light brown after trying this oil ONCE? Yet it&#x27;s safe for children? Yeah right. I need answers!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months now and my hair is growing out very nicely.  I would recommend and keep purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I think it works. Your results probably won&#x27;t be as dramatic as others on YouTube report, but it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> Im using right now for less than a month and I already have growth. It also makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I still have not heard from anybody it was not a full bottle most of it leaked out grease was on the in side and on the outside of the box</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for two weeks now along with doing the GHE for my natural hair. I notice my hair is thicker at the root and yes, some GROWTH. I have a few gray strains that had been covered with henna, but I have about 1/4 inch of new growth on those strains in two weeks. Is it the oil, maybe. Overall the oil has stopped the dryness problem I was having (due to dimethicone use), but I&#x27;ve also been using some Brahmi-Alma oil during my DC treatments, so I think its a combination of both oils and the GHE process to get my hair moisture balance back. Also, a little goes along way and if used SPARINGLY, it leaves my twist out style shiny and fluffy. I have since gotten rid of all products with insoluble silicones as well. Although I don&#x27;t embrace the CG method 100%, I&#x27;m finding out what does work for my hair on this natural hair journey. Although I&#x27;ve trimmed here and there, I&#x27;ve gained a solid 5 inches of growth since January 2013, so I assume I&#x27;m doing something right.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy Gro-Aut again.</li>
            <li> it smells a bit on the alcohol side but it gets the job done, that according to my wife. so will update this review if any changes</li>
            <li> Hair hasn&#x27;t seen much growth, good applicator bottle though.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m unimpressed. It is so greasy I can&#x27;t even wash it out of my fine hair, even if I silly use a few drops. Other oils I&#x27;ve tried seem to soak in, this one did not for me.</li>
            <li> I actually love the smell of this herbally solution.  It does make my hair a bit greasy with using suggested amount though, and I have yet to see results.  I just got it so I have yet to see the growth.</li>
            <li> I have not used this Prut religiously but for now ii fave it this rating I&#x27;ll rate it again in a couple of months</li>
            <li> Gro-aut Hair Growth Oil has help my hair to grow faster and healthier, even though most of my hair is now gray. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and I didn&#x27;t know that my hair could grow so fast, and so thick. I wish I had known about this product many, many years ago. Who needs &amp;#34;THE HAIR CLUB?&amp;#34; Buy this product, use this product &amp;#34;Til Death Do You Part&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Once product was received, began using it.  The scent is pleasant and the oil itself has been helping my hair.  Though, it is to soon to  actually provide an accurate rating; not quite enough time of has passed with usage for true results.  All in all, am pleased with this product.  Would definitely reorder product if results continue to be positive.  Thank you</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smell good and feel nice but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s growing at all.. Stick with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> excellent results for me</li>
            <li> All this oil did was make my hair greasy with just a small amount.  It didn&#x27;t help my hair grow any faster than normal either.</li>
            <li> It really hasn&#x27;t done any if the things mentioned but I like the smell . Will check to see if I can get a refund</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I have been using it for about a week and I wanted say that unlike others, I did not get an inch in that week like others have said. Although I did not achieve an inch I did, however, get a little over a centimeter of growth. I have thin, Caucasian, straight, hair and had to was my hair every morning after keeping it in all night. IF YOU BLEACH OR CHEMICALLY DAMAGE YOUR HAIR, THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING FOR MAKING YOUR HAIR FEEL HEALTHY AGAIN. Before using this, i had recently bleached my hair from brown to blonde, and it felt like straw. After one application of this my hair felt soft and silky again. I have also noticed that I have little baby hairs growing. My hair feels thicker and smoother than ever before. I recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> ??? I think it doesn&#x27;t really work with my hair type?</li>
            <li> Honestly couldn&#x27;t tell you whether it helps grow my hair, but I can say my Hair has never felt or looked better.  A very small amount massaged into my hair daily keeps tangles and breakage away!</li>
            <li> Great hair oil, light doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down or leave an unpleasant of chemical smell. Haven&#x27;t notice the miraculous growth yet (been using for about 2 months) but it&#x27;s a good moisturiser.</li>
            <li> Only used it for 3 weeks now.  Just makes my scalp itch.  Have to get back with you all regarding any hair growth.  Haven&#x27;t notice any growth..</li>
            <li> Appears to be helping with breakage.  Not greasy or smelly...  really like it.  Will order again and update!!!</li>
            <li> No, it didnt do anything it said it would do</li>
            <li> hate it! made my hair look greasy and dirty when using it i will not be buying this product again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good oil for your hair.  It&#x27;s too early to tell if it has produced any hair growth. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really tell the results.  My hair broke off from a perm and then&lt;br /&gt;stress so hoping this really works fast.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I had a thinning area near my temple and massaging the oil in the spot every few days is helping its growth. Be sure to wash this oil out of your hair once or a few times a week. It will make your hair a bit softer but it also make your scalp smell if you don&#x27;t. :P</li>
            <li> i have ben pleased with this product I just have to learned to not put so much on but other  then that It  does work my hair seems a lot stronger I had my first chemo an I am hoping that my hair will be strong enough  to help me.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve used about half of the bottle and I can say that my hair is smoother and seems healthier. Not really any growth though. The smell isn&#x27;t bad but I use the product at night because it does make my hair really greasy and the smell is strong.( but not bad)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and it smells really good</li>
            <li> I am still working on this oil growth but only wash my hair once a  week now as directed no different yet but still give it  a chance to work</li>
            <li> I like the product&lt;br /&gt;Experienced excessive shedding at first but after 4 days decreased however I take hair skin supplements so I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re want stop the shedding still deciding on whether I&#x27;ll reorder</li>
            <li> My wife can already tell the difference and so can I. Her hair is soft, no longer plagued with brittle hair caused by her Hashimoto disease. A real life saver as she was starting to lose her hair rapidly and it seems to all but stopped!</li>
            <li> Been using this oil for over 6 months and haven&#x27;t seen any improvements, all it does is give me a heavy case of dandruff, really regret buying this product especially for so much money, total waste of time!</li>
            <li> I like this product, my only issue is that it has a very strong odor. It DOES WORK; but the odor is something that I can do without. My hair has GROWN approx. 2 inches since I first used it over a month ago. You will have to wash your hair double the time you would normally wash it. For example: I normally wash my hair twice per week; but after using this product, it is more like every other day. And yes, I use it every day as this is why the washing must be implemented to keep from having excess build-up on the hair follicles.</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars because it didnt grow my edges back but it did grow my overall hair back.</li>
            <li> Going to buy some more.  Like the way it makes my hair feels!!</li>
            <li> Indeed I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I purchases this along with Tropic Isle&#x27;s JBCO and yes baby!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am going natural i am Puerto Rican and African American and my hair had been very long until I went to cosmetology school that&#x27;s when my hair started to look a mess because of tons of , being over processed not having the time to take care of it like i knew how to. Well Cosmetology school is over and I am back to taking care of me. I challenge myself to grow out my hair by August of 2014, the plan is bra length or maybe a couple inches shorter..!!! So I used JBCO initially for about four days while awaiting the arrival of  this and YES the jbco did thicken the thinning areas around my hairline.. however, I noticed added GROWTH while using Gro Aut!!!!!!In about 10 days my hair has already grown from shoulder length to collarbone length. I will post some before and after pictures soon and i am really considering a blog!!!!!!! It may be a little pricey but it works:) and though the smell isnt heavenly its not bad.. its just a medicated smell in a few weeks check out my reviews for a conditioner that essentially softens my hair and unkinks it lol.. I will update in about two weeks...Remember everything I am using is in conjunction!!! I shampoo every two weeks with Mane N Tail Shampoo and Conditioner, I do my protein treatment with Megatek Cell Rebuilder, I hot oil with JBCO for 15 mins and  apply Gro Aut twice to three times weekly and massage my scalp. I also wrap my hair (around my head\\&quot; in a doobie) nightly!!!&lt;br /&gt;Blessings on your hair journey guys!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the hair oil a couple of weeks and I can see the difference in my hair already.  It has more body and a lot less shedding.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants silkier and healthy hair</li>
            <li> Had better luck with other hair growth oils.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this stuff. I have not seen any improvement with any hair growth at all or any damage repair. I will not purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> I order Gro-aut it came early which was great. I started using it right away it has a funny smell but not bad also when I use it it make a cool feeling in my head but it soon fades away. I will let you all know if it works. started using it July 19, 2014. So today is August 26, 2014 and this has worked for me and my daughter hair has grown 2 1/2 in for both us is gotten thicker we received no shedding . Also we only use it once a week .</li>
            <li> From May 16th through July 16th, I have been using Natrol Biotin 10,000mcg once a day, Gro-Aut Hair Growth Oil (not as often as I should) and Source Naturals MSM Powder (1teaspoon twice a day) and my hair has grown two inches.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell, did really do anything for me. I was really looking foward to a result but didnt get one so i gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I am 100% natural, no flat iron or relaxers. When I have this product, I apply to scalp once a day. Give myself a scalp massage with this oil. Weekly hair washes. Sleep with a satin, silk scarf on at night to protect my natural hair from breakage and messing up. This oil always grows my hair faster. All you need is a lil bit. However, drinking plenty of water, healthy diet, exercise and taking a vitamin make a huge difference for healthy growing hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing like weed, awesome product I use it everyday it&#x27;s light comparing to many oils on the market. This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Seems keep going grow</li>

            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone who needs this type of product.  It is my first time using this product, but I have seen good results from this product on other people.</li>
            <li> GREAT LIKE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about 3 years now. I found it on a hair forum when I first went natural. Since then I have tried other products and various hair growth methods, but I always come back to this oil. Not only does it encourage hair growth but it makes my kinky hair softer and more manageable. I saw an improvement within the first few months and yes an increase in growth. This oil is really light compared to other hair growth oils that I&#x27;ve tried and the scent isn&#x27;t as offensive. It has sort of an herbal scent, so I try not to use too much at once or before going to an event. Otherwise I really like it.</li>
            <li> So far it heals the dry scalp spots. And has made my hair thick at the roots</li>
