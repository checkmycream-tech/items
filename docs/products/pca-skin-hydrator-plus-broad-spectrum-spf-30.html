            <li>Great facial sunscreen and moisturizer all in one.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for everyday use, great with a facial moisturizer underneath and a light foundation over.  </li>
            <li>Always goes on smoothly and does the job.</li>
            <li>The broad spectrum sun protection is important to me, and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It goes on light, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy with every single one of them specially this one.</li>
            <li>Good product, although my last order was either stolen or never arrived.</li>
            <li>you need just a little bit of product which is great, is not oily and it covers fantastic ...</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is a great daily moisturizer and sunscreen for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have used PCA Skin Hydrator Plus for ten months and find it has wonderful qualities: it is recommended by my physician for its protection from the sun and does not produce rash or redness as other products have done.</li>
            <li>I live in the arid Southwest, so a good face cream is essential or my skin turns to leather.</li>
            <li>My order was shipped on time, item was well packed and arrived exactly as described online.  </li>
            <li>I love this daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This lotion does exactly what it claims it will do: it hydrates your skin and protects it from the sun.</li>
            <li>Great for all types of skin, my husband has normal and I have delicate skin.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>VERY GREASY.</li>
            <li>It really is non-comedogenic (spelling?)</li>
            <li>The product itself is a lightweight, unscented, untinted facial moisturizer with an SPF 30--very clean and gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it go on smooth, have a high SPF(non ickey smelling SPF) and act as an illuminator, it also battles discoloration/blotchy skin with consistant use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fluid, absorbs quickly, does not leave white cast and feels comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li>I love all PCA products and this did not let me down.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing &amp; light weight everyday</li>
            <li>Light and non greasy, pump bottle puts out just the little you need and keeps product clean, lasts long time.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much every morning (other than in the middle of the summer when I switched to a higher SPF), and it has served me very well.</li>
            <li>I am a travel photographer, and in the heat of summer I don&#x27;t like to wear foundation when I am working outside, so this is all I will use on those hot summer days.  </li>
            <li>I first started using this when I got a facial, she sold the line.</li>
            <li>PCA products are my favorites as my skin is sensitive to break outs even at the age of 59.</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old with combination skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and you only need a little bit so the pump bottle should last you sometime.</li>
            <li>Will definitely reorder from this merchant in the near future.  </li>
            <li>However it doesn&#x27;t last as a durable all-day long spf if you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time outside in direct sun.</li>
            <li>but I cannot live without it and will not use any other product.  </li>

            <li> I use this moisturizer every day for the spf 30. It goes on light, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. However it doesn&#x27;t last as a durable all-day long spf if you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time outside in direct sun.</li>

            <li> I have very pale, very sensitive acne-prone skin, and this is my go-to moisturizer. I use it pretty much every morning (other than in the middle of the summer when I switched to a higher SPF), and it has served me very well. I don&#x27;t feel greasy, and my skin is protected.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD FOR OILY SKIN. VERY GREASY. I ONLY USE IT ON MY NECK INSTEAD OF RETURNING IT OR ON THE BACK OF MY HANDS WHEN I GO OUTSIDE.</li>

            <li> Felt too sticky and uncomfortable wasted money again</li>
            <li> An all around great moisturizer. It really is non-comedogenic (spelling?), I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using this 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> This product is a great daily moisturizer and sunscreen for sensitive skin. I use it in conjunction with PCA pHaze 11+ Apres Peel Hydrating Balm and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my middle aged, rosacea prone, sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> Always goes on smoothly and does the job.</li>
            <li> Not only does it go on smooth, have a high SPF(non ickey smelling SPF) and act as an illuminator, it also battles discoloration/blotchy skin with consistant use. My skins glows when I wear this(which is every day). It does not make me break out. It does not make my skin feel greasy. It does take a few minutes to absorb but I cannot live without it and will not use any other product.  I&#x27;ve tried many. At the age of 30, I can finally wear a facial moisturizer everyday like I&#x27;m supposed to.</li>
