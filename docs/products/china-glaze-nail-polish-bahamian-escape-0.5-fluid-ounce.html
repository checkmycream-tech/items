            <li>its such a beautiful blue.</li>
            <li>blue.&lt;br /&gt;It glides on easily, and clump free, and you only need one coat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very opaque and doesn&#x27;t need a lot of coats for full coverage.</li>
            <li>I received compliments right away the first time I wore it.  </li>

            <li> This blue is a very pretty color. It is very opaque and doesn&#x27;t need a lot of coats for full coverage. The formula was good, maybe a little thick but not enough to give me any problems when applying it. I wasn&#x27;t planning on getting this color and ended up buying it on a whim, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>

            <li> this is such a pretty bright blue color. it goes on well and dries quickly, its just a really good nail polish!!Its like a pool blue.</li>
            <li> If you need to get this anytime soon, the don&#x27;t order it from here! I ordered this nail polish on the 11th of November and got it on the 23rd. It was only supposed to take 5 days. First they lost it, then they said they shipped it and it took more than a week. The product is good and true to the picture, but the company didn&#x27;t help me at all. And when I asked for them to keep it and give me a refund, they ignored my question. So if you don&#x27;t mind waiting, then get it from here, but if you want good customer service and to get it quickly, buy this from another company.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color, vey matte. It&#x27;s a little on the thick side, but it&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s too hard to work with. Goes perfectly with a dress that I just bought! Great pedicure color!!!</li>

            <li> Purchased for my girlfriend who loves pastel type colors. China Glaze polish is one of the best polishes out there. Looks good, huge color assortment. I would rate China Glaze right up there with OPI and other higher end nail polish. Great polish, have purchased more China Glaze since this bottle.</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a few China Glaze polishes and I&#x27;m never disappointed. I like the variety of colors and the pricing.</li>
            <li> The color of this polish is so beautiful.  I love pastels, and if you do too, this is for you.  Try it.</li>

            <li> Love this nail polish, I normally never liked colors like this, but really like it!! I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t cover well, but to my surprised it pretty much covered in one coat!
