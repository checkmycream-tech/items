            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great soap, we smell clean, and it&#x27;s WAY cheaper than Dove or Dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>right to your door at great price .. cant beat it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the smell and the clean you achieve by using this soap.</li>
            <li>This soap is very good for family members that have eczema or overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>These bars of Ivory will yield 15 gallons or more of laundry detergent and the cost is $1.39 for all three bars.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SOAP</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Ivory soap, I&#x27;ve been using it since I&#x27;ve been a baby</li>
            <li>But some people love that.</li>
            <li>Need three more words.</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s clean, smells, good, and I always feel clean after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I forgot how strong Ivory bar soap smells.  </li>
            <li>free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells so clean.</li>
            <li>FEELING CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say other than it has a mild but good smell</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re full sized bars of soap.</li>
            <li>This is kind a soft soap</li>
            <li>great deal when on sale  if you get this for 1.24 or less  buy it...  </li>
            <li>They last a while (ie: they don&#x27;t disintegrate on their own like some soaps do).</li>
            <li>I started making my own laundry detergent because I thought it would make sense to have anything that touches their skin be washed in the same soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it cleans very well, leave your skin feeling clean without making it feel tight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not tried it on dedicates or finer fabrics - but great in hard water and on towels, jeans, tshirts, socks, etc.</li>
            <li>This soap inexpensive and works very well for us!</li>
            <li>First Ponds, Oil of Olay, and now Ivory too.</li>
            <li>BUT it is great soap and for someone with a regimen of products they use, I think would get you cleaner then about any other commercial soap.</li>
            <li>the description on the box says, because they&#x27;re really pure.</li>
            <li>They are just pure soap with no additives just the way I like them.</li>
            <li>The 3 pack occasionally goes for 99 cents (as an add-on item) with free shipping.</li>
            <li>All the original classic brand names that have gone back to households for years are changing their formulas  </li>
            <li>I use this to make homemade laundry detergent - use the fine part of your box grater, and let it dry out a bit - then whir it up in your food processor to make it a finer powder.  </li>
            <li>The original formula left skin very soft.</li>
            <li>this is helpful to someone looking for a mild soap that does double duty as laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you :) Never has let me down!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works, because I didn&#x27;t get much chance to use it, but if you&#x27;re at all sensitive to perfumes - don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and soap with dyes causes her to itch and will sometimes give her a rash.  </li>
            <li>I was wary of scented soap, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The same old soap I grew up with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i just wish there was slightly less glycerin so it would dry the skin a little more.</li>

            <li> This is one of the only soaps that my daughter can use.  She has very sensitive skin and soap with dyes causes her to itch and will sometimes give her a rash.  This soap inexpensive and works very well for us!</li>
            <li> The product is nice, it comes in three bars. It has a nice smell. That&#x27;s all I can think of now.</li>
            <li> The same old soap I grew up with. I bought several bars to send to a friend in the Peace Corps in Africa. She has some unusual bathing and laundry situations to deal with there, and the fact that Ivory floats turns out to be its best attribute. Groping for dropped soap in dark water is no fun.</li>
            <li> I have used this from when I was a kid. My Mother would always have a Boring white Ivory Bar in bathroom. Used it when I was a kid, grew up, tried to use different soaps and liquid body wash. seems i always come back to this stuff. It works, it&#x27;s clean, smells, good, and I always feel clean after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :) Never has let me down!</li>
            <li> This soap has been around forever! I love the scent. It smells so clean. In the winter you can use it to make flocking for your xmas tree.</li>
            <li> great deal when on sale  if you get this for 1.24 or less  buy it...  right to your door at great price .. cant beat it</li>
            <li> I was wary of scented soap, but so far so good. This works great and at a very good price.</li>
            <li> The 3 pack occasionally goes for 99 cents (as an add-on item) with free shipping. The 16 pack occasionally goes for $4 with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they&#x27;re 33 cents or less per bar... stock up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is great! They&#x27;re full sized bars of soap. They last a while (ie: they don&#x27;t disintegrate on their own like some soaps do). And they do float, like the description on the box says, because they&#x27;re really pure. (I don&#x27;t have a clue what \\&quot;pure\\&quot; means, but I&#x27;m all for it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have no problems with allergic reactions (some soaps cause some of us to break out a bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great soap, we smell clean, and it&#x27;s WAY cheaper than Dove or Dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY recommend when it&#x27;s on sale. (If it&#x27;s not on sale, I tend to prefer Dove moisturizing... but it&#x27;s almost always on sale.)</li>
            <li> I use this to make homemade laundry detergent - use the fine part of your box grater, and let it dry out a bit - then whir it up in your food processor to make it a finer powder.  Add 1 c Borax and 1 c Arm and Hammer Washing Soda (cheapest a Walmart, sadly) - and you have a great detergent!  I have not tried it on dedicates or finer fabrics - but great in hard water and on towels, jeans, tshirts, socks, etc.</li>
            <li> i bought a bunch of soap to try basically everything on the market. this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this soap is slightly scented like lemons. it cleans very well, leave your skin feeling clean without making it feel tight.&lt;br /&gt;i just wish there was slightly less glycerin so it would dry the skin a little more.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality for an Ivory soap product. Burns my skin, the wrapping was stuck to the soap and I ended up throwing it in the trash. I am off of Ivory after this.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected them to be. They are just pure soap with no additives just the way I like them.</li>
            <li> This soap is very good for family members that have eczema or overly sensitive skin. I started making my own laundry detergent because I thought it would make sense to have anything that touches their skin be washed in the same soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone reading this cares to try it, here is the recipe from this site: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Grate the soap&lt;br /&gt;*Heat 3 cups of water in a pot.&lt;br /&gt;*Add the soap and stir to dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;*Turn heat off and stir in a cup of washing soda&lt;br /&gt;*Put everything in the 5 gallon bucket holding 3 gallons of water and stir.&lt;br /&gt;*Cover and let it sit overnight.&lt;br /&gt;*Use 2 or 3 tablespoons per load in an energy-efficient front loader.&lt;br /&gt;For heavily soiled clothing: Add 1 cup of Borax. For very hard water locations: Add 1 cup of Baking Soda. Always stir before using and keep the lid on the bucket tightly closed to prevent young children or pets from drowning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both Castille and Ivory soaps. These bars of Ivory will yield 15 gallons or more of laundry detergent and the cost is $1.39 for all three bars.  (about what? 0.9 cents a gallon?) -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchasing washing soda at your local supermarket, in the laundry isle. (Around $2.00 a box)&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful to someone looking for a mild soap that does double duty as laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> What more can I say other than it has a mild but good smell and it was .97 for 3 bars when I purchased it. Great deal all around.</li>
            <li> The original formula left skin very soft. This smells good, and lathers well, but over time dries out skin. Disappointing. First Ponds, Oil of Olay, and now Ivory too. All the original classic brand names that have gone back to households for years are changing their formulas  be laden with chemicals that make their bottom line stretch further.</li>
            <li> We needed soap and I had some money left on a gift card and this was a wonderful household item to add. It came sealed and in great shape. Great item to stock up on to reach your $25 goal!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP IT LEAVES YOU FEELING CLEAN.  IVORY IS A VERY GOOD BARGAIN FOR THE PRICE I BUY IT A LOT.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Ivory soap, I&#x27;ve been using it since I&#x27;ve been a baby and I use nothing else this is the best soap ever for my skin.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid we would go to my grandmothers mothers house. We called her Momma Annie. This is the soap she used and I swear to god it is different then the Ivory you buy in the store now. This is kind a soft soap and I believe made for people who do a lot because if you don&#x27;t use lotion or something it will dry you out BUT it is great soap and for someone with a regimen of products they use, I think would get you cleaner then about any other commercial soap.</li>
            <li> smells basic wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I thought it was gonna smell great but wasn&#x27;t too happy with this bar. doesn&#x27;t smell bad just not for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just regular Ivory soap. If you like Ivory, you&#x27;ll like it. I forgot how strong Ivory bar soap smells.  Not my thing. But some people love that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell and the clean you achieve by using this soap. It is one of the highest quality soaps I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Ivory has always been my go to soap and I&#x27;m so happy to have found a Unisex version!  No perfumey or musky smell, Ivory screams, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve just showered,&amp;#34; rather than, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve just come from an orgy and am trying to cover the scent before I get home to shower!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend storing the bars unwrapped to increase the shelf-life.</li>
            <li> Ahh! the fragance in this stuff is crazy strong.  I found out I&#x27;m allergic to it too.  I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works, because I didn&#x27;t get much chance to use it, but if you&#x27;re at all sensitive to perfumes - don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Good price for sooap smells good and works came on time and will order the product again. Need three more words.</li>
