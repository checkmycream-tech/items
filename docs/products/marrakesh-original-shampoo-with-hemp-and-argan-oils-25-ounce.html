            <li>this is a wonderful product that i will buy again - makes my hair soft and silky and healthy looking - but it takes 4 or 5 squirts rather than one as it says!</li>
            <li>the smell is so exotic ...</li>

            <li>I absolutely LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Now I have exotic smelling hair which also feels healthy.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love their styling products but discovered that I couldn&#x27;t get them on my scalp w/o those kinda crusty patches forming.</li>
            <li>I use it with the conditioner and the Marrakesh hair elixir for a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I have long wild hair and this product is superior, not to mention a light wonderful almost mystic scent.</li>
            <li>Using the products together has done wonders for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>My sister bought me a bottle several months ago upon returning from one of her cosmetology shows and from the first time I used it I LOVED it!!!!</li>
            <li>Huge misconception.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have been using Marrakesh Original Shampoo and the Conditioner for about 3 years now.  </li>
            <li>This (with matching conditioner) are by far the best I&#x27;ve used yet (in my entire life), frizz or not.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the idea that a shampoo has to lather a lot to get your hair clean.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does not lather a lot but gets your hair clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>But it makes me feel like it doesnt clean my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered the 26.3 ounce size!  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything to help my color treated, flat ironed hair to feel soft, be shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I found the Marrakesh Original Shampoo was very satisfactory and met my needs &amp; expectation.  </li>
            <li>I was &#x27;advised&#x27; towards using another higher end shampoo and conditioner, but the higher end product was severely drying out my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this larger size after having such good results using the 8 oz size.</li>
            <li>wish this product was available at a local salon</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny and you only need a little bit for great lathering.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy, shinny and still has volume(I have thin, fine, sleek hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Also, I feel extremely comfortable with the contents of this as well as other Marrakesh/Earthly Body products, since I&#x27;ve come to really believe in both hemp seed oil and argan oil.</li>
            <li>I usually only need to use during the winter though because the shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like so many others.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I run the fingers of both hands straight back through my hair after a shower as grooming.  </li>
            <li>This does not claim to specifically help with such hair and indeed it doesn&#x27;t fix the problem that much.</li>
            <li>my hair is soft, shiney, silky, and I don&#x27;t need conditioner.</li>
            <li>Rinsed away completely without buildup.</li>
            <li>Marrakesh Shampoo and Conditioner really helps to keep it from looking dry and over processed.  </li>
            <li>No other shampoo I have ever used compares to Marrakesh brand.</li>
            <li>Although I received this item a day earlier than expected, I only received about half of the bottle full.</li>

            <li> I used the Marrakesh leave in treatment for a long time</li>
            <li> I know it is natural and there is not many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Did I mention that it is wavy toward the loose curly side.</li>
            <li> ive been using this , the conditioner and serum for yrs and wont ever go back to other shampoo!!!</li>

            <li> It produces little suds but, cleans and conditions with no build, up this shampoo with the scent of earthly delights.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the leave-in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp, and the body lotion which is thick, creamy and long-lasting.</li>

            <li> My hair is thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li> My thick haired, Veronica Lake style hairdo wife loves it also.</li>
            <li> so not sure whats up with that!  </li>
            <li> that up until I stated using this always looked limp)!!!  </li>

            <li> the smell is so exotic ...great shampoo really helps my hair (on the drier side) adds a lot of shine and volume....ive been using this , the conditioner and serum for yrs and wont ever go back to other shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Marrakesh Original Shampoo and the Conditioner for about 3 years now.  My hair is thick and wavy.  I have it colored once a month and highlighted about every 6 months.  Marrakesh Shampoo and Conditioner really helps to keep it from looking dry and over processed.  This is the first time I ordered the 26.3 ounce size!  I&#x27;m tired of running out of it!</li>
            <li> love this shampoo! smells great with great lather ability. rinses out great wish this product was available at a local salon</li>
            <li> I have silver-white hair and although I use a shampoo for gray hair weekly;  I also needed one I could use the rest of the week.  Wow!  Did I mention that it is wavy toward the loose curly side. and it also has a mind of its own?  I run the fingers of both hands straight back through my hair after a shower as grooming.  It produces little suds but, cleans and conditions with no build, up this shampoo with the scent of earthly delights.  My thick haired, Veronica Lake style hairdo wife loves it also.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. I use it with the matching conditioner. The scent lasts. I like the original scent best. Do to greying curlly hair w/ the potential for a drier frizzy look I do not rinse out my conditioner. I take care not to over apply and distribute well.</li>
            <li> I found the Marrakesh Original Shampoo was very satisfactory and met my needs &amp; expectation.  I recommend this product to everyone seeking a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble finding a shampoo and conditioner that really helped with my thin, curly, frizzy hair.

But neither did any other shampoo I bought, even those labeled &amp;#34;anti-frizz.&amp;#34; This (with matching conditioner) are by far the best I&#x27;ve used yet (in my entire life), frizz or not. My hair is softer than it&#x27;s ever been and it&#x27;s still less frizzy with this stuff than others. Also, I feel extremely comfortable with the contents of this as well as other Marrakesh/Earthly Body products, since I&#x27;ve come to really believe in both hemp seed oil and argan oil. I try to buy other products with the same oils, such as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap and lip balm.</li>
            <li> my hair is soft, shiney, silky, and I don&#x27;t need conditioner. I have long wild hair and this product is superior, not to mention a light wonderful almost mystic scent. Superior product.</li>

            <li> I love Marakesh products, I use them on my coated show dogs as well as myself and the results are fabulous for all of us!  I love the smell of the Argon oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the idea that a shampoo has to lather a lot to get your hair clean. Huge misconception. This shampoo does not lather a lot but gets your hair clean without drying it out. The smell is absolutely fabulous. I also recommend the conditioner and smoothing treatment as well.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product that i will buy again - makes my hair soft and silky and healthy looking - but it takes 4 or 5 squirts rather than one as it says!</li>
            <li> I am repeating this review I used for the Marrakesh Conditioner. Using the products together has done wonders for my fine hair. I was &#x27;advised&#x27; towards using another higher end shampoo and conditioner, but the higher end product was severely drying out my hair. Marrakesh smells great and leaves my hair in much better condition. I purchased this larger size after having such good results using the 8 oz size.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny and you only need a little bit for great lathering. But, the best part is the way it smells. I use it with the conditioner and the Marrakesh hair elixir for a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> My daughter visited one day with exotic(earthy(sandalwood? cedar?),with a touch of vanilla?)smelling hair. Now I have exotic smelling hair which also feels healthy. Clean but not stripped. I also bought the leave-in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp, and the body lotion which is thick, creamy and long-lasting. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to help my color treated, flat ironed hair to feel soft, be shiny and beautiful. This is the product. I use the conditioner as well and the leave in oil. Nothing better!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick hair. I used the Marrakesh leave in treatment for a long time an decided to take a chance on the shampoo and conditioner. I am so glad I did. I only have to wash my hair twice a week now and my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or flaky anymore.</li>
            <li> My sister bought me a bottle several months ago upon returning from one of her cosmetology shows and from the first time I used it I LOVED it!!!! Best shampoo I have ever used!  I used to have to switch shampoos, especially during season change, now after using this shampoo for over 6 months I still don&#x27;t feel the need to change! My hair looks healthy, shinny and still has volume(I have thin, fine, sleek hair that up until I stated using this always looked limp)!!!  I also have the conditioner and LOVE IT!  I usually only need to use during the winter though because the shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like so many others.</li>
            <li> Smells really great but caused my scalp to get kinda... Crusty would be the best word for it I guess.  But if I had waited to buy it after buying some their after shampoo products I would have known that.  I love their styling products but discovered that I couldn&#x27;t get them on my scalp w/o those kinda crusty patches forming. I like their body creme as well &amp; it doesn&#x27;t cause issues...so not sure whats up with that!  Love the smell of these products!  Wish they made a perfume oil...</li>
            <li> I know it is natural and there is not many chemicals in it. But it makes me feel like it doesnt clean my hair. There isnt bubbles.</li>
            <li> Those with wheat/gluten intolerances - please be advised - this product contains hydrolyzed wheat protein. If there was a complete ingredient list in the item description somewhere, then my bad. I adore the smell of the Marrakesh products and love the leave-in treatment so am disappointed that this item doesn&#x27;t work for me. Ah well.</li>
            <li> Although I received this item a day earlier than expected, I only received about half of the bottle full. The bottle has appeared to leak in the regional packaging which was from Amazon and had been be packaged by Federal Express. hopefully with the next bottle that I receive it is packaged in a box and not in a bag</li>
