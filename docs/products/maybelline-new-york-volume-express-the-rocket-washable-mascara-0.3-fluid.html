    <ol>
            <li>works great on my eye lashes!</li>
            <li>great mascara.  </li>
            <li>mascara is potentially great because I do like the rubber (?)</li>
            <li>I am not always great at washing off my make up each night.</li>
            <li>she liked it!))</li>
            <li>I am at a loss as to how the fans of this mascara can apply this and have it look good.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>and i love this stuff !</li>
            <li>So I tried this product (since it&#x27;s volume express) and just love it.</li>
            <li>This product also lasts all day, where most others look rubbed off and gone by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>If you try to apply more than one, the clumps get even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this mascara; it is build able; it thickens and lengthens my lashes, without clumping or flaking.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li>I love love love it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it to apply smoothly.  </li>
            <li>And the present was good</li>
            <li>Makes my eyelashes look super spidery.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for anyone needing more volume to their eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I really like how smooth this mascara is -</li>
            <li>This is my new go to mascara, easy to apply and no clumps.</li>
            <li>coat is more than enough.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why that is, as it was part of an order which included other Maybelline mascara which did not show up as a hazardous material.  </li>
            <li>the brush have tiny little bristles which is absolutely awesome! makes lashes super long!</li>
            <li>I am very particular about mascara and this one as inexpensive as it is works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is also very nicely pigmented, so you can definitely see the volume pay-off (even for brownish black).</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was just this tube, but mine was very clumpy.  </li>
            <li>Since it goes on so smoothly, it doesn&#x27;t clump even if I put on multiple coats.</li>
            <li>I cannot really rate the performance of this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I really like.</li>
            <li>and I just have to say that this the absolutely CLUMPIEST mascara that I&#x27;ve EVER SEEN in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very build-able.</li>
            <li>Im very picky about mascara</li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t feel it increased volume that much either.</li>
            <li>I have not changed mascara since high school.</li>
            <li>The brush is similar in appearance to that of CoverGirl LashBlast Volume, but the latter applies much better, with far less clumps and far more definition, while maintaining the volume intact.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, my eyelashes actually look long and full.</li>
            <li>With a few quick swipes, it delivers some real color density, which wakes up the look of your eyes.</li>
            <li>I always thought my eyelashes were really short, and then a makeup artist told me they were actually pretty long, but just didn&#x27;t have much volume.</li>
            <li>It also stays on well, not being as sensitive to oily eyelids as some non-waterproof mascaras are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really taken by the noticeable extra length and color without going over my lashes tons of times.</li>
            <li>I have tried several high end mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of different mascaras at varying price points, and I think that Maybelline New York Volume Express Washable Mascara (\\&quot;The Rocket\\&quot;) works well for a modest price.</li>
            <li>How can something be identified as hazardous and unable to be stored by Amazon and shipped back by you, when it was……stored by Amazon and shipped…..to be delivered to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> any event - Amazon was great as always and refunded my money, but the fact that Maybelline makes an expensive stick of mascara and has this lousy a quality assurance approach- Avoid this product and buy something else.</li>

            <li> My eyelashes are not long and thick but with this product no one would know !</li>
            <li> IT even gets my little lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this happens because it&#x27;s a little oilier than the standard mascara, which makes sense because I also had a frustrating time taking this mascara off with makeup remover wipes, soap &amp; water, toner, etc., etc.</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time finding a mascara</li>
            <li> Its hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, really waiting for it, although there has been a lot of shopping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look like I have false lashes on.  </li>
            <li> Beats all the really expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Definitely annoying when you have longer lashes and you have to be somewhere soon.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perhaps it was just this tube, but mine was very clumpy.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to apply smoothly.  I ended up replacing it after 1 week.</li>
            <li> great mascara.  Makes my lashes look like I have false lashes on.  Beats all the really expensive brands.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite mascara!  I get compliments on my eyelashes because of this mascara!  I have tried several high end mascara&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t like them as well as the Express Rocket!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> It was a present! And the present was good she liked it!))) I think so that  you can buy it</li>
            <li> I really like how smooth this mascara is - it goes on the lashes just the way you put them on. It is also very nicely pigmented, so you can definitely see the volume pay-off (even for brownish black). Since it goes on so smoothly, it doesn&#x27;t clump even if I put on multiple coats. But this mascara takes a while to dry. When I&#x27;m in a hurry, it smudges on my eyelids. Definitely annoying when you have longer lashes and you have to be somewhere soon. I think this happens because it&#x27;s a little oilier than the standard mascara, which makes sense because I also had a frustrating time taking this mascara off with makeup remover wipes, soap &amp; water, toner, etc., etc. Overall, I&#x27;ve had too many problems with the slow drying, frustrating removal, smearing, and flaking, so I don&#x27;t use this anymore.</li>
            <li> I have not changed mascara since high school. This is my new go to mascara, easy to apply and no clumps.</li>
            <li> IT even gets my little lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the brush it kinda big. Sometimes it slips an touches my eye lids.</li>
            <li> I cannot really rate the performance of this mascara.  The one shipped to me arrived damaged.  The shipping box as well as the Maybelline package were intact, however, when opened we found that the applicator tip was dangling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No big deal, I thought.  I&#x27;ll contact Amazon and return it.  However, when I tried to do so, I noticed this mascara is on Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;hazardous materials&amp;#34; list and cannot be shipped back.  I have no idea why that is, as it was part of an order which included other Maybelline mascara which did not show up as a hazardous material.  In any event, this product shows up on the hazmat list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even know why this would be.  How can something be identified as hazardous and unable to be stored by Amazon and shipped back by you, when it was……stored by Amazon and shipped…..to be delivered to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event - Amazon was great as always and refunded my money, but the fact that Maybelline makes an expensive stick of mascara and has this lousy a quality assurance approach- Avoid this product and buy something else.</li>
            <li> Then this is the mascara for you.  It&#x27;s so thin it takes a while to try and shows no noticeable improvement to length or volume.</li>
            <li> I have not got this mascara ((((, money paid. Very disappointed, really waiting for it, although there has been a lot of shopping</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time finding a mascara I really like. I always thought my eyelashes were really short, and then a makeup artist told me they were actually pretty long, but just didn&#x27;t have much volume. So I tried this product (since it&#x27;s volume express) and just love it. For the first time in my life, my eyelashes actually look long and full. This product also lasts all day, where most others look rubbed off and gone by the end of the day. Definitely recommend for anyone needing more volume to their eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I will give this tube about a month to see if the results change, but it&#x27;s about a week or two into this and I just have to say that this the absolutely CLUMPIEST mascara that I&#x27;ve EVER SEEN in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One coat is more than enough. If you try to apply more than one, the clumps get even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot apply this mascara without the lashes looking spidery and clumpy, even after dabbing the wand with tissue. I am at a loss as to how the fans of this mascara can apply this and have it look good. If you have any pointers, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is potentially great because I do like the rubber (?) brush and there is some flare to the lashes once it is on because it holds a curl well. It also stays on well, not being as sensitive to oily eyelids as some non-waterproof mascaras are. The brush is similar in appearance to that of CoverGirl LashBlast Volume, but the latter applies much better, with far less clumps and far more definition, while maintaining the volume intact.</li>
            <li> works great on my eye lashes! the brush have tiny little bristles which is absolutely awesome! makes lashes super long! definitely recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara; it is build able; it thickens and lengthens my lashes, without clumping or flaking.  And it wears 12+ hours.</li>
            <li> Thickens my lashes and adds drama. Very build-able. This is my 2nd tube in a month as I will be stocking up on these.</li>
            <li> This is the second tube of mascara that I have bought on amazon and the second tube that was dried out and useless.</li>
            <li> Im very picky about mascara and i love this stuff ! My eyelashes are not long and thick but with this product no one would know ! Thank you will continue using this product !</li>
            <li> I am not always great at washing off my make up each night. If you don&#x27;t then be prepared for mascara residue (specks of black) all over. Its hard to get off. And I didn&#x27;t feel it increased volume that much either. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara ever. Makes my eyelashes look super spidery. I love love love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different mascaras at varying price points, and I think that Maybelline New York Volume Express Washable Mascara (\\&quot;The Rocket\\&quot;) works well for a modest price. With a few quick swipes, it delivers some real color density, which wakes up the look of your eyes. I&#x27;m really taken by the noticeable extra length and color without going over my lashes tons of times. This one&#x27;s a definite keeper. Recommended -- give it a try!</li>
            <li> I am very particular about mascara and this one as inexpensive as it is works very well.  I adore the brush type as well.</li>
