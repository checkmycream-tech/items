            <li>Loyal customer!</li>
            <li>Just a few sprays and a comb will easily glide through my hair--plus, it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>A great leave in treatment when one doesn&#x27;t have time to use a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Great price for this vs buying from my local salon.</li>
            <li>this spray is also great as a mid day lift / refresher.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this amazing product.</li>
            <li>It really did a great job detangling my hair, actually better than most other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I imagine it would be a great detangler for long hair.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist bleached the top of my hair a beautiful blonde with peekaboo brown (blonde on top brown underneath).</li>
            <li>Sort of clean scent.</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>but  I love that the color is light blue and seems to actually cool my blonde a bit more which I LOVE!!</li>
            <li>It feels very light but is very conditioning.</li>
            <li>Mi grilfirend tell me it&#x27;s a wonderful product to use and hard to find, before that she bought on JC Penney</li>
            <li>This resulted in the bottle leaking product all over the packaging and leaving without a full bottle.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love this product, have used it for a while &amp; the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious but not overwhelming!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Pravana is a great product, will soften your hair and you won&#x27;t have any tangles at all, it&#x27;s nice to spray it in my hair and dry and go, I totally recommend this product&amp; this company.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased several different type of leave-in conditioner&#x27;s and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>My favorite leave in product, and it have tried many different ones.</li>
            <li>It ships quickly</li>
            <li>It does not leave a heavy residue, and has many proteins in it which is good for the hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shining, and so full of bounce!!  </li>
            <li>Super light, super amazing, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down (I hair super oily, super damaged hair) but gets all those knots out and leaves it with a super soft healthy feel and a light shine.</li>
            <li>I started using it when I had long straight color processed hair and it worked great</li>
            <li>I have been using the Pravana de-tangler for about 5 years or so and it far surpasses anything on the market for fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is naturally curly but tends to get frizzy, I spritz this stuff on it every morning and not only does it have a great clean smell (for when her hair is funky)</li>
            <li>Good product for curly dry hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, makes my hair so soft, and the bottle is fully recyclable!</li>
            <li>That is a first!</li>
            <li>The Pravana does a wonderful job on my very thick hair.</li>
            <li>Product smells great, and does not leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Spray or mist over head and shoulders as a fresh scent; sublime.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>totally worth 20 bucks</li>
            <li>This treatment makes my hair feel so soft and it looks healthy.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft, healthy looking</li>
            <li>hair cut the other day, I loved the smell of what my stylist was spraying in my hair while it was damp.</li>
            <li>but it knocks the frizz right out.  </li>
            <li>It use it right when I get out of the shower and it helps detangle my hair</li>
            <li>My salon specialist recommended it to me and she was right</li>
            <li>The comb slides right though with no problems.</li>
            <li>It makes my curly hair very soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>This product works for all hair types and considering we live where it is hot 9 months out of the year it leaves our hair soft and healthy looking even with the humidity!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smelling fantastic and super silky soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have profoundly damaged hair from my love of changing my hair color &amp; avid use of bleach - I often use neon Manic Panic colors which require bleaching beforehand.</li>
            <li>Okay, I owe the awesome color to my stylist but this product is the secret weapon to silky smooth hair that does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no heavy build up with the products and the at home maintenance is simply easy.  </li>
            <li>My niece, whom has very very curly hair also loves it.</li>
            <li>the first time.</li>
            <li>this stuff really has helped to mend the ends!  </li>
            <li>love this product and totally recommend getting it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>For her last trim I took her to my hair salon instead of these kid specialty places, the stylist recommended this product and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe putting it in a smaller box or more rapping would work</li>
            <li>I never fails.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>-I love the softness of my hair that only comes from using this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years but recently have not been able to buy it at my hair salon.</li>
            <li>I use it after I shampoo and condition, when hair is damp also before I use my hot irons.</li>
            <li>Shipped right away, came packaged very well, even wrapped in a plastic bag in case it leaked.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, not oily,  and it smells fantastic without being overwhelming in the long term.</li>
            <li>I love this treatment, it smells good, and does not leave a sticky or weird residue.  </li>
            <li>The sprayer is much easier to use than standard bottles, just make sure to shake up before using because it separates in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I towel dry first to get more product and spray</li>
            <li>I\\&quot;ve searched the world, high and low to find a product I love.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product after my hairdresser used it on my dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s such a strong scent, and nothing quite gets rid of</li>
            <li>Better than even the delicious smell, she could get actually a comb through my damp hair without any tangles (this is impossible for me to do).</li>
            <li>I have used soooooo many hair products, from the normal low quality stuff you can buy at any store, to high end products bought at the salon</li>
            <li>so I purchased the Intense Leave-in treatment, along with the Hydrating shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>My step daughter introduced me to Pravana Intense</li>
            <li>It works very well for me</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I really thought this one was going to be the one for me.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend to all who have damaged hair!</li>
            <li>I used it on my daughter&#x27;s relaxed hair that we are growing out, and it nourished and made it much easier to comb out the tangles where the hair has grown out.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my hairdresser for introducing me to this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really need it for my unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>Intense Therapy Leave-In Treatment.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This intense leave in therapy treatment was the answer.</li>
            <li>wish I&#x27;d like it, really.</li>
            <li>B0009HIFRY Pravana Intense Therapy Leave-</li>
            <li>I use this product after showering to detangle my very knotty hair.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>GSM shipped really fast, too.  </li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t help with smoothing or detangling, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li>, I much prefer &#x27;</li>
            <li>I find it very comparable to Aveda brilliance conditioner spray, which is what I bought it to replace.</li>
            <li>After drying I straight iron.</li>
            <li>Recommended: I have long dry gray hair and this is good</li>
            <li>I use a straightening iron on my hair-it has protected it from becoming dry and damaged.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Works better as a detangler than any other leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li>I had difficulty with the original bottle/sprayer, so I just transferred the product to a different spray bottle.</li>
            <li>and It gets very frizzy when the humidity is high.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is I wish the packaging was a little more secure from spilling.</li>
            <li>The top half of the bottle was sticking out.</li>
            <li>I used more the third time, with the same results.</li>
            <li>This product is great if you have thick, curly, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a lot of more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s particularly helpful if you have split ends, or ends that \\&quot;snap\\&quot; when you comb out your hair.</li>
            <li>It feels light, doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down, yet does a stellar job of making my hair easier to comb through.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone of all hair types</li>
            <li>I highly recomment this Pravana product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The products costs a little more than what I&#x27;m used to spending</li>
            <li>It works great when I straighten my hair, but leaves curls a little limp (always the case with intense conditioners)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural and highly helping my hair !</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a product that will enable me to brush through my hair without it hurting until I found this it detangles and softens hair with just a few sprits  </li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair, just be sure to shake well before spraying.</li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and how it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid island and this product leaves my hair soft and shiny, no matter the wheather.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has hair that tangles super bad and again, sprayed it in her hair and and I was able to easily comb through them all.</li>
            <li>It is in new packaging now.</li>
            <li>only ~$17 for a huge bottle which will last forever, this treatment is something I won&#x27;t go without ever again.</li>
            <li>I have fine (naturally dark brown that is turning gray) hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it feels moisturized without being weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave hair greasy, sprays on well and leaves hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair really soft!</li>
            <li>No dead ends when using this product Also, because I have longer hair helps detangles!</li>
            <li>I usually put it in a spray bottle with a tad bit more water when re-twisting my hair in the evening before I add an oil.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair too soft!</li>
            <li>It smells a little strong once you spray it on the hair, however once I blowdry the smells desapairs.</li>
            <li>This is saving me from giving myself more hair damage from ripping through my knots with a brush, both while my hair is wet and dry.</li>
            <li>I spray a little in my hair and it is tangle free.</li>
            <li>Love this product had hard time find it before I desided to look on the internet for it.  </li>
            <li>and it smells great, but it makes me itch like crazy if it gets on my skin.  </li>
            <li>y riso muy bonito como natural y</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this one 5 stars as they fixed the slippery bottle problem.</li>
            <li>And my hair is just so soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I may have received my product early</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It works, and its not heavy.</li>
            <li>This product feels lightweight and not heavy on the hair. .</li>
            <li>This made my hair look and feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair that I treat frequently</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>As an Afican-American woman with natural 4A-C hair, I often use this as a detangler and my daughter, who is also natural, uses it as a leave-in.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Have naturally curly, Frizzy hair and this stuff</li>
            <li>So far my hair has been so conditioned with this leave in therapy.</li>
            <li>A few sprays and tangle free combing was immediately my experience.</li>
            <li>I spray some on my two year old daughter&#x27;s hair before I brush it and there are no tears or \\&quot;Ouches\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>No heavy or gooey product.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It eliminated the frizzies, made my hair soft and shiny,</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>It detangles hair and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>It feels so silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, it  works wonders with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>This product works well on my teenage daughter&#x27;s fine, curly but fragile long hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why I have the world&#x27;s most tangled, hard-to-comb hair, but I guess we all have a cross to bear, and</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to put too much, because too much wiegh your hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair, and it definitely made a difference for me in combing my hair right after I wash it.</li>
            <li>Smell is nice but strong, the method of dispensing was worthless</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy and thick and it has been thru a lot of coloring (blue, purple, bleached, natural, ombra) because  of my love for colors my hair has lost its shine, softness and ia a bit crunchy.</li>
            <li>Several of the girls I work with complained of static when brushing their hair</li>
            <li>While getting my long, coarse (but straight!)</li>
            <li>It tames your hair right down and reduces frizz.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice any major improvements to my hair</li>
            <li>I actually used it while I was coloring my roots to keep the ends moist &amp; conditioned and it was light enough to do this, and it is deep treating enough for dry styling on the days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I spray it on wet hair before styling and it leaves my hair straight again.  </li>
            <li>I barely put any on, start at the bottom of her hair, and wa-la--</li>
            <li>It always leaves it soft and moisturized, especially on the 4C part!  </li>
            <li>but this product helps so much I don&#x27;t mind wet combing my hair anymore.</li>
            <li>I gave a low rating the first time due to the fact that when I received the product it was leaking and that the sprayer top was broken.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use so much product later when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>Requires only a few light sprays to allow the comb to glide through my long hair.</li>
            <li>Being  super pale blonde, I avoid yellow or colored products</li>
            <li>I have dry, natural wavy hair that is frizzy when it&#x27;s humid outside.</li>
            <li>You can use as little or as much as you want.  </li>
            <li>I use on my little girl&#x27;s hair all the time and makes it much easier to brush.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, no more tangles!!!</li>

            <li> (I have fine hair but lots of it)</li>
            <li> Loyal customer!</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays and a comb will easily glide through my hair--plus, it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> A great leave in treatment when one doesn&#x27;t have time to use a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Great price for this vs buying from my local salon.</li>
            <li> this spray is also great as a mid day lift / refresher.</li>
            <li> It is light weight on my hair, so it feels like I&#x27;m not wearing any product.</li>
            <li> And my hair stays tangle free.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to try to keep it healthly.</li>
            <li> Was so impressed I bought 3 more bottles and have one to a lady friend who is also a fanatic about her hair</li>
            <li> I loved how silky and soft my hair felt</li>
            <li> My hair has grown beautifully without having to work about taking out a chunk of hair do to split ends and dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle is super easy to use, and can be turned &#x27;off&#x27; for spill-proof traveling.</li>
            <li> It was out of stock and no other product we tried was as good.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this amazing product.</li>
            <li> It really did a great job detangling my hair, actually better than most other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I imagine it would be a great detangler for long hair.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist bleached the top of my hair a beautiful blonde with peekaboo brown (blonde on top brown underneath).</li>
            <li> Sort of clean scent.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> but  I love that the color is light blue and seems to actually cool my blonde a bit more which I LOVE!!</li>
            <li> It feels very light but is very conditioning.</li>
            <li> Mi grilfirend tell me it&#x27;s a wonderful product to use and hard to find, before that she bought on JC Penney</li>
            <li> This resulted in the bottle leaking product all over the packaging and leaving without a full bottle.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love this product, have used it for a while &amp; the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious but not overwhelming!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Pravana is a great product, will soften your hair and you won&#x27;t have any tangles at all, it&#x27;s nice to spray it in my hair and dry and go, I totally recommend this product&amp; this company.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased several different type of leave-in conditioner&#x27;s and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li> My favorite leave in product, and it have tried many different ones.</li>
            <li> It ships quickly</li>
            <li> It does not leave a heavy residue, and has many proteins in it which is good for the hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shining, and so full of bounce!!  </li>
            <li> Super light, super amazing, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down (I hair super oily, super damaged hair) but gets all those knots out and leaves it with a super soft healthy feel and a light shine.</li>
            <li> I started using it when I had long straight color processed hair and it worked great</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pravana de-tangler for about 5 years or so and it far surpasses anything on the market for fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is naturally curly but tends to get frizzy, I spritz this stuff on it every morning and not only does it have a great clean smell (for when her hair is funky)</li>
            <li> Good product for curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, makes my hair so soft, and the bottle is fully recyclable!</li>
            <li> That is a first!</li>
            <li> The Pravana does a wonderful job on my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Product smells great, and does not leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Spray or mist over head and shoulders as a fresh scent; sublime.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> totally worth 20 bucks</li>
            <li> This treatment makes my hair feel so soft and it looks healthy.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft, healthy looking</li>
            <li> hair cut the other day, I loved the smell of what my stylist was spraying in my hair while it was damp.</li>
            <li> but it knocks the frizz right out.  </li>
            <li> It use it right when I get out of the shower and it helps detangle my hair</li>
            <li> My salon specialist recommended it to me and she was right</li>
            <li> The comb slides right though with no problems.</li>
            <li> It makes my curly hair very soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> This product works for all hair types and considering we live where it is hot 9 months out of the year it leaves our hair soft and healthy looking even with the humidity!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling fantastic and super silky soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have profoundly damaged hair from my love of changing my hair color &amp; avid use of bleach - I often use neon Manic Panic colors which require bleaching beforehand.</li>
            <li> Okay, I owe the awesome color to my stylist but this product is the secret weapon to silky smooth hair that does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no heavy build up with the products and the at home maintenance is simply easy.  </li>
            <li> My niece, whom has very very curly hair also loves it.</li>
            <li> the first time.</li>
            <li> this stuff really has helped to mend the ends!  </li>
            <li> love this product and totally recommend getting it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> For her last trim I took her to my hair salon instead of these kid specialty places, the stylist recommended this product and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Maybe putting it in a smaller box or more rapping would work</li>
            <li> I never fails.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> -I love the softness of my hair that only comes from using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years but recently have not been able to buy it at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> I use it after I shampoo and condition, when hair is damp also before I use my hot irons.</li>
            <li> Shipped right away, came packaged very well, even wrapped in a plastic bag in case it leaked.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy, not oily,  and it smells fantastic without being overwhelming in the long term.</li>
            <li> I love this treatment, it smells good, and does not leave a sticky or weird residue.  </li>
            <li> The sprayer is much easier to use than standard bottles, just make sure to shake up before using because it separates in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I towel dry first to get more product and spray</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;ve searched the world, high and low to find a product I love.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product after my hairdresser used it on my dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s such a strong scent, and nothing quite gets rid of</li>
            <li> Better than even the delicious smell, she could get actually a comb through my damp hair without any tangles (this is impossible for me to do).</li>
            <li> I have used soooooo many hair products, from the normal low quality stuff you can buy at any store, to high end products bought at the salon</li>
            <li> so I purchased the Intense Leave-in treatment, along with the Hydrating shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> My step daughter introduced me to Pravana Intense</li>
            <li> It works very well for me</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I really thought this one was going to be the one for me.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend to all who have damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I used it on my daughter&#x27;s relaxed hair that we are growing out, and it nourished and made it much easier to comb out the tangles where the hair has grown out.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my hairdresser for introducing me to this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really need it for my unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> Intense Therapy Leave-In Treatment.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This intense leave in therapy treatment was the answer.</li>
            <li> wish I&#x27;d like it, really.</li>
            <li> B0009HIFRY Pravana Intense Therapy Leave-</li>
            <li> I use this product after showering to detangle my very knotty hair.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> GSM shipped really fast, too.  </li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t help with smoothing or detangling, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> , I much prefer &#x27;</li>
            <li> I find it very comparable to Aveda brilliance conditioner spray, which is what I bought it to replace.</li>
            <li> After drying I straight iron.</li>
            <li> Recommended: I have long dry gray hair and this is good</li>
            <li> I use a straightening iron on my hair-it has protected it from becoming dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Works better as a detangler than any other leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> I had difficulty with the original bottle/sprayer, so I just transferred the product to a different spray bottle.</li>
            <li> and It gets very frizzy when the humidity is high.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish the packaging was a little more secure from spilling.</li>
            <li> The top half of the bottle was sticking out.</li>
            <li> I used more the third time, with the same results.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you have thick, curly, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than a lot of more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly helpful if you have split ends, or ends that \\&quot;snap\\&quot; when you comb out your hair.</li>
            <li> It feels light, doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down, yet does a stellar job of making my hair easier to comb through.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone of all hair types</li>
            <li> I highly recomment this Pravana product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The products costs a little more than what I&#x27;m used to spending</li>
            <li> It works great when I straighten my hair, but leaves curls a little limp (always the case with intense conditioners)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural and highly helping my hair !</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a product that will enable me to brush through my hair without it hurting until I found this it detangles and softens hair with just a few sprits  </li>
            <li> Not heavy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair, just be sure to shake well before spraying.</li>
            <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and how it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid island and this product leaves my hair soft and shiny, no matter the wheather.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has hair that tangles super bad and again, sprayed it in her hair and and I was able to easily comb through them all.</li>
            <li> It is in new packaging now.</li>
            <li> only ~$17 for a huge bottle which will last forever, this treatment is something I won&#x27;t go without ever again.</li>
            <li> I have fine (naturally dark brown that is turning gray) hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it feels moisturized without being weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave hair greasy, sprays on well and leaves hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> No dead ends when using this product Also, because I have longer hair helps detangles!</li>
            <li> I usually put it in a spray bottle with a tad bit more water when re-twisting my hair in the evening before I add an oil.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair too soft!</li>
            <li> It smells a little strong once you spray it on the hair, however once I blowdry the smells desapairs.</li>
            <li> This is saving me from giving myself more hair damage from ripping through my knots with a brush, both while my hair is wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I spray a little in my hair and it is tangle free.</li>
            <li> Love this product had hard time find it before I desided to look on the internet for it.  </li>
            <li> and it smells great, but it makes me itch like crazy if it gets on my skin.  </li>
            <li> y riso muy bonito como natural y</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this one 5 stars as they fixed the slippery bottle problem.</li>
            <li> And my hair is just so soft.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>

            <li> It works, and its not heavy.</li>
            <li> This product feels lightweight and not heavy on the hair. .</li>
            <li> This made my hair look and feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I treat frequently</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> As an Afican-American woman with natural 4A-C hair, I often use this as a detangler and my daughter, who is also natural, uses it as a leave-in.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Have naturally curly, Frizzy hair and this stuff</li>
            <li> So far my hair has been so conditioned with this leave in therapy.</li>
            <li> A few sprays and tangle free combing was immediately my experience.</li>
            <li> I spray some on my two year old daughter&#x27;s hair before I brush it and there are no tears or \\&quot;Ouches\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> No heavy or gooey product.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It eliminated the frizzies, made my hair soft and shiny,</li>
            <li> Not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> It detangles hair and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> It feels so silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it  works wonders with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product works well on my teenage daughter&#x27;s fine, curly but fragile long hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I have the world&#x27;s most tangled, hard-to-comb hair, but I guess we all have a cross to bear, and</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to put too much, because too much wiegh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, and it definitely made a difference for me in combing my hair right after I wash it.</li>
            <li> Smell is nice but strong, the method of dispensing was worthless</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and thick and it has been thru a lot of coloring (blue, purple, bleached, natural, ombra) because  of my love for colors my hair has lost its shine, softness and ia a bit crunchy.</li>
            <li> Several of the girls I work with complained of static when brushing their hair</li>
            <li> While getting my long, coarse (but straight!)</li>
            <li> It tames your hair right down and reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice any major improvements to my hair</li>
            <li> I actually used it while I was coloring my roots to keep the ends moist &amp; conditioned and it was light enough to do this, and it is deep treating enough for dry styling on the days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I spray it on wet hair before styling and it leaves my hair straight again.  </li>
            <li> I barely put any on, start at the bottom of her hair, and wa-la--</li>
            <li> It always leaves it soft and moisturized, especially on the 4C part!  </li>
            <li> but this product helps so much I don&#x27;t mind wet combing my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> I gave a low rating the first time due to the fact that when I received the product it was leaking and that the sprayer top was broken.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use so much product later when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Requires only a few light sprays to allow the comb to glide through my long hair.</li>
            <li> Being  super pale blonde, I avoid yellow or colored products</li>
            <li> I have dry, natural wavy hair that is frizzy when it&#x27;s humid outside.</li>
            <li> You can use as little or as much as you want.  </li>
            <li> I use on my little girl&#x27;s hair all the time and makes it much easier to brush.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, no more tangles!!!</li>
            <li> I use other natural haircare products that contribute, but this is in my haircare regimen and works well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to come by in person, but sites like amazon make it possible to get your hands on these products for reasonable prices!</li>
            <li> Does not build up and it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Added</li>
            <li> I have coarse, long, color treated hair that can feel like a tumbleweed after shampooing</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my hair feel soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling silky soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> a bit expensive for the product, and if you have to pay shipping it is very expensive, I am sure you can buy something of equal quality or better in the store</li>
            <li> But when it starts to dry it makes my recently treated hair feel rubbery almost and sticky and pulls it out whenever i brush.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice shine to the hair as well, and unlike other detanglers I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or make my hair get dirty faster.</li>
            <li> this product changes the feel of my newly shampooed hair from dry and tangled to manageable &amp; untangled with a few sprays.  </li>
            <li> the trigger is difficult for me to use, so i transferred the treatment into a different clean spray bottle that i had.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser, Makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t weight it down!  </li>
            <li> Reflect Mist &amp; Go Conditioner, which i still like, but nothing has provided the long term effects as this product by pravana.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, I purchased this product over 8 months ago</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; detangler for daughters long hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my shower, I spray a tiny bit on my wet hair, and my pick/comb glides effortlessly through my hair....</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it as long as I can  find it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not loyal to any one brand line, I tend to like different products from different lines.  </li>
            <li> It detangles long curly hair like a breeze, and is so shiny!  </li>
            <li> especially the ends( due to coloring,blow drying and curling)</li>
            <li> actually had to throw it away the other day, after failing to ever use it because I just couldn&#x27;t take the smell lingering on my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long hair annd</li>
            <li> my hair has always been dry</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my typically dry hair (bottle blond) has benefited from the use of this product also.</li>
            <li> I shampoo, towel dry and spritz on  Pravana.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products that are always too heavy or don&#x27;t condition enough.</li>
            <li> My fine hair went from limp and dull to limp and frizzy (after the bleach).</li>
            <li> When I found it was too sticky, I used less the second time, and it was still sticky and gummy.</li>
            <li> After being completely amazed with the Pravana perfection Trio product to straighten and soften my Brillo unruly hair, I wanted to find a leave in treatment that wasn&#x27;t heavy, filmy or matting the hair down.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months now and it is the only product that I have found that helps me to comb through my very long hair!</li>
            <li> Love the product packaging was bad and lost some product in transit</li>
            <li> It only took a few spritz of Pravana which justifies the cost of it.</li>
            <li> and I have thick/wavy/frizzy hair and spent the day in 97 degree heat and 80 percent humidity</li>
            <li> Hair does no appear greasy  or look wet once it dries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;shine spray&amp;#34; but an instant and leave in conditioner that definitely feels like it is repairing or at least temporarily sealing the damaged ends, and adding smoothness to rough areas.</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re not supposed to comb your hair when it&#x27;s wet or damp, but this product allows me to as my comb just glides through.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh down hair, but works to manage my dry hair</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Product of the week, in other words.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair that tends to dry out if I don&#x27;t condition it regularly.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t even use it because it was destroyed and half empty when I got it.</li>
            <li> Pravana has saved me from flyaway frizzlies and it doesn&#x27;t weigh  my hair down like other products.  </li>
            <li> Mi hair is dark brown and curly, I used to have highlights, now I have ombre hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m careful not to purchase heavy conditioners).</li>
            <li> Not something i would down my money on again.</li>
            <li> and this does not weigh it down and still styles well.</li>
            <li> I have to put my hair up in a ponytail for part of my day at work, and when I take it down</li>
            <li> I was contacted by the store and asked if I would take down my review</li>
            <li> but if I do spray a lot it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> It does not build up on the hair, leaving it dull and flat.  </li>
            <li> and im half way through bottle.</li>
            <li> I can go from straw to silk in less than a week using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Would not order from here unless you want to get half of what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It was in an evelope half its size and taped.</li>
            <li> I use it after my husband and I go riding on the motorcycle and my hair is a mess.</li>
            <li> It helps to condition my hair without leaving it greasy or bogged down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make her hair oily, stiff and crunchy, or weigh her curls down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coming off of having relaxers for years and color and was a little hesitant, but after seeing the results on others, I opted to try Pravana products.  </li>
            <li> This product give my hair the worst static ever!  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the offending ingredient is, since I use other Pravana products without any issues.</li>
            <li> your hair will go limp.</li>
            <li> With a few uses, you can feel the improvement in your hair.  </li>
            <li> A few spritz will do the trick.</li>
            <li> - isn&#x27;t heavy at all.</li>
            <li> but I just wasted 7 days thinking I would get my hair product....</li>
            <li> so it is prone to being dried out and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> so what a waste of money.. and way to go FEDEX for leaving a soggy box on my frontt stoop..</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy afterwards either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously purchased this at a salon for 3 times the price!  </li>
            <li> and my hair was way less frizzy than usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but just takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my little children&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> Not worth me paying to send it back, but still really disappointing considering the price of this product.</li>
            <li> They sell it at ULTA and it&#x27;s made wonders no more puffy hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair (I have thin hair and use products to help add volume</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe it except that my husband is crazy about the way my hair smells, even after it has long dried in.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and use this everyday when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Curly, thick and tangled after washing.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair, and it is extremely difficult for me to get a comb through it after a shower without any product.</li>
            <li> Seriously - there would be NO competition.</li>
            <li> and I was just never happy.</li>
            <li> However, when I received this, it was packaged extremely poorly.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was wrapped in a plastic bag with scotch tape and placed in a thin and flimsy cardboard envelope.  </li>
            <li> The trigger luckly wasnt broken, but anyone couldve tampered with it.</li>
            <li> But the pump arrived broken and I cannot use it.  </li>
            <li> what upset me was I received it broken.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product for me due to my hair tangling badly.</li>
            <li> I still add other products to my hair but this helps me get that ugly dryness out.</li>
            <li> If you have children (particularly girls) that have hair that is terrible to comb out - THIS IS A MUST!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> She tryed to buy in a mall store, but is is too expensive</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> the bottle had broken at the base of the sprayer and the contents were all over.</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel like silk and the shine will blind!</li>
            <li> Had it not smelled so darn bad :</li>
            <li> however  the shipping is the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A great leave in treatment when one doesn&#x27;t have time to use a regular conditioner.  It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product to me because my hair is curly, fine, and prone to frizz (as in... it&#x27;s always frizzy!!). I was hoping this product was a miracle, but it left my hair sticky. I used the recommended amount (per my stylist&#x27;s instructions) the first time. When I found it was too sticky, I used less the second time, and it was still sticky and gummy. I used more the third time, with the same results. I ended up giving it to a friend who doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; hair so she could use it as a leave in.</li>
            <li> Spray or mist over head and shoulders as a fresh scent; sublime. Use sparingly or else your hair will go limp.</li>
            <li> I am obsessede with this! Super light, super amazing, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down (I hair super oily, super damaged hair) but gets all those knots out and leaves it with a super soft healthy feel and a light shine.</li>
            <li> It smells okay and looks alright and when i put it in my hair it detangles , But when it starts to dry it makes my recently treated hair feel rubbery almost and sticky and pulls it out whenever i brush. Not something i would down my money on again.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you have thick, curly, coarse hair. It tames your hair right down and reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! I started using it when I had long straight color processed hair and it worked great (I have fine hair but lots of it) then I have recently got my hair cut into an A-Symetrical short bob in the back A lined to the front and this product works on that style just as well. Not heavy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair, just be sure to shake well before spraying. You&#x27;ll love it!!! And you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price, it is actually cheaper than the cosmotologist discount given at the local store.</li>
            <li> I started using the Pravana Keratin Fusion Texture Control which works great on my hair so I opted for more Pravana products.  I have sensitive/itchy scalp so I purchased the Intense Leave-in treatment, along with the Hydrating shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchases.  There&#x27;s no heavy build up with the products and the at home maintenance is simply easy.  I&#x27;m coming off of having relaxers for years and color and was a little hesitant, but after seeing the results on others, I opted to try Pravana products.  The products costs a little more than what I&#x27;m used to spending but it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Expiration date is far ahead (which is great), product was packaged very safely and came with no dents or leakage.  I love this treatment, it smells good, and does not leave a sticky or weird residue.  I use it for static hair.  Great price for this vs buying from my local salon.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awesome! Me and my daughter both use this on a daily basis. This product works for all hair types and considering we live where it is hot 9 months out of the year it leaves our hair soft and healthy looking even with the humidity! I highly recommend this product to everyone of all hair types</li>
            <li> Hola&lt;br /&gt;me gusta mucho este producto cuando un tiene el cabello rizado pero sin forma como friss este producto lo mejora lo pone muy sueve y riso muy bonito como natural y a la ves lo acondiciona este produsto es maravilloso me gusta mucho y mientras lo tenga amazon lo comprare por este medio Gracias amazon</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is very good, I would recommend it to anyone...</li>
            <li> The best leave in treatment I&#x27;ve ever had!  It arrived yesterday, and I used it after shampoo and conditioning this AM.  My hair is soft, shining, and so full of bounce!!  So glad I listened to the reviewers and got myself a bottle.  BTW, I had no problem with the spray nozzle--it works very nicely!!  I highly recomment this Pravana product.</li>
            <li> Great product, Speedy Shipping!</li>
            <li> This product works well on my teenage daughter&#x27;s fine, curly but fragile long hair.  I will use it again.</li>
            <li> The hydrating leave-in treatment smells so wonderful! I don&#x27;t wear fragrances or like smelly things, but this is incredible. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it except that my husband is crazy about the way my hair smells, even after it has long dried in. I wish I could find it locally, but thank you for putting it on Amazon.  I&#x27;m giving this one 5 stars as they fixed the slippery bottle problem.</li>
            <li> As a product junkie, i have tried all sorts of pre styling sprays that are leave in / pre-styling sprays and treatments. This is my best one I have ever used. before this, i was set on using ShiKai Color Reflect Mist &amp; Go Conditioner, which i still like, but nothing has provided the long term effects as this product by pravana. Shake it up before each use. It is not heavy, not oily,  and it smells fantastic without being overwhelming in the long term. this spray is also great as a mid day lift / refresher. It is not sticky or greasy. the trigger is difficult for me to use, so i transferred the treatment into a different clean spray bottle that i had.  that trigger on the spray is the only thing i would change.</li>
            <li> My step daughter introduced me to Pravana Intense Leave-In Treatment several years ago and I&#x27;ve been hooked on it ever since. I have dry, natural wavy hair that is frizzy when it&#x27;s humid outside. Pravana helps control these frizzies. Several of the girls I work with complained of static when brushing their hair so I gave then samples of my Pravana. They too are now faithful users. Oh, and it smells wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product when my keratin treatment is wearing off.  I spray it on wet hair before styling and it leaves my hair straight again.  It works very well for me</li>
            <li> It makes your hair softer, shine, and healthy looking.  Great  Product!  I recommend all the Pravana products ... they do what they say they will do.</li>
            <li> This is a really good leave in that conditions and softens the hair. That is what I need since my hair is very coarse. The spray is amazing, and it smells just like bubble gum! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw - at the salon where I purchased it, my stylist told me you can also use it on your body as a moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it  works wonders with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> The best product in my opinion out there ! Perfect for summer beach use</li>
            <li> Smells great and a great leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> Great Product that Smells Awesome!!!!!!  I have very long hair annd this stuff really has helped to mend the ends!  Its a Must Have hair product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this as a help to deal with the Houston humidity... it works well!  I have very thin hair and this does not weigh it down and still styles well.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle! Love it! Makes my hair really soft! Will purchase it again! You can&#x27;t get it from regular beauty store.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pravana de-tangler for about 5 years or so and it far surpasses anything on the market for fine, easily tangled hair. It does not leave hair greasy, sprays on well and leaves hair very soft and shiny. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Mi grilfirend tell me it&#x27;s a wonderful product to use and hard to find, before that she bought on JC Penney but they don&#x27;t sell it anymore on my region.</li>
            <li> This is great for getting tangles out.</li>
            <li> While getting my long, coarse (but straight!) hair cut the other day, I loved the smell of what my stylist was spraying in my hair while it was damp. Better than even the delicious smell, she could get actually a comb through my damp hair without any tangles (this is impossible for me to do). So I purchased this leave-in conditioner, and my hair has felt like silk ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For only ~$17 for a huge bottle which will last forever, this treatment is something I won&#x27;t go without ever again. The spray bottle is super easy to use, and can be turned &#x27;off&#x27; for spill-proof traveling. Like I said, the smell is great. It stays with you during the day too. I have to put my hair up in a ponytail for part of my day at work, and when I take it down I always get a nice whiff of how great my hair smells. Most importantly, no more tangles!!! This is saving me from giving myself more hair damage from ripping through my knots with a brush, both while my hair is wet and dry. And my hair is just so soft. Absolutely love this. Such a steal!</li>
            <li> I have used soooooo many hair products, from the normal low quality stuff you can buy at any store, to high end products bought at the salon and I was just never happy. That is until I found Pravana!! What a great product! It&#x27;s hard to come by in person, but sites like amazon make it possible to get your hands on these products for reasonable prices! This leave in conditioner is FANTASTIC! The smell is amazing, the quality is top notch! Your hair won&#x27;t even feel like your \\&quot;usual\\&quot; hair after using their products! I recommend using their shampoo, conditioner, AND this leave in conditioner!!! Your hair will feel like silk and the shine will blind!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for leaving your hair feeling touchably soft.</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;ve searched the world, high and low to find a product I love.  This is it.  It detangles long curly hair like a breeze, and is so shiny!  With a few uses, you can feel the improvement in your hair.  I&#x27;m not loyal to any one brand line, I tend to like different products from different lines.  This item is dynamite!</li>
            <li> this is an awesome product I have curly hair that always has knots in it. I have never been able to find a product that will enable me to brush through my hair without it hurting until I found this it detangles and softens hair with just a few sprits  love this product and totally recommend getting it. totally worth 20 bucks</li>
            <li> Jump out of the shower and spray this on your hair! It is a wonderful detangler! It smells really good! I even use it on my little children&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used the product on me and I was instantly attracted to the scent. Great leave in conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair (I have thin hair and use products to help add volume so I&#x27;m careful not to purchase heavy conditioners). It lasts a long time, I purchased this product over 8 months ago and im half way through bottle. A few spritz will do the trick.</li>
            <li> ...but I didn&#x27;t notice any major improvements to my hair so I am inclined to think it&#x27;s all hype.  Product of the week, in other words.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before and it is a great product but the company I bought it from STILL has not sent it to me. I emailed them and still no response. I bought it beginning of Sept  and I STILL have not received it</li>
            <li> Good product good price</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these and one was damaged, but they replaced it immediately and I feel like they deserve a great rating.  We all know that things can happen to orders, but this was a great experience and I really appreciate their great customer service!  I would FOR SURE order from them again!  Pravana is a great product, will soften your hair and you won&#x27;t have any tangles at all, it&#x27;s nice to spray it in my hair and dry and go, I totally recommend this product&amp; this company.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile, but could not find it at Penney&#x27;s Hair Salon any more.  I have naturally curly hair and It gets very frizzy when the humidity is high.  This works great!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I really thought this one was going to be the one for me. Instead it did nothing. It does smell good. Sort of clean scent. I used it 5 times and almost 1/2 the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products! I have thin hair and use this everyday when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> i love this product! it is the only spray in conditioner i have ever bought that actually works!! i highly recommend to all who have damaged hair!</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is naturally curly but tends to get frizzy, I spritz this stuff on it every morning and not only does it have a great clean smell (for when her hair is funky) but it knocks the frizz right out.  Doesn&#x27;t look greasy a bit - isn&#x27;t heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several different type of leave-in conditioner&#x27;s and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  It does not build up on the hair, leaving it dull and flat.  I use it every day.  It makes my hair very easy to comb.  My niece, whom has very very curly hair also loves it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Requires only a few light sprays to allow the comb to glide through my long hair. Does not build up and it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Added photos of ingredients</li>
            <li> I love this product, makes my hair so soft, and the bottle is fully recyclable! And i got it in record time, will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> This leave in treatment is by far the best. It use it right when I get out of the shower and it helps detangle my hair so I don&#x27;t even have to brush it. This helps a lot with the wave so I don&#x27;t have to use so much product later when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine, curly hair that dries out easily. I have tried numerous products that are always too heavy or don&#x27;t condition enough. For her last trim I took her to my hair salon instead of these kid specialty places, the stylist recommended this product and I absolutely love it. It doesn&#x27;t make her hair oily, stiff and crunchy, or weigh her curls down. Her curls are shiny, and bouncy, just the way I like them.</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m in love with this product because it takes the place of so many others.  It is a leave-in conditioner, detangler, shine serum, and frizz control all in one bottle.</li>
            <li> Good price, GREAT product! It&#x27;s like spraying angel semen in your hair.</li>
            <li> I may have received my product early but I can&#x27;t even use it because it was destroyed and half empty when I got it. I don&#x27;t know if it was a package problem or a shipping problem but I just wasted 7 days thinking I would get my hair product.... Maybe putting it in a smaller box or more rapping would work but I&#x27;m still out my hair product....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously purchased this at a salon for 3 times the price!  When they ran out, I decided to look elsewhere. I&#x27;ll never purchase at a salon again. It makes my hair soft and manageable. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product for me due to my hair tangling badly. I was using an over the counter leave in conditioner but my hair looked somewhat greasy using it. It only took a few spritz of Pravana which justifies the cost of it. The tangles that were still there were very easily combed through. I love this product. It&#x27;s a little pricey but just takes a small amount. My granddaughter has hair that tangles super bad and again, sprayed it in her hair and and I was able to easily comb through them all. And it does not make my hair greasy. This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I would encourage anyone to use it who has curly or damaged hair....it is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> This treatment makes my hair feel so soft and it looks healthy. I have long hair so this product did an amazing job when it comes to helping with tangles.</li>
            <li> Works better as a detangler than any other leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff I love how it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and how it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a leave-in conditioner for awhile. The Pravana does a wonderful job on my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!! It has a very nice scent also.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I really love this product for protecting the hair and it smalls nice too.</li>
            <li> Works great and seems to protect the hair from all the blow drying and products.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; detangler for daughters long hair. I never fails. It works, and its not heavy. I barely put any on, start at the bottom of her hair, and wa-la--no problem combing. I love that it comes out in a light mist so that you are not wasting product!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling fantastic and super silky soft. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s relaxed hair that we are growing out, and it nourished and made it much easier to comb out the tangles where the hair has grown out. I used it today and I have thick/wavy/frizzy hair and spent the day in 97 degree heat and 80 percent humidity and my hair was way less frizzy than usual. We really love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is easy to use. Shake and spray. It is light weight on my hair, so it feels like I&#x27;m not wearing any product. Reduces frizz and keep my hair looking healthy. No dead ends when using this product Also, because I have longer hair helps detangles!</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in conditioner.  It&#x27;s better than a lot of more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product feels lightweight and not heavy on the hair. . My hair is super soft, shiny and smooth. It smells delicious but not overwhelming!  Being  super pale blonde, I avoid yellow or colored products but  I love that the color is light blue and seems to actually cool my blonde a bit more which I LOVE!! A+ Pravana!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but I definitely noticed a difference! My hair is wavy and thick and it has been thru a lot of coloring (blue, purple, bleached, natural, ombra) because  of my love for colors my hair has lost its shine, softness and ia a bit crunchy. This made my hair look and feel soft.  I&#x27;ll update after I use it longer</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I treat frequently so it is prone to being dried out and frizzy.  This spray is amazing.  It helps to condition my hair without leaving it greasy or bogged down.  I can go from straw to silk in less than a week using it twice a day.  Loyal customer!</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. It makes my curly hair very soft and easy to manage. It also makes blow drying my hair very easy.</li>
            <li> Product inside is great.  However the spray bottle would not work.  Had to purchase a separate bottle to put it in to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> It works just as intended.  I was told how great this is by a friend.  Once I tried it I will always have it around. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It makes your hair soft and manageable. Everybody should use it.</li>
            <li> As an Afican-American woman with natural 4A-C hair, I often use this as a detangler and my daughter, who is also natural, uses it as a leave-in.  I usually put it in a spray bottle with a tad bit more water when re-twisting my hair in the evening before I add an oil.  It always leaves it soft and moisturized, especially on the 4C part!  I use other natural haircare products that contribute, but this is in my haircare regimen and works well.  No dryness or brittleness.</li>
            <li> Love Pravana leave in treatment. Thanks to my hairdresser for introducing me to this product.</li>
            <li> Shipped right away, came packaged very well, even wrapped in a plastic bag in case it leaked. I use this every day!</li>
            <li> I love this product. my hair has always been dry especially the ends( due to coloring,blow drying and curling) this product makes my hair feel and look healthier.</li>
            <li> I like just about everything about this product.  The sprayer is much easier to use than standard bottles, just make sure to shake up before using because it separates in the bottle.  Other than that, it&#x27;s awesome and is a great leave-in and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this product and would give it alone 5 stars.  However, when I received this, it was packaged extremely poorly.  The bottle was wrapped in a plastic bag with scotch tape and placed in a thin and flimsy cardboard envelope.  This resulted in the bottle leaking product all over the packaging and leaving without a full bottle.  Not worth me paying to send it back, but still really disappointing considering the price of this product.</li>
            <li> Recommended: I have long dry gray hair and this is good but I like The hair product it&#x27;s a 10 even better.</li>
            <li> I love this product however I will not purchase from this store again. I gave a low rating the first time due to the fact that when I received the product it was leaking and that the sprayer top was broken. I had to transplant what was left of the product into another spray bottle so I could use what was left in the bottle. I was contacted by the store and asked if I would take down my review and they would replace my order. I did and still have not received the replacement product. This was before Christmas. Would not order from here unless you want to get half of what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This spray in conditioner is my go to detangler for my coarse hair. It feels light, doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down, yet does a stellar job of making my hair easier to comb through. I have coarse, long, color treated hair that can feel like a tumbleweed after shampooing but this product helps so much I don&#x27;t mind wet combing my hair anymore. It gives a nice shine to the hair as well, and unlike other detanglers I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or make my hair get dirty faster. It&#x27;s particularly helpful if you have split ends, or ends that \\&quot;snap\\&quot; when you comb out your hair. It smells nice &amp; fresh too.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I was satisfied with the cost as well as the performance of the products.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I have really long hair and it helps keep tangles under control.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the scent of this product and purchased it from my hair salon.  This product give my hair the worst static ever!  I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> awesome product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, on days that I don&#x27;t condition my hair I use this and it makes my hair soft and manageable.  Bonus is the nice scent it has to it.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in product, and it have tried many different ones.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and smooth. And my hair stays tangle free.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Have been using it for years.  Have naturally curly, Frizzy hair and this stuff is magic!  Shipping was awesome and arrived in great condition and on time.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser, Makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t weight it down!  I have Been using it for 2 years!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and I color it.  Pravana has saved me from flyaway frizzlies and it doesn&#x27;t weigh  my hair down like other products.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This product make combing my hair a breeze.  You don&#x27;t have to put too much, because too much wiegh your hair down.  a little bit goes a long way.  If used with prevana silk degrees shine serum, you will get great results.</li>
            <li> Made my hair too soft!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because my hair salon used it and it smelled so amazing!! It makes my hair extremely soft and is a great therapy treatment.  I will definately be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> The packaging wasnt good at all. Im suprised it arrived in tact. It was in an evelope half its size and taped. The top half of the bottle was sticking out.The trigger luckly wasnt broken, but anyone couldve tampered with it. Otherwise, I love this product, have used it for a while &amp; the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it.. however  the shipping is the worst. it arrived in a soggy box .. the bottle had broken at the base of the sprayer and the contents were all over. they had taken the bottle and put it in a plastic bag and added one air pillow...ONE... which supplied no cushioning .. so it broke and the bag didn&#x27;t hold the contents... ya, I could have returned it or filed with FEDEX and I meant to but didn&#x27;t get to it..so what a waste of money.. and way to go FEDEX for leaving a soggy box on my frontt stoop..</li>
            <li> The was recommeded to me by my hair stylist. She had been using it on my hair for a while to give it some extra protection. I&#x27;m african-american with relaxed hair so it&#x27;s important to try to keep it healthly.</li>
            <li> I am reordering this product, I used to get it in the salon but not anymore. It ships quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. The only thing is I wish the packaging was a little more secure from spilling.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in. Smells amazing. Best product i own. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If there were to be a contest for the most tangled, hard-to-comb hair in the world - I would win. Seriously - there would be NO competition. I&#x27;m not sure why I have the world&#x27;s most tangled, hard-to-comb hair, but I guess we all have a cross to bear, and if this is my one imperfection in life, well, I guess it&#x27;s better than what I COULD be suffering from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with this affliction is trying to find a hairdresser that will work with me...and it was actually at my hairdresser&#x27;s suggestion that I try this product. I was skeptical. I have lived with my affliction for over 50 years, and had yet to find anything that helped ease the pain of brushing my hair....However, I dutifully purchased a bottle - and was shocked...SHOCKED...to discover that this product actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my shower, I spray a tiny bit on my wet hair, and my pick/comb glides effortlessly through my hair....Angels sing, birds chirp, and my scalp is gloriously happy that I am not yanking my hair out, bit by bit. Life is now good in my world, and even my hairdresser is happy. And women know - you ALWAYS want to keep your hairdresser happy.....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months now and it is the only product that I have found that helps me to comb through my very long hair! I have even recommend this product to friends, family and stylists. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love how this conditions my hair and it smells great, but it makes me itch like crazy if it gets on my skin.  Not sure what the offending ingredient is, since I use other Pravana products without any issues.</li>
            <li> i love this product.  I really need it for my unruly hair.  My only concern was it leaked a tiny bit  in the bag because it didn&#x27;t have a cap for the nozzle.  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t come with a cap, although the last one I owned had a cap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.  Does not weigh down hair, but works to manage my dry hair</li>
            <li> I rated this a 4 because there are better products out there, but this is definitely great for the money.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and would recommend to anyone in the market.</li>
            <li> So far my hair has been so conditioned with this leave in therapy. I absolutely love it! My salon specialist recommended it to me and she was right it does it&#x27;s job. My hair has grown beautifully without having to work about taking out a chunk of hair do to split ends and dry damaged hair. Absolutely love it. Buy also the CHI Keratin (not spray) I use it often and forget what it&#x27;s called. They sell it at ULTA and it&#x27;s made wonders no more puffy hair and I love the scent of it also. Back to Pravana it smells so good also. Shake Shake Shake and spray, tada, works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair, and it is extremely difficult for me to get a comb through it after a shower without any product. I had been using the same product for years when suddenly it was discontinued. I thought I&#x27;d never find something that worked as well on my hair (I had gone through many trial-and-error experiences to even settle on a product), but my hairdresser recommended Prava Intense Therapy Leave-In Treatment. It works WONDERS! Just a few sprays and a comb will easily glide through my hair--plus, it smells wonderful. I had difficulty with the original bottle/sprayer, so I just transferred the product to a different spray bottle. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great leave-in conditioner that leaves my hair silky and soft.  It works great when I straighten my hair, but leaves curls a little limp (always the case with intense conditioners)</li>
            <li> After being completely amazed with the Pravana perfection Trio product to straighten and soften my Brillo unruly hair, I wanted to find a leave in treatment that wasn&#x27;t heavy, filmy or matting the hair down. This intense leave in therapy treatment was the answer. A few sprays and tangle free combing was immediately my experience. It&#x27;s even by its amino acids makeup making a big difference in my hair shine and texture. Was so impressed I bought 3 more bottles and have one to a lady friend who is also a fanatic about her hair and she to was amazed.</li>
            <li> this product changes the feel of my newly shampooed hair from dry and tangled to manageable &amp; untangled with a few sprays.  I still add other products to my hair but this helps me get that ugly dryness out.</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes my hair nice and smooth and easy to detangle :) - I recommend it</li>
            <li> This product works like magic.  Makes your hair soft, healthy looking and it smells good also.</li>
            <li> Love the product packaging was bad and lost some product in transit</li>
            <li> This product is great!! I use a straightening iron on my hair-it has protected it from becoming dry and damaged. This is a must have product for my hair-I love the softness of my hair that only comes from using this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair that tends to dry out if I don&#x27;t condition it regularly. I use the Pravana hydrating shampoo and conditioner and then I use this when I get out of the shower. What a difference! It&#x27;s also a terrific detangler. I spray some on my two year old daughter&#x27;s hair before I brush it and there are no tears or \\&quot;Ouches\\&quot;. The comb slides through easily. Hair does no appear greasy  or look wet once it dries. I love love love this!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome detangler/ hair treatment. I have been using it for a while now, it&#x27;s non-gunky and works amazing. I have long hair, and it definitely made a difference for me in combing my hair right after I wash it. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It does not leave a heavy residue, and has many proteins in it which is good for the hair. I would recommend this for a friend but if your hair has been died numerous times, you might need something stronger.</li>
            <li> Had it not smelled so darn bad :(&lt;br /&gt;I actually had to throw it away the other day, after failing to ever use it because I just couldn&#x27;t take the smell lingering on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s such a strong scent, and nothing quite gets rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;The scent it like pouring cough syrup on your head. Robitussin smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d like it, really.</li>
            <li> Mi hair is dark brown and curly, I used to have highlights, now I have ombre hair. I have used brands like Alter Ego, Kerastase, Salerm, Morocanoil, etc.... and this is by far the best leave in I have ever purchased. I live in a very humid island and this product leaves my hair soft and shiny, no matter the wheather. I will definitely buy this product again. It smells a little strong once you spray it on the hair, however once I blowdry the smells desapairs.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009HIFRY Pravana Intense Therapy Leave-In Treatment 10.1oz]]  WONDERFUL PRODUCT! No heavy or gooey product.  It keeps my wife&#x27;s hair shinny and smells very good. This is a terrific leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> Love this product had hard time find it before I desided to look on the internet for it.  Good price and fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, my wife use this product for her hair. She tryed to buy in a mall store, but is is too expensive</li>
            <li> Great moisture but not heavy.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have bought it many times from my hairstylist. But the pump arrived broken and I cannot use it.  I need a replacement pump.&lt;br /&gt;How do I go about that?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Would have been nice if u would have sent correct product....very in happy customer</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is fabulous!  You can use as little or as much as you want.  It does NOT leave any kind of residue in your hair.  You will not even notice it there.  If you have children (particularly girls) that have hair that is terrible to comb out - THIS IS A MUST!  The products made for kids always seem to leave the hair greasy/yucky feeling.  This will not.  Try it!</li>
            <li> Love it...Great product for myself and my kids right out of the shower. Also helps with damage from chlorine in the pool. Would buy again and again. Plus it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years but recently have not been able to buy it at my hair salon. I am so glad I found it on Amazon! I ordered the leave-in treatment and within 24 hours my bottle had shipped. I received it within the week and am so pleased with my purchase. I definitely recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis.  I was so happy to see it on AMazon so I ordered, but what upset me was I received it broken.</li>
            <li> It really did a great job detangling my hair, actually better than most other products I have tried. I like how it makes my hair feel soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing treatment.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this product after showering to detangle my very knotty hair. It is fantastic! The comb slides right though with no problems. I have also noticed that my typically dry hair (bottle blond) has benefited from the use of this product also. Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> ordered for a friend this is what I should have ordered for myself</li>
            <li> Product smells great, and does not leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy.  Bought this because I recently had my hair chemically straightened and want to keep it as shiny as possible.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using Pravana for years. It was out of stock and no other product we tried was as good. It is in new packaging now. It leaves your hair shiny and manageable and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything and every product to get my hair detangled after I shower this is the only product to work and bonus it&#x27;s all natural and highly helping my hair !</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> On the first try, I am so impressed with this product!  It eliminated the frizzies, made my hair soft and shiny, a breeze to comb through and did wonders for brightening my blonde hair color.  No brassiness.  I have fine hair and it feels moisturized without being weighed down at all.  GSM shipped really fast, too.  This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me! I have just bleached my hair and was looking for something &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; but this isn&#x27;t it! It really didn&#x27;t help with smoothing or detangling, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this, I much prefer &#x27;it&#x27;s a 10&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Works great. Not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> Best way to order so many products. It arrived on time and still the same awesome product. Will always order this way.</li>
            <li> a bit expensive for the product, and if you have to pay shipping it is very expensive, I am sure you can buy something of equal quality or better in the store</li>
            <li> I have profoundly damaged hair from my love of changing my hair color &amp; avid use of bleach - I often use neon Manic Panic colors which require bleaching beforehand. This is the first Pravana product I have tried and I am very impressed. It feels very light but is very conditioning. I actually used it while I was coloring my roots to keep the ends moist &amp; conditioned and it was light enough to do this, and it is deep treating enough for dry styling on the days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair. I find it very comparable to Aveda brilliance conditioner spray, which is what I bought it to replace. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;shine spray&amp;#34; but an instant and leave in conditioner that definitely feels like it is repairing or at least temporarily sealing the damaged ends, and adding smoothness to rough areas. I imagine it would be a great detangler for long hair. Make sure to shake it before spraying.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it after I shampoo and condition, when hair is damp also before I use my hot irons. I highly recommend this amazing product. It has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave-in treatment on the market. I will continue to buy it as long as I can  find it. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is the best leave-in conditioner my wife has ever used. Safe for Keratin treated hair. Just be sure to shake well before spraying.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It does wonders getting tangles out. I use it after my husband and I go riding on the motorcycle and my hair is a mess. I spray a little in my hair and it is tangle free. The product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy afterwards either.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does wonder for my hair! I like to dye my hair and this product has brought my hair back to life!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the kids and me. It detangles hair and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product after my hairdresser used it on my dry, curly hair. Leaves my hair feeling silky soft without weighing it down. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that tangles easily. I have used many, many conditioning products and frankly this is the easiest and the best. I shampoo, towel dry and spritz on  Pravana. It keeps my hair healthy, shiny and smells good, too.  I&#x27;m staying with this one!</li>
            <li> Okay, I have tried MANY hair products from low-end to high-end. I have fine (naturally dark brown that is turning gray) hair. My hairstylist bleached the top of my hair a beautiful blonde with peekaboo brown (blonde on top brown underneath). I loved how silky and soft my hair felt after she dried and straight ironed it. I asked her what she used and this was it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if anyone has ever had their hair bleached you know it will change the texture of your hair. My fine hair went from limp and dull to limp and frizzy (after the bleach). I spritz this in my hair after washing and conditioning with Joico shampoo and conditioner. I towel dry first to get more product and spray (it doesn&#x27;t take a lot) but if I do spray a lot it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. That is a first! It is a great detangler. I know you&#x27;re not supposed to comb your hair when it&#x27;s wet or damp, but this product allows me to as my comb just glides through. It makes drying my hair a breeze and I happen to LOVE the smell. It&#x27;s a clean fresh smell. After drying I straight iron. My hair is noticeably healthier than before I even bleached it! It feels so silky and soft. Sometimes I catch myself running my fingers through my hair and I have to stop. It feels that good. Everyone comments on how great my hair looks and even asks for my stylist. Okay, I owe the awesome color to my stylist but this product is the secret weapon to silky smooth hair that does not weigh hair down. I purchase mine at my local Ulta store.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, detangles great!  I use on my little girl&#x27;s hair all the time and makes it much easier to brush.</li>
            <li> My wife believes its the best</li>
            <li> Love this product great price</li>
            <li> For those of us with combination hair. Curly, thick and tangled after washing. This is the product for you. I use this for my daughter and it is the best product ever. As soon as you spray it on you can spear the tangles with your hands. We call this hair magic in our house. I love this product. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> Good product for curly dry hair. Detangles well. Smell is nice but strong, the method of dispensing was worthless it worked much better when I poured it in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I no longer need conditioner for my hair.  Wish it came in a bigger size bottle!</li>
