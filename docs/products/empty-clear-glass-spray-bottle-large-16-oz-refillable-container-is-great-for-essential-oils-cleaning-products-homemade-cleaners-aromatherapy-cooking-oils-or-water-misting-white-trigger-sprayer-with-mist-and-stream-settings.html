            <li>I make my own household cleaners and love these spray bottles for my blends.</li>
            <li>It is a very fine, airy mist.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little bottle for my homemade organic cleaners and the customer service from Sally&#x27;s was top-notch.</li>
            <li>Thought might be able to use as a sprayer for olive oil, sprayer unit didn&#x27;t seem suitable.</li>
            <li>Love the sprayer.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Love the quality of these sprayers.</li>

            <li>If i have any issues with the replacement sprayer, i will update my review &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you don&#x27;t mind spending more money to replace the spray head</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>love these bottles ...</li>
            <li>Came on time in good condition and works great for my essential oil cleaning spray.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now ordered two of these bottles, and I absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be adding even more to my home cleaning collection.</li>
            <li>I ordered two and while I love the glass bottles, both nozzles stopped working almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get to start my project as planned, but I&#x27;m pleased with product.</li>
            <li>Lovely bottles.  </li>
            <li>Awesome spray bottle for keeping essential oils disinfectants in!</li>
            <li>from these sellers, and am always pleased with product and service.  </li>
            <li>We have not had any issues with the bottles and will continue to purchase more as we need them.</li>
            <li>Most spray bottles out there are made out of plastic.</li>
            <li>So part of the reason why I purchased this product is because it comes with a glass bottle :)</li>
            <li>much better than flimsy plastic ones</li>
            <li>and I was able to use them for my homemade household cleaning products.</li>
            <li>The replacement product has yet to break, but even if it did, I am confident that the company would intervene again.</li>
            <li>I Never thought I would say that about a spray bottle filled with cleaning solution!  </li>
            <li>I love the mist option.  </li>
            <li>I love using glass bottles instead of plastic</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great looking bottle.</li>
            <li>In my effort to stop using plastic, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>Aesthetically, this bottle gets five stars because it looks so much nicer on the counter top than a plastic bottle and of course, it&#x27;s great not to use the plastic...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already purchased more.</li>
            <li>Easy to spray, easy to fill, attractive sitting out on vanity for quick use.</li>
            <li>Will do more business with Sally&#x27;s Organics.”</li>
            <li>This glass bottle is better than most I&#x27;ve seen in the stores.</li>
            <li>love that they are glass.</li>
            <li>Love this glass bottle.  </li>
            <li>I could have found many spray containers at Wal-Mart but they would all be plastic.</li>
            <li>Will be buying many more.</li>
            <li>Love these bottles for my homemade cleaners and spraying my cloth items with lavender water.</li>
            <li>I am excited to make my own homemade air freshener spray.</li>
            <li>The glass bottle is great - highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The first two months it was functional and I loved it, though.   </li>
            <li>I loved it at first</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and was nicely packed.  </li>
            <li>and so far they are working great.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that there was free shipping for Prime members.</li>
            <li>Glass and plastic nozzle seem like good quality and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The item was extremely well packaged and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>That was great customer service, and so far so good with the new nozzles.</li>
            <li>It was easy to fill and use as well.</li>
            <li>The spray on the grill racks is to keep the meat from sticking to the grill and the spray on the smoker rack and pan is for easy cleanup and to keep meat from sticking.</li>
            <li>Also when I had a defective sprayer, it was replaced very quickly.</li>
            <li>They were amazing for the first week.</li>
            <li>The company contacted me about my problem, gave me a full refund, AND told me they&#x27;d send me another top for the bottle.</li>
            <li>I give this item 5 stars as the replacement has worked fine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the glass bottle is fine.</li>
            <li>This worked fine for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>The nozzle is fine.  </li>
            <li>If you do order it, I really hope you have better luck than I did with it!  </li>
            <li>This one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>So now I buy 16oz glass bottles of vinegar for around a dollar and a cheap spray bottle at the dollars store.  </li>
            <li>I had two plastic spray containers filled with cleaning liquid and the trigger on both sprayers broke.</li>
            <li>I filled this glass spray bottle with the cleaning liquid and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>This bottle is perfect, I will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>Works great for my essential oil cleansers.</li>
            <li>These glass bottles are great, just what I need for use with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>The bottles and sprayers work great for my essential oil concoctions.</li>
            <li>the sprayers fit well and work nicely, they were packed very well</li>
            <li>original review rated this item 2 stars because of the sprayer breaking.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for :-))).</li>
            <li>I use it with vinegar and lemon oil to clean my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I came back and bought another after months of great use from my first one.</li>
            <li>Nice size for homemade natural cleaners.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢glass bottle is good for essential oils&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you do order it, I really hope you have better luck than I did with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sally&#x27;s Organics communicated with me quickly &amp; efficiently.</li>
            <li>Quick service.</li>
            <li>Was sent a replacement sprayer head shortly after this review was written and was contacted by a representative of Sally&#x27;s Organics to make sure everything is okay.</li>
            <li>Nice thick glass bottle with good sprayer.</li>
            <li>Quick ship and just as described</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>The bottle holds enough to spray foliar plant food on all my plants, too, so I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the product long, but they seem surprisingly sturdy.</li>
            <li>I ordered two initially, and once I received my order,  I quickly ordered three more!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good size, perfect for homemade household cleaners, and other various essential oil sprays.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!  </li>
            <li>The spray bottles are very comfortable to hold and not heavy.</li>
            <li>The sprayer is fantastic and the bottle/sprayer seems to be very well made.  </li>
            <li>Love the glass - not lightweight, but not heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you want your money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you want your money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I ordered one of these to keep fresh water in for food applications in my kitchen.</li>
            <li>So the plastic spraying mechanism rarely stays in place.  </li>
            <li>Not only are they nice looking, but they are functional as well.  </li>
            <li>but I think a sprayer should last more than 3 months of light use.</li>
            <li>A Product well worth the price as the convenience it bring saves time and resources .</li>
            <li>exactly as described...shipped quickly...</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>and we thought we might end up replacing them pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>right.  </li>
            <li>Also, the trigger pressure is &#x27;juuust right&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I opted for the replacement, which they sent right away.</li>
            <li>and if you have any issues, they work with you right away.</li>
            <li>Simple, effective and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>but the new spray head doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li>but the new spray head doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li>I could not find my previous review to edit it, but I wanted to write an update: I loved receiving this sturdy glass bottle but the sprayer head was defective.</li>
            <li>only one works now (that&#x27;s used very, very lightly).</li>
            <li>The top was constantly clogging, and all I ever put in it is vinegar.</li>
            <li>This spray bottle was exactly as described and just what I needed.  </li>
            <li>The bottle itself is pretty durable, but the sprayer keeps coming untwisted.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Sprayer broke from bottle after first use.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s pretty well the case with any sprayer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bummed about that!</li>
            <li>I definitely will purchase more</li>
            <li>exactly as described and what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order several more.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it regularly ever since (for the past 6+ months) and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly on time; the product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>size is difficult so was very happy with these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just try to find another spray trigger to work with the bottle, especially since we paid a lot more for the glass bottle vs. a cheaper plastic one.</li>
            <li>Will probably be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a quality spray bottle with a good sprayer.</li>
            <li>Sally&#x27;s Organics was kind enough to send me what promises to be a new and improved spray trigger.</li>
            <li>My wife was very excited that I bought this for her until about a week later when the nozzle stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Great for lemon essential oil with water and using to clean with instead of harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>These are really great, really substantial thick glass</li>
            <li>Filled with shower spray and sits right outside the shower door.</li>
            <li>I loved this glass bottle and used it about once a week for the past 3 months with a vinegar water solution.</li>
            <li>I would certainly use this vendor again.</li>
            <li>and I will continue the Adventure of the White Vinegar Sprayer when I receive the new top.</li>
            <li>These bottles have two spray options, one being a stream and the other a very very fine mist.</li>
            <li>Ordered 2, 1 was fine, the second worked for 5 minutes and the sprayer started leaking.</li>
            <li>It was a little pricey, but for the durability it has given, it was well worth it and better than the plastic ones i purchased-thinking they were glass.</li>
            <li>The sprayer is perfect....gives a nice spray---not too much, not too little but juuuust</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve updated my experience to 4 stars because I really appreciate personable companies who care about their customers and take responsibility for their products.</li>
            <li>[I have several &amp; none of them fit this bottle...]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had these a few days, but I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality, especially the nozzle portion.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, well-packaged bottle.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just got a defective one to begin with, but I highly recommend this product if you can get it!</li>
            <li>This is so much nicer than the plastic spray bottles that looks worn and tatty after awhile.</li>
            <li>I really like this bottle</li>
            <li>Two weeks of light usage as a white vinegar sprayer the plastic spray mechanism no longer works.  </li>
            <li>Much appreciated</li>
            <li>The spray works very well</li>
            <li>Very well packaged so arrived in tact and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product as described.</li>
            <li>The item I ordered was delivered fast and it was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>There is something about real glass that pleases me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care much about the constituents of plastics leaching into anything liquid.</li>
            <li>“Love the spray bottles only used 16 oz clear one.</li>
            <li>The new sprayer arrived at our old address [delivery service left it at the door so it wasn&#x27;t able to be forwarded by the rental office].</li>
            <li>: I am still using the glass portion with a new spray head, [I have several &amp; none of them fit this bottle...]</li>
            <li>“It&#x27;s the perfect size, just big enough and not too small that I would have to keep making new solutions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for only a few days, so will have to wait before I change the rating to five stars, but it&#x27;s working great so far, so</li>
            <li>Much to my amazement the company Sally&#x27;s Organics is sending me a new one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the bottles, (trying to get away from the plastic world we live in)</li>
            <li>It sprays easily, and it is everything that I expected.</li>
            <li>My shipment arrived quickly, and I will definitely order from Sally&#x27;s Organics again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality glass bottles, not too delicate or fragile.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Thick glass and the spray nozzle is not only sturdy but very firm fitting to my hand which is very useful in a nice grip since the glass is heavier then plastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you want to use his spray bottle for more than a few months of</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T Recommend if: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you want to use his spray bottle for more than a few months of</li>
            <li>I love the bottle itself but the spray stopped working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Can wait to make some fun room sprays with my essential oils!</li>
            <li>Note: I am still using the glass portion with a new spray head,</li>
            <li>Sally&#x27;s Organics responded and are sending a new sprayer.  </li>
            <li>and they said they would send me a new one.</li>
            <li>Sally&#x27;s read my review and sent me a new set of nozzles for the bottles I still had.</li>
            <li>*update- new sprayer was sent and this one works</li>
            <li>It is thick and durable with a good solid spray.</li>
            <li>These bottles are truly pretty enough to leave out!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was just as I expected.</li>
            <li>Bottle is fine but sprayer stopped working after a few uses.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s made of plastic, it has a hard time gripping onto the glass grooves at the opening of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not too hard to find a fitting replacement head, but I don&#x27;t have the time or money to waste looking for a proper fitting one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not too hard to find a fitting replacement head, but I don&#x27;t have the time or money to waste looking for a proper fitting one.</li>
            <li>no problems so far.</li>
            <li>Today, however, the spray handle is completely locked and will NOT work ----</li>
            <li>I use them near the sink.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already been replacing my cleaners with all natural ones in these.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this purchase.</li>
            <li>I was worried that it might be too heavy once filled</li>
            <li>Bottles arrived on time, well packaged, and so far they work well.</li>
            <li>I use it for mixing natural cleaning products/essential oils.</li>
            <li>I only use the spay and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Great customer service and the product works well the second time around--I think it was just bad luck the first time.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy glass bottle that&#x27;s big enough to hold any type of cleaning product that you need.</li>
            <li>There is a major problem with the spray bottle nozzle unit ----</li>
            <li>I swapped out the sprayer from an old plastic one I had and that&#x27;s been working, but I shouldn&#x27;t need to replace an entire component.</li>
            <li>I am using these with my Young Living Essential Oils for home cleaning and room freshening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, and just with water in it, but it worked well.  </li>
            <li>After I wrote a review to this effect several months back, the company contacted me and sent a new, functional head.</li>
            <li>But I wrote a very negative review and was contacted by a representative of Sally&#x27;s Organics who promised me a Full Refund and said that they were sending me a new spray mechanism!  </li>
            <li>Unlike some other bottles that I&#x27;ve bought, that break on the first day, this one&#x27;s lasting well and feels like it will for awhile to come.</li>
            <li>It does a wide fine mist fan spray as well as a targeted heavy stream spray.</li>
            <li>There is not too much that can be said about a glass spray bottle other than that it works just the way it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>Other than that they work very well.</li>
            <li>The first spray bottle I received stopped working after only a few weeks of use (the spray nozzle just completely stopped functioning).</li>
            <li>easily [the sprayer only lasted a few months with light use; filled with half vinegar &amp; half water to spray small kitchen counter 2-3 times a week before sprayer broke]&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢unreliable, therefore not worth the money</li>
            <li>but it is only a bit heavier than a regular cleaning bottle so you will barely know the difference at all.</li>
            <li>The first time the clog problem happened a few weeks after the purchase, the nozzle eventually worked after several additional pumps.</li>
            <li>:(    Post #1: So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I use only pure essential oils in my bottles and these hold up well - even with the plastic sprayer, which was previously a concern of mine.</li>

            <li> This is a great little bottle for my homemade organic cleaners and the customer service from Sally&#x27;s was top-notch.</li>
            <li> Thought might be able to use as a sprayer for olive oil, sprayer unit didn&#x27;t seem suitable.</li>

            <li> If i have any issues with the replacement sprayer, i will update my review &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you don&#x27;t mind spending more money to replace the spray head</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> love these bottles ...</li>
            <li> Came on time in good condition and works great for my essential oil cleaning spray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now ordered two of these bottles, and I absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be adding even more to my home cleaning collection.</li>
            <li> I ordered two and while I love the glass bottles, both nozzles stopped working almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to start my project as planned, but I&#x27;m pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Lovely bottles.  </li>
            <li> Awesome spray bottle for keeping essential oils disinfectants in!</li>
            <li> from these sellers, and am always pleased with product and service.  </li>
            <li> We have not had any issues with the bottles and will continue to purchase more as we need them.</li>
            <li> Most spray bottles out there are made out of plastic.</li>
            <li> So part of the reason why I purchased this product is because it comes with a glass bottle :)</li>
            <li> much better than flimsy plastic ones</li>
            <li> and I was able to use them for my homemade household cleaning products.</li>
            <li> The replacement product has yet to break, but even if it did, I am confident that the company would intervene again.</li>
            <li> I Never thought I would say that about a spray bottle filled with cleaning solution!  </li>
            <li> I love the mist option.  </li>
            <li> I love using glass bottles instead of plastic</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great looking bottle.</li>
            <li> In my effort to stop using plastic, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Aesthetically, this bottle gets five stars because it looks so much nicer on the counter top than a plastic bottle and of course, it&#x27;s great not to use the plastic...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased more.</li>
            <li> Easy to spray, easy to fill, attractive sitting out on vanity for quick use.</li>
            <li> Will do more business with Sally&#x27;s Organics.”</li>
            <li> This glass bottle is better than most I&#x27;ve seen in the stores.</li>
            <li> love that they are glass.</li>
            <li> Love this glass bottle.  </li>
            <li> I could have found many spray containers at Wal-Mart but they would all be plastic.</li>
            <li> Will be buying many more.</li>
            <li> Love these bottles for my homemade cleaners and spraying my cloth items with lavender water.</li>
            <li> I am excited to make my own homemade air freshener spray.</li>
            <li> The glass bottle is great - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The first two months it was functional and I loved it, though.   </li>
            <li> I loved it at first</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and was nicely packed.  </li>
            <li> and so far they are working great.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that there was free shipping for Prime members.</li>
            <li> Glass and plastic nozzle seem like good quality and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The item was extremely well packaged and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> That was great customer service, and so far so good with the new nozzles.</li>
            <li> It was easy to fill and use as well.</li>
            <li> The spray on the grill racks is to keep the meat from sticking to the grill and the spray on the smoker rack and pan is for easy cleanup and to keep meat from sticking.</li>
            <li> Also when I had a defective sprayer, it was replaced very quickly.</li>
            <li> They were amazing for the first week.</li>
            <li> The company contacted me about my problem, gave me a full refund, AND told me they&#x27;d send me another top for the bottle.</li>
            <li> I give this item 5 stars as the replacement has worked fine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the glass bottle is fine.</li>
            <li> This worked fine for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle is fine.  </li>
            <li> If you do order it, I really hope you have better luck than I did with it!  </li>
            <li> This one is fantastic.</li>
            <li> So now I buy 16oz glass bottles of vinegar for around a dollar and a cheap spray bottle at the dollars store.  </li>
            <li> I had two plastic spray containers filled with cleaning liquid and the trigger on both sprayers broke.</li>
            <li> I filled this glass spray bottle with the cleaning liquid and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This bottle is perfect, I will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Works great for my essential oil cleansers.</li>
            <li> These glass bottles are great, just what I need for use with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> The bottles and sprayers work great for my essential oil concoctions.</li>
            <li> the sprayers fit well and work nicely, they were packed very well</li>
            <li> original review rated this item 2 stars because of the sprayer breaking.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for :-))).</li>
            <li> I use it with vinegar and lemon oil to clean my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I came back and bought another after months of great use from my first one.</li>
            <li> Nice size for homemade natural cleaners.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢glass bottle is good for essential oils&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do order it, I really hope you have better luck than I did with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s Organics communicated with me quickly &amp; efficiently.</li>
            <li> Quick service.</li>
            <li> Was sent a replacement sprayer head shortly after this review was written and was contacted by a representative of Sally&#x27;s Organics to make sure everything is okay.</li>
            <li> Nice thick glass bottle with good sprayer.</li>
            <li> Quick ship and just as described</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> The bottle holds enough to spray foliar plant food on all my plants, too, so I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long, but they seem surprisingly sturdy.</li>
            <li> I ordered two initially, and once I received my order,  I quickly ordered three more!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good size, perfect for homemade household cleaners, and other various essential oil sprays.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!  </li>
            <li> The spray bottles are very comfortable to hold and not heavy.</li>
            <li> The sprayer is fantastic and the bottle/sprayer seems to be very well made.  </li>
            <li> Love the glass - not lightweight, but not heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you want your money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you want your money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these to keep fresh water in for food applications in my kitchen.</li>
            <li> So the plastic spraying mechanism rarely stays in place.  </li>
            <li> Not only are they nice looking, but they are functional as well.  </li>
            <li> but I think a sprayer should last more than 3 months of light use.</li>
            <li> A Product well worth the price as the convenience it bring saves time and resources .</li>
            <li> exactly as described...shipped quickly...</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> and we thought we might end up replacing them pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> right.  </li>
            <li> Also, the trigger pressure is &#x27;juuust right&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I opted for the replacement, which they sent right away.</li>
            <li> and if you have any issues, they work with you right away.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> but the new spray head doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li> but the new spray head doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li> I could not find my previous review to edit it, but I wanted to write an update: I loved receiving this sturdy glass bottle but the sprayer head was defective.</li>
            <li> only one works now (that&#x27;s used very, very lightly).</li>
            <li> The top was constantly clogging, and all I ever put in it is vinegar.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle was exactly as described and just what I needed.  </li>
            <li> The bottle itself is pretty durable, but the sprayer keeps coming untwisted.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sprayer broke from bottle after first use.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s pretty well the case with any sprayer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bummed about that!</li>
            <li> I definitely will purchase more</li>
            <li> exactly as described and what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order several more.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly ever since (for the past 6+ months) and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly on time; the product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> size is difficult so was very happy with these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just try to find another spray trigger to work with the bottle, especially since we paid a lot more for the glass bottle vs. a cheaper plastic one.</li>
            <li> Will probably be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a quality spray bottle with a good sprayer.</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s Organics was kind enough to send me what promises to be a new and improved spray trigger.</li>
            <li> My wife was very excited that I bought this for her until about a week later when the nozzle stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Great for lemon essential oil with water and using to clean with instead of harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> These are really great, really substantial thick glass</li>
            <li> Filled with shower spray and sits right outside the shower door.</li>
            <li> I loved this glass bottle and used it about once a week for the past 3 months with a vinegar water solution.</li>
            <li> I would certainly use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> and I will continue the Adventure of the White Vinegar Sprayer when I receive the new top.</li>
            <li> These bottles have two spray options, one being a stream and the other a very very fine mist.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2, 1 was fine, the second worked for 5 minutes and the sprayer started leaking.</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey, but for the durability it has given, it was well worth it and better than the plastic ones i purchased-thinking they were glass.</li>
            <li> The sprayer is perfect....gives a nice spray---not too much, not too little but juuuust</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve updated my experience to 4 stars because I really appreciate personable companies who care about their customers and take responsibility for their products.</li>
            <li> [I have several &amp; none of them fit this bottle...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these a few days, but I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality, especially the nozzle portion.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, well-packaged bottle.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a defective one to begin with, but I highly recommend this product if you can get it!</li>
            <li> This is so much nicer than the plastic spray bottles that looks worn and tatty after awhile.</li>
            <li> I really like this bottle</li>
            <li> Two weeks of light usage as a white vinegar sprayer the plastic spray mechanism no longer works.  </li>
            <li> Much appreciated</li>
            <li> The spray works very well</li>
            <li> Very well packaged so arrived in tact and ready to use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product as described.</li>
            <li> The item I ordered was delivered fast and it was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> There is something about real glass that pleases me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much about the constituents of plastics leaching into anything liquid.</li>
            <li> “Love the spray bottles only used 16 oz clear one.</li>
            <li> The new sprayer arrived at our old address [delivery service left it at the door so it wasn&#x27;t able to be forwarded by the rental office].</li>
            <li> : I am still using the glass portion with a new spray head, [I have several &amp; none of them fit this bottle...]</li>
            <li> “It&#x27;s the perfect size, just big enough and not too small that I would have to keep making new solutions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for only a few days, so will have to wait before I change the rating to five stars, but it&#x27;s working great so far, so</li>
            <li> Much to my amazement the company Sally&#x27;s Organics is sending me a new one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the bottles, (trying to get away from the plastic world we live in)</li>
            <li> It sprays easily, and it is everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> My shipment arrived quickly, and I will definitely order from Sally&#x27;s Organics again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality glass bottles, not too delicate or fragile.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Thick glass and the spray nozzle is not only sturdy but very firm fitting to my hand which is very useful in a nice grip since the glass is heavier then plastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you want to use his spray bottle for more than a few months of</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T Recommend if: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you want to use his spray bottle for more than a few months of</li>
            <li> I love the bottle itself but the spray stopped working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Can wait to make some fun room sprays with my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Note: I am still using the glass portion with a new spray head,</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s Organics responded and are sending a new sprayer.  </li>
            <li> and they said they would send me a new one.</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s read my review and sent me a new set of nozzles for the bottles I still had.</li>
            <li> *update- new sprayer was sent and this one works</li>
            <li> It is thick and durable with a good solid spray.</li>
            <li> These bottles are truly pretty enough to leave out!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Bottle is fine but sprayer stopped working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s made of plastic, it has a hard time gripping onto the glass grooves at the opening of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not too hard to find a fitting replacement head, but I don&#x27;t have the time or money to waste looking for a proper fitting one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not too hard to find a fitting replacement head, but I don&#x27;t have the time or money to waste looking for a proper fitting one.</li>
            <li> no problems so far.</li>
            <li> Today, however, the spray handle is completely locked and will NOT work ----</li>
            <li> I use them near the sink.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already been replacing my cleaners with all natural ones in these.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it might be too heavy once filled</li>
            <li> Bottles arrived on time, well packaged, and so far they work well.</li>
            <li> I use it for mixing natural cleaning products/essential oils.</li>
            <li> I only use the spay and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and the product works well the second time around--I think it was just bad luck the first time.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy glass bottle that&#x27;s big enough to hold any type of cleaning product that you need.</li>
            <li> There is a major problem with the spray bottle nozzle unit ----</li>
            <li> I swapped out the sprayer from an old plastic one I had and that&#x27;s been working, but I shouldn&#x27;t need to replace an entire component.</li>
            <li> I am using these with my Young Living Essential Oils for home cleaning and room freshening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, and just with water in it, but it worked well.  </li>
            <li> After I wrote a review to this effect several months back, the company contacted me and sent a new, functional head.</li>
            <li> But I wrote a very negative review and was contacted by a representative of Sally&#x27;s Organics who promised me a Full Refund and said that they were sending me a new spray mechanism!  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other bottles that I&#x27;ve bought, that break on the first day, this one&#x27;s lasting well and feels like it will for awhile to come.</li>
            <li> It does a wide fine mist fan spray as well as a targeted heavy stream spray.</li>
            <li> There is not too much that can be said about a glass spray bottle other than that it works just the way it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Other than that they work very well.</li>
            <li> The first spray bottle I received stopped working after only a few weeks of use (the spray nozzle just completely stopped functioning).</li>
            <li> easily [the sprayer only lasted a few months with light use; filled with half vinegar &amp; half water to spray small kitchen counter 2-3 times a week before sprayer broke]&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢unreliable, therefore not worth the money</li>
            <li> but it is only a bit heavier than a regular cleaning bottle so you will barely know the difference at all.</li>
            <li> The first time the clog problem happened a few weeks after the purchase, the nozzle eventually worked after several additional pumps.</li>
            <li> :(    Post #1: So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I use only pure essential oils in my bottles and these hold up well - even with the plastic sprayer, which was previously a concern of mine.</li>
            <li> However, this is the exact opposite situation, in that that the bottle is being used to spray vinegar, and given that vinegar can fix deposit clogging, this is the one liquid that would seem to be least likely to cause a clog.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really exactly what I wanted, which is sometimes hard to get via Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a solid glass bottle, but after less than a month of use (and not everyday), the spray trigger stopped working on either of the 2 spray levels.  </li>
            <li> I really miss my spray bottle so am anxiously looking forward to the replacement.  </li>
            <li> however long it may last you</li>
            <li> however long it may last you</li>
            <li> I mentioned it and they sent me a new spritzer well past when that was necessary.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate their kindly response and replacement of the bad part.  </li>
            <li> The spray nozzle jammed up on me the second time that I used it</li>
            <li> Hey, I iron my lines for crying out loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how it holds up to other solutions, like with vinegar or essential oils mixed in water.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, same problem as some other reviewers:</li>
            <li> The sprayers on both of these all of a sudden quit working, within about a 10 days of each other.</li>
            <li> only need it to last maybe a few weeks&lt;</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews stating that the bottle didn&#x27;t spray properly and it only streamed...</li>
            <li> but the sprayer completely stopped working after very little use.</li>
            <li> The trigger only pulls about half way.  </li>
            <li> Both contain water and less than 10 drops of essential oils.</li>
            <li> The spray trigger for the initial bottle failed after a few days, but they quickly provide a replacement.</li>
            <li> While product is a little pricey, you definitely get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely do business with Sally&#x27;s Organics and would recommend this to other family and friends as well as other people!</li>
            <li> It was well wrapped for shipping to prevent damage from rough handling,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggestion: I ended up just using now empty</li>
            <li> I ended up just using now empty</li>
            <li> a few days after my second post.  </li>
            <li> Within a week of using the handle on the spray bottle got jammed and stopped working.</li>
            <li> the glass bottle from my Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar &amp; putting one of my other spray heads on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the glass bottle from my Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar &amp; putting one of my other spray heads on it.  </li>
            <li> I use one for oil to spray on bakes veggies, the other for liquid smoke.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming by the other reviews that the unit must be clogged.  </li>
            <li> I will be replacing the other spray bottles in our house with these.</li>
            <li> Not sure what caused the sudden cessation of use.</li>
            <li> but....I have to rate it three stars because I&#x27;ve had it less than a month</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle for use in the bathroom --- it is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> Glass feels sturdy yet not too heavy.</li>
            <li> When the bottle is not used for a few days, the nozzle appears to become clogged and the spray handle locks up</li>
            <li> Heavy duty glass.</li>
            <li> We ordered a few for my homemade cleaners &amp; for my husband&#x27;s craft brewing projects.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to tell from the photo what quality the spray nozzles would be</li>
            <li> I would like to order a small one around 8 oz.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try small jars for creams.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the replacement actually stays on!</li>
            <li> The sprayer attachment has held up for the past couple months without clogging or any dysfunction.</li>
            <li> can appreciate that this problem might occur if one where using the spray bottle in a city with excessively hard water causing mineral deposits in the nozzle.</li>
            <li> My order was late.</li>
            <li> These are smaller than I expected, and the plastic sprayer sometimes becomes unscrewed from the glass base.</li>
            <li> I posted a negative review, and Sally&#x27;s Organics contacted me almost immediately and offered to either refund my money or send a replacement one.</li>
            <li> Disappointed the nozzle stopped working after only a few uses</li>
            <li> An awful lot of money to spend on something that breaks right away!</li>
            <li> It took very little time for it to become useless.  </li>
            <li> Even BPA plastic is bad because when they take out the BPA they use substitutes that are equally bad if not worse.</li>
            <li> Thank you Sally&#x27;s for standing behind your products.</li>
            <li> and the trigger is already working poorly.    </li>
            <li> I use it to store vinegar to spray my sink with after handling raw chicken to kill germs.”</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these for home-made cleaning solutions and essential oils spider repellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed as these bottles are not cheap.</li>
            <li> After about 3 months, this spray bottle became completely useless.</li>
            <li> but they are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> As of today this spray bottle is useless.  </li>
            <li> Was afraid they might get broke during shipping, but seller packed them well.</li>
            <li> so nothing crazy.</li>

            <li> After about 3 months, this spray bottle became completely useless. The top was constantly clogging, and all I ever put in it is vinegar. I could only use it about twice before it clogged again. The first two months it was functional and I loved it, though.   The company contacted me about my problem, gave me a full refund, AND told me they&#x27;d send me another top for the bottle. I received a response from them within a day, too. I&#x27;ve updated my experience to 4 stars because I really appreciate personable companies who care about their customers and take responsibility for their products. I would buy from Sally&#x27;s Organics again.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle was exactly as described and just what I needed.  It was well wrapped for shipping to prevent damage from rough handling,</li>
            <li> Works great! Love the sprayer. Love the glass - not lightweight, but not heavy. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Filled with shower spray and sits right outside the shower door.</li>
            <li> I love these bottles, great quality</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle for use in the bathroom --- it is a bit heavy but I rather use glass then plastic.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is pretty durable, but the sprayer keeps coming untwisted. I&#x27;ll tighten it, set it on the counter, and within seconds, it&#x27;s loosened itself up without even being touched.</li>
            <li> These bottles arrived quickly and are the perfect size!  Thanks!!  I&#x27;ll be using these for my organic cleaning products and the glass is needed for the essential oils</li>
            <li> Adjustable spray...sturdy glass bottle</li>
            <li> Nice product! Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Great product, use it for my vinegar/water/lemon scent cleaning solution. Glass feels sturdy yet not too heavy. no problems so far.</li>
            <li> Very nice glass spray bottle, perfect for homemade cleaners. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, the plastic spray part is sturdy and works well.</li>
            <li> Love it...exactly as described...shipped quickly...I will definitely be shopping from Sally&#x27;s Organics again.</li>
            <li> Love these bottles! Bought three and no issues with any of them.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the quality of these sprayers. Very pleased with my purchase :-))</li>
            <li> There is a major problem with the spray bottle nozzle unit ---- When the bottle is not used for a few days, the nozzle appears to become clogged and the spray handle locks up ---- This problem occurs regardless of whether the nozzle is placed in the stream or mist position. The first time the clog problem happened a few weeks after the purchase, the nozzle eventually worked after several additional pumps. Today, however, the spray handle is completely locked and will NOT work ---- The spray bottle is now totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can appreciate that this problem might occur if one where using the spray bottle in a city with excessively hard water causing mineral deposits in the nozzle. However, this is the exact opposite situation, in that that the bottle is being used to spray vinegar, and given that vinegar can fix deposit clogging, this is the one liquid that would seem to be least likely to cause a clog.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my essential oil blends! Great shipping, delivery time, pricing, and product. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Nice size for homemade natural cleaners. Used for a homemade Thieves cleaner.  Worked well for several months then stopped working; Sally&#x27;s Organics replaced at no charge.  Great customer service</li>
            <li> This bottle worked great for about 2 weeks and then the sprayer quit. I was using it for homemade Fruit/Veggie Wash (1 cup water, 2 tbsp vinegar, and 2 tbsp lemon). I swapped out the sprayer from an old plastic one I had and that&#x27;s been working, but I shouldn&#x27;t need to replace an entire component.</li>
            <li> -----------------------------UPDATED REVIEW 3/27/2015-----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review rated this item 2 stars because of the sprayer breaking. After posting my review, I was contact via email by Sally&#x27;s Organics the NEXT DAY apologizing for my problems with the sprayer, &amp; sent me a replacement sprayer head! [I bought this item 10/22/2014, 4-5 months ago]. I had moved since then, my address was updated on Amazon, but it didn&#x27;t enter my mind to ask if they had my updated address. The new sprayer arrived at our old address [delivery service left it at the door so it wasn&#x27;t able to be forwarded by the rental office]. Sally&#x27;s Organics communicated with me quickly &amp; efficiently. When they found out what haaddressed they replacement they sent, they sent me one to my current address! i am so very impressed at the level of attention &amp; care this company gives their customers to ensure satisfaction. I am now happily using my bottle with the replacement sprayer &#x3D;) I give this item 5 stars as the replacement has worked fine. We will see how it holds up, in time. If i have any issues with the replacement sprayer, i will update my review &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM FROM SALLY&#x27;S ORGANICS, a company WHO stands behinds their products to ensure customer satisfaction!!!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW 3/2/2015-----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢nice glass&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢sprays nice even mist&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢glass bottle is good for essential oils&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢has 2 spray options, mist &amp; stream&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢sprayer feet sturdy &amp; fits snug well on bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢breaks easily [the sprayer only lasted a few months with light use; filled with half vinegar &amp; half water to spray small kitchen counter 2-3 times a week before sprayer broke]&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢unreliable, therefore not worth the money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend IF:&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you only need it to last maybe a few weeks&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you don&#x27;t mind spending more money to replace the spray head&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you are willing to take the risk that yours may or may not last past the return/refund period&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T Recommend if:&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you want to use his spray bottle for more than a few months of however long it may last you&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you want your money&#x27;s worth&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢you don&#x27;t want the hassle of a return &amp; refund&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am still using the glass portion with a new spray head, [I have several &amp; none of them fit this bottle...] but the new spray head doesn&#x27;t fit right &amp; it leaks whenever I shake or tilt it.

Suggestion: I ended up just using now empty the glass bottle from my Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar &amp; putting one of my other spray heads on it.

            <li> Love this item. It sprays easily, and it is everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use instead of a plastic spray bottle.  Looks great and works wonderfully.  Think I&#x27;ll buy a couple more!</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these to keep fresh water in for food applications in my kitchen. It is perfect. I had one difficulty, which was that I dropped it on the floor and broke the sprayer head. Much to my amazement the company Sally&#x27;s Organics is sending me a new one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great company!</li>
            <li> I love the way this sprayer works so well!</li>
            <li> Ordered 2, 1 was fine, the second worked for 5 minutes and the sprayer started leaking.</li>
            <li> what you would expect it to be</li>
            <li> i love this spray bottle! It is glass, which works well for my home made essential oil cleaner. It is thick and durable with a good solid spray. It was a little pricey, but for the durability it has given, it was well worth it and better than the plastic ones i purchased-thinking they were glass.</li>
            <li> Sprayer broke from bottle after first use.  Very cheap sprayer nozzle, nice glass bottle.</li>
            <li> love these bottles ...I use them near the sink.  I have won with bleach water and a blue one for all purpose cleanser...very handy and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Came on time in good condition and works great for my essential oil cleaning spray.  The only thing I&#x27;ve found as I&#x27;ve been using it more is that it is difficult to get the last 1/4 of liquid out of the bottle if you&#x27;re tipping the bottle at all but that&#x27;s pretty well the case with any sprayer.  Solid glass construction.</li>
            <li> feels like something Gramma would use - in a good way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now ordered two of these bottles, and I absolutely love them.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be adding even more to my home cleaning collection.</li>
            <li> I ordered two and while I love the glass bottles, both nozzles stopped working almost immediately. I&#x27;m really bummed about that!</li>
            <li> “Love the spray bottles only used 16 oz clear one. I will order again I would like to order a small one around 8 oz. My order was late. I didn&#x27;t get to start my project as planned, but I&#x27;m pleased with product. Can&#x27;t wait to try small jars for creams. Thank you”</li>
            <li> Well made and looks great too!  Perfect for my homemade cleaners.</li>
            <li> Terrific service and product just as pictured and&lt;br /&gt;described. Very satisfied with this seller.</li>
            <li> Sprayer stopped working after several uses.  Disappointed.  Otherwise, the glass bottle is fine.</li>
            <li> Post #3:Here we are....a few days after my second post.  Sally&#x27;s Organics responded and are sending a new sprayer.  I appreciate their kindly response and replacement of the bad part.  I really miss my spray bottle so am anxiously looking forward to the replacement.  Thank you Sally&#x27;s for standing behind your products. I changed the rating from 1 star to 3 stars.  Blessings.    Post #2: The day after I posted, the trigger quit working.  ARGH!  I don&#x27;t believe it.:(    Post #1: So far, so good.  I use it to spray my fruit and veggies with home made cleaning solution.  The sprayer is perfect....gives a nice spray---not too much, not too little but juuuust right.  Also, the trigger pressure is &#x27;juuust right&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Great product. The top secures nicely &amp; it&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing. Love it!</li>
            <li> Lovely bottles.  One of the spritzers was clogged and I didn&#x27;t realize it until much later.  This is an excellent seller.  I mentioned it and they sent me a new spritzer well past when that was necessary.  Good product and wonderful seller!</li>
            <li> This worked fine for about two weeks.  I use it for my vinegar/water cleaning solution.  Then, the trigger stopped working.  Second time this has happened with this product so I am not ordering again.</li>
            <li> Item received in good shape. Just what we needed. We may be ordering another one for a backup. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these a few days, but I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality, especially the nozzle portion. I&#x27;ve already been replacing my cleaners with all natural ones in these.</li>
            <li> Awesome spray bottle for keeping essential oils disinfectants in! Amazing trigger too...will Definately purchase more! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, well-packaged bottle. This is the 3rd or 4th bottle I have&lt;br /&gt;purchased from these sellers, and am always pleased with product and service.  I used it for all my home made cleaning products, almost all of which also use essential oils.  This is the bottle you want for the big jobs ..!</li>
            <li> The spray trigger for the initial bottle failed after a few days, but they quickly provide a replacement.</li>
            <li> The product itself is excellent. I use it for homemade cleaning solution (white vinegar + water).  It&#x27;s really exactly what I wanted, which is sometimes hard to get via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using the handle on the spray bottle got jammed and stopped working. Not a quality product.</li>
            <li> As described, and the seller sent an email verifying that the spray bottle was functioning properly, and offering to replace the sprayer if I ever have a problem with it (which I haven&#x27;t, but I appreciate the offer since I was hesitant to spend money on a spray bottle, when in my experience the sprayers quite often malfunction). Will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a quality spray bottle with a good sprayer. This one is fantastic. I came back and bought another after months of great use from my first one. And it helps that it looks nice, too :) Highly recommend this spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Thank you!! Quick service. Quality product.</li>
            <li> Great bottle; sturdy trigger top.  Comes with convenient labels!</li>
            <li> The product came just as described! We love these spray bottles and have used them to make lotions, sprays and for cleaning solution! We have not had any issues with the bottles and will continue to purchase more as we need them.</li>
            <li> While I was looking around for spray bottles, I couldn&#x27;t find one that I liked. Most spray bottles out there are made out of plastic. So part of the reason why I purchased this product is because it comes with a glass bottle :) Which is great! What isn&#x27;t so great is the sprayer mechanism itself, which is made of plastic. Because it&#x27;s made of plastic, it has a hard time gripping onto the glass grooves at the opening of the bottle. So the plastic spraying mechanism rarely stays in place.  I&#x27;ve just taken the sprayer off and I&#x27;m now using the glass bottle for storing liquid.  UPDATE - 8/18/15: Was sent a replacement sprayer head shortly after this review was written and was contacted by a representative of Sally&#x27;s Organics to make sure everything is okay. Needless to say, the replacement actually stays on! Maybe I just got a defective one to begin with, but I highly recommend this product if you can get it!</li>
            <li> great product, as desired.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. Item arrived quickly and was exactly what I was expecting. They also included some labels for the bottles. Glass and plastic nozzle seem like good quality and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle to use my essential oils for cleaning.  I love it!  It is a nice sturdy bottle.  It was easy to fill and use as well. Shipped quickly and was nicely packed.  I would definitely recommend this bottle!!</li>
            <li> The spray bottles are very comfortable to hold and not heavy. Will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love the bottle itself but the spray stopped working after a few weeks. There is no explanation since I am only spraying liquids.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle, nice spray head. I make my own &amp;#34;PAM&amp;#34;, which consists of 1/3 lecithin, 1/3 Everclear Grain Alcohol and 1/3 palm oil. The grain alcohol decreases the viscosity of the mixture so it will properly squirt out of the bottlel.  It works great and the spray function (I don&#x27;t need the squirt stream function) works perfectly. I use this to spray the racks on my grill and smoker. The spray on the grill racks is to keep the meat from sticking to the grill and the spray on the smoker rack and pan is for easy cleanup and to keep meat from sticking.</li>
            <li> Very nice bottles.  I use one for oil to spray on bakes veggies, the other for liquid smoke.  They both work great.</li>
            <li> Probably the BEST spray bottle of any I have ever used or purchased. If I could afford it, I would replace all bottles in my house with this one because the sprayer is so great. It does a wide fine mist fan spray as well as a targeted heavy stream spray. Excellent</li>
            <li> Great product! I definitely will purchase more</li>
            <li> exactly as described and what I wanted.  much better than flimsy plastic ones</li>
            <li> Nice thick glass bottle with good sprayer. I use it to store vinegar to spray my sink with after handling raw chicken to kill germs.”</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews stating that the bottle didn&#x27;t spray properly and it only streamed...mine works great! The bottles came within a week and I was able to use them for my homemade household cleaning products. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle jammed up on me the second time that I used it and I can&#x27;t get it to work again. Now the bottle is worthless. An awful lot of money to spend on something that breaks right away!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> “I wanted bottles that were glass not plastic. Even BPA plastic is bad because when they take out the BPA they use substitutes that are equally bad if not worse. I wish the sprayers were not plastic but it&#x27; impossible to have glass ones. I use these for all my cleaning concentrates and even a skin care lotion I dilute with an essential oil.”</li>
            <li> After just a week of use, the trigger on the spray nozzle started to stiffen.  It took very little time for it to become useless.  However, the company immediately replaced the entire product.  The replacement product has yet to break, but even if it did, I am confident that the company would intervene again.</li>
            <li> I love love love this wonderful, sleek, glass spray bottle. I ordered two initially, and once I received my order,  I quickly ordered three more!  I have shown these bottles to friends of mine while at my home and their reactions were....oh, those are beautiful!!!  &amp;#34;Where did you get those&amp;#34; was the next question. They are really attractive! I Never thought I would say that about a spray bottle filled with cleaning solution!  I thought it, and then my friends said it.  Not only are they nice looking, but they are functional as well.  I love the mist option.  It is a very fine, airy mist.  These bottles have two spray options, one being a stream and the other a very very fine mist. I am using these with my Young Living Essential Oils for home cleaning and room freshening. These bottles are truly pretty enough to leave out!</li>
            <li> I loved it at first but the sprayer completely stopped working after very little use.</li>
            <li> The bottles are great!!!!  A really good value.</li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars but I don&#x27;t like the price. I love using glass bottles instead of plastic but they are so expensive.  So now I buy 16oz glass bottles of vinegar for around a dollar and a cheap spray bottle at the dollars store.  Remove sprayer from plastic bottle and screw it on the vinegar bottle!  Voila!  You have home made cleaner that is great for windows, &amp; mirrors etc. that is non toxic.  Also you can infuse the vinegar with rosemary and organic orange peels for a great kitchen/bathroom cleaner.</li>
            <li> My wife was very excited that I bought this for her until about a week later when the nozzle stopped working.  The trigger only pulls about half way.  I&#x27;m assuming by the other reviews that the unit must be clogged.  We will try to replace with another nozzle, but I feel that the this is not a satisfactory product and I will not be purchasing anymore.</li>
            <li> I really like the bottles, (trying to get away from the plastic world we live in) the sprayers fit well and work nicely, they were packed very well, I just ordered a third one.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective and does exactly what it says. I&#x27;m going to order several more.  I use them for homemade cleaning products, and using this nice, well made product keeps my cleaning area looking nice and neat.  Not to mention that it works wonderfully.  This is so much nicer than the plastic spray bottles that looks worn and tatty after awhile.</li>
            <li> I really like this bottle but I wish you could turn the nozzle for a tighter/looser stream.</li>
            <li> As of today this spray bottle is useless.  Two weeks of light usage as a white vinegar sprayer the plastic spray mechanism no longer works.  Perhaps they should call it a WATER SPRAYER?  I don&#x27;t know.  But I wrote a very negative review and was contacted by a representative of Sally&#x27;s Organics who promised me a Full Refund and said that they were sending me a new spray mechanism!  Much appreciated and I will continue the Adventure of the White Vinegar Sprayer when I receive the new top.</li>
            <li> The item was extremely well packaged and arrived in perfect condition. There is not too much that can be said about a glass spray bottle other than that it works just the way it is supposed to. I had two plastic spray containers filled with cleaning liquid and the trigger on both sprayers broke. I filled this glass spray bottle with the cleaning liquid and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Fantastic spray bottle, and dare I say beautiful.  Never would I think to describe a spray bottle as such, but it is so.  The customer service and  and delivery speed and care in packaging is perfect. I even ordered another almost immediately!</li>
            <li> “Item came in a nice box, the product itself works perfectly and I am so excited to be using this bottle with my home made detergent</li>
            <li> Perfectly durable sprayer with multi-spray nozzle for my home made surfactant. Appreciate the vendor reach out to confirm satisfactory glass container receipt. Sally&#x27;s packaging is sustainable and was received in tact in the Amazon Prime container; both going to recycle or use in the wood stove.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this purchase. It was a little hard to tell from the photo what quality the spray nozzles would be and we thought we might end up replacing them pretty quickly. I haven&#x27;t had the product long, but they seem surprisingly sturdy. I will be replacing the other spray bottles in our house with these.</li>
            <li> Works and looks great!</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT size spay bottle for cleaning! I was worried that it might be too heavy once filled but it is only a bit heavier than a regular cleaning bottle so you will barely know the difference at all. I like to mix up my own cleaners and now that I have found the perfect bottle I will be buying more for all of my mixes. So this one is a LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> “It&#x27;s a perfect size, sturdy glass bottle!”</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> These are smaller than I expected, and the plastic sprayer sometimes becomes unscrewed from the glass base. Other than that they work very well.</li>
            <li> Quick ship and just as described</li>
            <li> The first spray bottle I received stopped working after only a few weeks of use (the spray nozzle just completely stopped functioning). I posted a negative review, and Sally&#x27;s Organics contacted me almost immediately and offered to either refund my money or send a replacement one. I opted for the replacement, which they sent right away. I have been using it regularly ever since (for the past 6+ months) and it works perfectly. Great customer service and the product works well the second time around--I think it was just bad luck the first time.</li>
            <li> The glass bottle is weighty and well-made.  The sprayer mechanism is well-made, sturdy, and has 3 settings.  All in all, a good purchase and one I would make again.</li>
            <li> I loved this glass bottle and used it about once a week for the past 3 months with a vinegar water solution. Yesterday the sprayer stopped working. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed as these bottles are not cheap. I hope I can find another sprayer that works with this bottle but I think a sprayer should last more than 3 months of light use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great looking bottle. I am excited to make my own homemade air freshener spray.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and quality!</li>
            <li> This is a great spray bottle. I used it to make natural air freshener, and it works great! In my effort to stop using plastic, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Just what I was in the market for!</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service.  Arrived exactly on time; the product is exactly as described.  The spray works very well and I was intentionally looking for a a spray bottle for oil.  The nozzle is fine.  I recommend the company and the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Bottles arrived on time, well packaged, and so far they work well. Very nice quality glass bottles, not too delicate or fragile. Pump sprayers are good -- love the two spray settings (mist or stream). I&#x27;m using these for home-made cleaning solutions and essential oils spider repellent.</li>
            <li> This bottle is perfect, I will order more in the near future. I make my own cleaning products, this bottle is excellent, well made.</li>
            <li> Great quality!  While product is a little pricey, you definitely get what you pay for.  The sprayer is fantastic and the bottle/sprayer seems to be very well made.  I use it for mixing natural cleaning products/essential oils.</li>
            <li> “Great spray bottle!”</li>
            <li> “It&#x27;s the perfect size, just big enough and not too small that I would have to keep making new solutions</li>
            <li> This is a great and responsive company that cares about your satisfaction! Great product that is environmentally friendly and if you have any issues, they work with you right away. I would definitely do business with Sally&#x27;s Organics and would recommend this to other family and friends as well as other people!</li>
            <li> “Quality product and prompt service!”</li>
            <li> “Great bottles. Heavy duty glass. Solid sprayer and so far they are working great. Love the fact that there was free shipping for Prime members. Big bonus.”</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use for a homemade cleaner with essential oils, after less than a week the spray nozzle has stopped working, so the glass bottle is fine but not sure the nozzle is made for use with essential oils</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy glass bottle that&#x27;s big enough to hold any type of cleaning product that you need. I use it with vinegar and lemon oil to clean my bathroom. The sprayer stopped working about two months after I purchased it. I contacted the seller to ask where to get a replacement sprayer and they said they would send me a new one. Very good customer service.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, same problem as some other reviewers: nozzle totally stopped up and nothing will fix it. Company refunded, which I appreciate, but I would have just preferred spray bottles that worked. :-(    UPDATE: Sally&#x27;s read my review and sent me a new set of nozzles for the bottles I still had. That was great customer service, and so far so good with the new nozzles. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works great for my essential oil cleansers. Would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Aesthetically, this bottle gets five stars because it looks so much nicer on the counter top than a plastic bottle and of course, it&#x27;s great not to use the plastic...but....I have to rate it three stars because I&#x27;ve had it less than a month and the trigger is already working poorly.    1/13/15 update: Sally&#x27;s Organics was kind enough to send me what promises to be a new and improved spray trigger. I&#x27;ve used it for only a few days, so will have to wait before I change the rating to five stars, but it&#x27;s working great so far, so hopefully it will last. I did change my rating to four stars because of their personal and responsive customer service.</li>
            <li> I could not find my previous review to edit it, but I wanted to write an update: I loved receiving this sturdy glass bottle but the sprayer head was defective. After I wrote a review to this effect several months back, the company contacted me and sent a new, functional head. I was very pleased with the customer service and my bottle works great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great Bottles! High quality. Was afraid they might get broke during shipping, but seller packed them well. They&#x27;re good size, perfect for homemade household cleaners, and other various essential oil sprays. I&#x27;ve already purchased more.</li>
            <li> “Prompt delivery! Very well packaged so arrived in tact and ready to use. Easy to spray, easy to fill, attractive sitting out on vanity for quick use. Will do more business with Sally&#x27;s Organics.”</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product as described. Seems like a good quality bottle so far and is the perfect size for my home cleaning needs. Thank you for making a great product!</li>
            <li> Use it for spraying essential oils and water mixture.&lt;br /&gt;Strong and doesn&#x27;t spittle.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick. 16 oz. size is difficult so was very happy with these</li>
            <li> Excellent sprayer. Filled it with rosewater and it works beautifully</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle is sturdy. Unlike some other bottles that I&#x27;ve bought, that break on the first day, this one&#x27;s lasting well and feels like it will for awhile to come.The bottle holds enough to spray foliar plant food on all my plants, too, so I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> A Product well worth the price as the convenience it bring saves time and resources . I Use it to treat my scalp and it is been Delightful :) Make the good choice !</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  I ordered 4 of them at first for cleaning supplies and was so impressed, I ordered 4 more!</li>
            <li> This is a great little bottle for my homemade organic cleaners and the customer service from Sally&#x27;s was top-notch. I would certainly use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This glass bottle is better than most I&#x27;ve seen in the stores. We&#x27;ve been very happy using it to store our home-made cleaning product for use all over the house. The sprayer attachment has held up for the past couple months without clogging or any dysfunction.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Can wait to make some fun room sprays with my essential oils!</li>
            <li> love that they are glass. let&#x27;s me see what i have mixed.</li>
            <li> This is a solid glass bottle, but after less than a month of use (and not everyday), the spray trigger stopped working on either of the 2 spray levels.  I tried unclogging it using different methods, but nothing worked.  I use this bottle for a vinegar + water + dōTERRA Lemon EO cleaning mixture.  I&#x27;ll just try to find another spray trigger to work with the bottle, especially since we paid a lot more for the glass bottle vs. a cheaper plastic one.</li>
            <li> I bought this glass bottle to use with my essential oils.  This bottle is wonderful</li>
            <li> Love this glass bottle.  Great for lemon essential oil with water and using to clean with instead of harsh chemicals.  Plus it makes the room smell good.</li>
            <li> Love this glass spray bottle! Works Wonderfully.</li>
            <li> “Excellent service and excellent product! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It was exactly what I was looking for :-))).</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Bottle is fine but sprayer stopped working after a few uses. Contacted them to replace but still no response.   *update- new sprayer was sent and this one works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, and just with water in it, but it worked well.  I&#x27;m curious to see how it holds up to other solutions, like with vinegar or essential oils mixed in water.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: we&#x27;ve had these for a month or so. Ordered 3 &amp; only one works now (that&#x27;s used very, very lightly). The two I use daily have stopped working all together. It&#x27;s a simple water vinegar mixture so nothing crazy. They were amazing for the first week. I will be buying replacement sprayers some where else. Very disappointed.    I love these! We ordered a few for my homemade cleaners &amp; for my husband&#x27;s craft brewing projects. The spray options are seriously wonderful &amp; the bottles are perfect. It&#x27;s nice to have bottles of cleaner that look nice too.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality glass and mist nozzle.  I use it for cleaning in my spa with waterproof chalk markers and labels.</li>
            <li> Great size and quality. The spray works well and I appreciate the good quality.  Update:  The sprayers on both of these all of a sudden quit working, within about a 10 days of each other. I have all-natural cleaning products in both bottles. One contains vinegar, one contains rubbing alcohol. Both contain water and less than 10 drops of essential oils. Not sure what caused the sudden cessation of use.</li>
            <li> These glass bottles are great, just what I need for use with my essential oils. My shipment arrived quickly, and I will definitely order from Sally&#x27;s Organics again.</li>
            <li> The glass bottle is great - highly recommend. Also when I had a defective sprayer, it was replaced very quickly. Great seller.</li>
            <li> I make my own household cleaners and love these spray bottles for my blends. I use only pure essential oils in my bottles and these hold up well - even with the plastic sprayer, which was previously a concern of mine.</li>
            <li> The item I ordered was delivered fast and it was just what I wanted. I could have found many spray containers at Wal-Mart but they would all be plastic. There is something about real glass that pleases me. Of course its lack of toxicity is one factor. I don&#x27;t care much about the constituents of plastics leaching into anything liquid.</li>
            <li> Disappointed the nozzle stopped working after only a few uses</li>
            <li> I use lavender water when ironing my lines and wanted something to hold it, and this is perfect. The bottle has heft so I&#x27;m not worried about it falling over and breaking. Ironing can be a drudge and whenever I find something that makes it more of a treat I&#x27;m using it! This does. Hey, I iron my lines for crying out loud.</li>
            <li> The bottles and sprayers work great for my essential oil concoctions. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Thought might be able to use as a sprayer for olive oil, sprayer unit didn&#x27;t seem suitable. Returned item.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality of this product. Thick glass and the spray nozzle is not only sturdy but very firm fitting to my hand which is very useful in a nice grip since the glass is heavier then plastic. Will be buying many more.</li>
            <li> Love these bottles for my homemade cleaners and spraying my cloth items with lavender water. They spray has two options, stream and spray. I only use the spay and it works very well. Will probably be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> Great quality, the sprayer sprays well and does not leak like others I have used.</li>
            <li> These are really great, really substantial thick glass and they hold a lot. Good spray mechanism. Just perfect!!! Thank you Sally!</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised, good quality, great for my homemade counter cleaner!</li>
