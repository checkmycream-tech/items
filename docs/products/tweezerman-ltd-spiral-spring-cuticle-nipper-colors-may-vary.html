            <li>Hands down another great product by Twizzerman!</li>
            <li>I love these, I&#x27;ve gone through tons of cuticle nippers because they break quickly</li>
            <li>have large hands, and I believe these to be equally comfortable and effective for</li>
            <li>and I feel comfortable working with it.</li>
            <li>The design is comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>Amazingly this nipper is very comfy to use.</li>
            <li>These cuticle clippers are fabulous.</li>
            <li>The spiral handle is so comfortable on your hand.</li>
            <li>(and you can get them resharpened for free from Tweezerman).</li>
            <li>They are smooth and well made.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I balked at first at the price of these cuticle nippers, but loved my tweezers by Tweezerman so much that I bit the bullet.  </li>
            <li>I use them in between manicures and they were great on keeping my dry cuticles under control.</li>
            <li>Every time I have ever gone and had them done professionally, I was never that comfortable in that kind of environment at all.  </li>
            <li>The precision of these are great, regardless of if you&#x27;re right or left handed.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp with a nice pointed tip.</li>
            <li>I will buy two more soon, one for my mom and one for my manicurist that loves it so much and her birthday is coming up.</li>
            <li>these, read the description, didn&#x27;t buy, kept coming back to the description, intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;Finally purchased, and my goodness who knew I could be so delighted by cuticle nippers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work well for those quick trims.</li>
            <li>I have the classic version of this from Tweezerman that I like much better.  </li>
            <li>Love the Tweezerman easy to use even for a left handed person.</li>
            <li>This is great wish it could be a little sharper</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth every penny</li>
            <li>While somewhat pricey, this product is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>The grip is soooo comfortable, these are now the only set I&#x27;ll use.&lt;br /&gt;Innovation happens in interesting places.</li>
            <li>I love them I&#x27;ve own others but these are better than any other ones if same brand.</li>
            <li>I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting to smile every time I reach for cuticle nippers, for goodness sake!</li>
            <li>These work very well and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>I love Tweezerman products in general.</li>
            <li>I figure, as long as I can still do my own; I will.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, slim enough, and nicely angled that they really let me get into all the nooks and get very precise and detailed snips.</li>
            <li>They may cost a bit more but they are definitely cheaper than buying 3 or 4 cheaper versions.</li>
            <li>saying they don&#x27;t open wide enough--not sure what kind of cuticles they are trying to trim</li>
            <li>Needless to say they were returned, but I still needed some cuticle nippers, so I took a chance on this very different design, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did because they&#x27;re the best.  </li>
            <li>They look like they will last a lifetime, though, so I am satisfied with this purchase and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very sharp and precise!!  </li>
            <li>and I will be the first to stand on line for purchase.</li>
            <li>THESE are sooooo much easier, it&#x27;s noticeable!  </li>
            <li>the tip is very fine, making it easy to get into small crevasses.</li>
            <li>They clip off the sharp ends nice and neatly without the cat putting up a fuss.  </li>
            <li>The design is great in that you don&#x27;t have to worry about the latch slipping to keep them open.  </li>
            <li>These jaws of this cuticle nipper do not have enough spring action to be effective.  </li>
            <li>These are awesome...way better than traditional stainless steel ones.</li>
            <li>So, you may want to make sure your hands are dry.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t pull apart the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; to access more difficult-to-reach areas, and as a result, they are not easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Just how large are your cuticles???????  </li>
            <li>nippers are sharp enough to get to the most minute edges of your cuticle but somehow manage NOT to draw blood easily.  </li>
            <li>It has really modern looks</li>
            <li>but I got used to it really fast.</li>
            <li>The issue is that it does not have enough force or spring-action to smoothly cut the cuticles.  </li>
            <li>Without question, these are the absolutely finest cuticle nippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>works very well and makes trimming much easier.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate this because I keep my tools all together</li>
            <li>They are really cool!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like them so much</li>
            <li>Very accurate and sharp.</li>
            <li>Nipping hangnails -- even the tiniest -- is a cinch with these; in fact, I find that, often, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve actually accomplished the little cuticle deed I wanted to do, so quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>And it is really sharp which I love.</li>
            <li>The spring doesn&#x27;t allow me to open the jaw to clean them, ie: I brush out the skin pieces.</li>
            <li>Very well-made and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I used these cuticle nippers to trim my cat&#x27;s claws, and they work much better than the conventional nail clippers for cats that they sell at the pet stores.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, which I love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also true that they don&#x27;t open very wide, which is fine for how I use them.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp and so easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $20, especially if you have cats.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra cost -- and</li>
            <li>, I love this new design, there is a little learning curve</li>
            <li>They are new to the market</li>
            <li>These nippers are very sharp and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>They are so easy to use and super sharp, so be careful.</li>
            <li>I almost got them at the same time, but I wanted to try these out first.  </li>
            <li>That is true, but not really the issue.  </li>
            <li>If I were the president of the company I might do a special order that was solid metal color instead of magenta and blue -- tweezerman, if you are reading this and decide to try my suggestion, let me know</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li>I really wish they had a more tradition look as I really do not see a purpose in having a loop handle instead of the conventional handles</li>
            <li>Some care and attention needs to be in effect while using these as they are super sharp.</li>
            <li>So they don&#x27;t cut as well as the old school style.</li>
            <li>have used these on my nails for four complete manicures now</li>
            <li>It took me some time to get the &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; of the clipper action and feel.</li>
            <li>I got the hot pink color, but anycolor would do.</li>
            <li>The unique spring design is so easy to use -- no more fumbling with a little inside metal lever that inevitably slips out of alignment just when you&#x27;re about to clip your cuticle.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty sharp, so you must be careful when using them for the first time.</li>
            <li>Nothing really wrong with this one, just didn&#x27;t have as good a \\&quot;feel\\&quot; as the regular one.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely obsessed with nails, I have been doing my own manicures for years</li>
            <li>Not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>Almost too sharp, but better that than dull</li>
            <li>They are sharp and I have used them for about two weeks and hope they don&#x27;t go dull quickly but small enough so its easy to not cut yourself.  </li>
            <li>medium and small sized hands.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are as sharp as can be, finely edged and matched.  </li>
            <li>They take a little getting used to since the feel is different than that of the more commonly used clippers, and they are easier to squeeze.</li>

            <li> I will buy two more soon, one for my mom and one for my manicurist that loves it so much and her birthday is coming up.</li>
            <li> these, read the description, didn&#x27;t buy, kept coming back to the description, intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;Finally purchased, and my goodness who knew I could be so delighted by cuticle nippers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work well for those quick trims.</li>
            <li> I have the classic version of this from Tweezerman that I like much better.  </li>
            <li> Love the Tweezerman easy to use even for a left handed person.</li>
            <li> This is great wish it could be a little sharper</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth every penny</li>
            <li> While somewhat pricey, this product is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> The grip is soooo comfortable, these are now the only set I&#x27;ll use.&lt;br /&gt;Innovation happens in interesting places.</li>
            <li> I love them I&#x27;ve own others but these are better than any other ones if same brand.</li>
            <li> I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting to smile every time I reach for cuticle nippers, for goodness sake!</li>
            <li> These work very well and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman products in general.</li>
            <li> I figure, as long as I can still do my own; I will.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, slim enough, and nicely angled that they really let me get into all the nooks and get very precise and detailed snips.</li>
            <li> They may cost a bit more but they are definitely cheaper than buying 3 or 4 cheaper versions.</li>
            <li> saying they don&#x27;t open wide enough--not sure what kind of cuticles they are trying to trim</li>
            <li> Needless to say they were returned, but I still needed some cuticle nippers, so I took a chance on this very different design, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did because they&#x27;re the best.  </li>
            <li> They look like they will last a lifetime, though, so I am satisfied with this purchase and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very sharp and precise!!  </li>
            <li> and I will be the first to stand on line for purchase.</li>
            <li> THESE are sooooo much easier, it&#x27;s noticeable!  </li>
            <li> the tip is very fine, making it easy to get into small crevasses.</li>
            <li> They clip off the sharp ends nice and neatly without the cat putting up a fuss.  </li>
            <li> The design is great in that you don&#x27;t have to worry about the latch slipping to keep them open.  </li>
            <li> These jaws of this cuticle nipper do not have enough spring action to be effective.  </li>
            <li> These are awesome...way better than traditional stainless steel ones.</li>
            <li> So, you may want to make sure your hands are dry.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t pull apart the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; to access more difficult-to-reach areas, and as a result, they are not easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Just how large are your cuticles???????  </li>
            <li> nippers are sharp enough to get to the most minute edges of your cuticle but somehow manage NOT to draw blood easily.  </li>
            <li> It has really modern looks</li>
            <li> but I got used to it really fast.</li>
            <li> The issue is that it does not have enough force or spring-action to smoothly cut the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> Without question, these are the absolutely finest cuticle nippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> works very well and makes trimming much easier.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate this because I keep my tools all together</li>
            <li> They are really cool!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like them so much</li>
            <li> Very accurate and sharp.</li>
            <li> Nipping hangnails -- even the tiniest -- is a cinch with these; in fact, I find that, often, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve actually accomplished the little cuticle deed I wanted to do, so quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> And it is really sharp which I love.</li>
            <li> The spring doesn&#x27;t allow me to open the jaw to clean them, ie: I brush out the skin pieces.</li>
            <li> Very well-made and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I used these cuticle nippers to trim my cat&#x27;s claws, and they work much better than the conventional nail clippers for cats that they sell at the pet stores.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, which I love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also true that they don&#x27;t open very wide, which is fine for how I use them.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and so easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $20, especially if you have cats.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra cost -- and</li>
            <li> , I love this new design, there is a little learning curve</li>
            <li> They are new to the market</li>
            <li> These nippers are very sharp and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> They are so easy to use and super sharp, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I almost got them at the same time, but I wanted to try these out first.  </li>
            <li> That is true, but not really the issue.  </li>
            <li> If I were the president of the company I might do a special order that was solid metal color instead of magenta and blue -- tweezerman, if you are reading this and decide to try my suggestion, let me know</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li> I really wish they had a more tradition look as I really do not see a purpose in having a loop handle instead of the conventional handles</li>
            <li> Some care and attention needs to be in effect while using these as they are super sharp.</li>
            <li> So they don&#x27;t cut as well as the old school style.</li>
            <li> have used these on my nails for four complete manicures now</li>
            <li> It took me some time to get the &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; of the clipper action and feel.</li>
            <li> I got the hot pink color, but anycolor would do.</li>
            <li> The unique spring design is so easy to use -- no more fumbling with a little inside metal lever that inevitably slips out of alignment just when you&#x27;re about to clip your cuticle.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty sharp, so you must be careful when using them for the first time.</li>
            <li> Nothing really wrong with this one, just didn&#x27;t have as good a \\&quot;feel\\&quot; as the regular one.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with nails, I have been doing my own manicures for years</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Almost too sharp, but better that than dull</li>
            <li> They are sharp and I have used them for about two weeks and hope they don&#x27;t go dull quickly but small enough so its easy to not cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> medium and small sized hands.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are as sharp as can be, finely edged and matched.  </li>
            <li> They take a little getting used to since the feel is different than that of the more commonly used clippers, and they are easier to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Have owned other Tweezerman cuticle nippers and this is by far the highest-quality one I have owned of any brand or Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> Tweezerman is expensive and I waited a long time but after buying an item from them the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not that cuticle nippers are hard to use, don&#x27;t need a firm strong grip.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old and have a lot of trouble with my hands and wrists!&lt;br /&gt;Arthritis and multiple surgeries, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews complaining that they don&#x27;t open wide enough.  </li>
            <li> Open wide enough for what?  </li>
            <li> It came loose &amp; never stays on, resulting in the file getting damaged constantly when I put it away.  </li>
            <li> The first time, I was really careful and it took a little while to get used to the way they worked, but no time at all to &amp;#34;get them&amp;#34;!!  </li>
            <li> Its much easier and less strain on my palm and wrist than the traditional clippers but maneuvering the small head with the spring grip takes some time to get accustomed to.</li>
            <li> Finally found a cuticle nipper that is sharp.....</li>
            <li> I mean seriously, your are clipping little edges of skin here, not cutting your whole finger</li>
            <li> Due to the design, they don&#x27;t open very wide.</li>
            <li> While growing up my mother always had little pairs of cuticle nippers with the same type of head.</li>
            <li> I can understand now why some complained that the mouth did not open wide enough.  </li>
            <li> It just tears the skin leaving it rough and jagged.  </li>
            <li> Also, I got the pink ones and like how they stand out in my sea of nail tools.</li>
            <li> --I got pink.</li>
            <li> it is definitely well constructed, sharp clipper and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> This is so sharp, be careful with it.</li>
            <li> but all of them were a little dull and always broke, especially the bar that made them spring open after squeezing them.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it only opens very little.  </li>
            <li> It is different grip from other , usual nippers</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I was hoping</li>
            <li> These are sharp and well made.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine ever choosing anything other than these Spiral Spring Cuticle Nippers -- why would you?</li>
            <li> Use it every week and still so sharp.</li>
            <li> They are heavier than any pair I have owned before, whether Tweezerman or other brands.  </li>
            <li> They also work great on my poly-dactyl cat&#x27;s thumb that has a twisted nail on it (which is impossible to trim with conventional cat nail</li>
            <li> No accidentally cutting too much even when operated with my left hand</li>
            <li> None of my other nippers came with this little feature.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sharp.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and get the job done.  </li>
            <li> The grip on these seem to be wearing out and the jaw is very small (for cuticles only), they may work well for some if they need a dedicated cuticle clipper, but I should have bought a small quality nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> I have bought at least 3 other Cuticle clippers that cost about 30% to 50% less</li>
            <li> Lost its&#x27; nippiness and dulled after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> last (unimportant) thing....  </li>
            <li> and I find that my nippers get dull over the years, not from trimming my cuticles but from rubbing up against other tools I have.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little bit slick.  </li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> No more worrying about the pesky hinges  breaking or detaching.</li>
            <li> But the closed coil handle of these mean they do not open very widely, so sometimes they feel uncomfortable and unnecessarily difficult to use.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cover it was designed with is doomed to fail.  </li>
            <li> When you do cut your cuticles, they become lodged between the cutters and it is hard to get them out because the opening is so small.</li>
            <li> When I get too old, and in too bad of shape to do them, there will be plenty of time for that when I HAVE to have them done!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I quit sending them off as I was afraid they wouldn&#x27;t get back to me.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have been such a chicken!!  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> They were so nostalgic to me</li>
            <li> I am truly sorry I didn&#x27;t discover them years</li>
            <li> And, yes, I know how to use them - it isn&#x27;t difficult!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in these nippers.  </li>
            <li> but this design is the way to go, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lost its&#x27; nippiness and dulled after just a few weeks. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I am doing my own acrylic nails and these are great for breaking on the parts that have lifted.</li>
            <li> easy to hold, includes a cover for the blades, and cuts well. the tip is very fine, making it easy to get into small crevasses.</li>
            <li> These nippers are very sharp and easy to hold.  I like that it&#x27;s springy, which makes it easier to use with one hand.  The handle is a little bit slick.  So, you may want to make sure your hands are dry.  However, these are the best nippers I have tried yet.  They are excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> These are much more difficult to handle than traditional tweezerman cuticle clippers!  You can&#x27;t pull apart the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; to access more difficult-to-reach areas, and as a result, they are not easy to clean.</li>
            <li> they work well &amp; easy on my hands</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is expensive and I waited a long time but after buying an item from them the quality is top notch. I have bought at least 3 other Cuticle clippers that cost about 30% to 50% less but all of them were a little dull and always broke, especially the bar that made them spring open after squeezing them. The spiral spring on this are perfect and nothing to break. You can also see the quality of these versus any others that I have seen. They may cost a bit more but they are definitely cheaper than buying 3 or 4 cheaper versions.</li>
            <li> This is great wish it could be a little sharper but you won&#x27;t be dis appointed it does what you want easy to hold .love it</li>
            <li> These are my &amp;#34;at work&amp;#34; nippers so I don&#x27;t rip off my cuticles and make them bleed. You know what I am talking about!! They work well for those quick trims. I saw a review saying they don&#x27;t open wide enough--not sure what kind of cuticles they are trying to trim but I have not had any problems with that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, good sharpened, perfect tip for me and I&#x27;am not a professional, but cannot find a good one, so has to do my mani by myself and this is the nipper I was looking for! Surely will by more and recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> I love this implement. It has really modern looks and I feel comfortable working with it. It is different grip from other , usual nippers but I got used to it really fast. And it is really sharp which I love.Really great tool.</li>
            <li> I can understand now why some complained that the mouth did not open wide enough.  That is true, but not really the issue.  The issue is that it does not have enough force or spring-action to smoothly cut the cuticles.  It just tears the skin leaving it rough and jagged.  I am returning.</li>
            <li> I used these cuticle nippers to trim my cat&#x27;s claws, and they work much better than the conventional nail clippers for cats that they sell at the pet stores.  They clip off the sharp ends nice and neatly without the cat putting up a fuss.  They also work great on my poly-dactyl cat&#x27;s thumb that has a twisted nail on it (which is impossible to trim with conventional cat nail clippers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side, it also works great at trimming my hangnails, and it feels nice and comfortable in my hand.  Definitely worth the $20, especially if you have cats.</li>
            <li> I LOVE TWEEZERMAN PRODUCTS.  This is a beautifully made product.</li>
            <li> These are great Nipper&#x27;s.  They are so easy to use and super sharp, so be careful. I use them in between manicures and they were great on keeping my dry cuticles under control.</li>
            <li> These are soo good.  They are sharp and I have used them for about two weeks and hope they don&#x27;t go dull quickly but small enough so its easy to not cut yourself.  I won&#x27;t go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> Best cuticle nippers I ever had.  Easy to use!</li>
            <li> I love them I&#x27;ve own others but these are better than any other ones if same brand. Perfect grip k</li>
            <li> Best cuticle nipper I&#x27;ve ever gotten, it&#x27;s really easy to use and works well.  My only complaint is that the cover it was designed with is doomed to fail.  It came loose &amp; never stays on, resulting in the file getting damaged constantly when I put it away.  Ultimately, I will have to replace this sooner then later b/c of that defect.</li>
            <li> OMG this cuticle Nipper is great!!!! Great!!!! the shape gives you total control. I will buy two more soon, one for my mom and one for my manicurist that loves it so much and her birthday is coming up. Worth every penny!!!!! I got the hot pink color, but anycolor would do. They are a great buy.</li>
            <li> These jaws of this cuticle nipper do not have enough spring action to be effective.  The are easy to hold onto - the concept is a good idea but needs to be improved.  I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;wowed\\&quot;!  I have the classic version of this from Tweezerman that I like much better.  Nothing really wrong with this one, just didn&#x27;t have as good a \\&quot;feel\\&quot; as the regular one.</li>
            <li> Without question, these are the absolutely finest cuticle nippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  They are sharp, very easy to use, and so incredibly well constructed.  I&#x27;d purchased another cuticle nippers and they broke before I even used them!  Needless to say they were returned, but I still needed some cuticle nippers, so I took a chance on this very different design, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did because they&#x27;re the best.  You will not be disappointed in these nippers.  They&#x27;re worth every penny and then some.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I was hoping but they do the job well.</li>
            <li> Work great, love the design.</li>
            <li> I love these. They&#x27;re very sharp. They&#x27;re better than the Revlon ones I have. I would def recommend getting them.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with nails, I have been doing my own manicures for years and I have always been using Tweezerman cuticle nippers, I love this new design, there is a little learning curve but I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough. Pulls cuticles rather than cuts them. And, yes, I know how to use them - it isn&#x27;t difficult!</li>
            <li> I decided to start doing my nails at home and purchased this item.  I love the design and the color.  They feel sturdy and are easy to maneuver around fingernails and toenails. They are very sharp and get the job done.  It did take a while to get used to them but I think that would have happened with any cuticle nippers if you haven&#x27;t used one before (and I hadn&#x27;t.)  I&#x27;m thrilled that I can save money doing my nails at home in-between visits to the nail salon!</li>
            <li> These nippers work great. I really wish they had a more tradition look as I really do not see a purpose in having a loop handle instead of the conventional handles</li>
            <li> Hands down another great product by Twizzerman! I have bought many things by this brand and as awalys I am very pleased once again. I have small hands and I thought this would be a bit too bulky for me but this fits very comfortable when holding it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like. Bought these hoping they&#x27;d be an improvement. They weren&#x27;t. The spring doesn&#x27;t allow me to open the jaw to clean them, ie: I brush out the skin pieces. So they don&#x27;t cut as well as the old school style. Finally dulled. Bought the regular 1/2 jaw like I always have. Won&#x27;t buy again. Don&#x27;t recommend. Have been using TM for many many years, think this is the worst product they&#x27;ve brought out.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and well made.  I just wish they were larger.  It&#x27;s also true that they don&#x27;t open very wide, which is fine for how I use them.  The design is comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> These are good nippers that help with maintaining my nail regiment but the grip takes some getting used to. Its much easier and less strain on my palm and wrist than the traditional clippers but maneuvering the small head with the spring grip takes some time to get accustomed to. They look like they will last a lifetime, though, so I am satisfied with this purchase and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Finally found a cuticle nipper that is sharp.....hurray!  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> Who would have guessed that a simple concept/design approach could make such a vast difference! Nipping hangnails -- even the tiniest -- is a cinch with these; in fact, I find that, often, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve actually accomplished the little cuticle deed I wanted to do, so quickly and easily. I can&#x27;t imagine ever choosing anything other than these Spiral Spring Cuticle Nippers -- why would you? I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting to smile every time I reach for cuticle nippers, for goodness sake! However, what I find here is -- perfection in an implement!</li>
            <li> I L O V E this cuticle nipper. Im a nail tecnician and my clients says that is beautiful, and they dont feel a thing when they are gettin the manicure or pedicure done. 100% recomended</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Very precise and neat</li>
            <li> works very well and makes trimming much easier.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes great products.</li>
            <li> The grip on these seem to be wearing out and the jaw is very small (for cuticles only), they may work well for some if they need a dedicated cuticle clipper, but I should have bought a small quality nail clipper.  I was looking for a quality universal tool to care for my nails, this isn&#x27;t it.  Male user.</li>
            <li> Amazingly this nipper is very comfy to use. It&#x27;s very sharp and accurate. Love it!</li>
            <li> Ratty cuticles don&#x27;t stand a chance against these guys.  And, I prefer them to the cuticle trimmers that have that one piece in the middle that moves.  These work very well and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> These are the best cuticle scissors I have ever used. Very accurate and sharp.</li>
            <li> These cuticle clippers are fabulous. They are new to the market - I read that the patent is pending.They take a little getting used to since the feel is different than that of the more commonly used clippers, and they are easier to squeeze. They are pretty sharp, so you must be careful when using them for the first time. If you clip&lt;br /&gt;your own cuticles, you should try these.</li>
            <li> Best cuticle nipper there is! Use it every week and still so sharp. The spiral handle is so comfortable on your hand. Love them</li>
            <li> These cut so well. They were way better than my Mehaz nippers which cost more. The blades are sharp, slim enough, and nicely angled that they really let me get into all the nooks and get very precise and detailed snips. No pulling. No accidentally cutting too much even when operated with my left hand that isn&#x27;t quite as coordinated. Due to the design, they don&#x27;t open very wide. But I found that it only took  me a couple minutes before I got used to it and got proficient with using this style of nippers. And after a while, I actually think this design is easier to use than the traditional design. They are more comfortable in the hand, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These also come with a plastic protective cover for the blades. I really appreciate this because I keep my tools all together and I find that my nippers get dull over the years, not from trimming my cuticles but from rubbing up against other tools I have. None of my other nippers came with this little feature. Also, I got the pink ones and like how they stand out in my sea of nail tools. They are easy to find and reach for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering whether you want to try these or not, I say go for it. You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> I was so scared to try these because if some of the reviews!!  I am 68 years old and have a lot of trouble with my hands and wrists!&lt;br /&gt;Arthritis and multiple surgeries, etc.  I am so glad I took the plunge and gave them a try!!  Some people just go nuts when they review things!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been doing my own manis and pedis forever.  Every time I have ever gone and had them done professionally, I was never that comfortable in that kind of environment at all.  I figure, as long as I can still do my own; I will.  When I get too old, and in too bad of shape to do them, there will be plenty of time for that when I HAVE to have them done!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used these on my nails for four complete manicures now and I can honestly say, I really like them!!  The first time, I was really careful and it took a little while to get used to the way they worked, but no time at all to &amp;#34;get them&amp;#34;!!  They are really cool!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp and precise!!  I like them so much, I am going to buy a pair of Tweezerman regular style ones for my pedicures.  I almost got them at the same time, but I wanted to try these out first.  I shouldn&#x27;t have been such a chicken!!  These are fantastic!!  Take the plunge!!</li>
            <li> While somewhat pricey, this product is well worth it. While growing up my mother always had little pairs of cuticle nippers with the same type of head. Although they disappeared from the market quite a while ago, I could send my Mom&#x27;s to the manufacturer for sharpening. They were so nostalgic to me I quit sending them off as I was afraid they wouldn&#x27;t get back to me. It&#x27;s been said you shouldn&#x27;t cut your cuticles, but this is the only thing that works for me. The precision of these are great, regardless of if you&#x27;re right or left handed. Some care and attention needs to be in effect while using these as they are super sharp. You can&#x27;t pick the color, but I would have been satisfied with either color--I got pink.</li>
            <li> I like these.  Almost too sharp, but better that than dull (and you can get them resharpened for free from Tweezerman).</li>
            <li> Very impressed.  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.  They are heavier than any pair I have owned before, whether Tweezerman or other brands.  The design is great in that you don&#x27;t have to worry about the latch slipping to keep them open.  Very well-made and would highly recommend.  Have owned other Tweezerman cuticle nippers and this is by far the highest-quality one I have owned of any brand or Tweezerman.  Love the colors, too.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Nice and sharp with a nice pointed tip.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it only opens very little.  When you do cut your cuticles, they become lodged between the cutters and it is hard to get them out because the opening is so small.</li>
            <li> Oh My God, I LOVE LOVE LOVE these cuticle nippers.  They are sharp and so easy to manage.  I&#x27;ve read reviews complaining that they don&#x27;t open wide enough.  Open wide enough for what?  Just how large are your cuticles???????  I mean seriously, your are clipping little edges of skin here, not cutting your whole finger off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nippers are sharp enough to get to the most minute edges of your cuticle but somehow manage NOT to draw blood easily.  I can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough.  I am truly sorry I didn&#x27;t discover them years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last (unimportant) thing....  I am a bit of a geek when it comes to metal....  I love nicely sculpted metal tools and these are a thing of beauty.  They are smooth and well made.  If I were the president of the company I might do a special order that was solid metal color instead of magenta and blue -- tweezerman, if you are reading this and decide to try my suggestion, let me know and I will be the first to stand on line for purchase.</li>
            <li> I balked at first at the price of these cuticle nippers, but loved my tweezers by Tweezerman so much that I bit the bullet.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  The unique spring design is so easy to use -- no more fumbling with a little inside metal lever that inevitably slips out of alignment just when you&#x27;re about to clip your cuticle.  Well worth the extra cost -- and the bright color is a bonus.</li>
            <li> It took me some time to get the &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; of the clipper action and feel. it is definitely well constructed, sharp clipper and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> These are awesome...way better than traditional stainless steel ones.</li>
            <li> I love these, I&#x27;ve gone through tons of cuticle nippers because they break quickly but this design is the way to go, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, which I love. I love Tweezerman products in general. But the closed coil handle of these mean they do not open very widely, so sometimes they feel uncomfortable and unnecessarily difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I am a longtime purchaser and user of Tweezerman products.&lt;br /&gt;I have another pair of Tweezerman cuticle nippers that I like a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Saw these, read the description, didn&#x27;t buy, kept coming back to the description, intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;Finally purchased, and my goodness who knew I could be so delighted by cuticle nippers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that cuticle nippers are hard to use, don&#x27;t need a firm strong grip.&lt;br /&gt;But THESE are sooooo much easier, it&#x27;s noticeable!  Seems to give better control than the &amp;#34;scissor handle&amp;#34; style.&lt;br /&gt;I have large hands, and I believe these to be equally comfortable and effective for medium and small sized hands.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are as sharp as can be, finely edged and matched.  The grip is soooo comfortable, these are now the only set I&#x27;ll use.&lt;br /&gt;Innovation happens in interesting places.</li>
            <li> Love the Tweezerman easy to use even for a left handed person.</li>
            <li> Before I could blink my item was here. This is so sharp, be careful with it. Packaging is awesome. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning with really clean fingernails!!! Love their service! They also include a cute note in the package.</li>
            <li> No more worrying about the pesky hinges  breaking or detaching. Love them !</li>
