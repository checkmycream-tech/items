            <li>I Removed Alot Of My Own Lashes In The Process.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great size!</li>
            <li>you will also be pulling out your own lashes....</li>
            <li>Great glue for Ardell lashes and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell kinda like nail polish or nail polish remover and irritates eyes.</li>
            <li>Holds lashes perfectly and is undetectably clear</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think I will be using this glue again until I have had more practice.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;OBVIOUSLY</li>
            <li>Just know that before buying :)</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this product to be really good because I had heard many good reviews previously...</li>
            <li>But on a good note, it&#x27;s not so strong that it pulls out your natural lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for individual lashes.</li>
            <li>and two cool showers...and are still holding strong</li>
            <li>This product is really great and long wear.</li>
            <li>This dries super quick!</li>
            <li>u can either apply directly to eyelash or to your own eye either way works fine</li>
            <li>I ordered the clear glue to use iwth individual lashes for the very first time and am very impressed by it&#x27;s sticking power!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  one or two lashes have fallen out after about a week, but its was a quick fix and all is well.</li>
            <li>The price is good and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Maggie G has a pretty good review of this product, and you can find a ton of videos on youtube as to how to put on individual lashes...</li>
            <li>I use the dark now and am more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>they also shipped super fast</li>
            <li>Description does not tell you what this is exactly for.</li>
            <li>This Made My Eyes Water Severely, Really Didn&#x27;t Get What I Paid &amp; Was Hoping For.</li>
            <li>And Really Didn&#x27;t Hold The Lashes</li>
            <li>All my clients are very satisfy with the results.</li>
            <li>And getting the day&#x27;s makeup off is much easier without having to deal with mascara.</li>
            <li>Works really well when I need it.</li>
            <li>but when I need to fill them in it works really well.</li>
            <li>This glue is made for permalashes not the kind you wear everyday.</li>
            <li>The glue is fast drying and the more its open to air, over time the stuff in the bottle will become thicker and harder to use.</li>
            <li>you feel a burning sensation from \\&quot;fumes\\&quot; then you have too much glue on the lash end, also you need to be sure you apply this to your lashes, not on your skin, because if you apply it to your skin it will only last several hrs...</li>
            <li>I cannot wear the black Lashtite because it irritates my eyes, but the clear works fine.  </li>
            <li>Love that it lasts just as long as the black glue but the down side to this product is that most people have a side affect that is unfavorable such as itchy eyes swelling and discharge</li>
            <li>clear, just practice</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00027D8IC Duo Lash Adhesive, Clear, 0.25 Ounce]]&lt;br</li>
            <li>( I place these under my natural lashes as I was taught by a makeup artist friend)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t stop using them!&lt;br /&gt;Not having to put mascara on my short straight lashes in the a.m.</li>
            <li>The fumes also burned my eyes just by putting the glue near my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;so far they have lasted through a major heat wave 100 degrees in NYC</li>
            <li>but u have to be careful that u do not apply too much at one time</li>
            <li>I might have used too much glue, but people can clearly see the dried glue on my lashes...</li>

            <li> , it dries white and not clear</li>
            <li> Wanted the Black not the clear</li>
            <li> I have read reviews saying it dries clear; but no matter how little I use it still turns white not clear.</li>
            <li> DuraLash Naturals Knot-Free Short Black (pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for attaching individual lashes to your eyes, not a full strip.</li>
            <li> which means because it was white and dried on the lashed the lashes had to be aremoved.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t need to order another bottle since I only used a few drops.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold lashes on as long as the stuff that comes in the little vial with a &amp;#34;starter pack&amp;#34; of Ardell lashes.</li>
            <li> I used this to help a longer wear out of my eyelid tape due to my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Not a pretty pictures&lt;</li>
            <li> Felt like my lashes been on forever but use it carefully because if not it is not coming off!</li>
            <li> This glue is not very strong but will do the job for a day.</li>
            <li> so, you only need to put a small dot of adhesive on either a piece of foil,  a small mirror,  or a jade stone</li>
            <li> off half way through the night</li>
            <li> you do need to order a little brush or something to apply the adhesive with</li>
            <li> Firmly They Were Too Flexible</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product because I just ended up throwing it away because of lack of description.</li>
            <li> It dries so stiff</li>
            <li> (like 3 hrs in)&lt;br /&gt;not worth it :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible took out so many of my lashes even with the remover it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference between the two is.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed when I discovered that when I put my eyelashes on the glue dried having a crinkled look and was not very discreet like other adhesives I had previously tried.</li>
            <li> And Really Hard To Remove.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to use</li>
            <li> i learned this the hard way!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> otherwise all your hard work will be wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I found it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> My artificial eyelashes also fell off shortly after applying.</li>
            <li> Its impossible to remove without a glue remover of some sort and definitely did not come off even after 2 days of sleep and showers and face wash.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s irritating.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really uncomfortable when you blink</li>
            <li> Not good!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Really Disappointing !</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also have to remember if your using make up remover use one that does not have an oil base</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This Made My Eyes Water Severely, Really Didn&#x27;t Get What I Paid &amp; Was Hoping For. Smell Is A Health Hazard In My Opinion And Really Didn&#x27;t Hold The Lashes Firmly They Were Too Flexible And Really Hard To Remove. I Removed Alot Of My Own Lashes In The Process. Really Disappointing !</li>
            <li> Love that it lasts just as long as the black glue but the down side to this product is that most people have a side affect that is unfavorable such as itchy eyes swelling and discharge</li>
            <li> This product is really great and long wear. I used this to help a longer wear out of my eyelid tape due to my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Holds lashes perfectly and is undetectably clear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible took out so many of my lashes even with the remover it doesn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s really uncomfortable when you blink</li>
            <li> Great glue for Ardell lashes and dries quickly. I recommend this seller and I love it!</li>
            <li> I dont like it only used once, it dries white and not clear which means because it was white and dried on the lashed the lashes had to be aremoved.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t workout for me. i burns my eyes when applied to my eyelash line.&lt;br /&gt;maybe it is just me? i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to use but I&#x27;ll keep trying</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great size!</li>
            <li> Ive used this brand for years. It&#x27;s great for individual lashes. They stay on for weeks. My only suggestion is that you remember to always replace the cap in between lash applications. The glue is fast drying and the more its open to air, over time the stuff in the bottle will become thicker and harder to use. The price is good and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have read reviews saying it dries clear; but no matter how little I use it still turns white not clear. I use the dark now and am more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This eyelash glue is not at all sticky, doesnt work,  I don&#x27;t know how they even call it glue.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> dries clear you just have to be very careful not to get it in your eyes but it works well</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is excellent.  I cannot wear the black Lashtite because it irritates my eyes, but the clear works fine.  If Lashtite is used properly, your eyelash extensions will stay on until you decide to take them off.  This product has worked well with different brands of lash extensions.</li>
            <li> I ordered the clear glue to use iwth individual lashes for the very first time and am very impressed by it&#x27;s sticking power! Its impossible to remove without a glue remover of some sort and definitely did not come off even after 2 days of sleep and showers and face wash. I had to order a glue remover that will hopefully work. When applying this glue, use sparingly and try not to glue it to your eyelid like I did because when it dries attached to my skin, it&#x27;s irritating. I&#x27;m a newbie at applying individual lashes so I don&#x27;t think I will be using this glue again until I have had more practice. It dries so stiff and then the lashes start to clump together on my eyes. I might have used too much glue, but people can clearly see the dried glue on my lashes...I wouldn&#x27;t need to order another bottle since I only used a few drops. This bottle would probably last a life time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmo student, and were learning how to do semi-permanent lashed and this product does wonders!! All my clients are very satisfy with the results. I&#x27;ve tried it on myself and I personally love it!! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;OBVIOUSLY&lt;br /&gt;you have to purchase the lash glue remover because, If you don&#x27;t you eyelashes will get pulled out!! Not a pretty pictures&lt;br /&gt;*dries clear, just practice&lt;br /&gt;try it out</li>
            <li> Maggie G has a pretty good review of this product, and you can find a ton of videos on youtube as to how to put on individual lashes...you just have to use the application method that works best for you ( I place these under my natural lashes as I was taught by a makeup artist friend)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNINGS:  This glue can and will hold for your individual lashes in place for 2 -3 weeks, do not even attempt to pull them off otherwise...you will also be pulling out your own lashes....( trust me i learned this the hard way!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you feel a burning sensation from \\&quot;fumes\\&quot; then you have too much glue on the lash end, also you need to be sure you apply this to your lashes, not on your skin, because if you apply it to your skin it will only last several hrs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also have to remember if your using make up remover use one that does not have an oil base otherwise all your hard work will be wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you find out what method works best for you... I suggest you make time for yourself and have patience and practice...practice...practice and when you think you got it practice some more...trust me on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for Indivual lashes...not strip lashes, for Strip lashes I suggest Duo glue [[ASIN:B00027D8IC Duo Lash Adhesive, Clear, 0.25 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This dries super quick! so, you only need to put a small dot of adhesive on either a piece of foil,  a small mirror,  or a jade stone [[ASIN:B006972O6G Eyelash Extension Jade Stone Glue Pallet 2 Inch Wide]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this item yesterday and put on a set of [[ASIN:B006S0EZYS DuraLash Naturals Knot-Free Short Black (pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far they have lasted through a major heat wave 100 degrees in NYC + and two cool showers...and are still holding strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  one or two lashes have fallen out after about a week, but its was a quick fix and all is well.</li>
            <li> This eyelash glue isn&#x27;t the sticky type. It has a very strong smell kinda like nail polish or nail polish remover and irritates eyes. This glue is made for permalashes not the kind you wear everyday. Know that! Just know that before buying :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok. It doesn&#x27;t hold lashes on as long as the stuff that comes in the little vial with a &amp;#34;starter pack&amp;#34; of Ardell lashes. I&#x27;m not sure what the difference between the two is. That being said, my lashes still stay put for anywhere from 3 to 7 days. Buyers beware....Lash extensions are like CRACK! You just can&#x27;t stop using them!&lt;br /&gt;Not having to put mascara on my short straight lashes in the a.m. saves me a HUGE amount of time!! And getting the day&#x27;s makeup off is much easier without having to deal with mascara.</li>
            <li> buy it&lt;br /&gt;didnt like it&lt;br /&gt;came off half way through the night (like 3 hrs in)&lt;br /&gt;not worth it :(</li>
            <li> Works great! Felt like my lashes been on forever but use it carefully because if not it is not coming off! Lol</li>
            <li> I was expecting this product to be really good because I had heard many good reviews previously...but I was disappointed when I discovered that when I put my eyelashes on the glue dried having a crinkled look and was not very discreet like other adhesives I had previously tried. The fumes also burned my eyes just by putting the glue near my eyes. My artificial eyelashes also fell off shortly after applying. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well when I need it. I don&#x27;t always use it as I have lash extensions but when I need to fill them in it works really well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold like I thought it was going to!</li>
            <li> This glue is not very strong but will do the job for a day. But on a good note, it&#x27;s not so strong that it pulls out your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> I found it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Description does not tell you what this is exactly for. It&#x27;s for attaching individual lashes to your eyes, not a full strip. I wasted my money on this product because I just ended up throwing it away because of lack of description.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to be the best, but oh surprise... Not good!! Will not stick my lashes on at all!</li>
            <li> Glue works great and it is clear and does not have that disgusting gross sticky feeling on your eyes you do need to order a little brush or something to apply the adhesive with I used a q tip but u have to be careful that u do not apply too much at one time u can either apply directly to eyelash or to your own eye either way works fine they also shipped super fast so I am happy with the product</li>
            <li> Wanted the Black not the clear</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as it said it would. After a day the lashes started to fall off. Was very disappointed. Hopefully I will a better product!!</li>
