    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am so happy to have discovered this product when I did!</li>
            <li>They were wonderful!  </li>
            <li>But my skin feels and looks great after use!</li>
            <li>Best observed over a period of time.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say this one of my best buys ever!!!</li>
            <li>Good idea to take pictures before, during and after.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use!</li>
            <li>She uses it on her knee every night for 30 minutes with surprisingly good results!</li>
            <li>Bought for my mom who has beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>It has been four years since I  began using this product and I am as happy with the product as I was then.  </li>
            <li>all of which have greatly been reduced.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I took the risk with this product.  </li>
            <li>but when I saw a friend who hadn&#x27;t seen me in almost a year, she said that my skin looked great.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the Omnilux is twice as bright as this.</li>
            <li>I started to see good results after four weeks.</li>
            <li>Good luck to you.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good product and think it will work, but I just haven&#x27;t disciplined myself to do it.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I needed to replace a cord on one of my units, and I received excellent customer service from Lightstim when they sent me a new cord.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product!  </li>
            <li>That is when I knew for sure that my lightstim was doing what was promised.</li>
            <li>I love that the results are permanent.</li>
            <li>It does what it promises and I love what it is doing for my face.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I will see more.</li>
            <li>I also noticed my sagging neck was looking better and more lifted.  </li>
            <li>I have to use an extension cord if I use it while watching TV, which is most of the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will look for something more durable.</li>
            <li>Looking forward in the months to come to see some even greater results as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the LightSlim.</li>
            <li>Item arrived safely and works as described.</li>
            <li>And I have to say my skin is so much better since I started using this.  </li>
            <li>I was complimented by a kind stranger last week about how beautiful my skin was.  </li>
            <li>Combined with my Clarisonic and good skin products I am positive I will see more results.</li>
            <li>This must not be uncommon in that the manual clearly states if this happens to return it for a refund.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, I just do the treatments while I watch</li>
            <li>It is easy...</li>
            <li>I used this faithfully for weeks with no result whatsoever  for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My fine lines did reduce around my eyes, forehead and mouth.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have never had crows feet</li>
            <li>but I did have some redness at  the outside corners of my eyes which has been greatly reduced since I began using Lightstim twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll check out some of the fillers available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous product otherwise</li>
            <li>feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>Combine it with a professional facial every so often &#x3D; even better results!!!!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>so it will be interesting to see if they notice my younger looking skin:).</li>
            <li>I saw some changes, but mainly it cleared my skin better than it addressed wrinkles.</li>
            <li>First thing that has helped in years!</li>
            <li>They do want to help, and apparently with patience and being religious with using it, it will do some good!</li>
            <li>so I have time  to devote to the longer and more frequent sessions.</li>
            <li>Have used this for about 2 months now &amp; it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Might want to give it a try if you are looking for something more direct and results oriented than just all those \\&quot;creams\\&quot; that are out there.</li>
            <li>That result alone was worth it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really give this a fair shake because I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  </li>
            <li>I am still seeing consistent results.  </li>
            <li>however don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s not had enough time yet to be able to judge it.</li>
            <li>Together with a healthy lifestyle and daily skin care this product is a</li>
            <li>I will continue using it, and try to be more regular with the treatments to see if it continues to improve my skin.  </li>
            <li>have used it on my hands and they have a much better texture and appearance overall too.</li>
            <li>as I have&lt;br /&gt;not been using it consistently.</li>
            <li>Check back in a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>Also, I am wondering if I was shipped a first quality product.  </li>
            <li>The Lightstim did not arrive in the packaging as shown on Amazon, rather it was placed in a clear plastic case, somewhat like a cheap make-up bag.  </li>
            <li>The product states that you need to use LightStim 5 days a week for the first 6 - 8 weeks and after that 2 days a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li>, it has helped dramatically with my adult acne and that alone is worth the price for me!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say or not say that I&#x27;ve had positive reults, but, I think it does help.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised they are about the same price, when the Omnilux seems like a far superior product to the LightStim.  </li>
            <li>I really trusted him to be real</li>
            <li>so I spent more than $200 on it.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t read the reviewsâ€¦.I</li>
            <li>I will use this unit forever as I believe it really works.</li>
            <li>The LightStim is very lightweight. .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li>I asked my esthetician if LightStim really works</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but nothing really noticeable.</li>
            <li>Low rating because it might be too soon to tell any significant difference.  </li>
            <li>It can be a little drying if used in winter months so a good serum or misture cream is necessary.</li>
            <li>I love the facial like feeling the LIfeStim affords while at the same time diminishing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this light 3 times, but after the first use the pores were dramatically smaller.</li>
            <li>Before applying my foundation (which has sunscreen in it) I apply a moisturizer with sunscreen as well, which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the new cords are of better quality then they previously were.  </li>
            <li>Please note that this time could easily be cut in half (about 20 minutes) three to four times a week with similiar results.</li>
            <li>and it sounded like it would help improve my skin and soften those old lady wrinkles!  </li>
            <li>Really has almost erased the lines at the outside corners of my eyes completely already.</li>
            <li>I am an early riser</li>
            <li>I started about 2 years ago when I was 66 years old.  </li>
            <li>Still to early to see permanent results but</li>
            <li>(I am 62 years old).  </li>
            <li>I am 34 years old and purchased this 2 years ago</li>
            <li>Low and behold, about 4 months later (of regular daily use)I began to see improvement in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I have been fortunate to always have younger looking skin, but I do have the typical frown lines as well as forehead wrinkles</li>
            <li>I normally use my Lightstims daily, but there are times when I need to skip  two or three treatments and that has proved not be a problem.</li>
            <li>I actually have good skin, but I am obsessed about maintaining my youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li>and I can tell a major difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>So sad tonight when I plug it in for the first time and it won&#x27;t turn on, and I even tried it in several outlets to be sure it wasn&#x27;t the outlet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its all in my head, but apparently it helps to build collagen.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have been using LightStim for just over four weeks and saw results after only three days!  </li>
            <li>The one draw back is that it takes about 40 minutes to an hour to complete the neck and face nightly, with three minutes in each spot treated.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this every day for the full 8 weeks and then plan to use it at least 3 to 4 times a week..</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer, the pores smaller, and the wrinkles are less defined.</li>

            <li> My skin is much softer, the pores smaller, and the wrinkles are less defined.</li>
            <li> My normal Lightstim routine is now a one half hour treatment in the morning, occasionally I will do an additional treatment in the evening only because it is so relaxing.</li>
            <li> When we get older, every little bit</li>
            <li> It is a small matter really</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical at first then disappointed, then happy.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny -- I have been using for approximately 2 months</li>
            <li> , I have actually purchased a second unit to cut my treatment time in half.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 4 weeks, I noticed less lines above my lips and my overall skin looked brighter.  </li>
            <li> No new wrinkles have formed in that time.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> After spending several hours researching different products I anxiously awaited two day delivery of the Lightstim.  </li>
            <li> No new wrinkles have appeared in the eight months since I started using my Lightstims!</li>
            <li> Also lines on other areas on my face overall are now much less noticeable as well.</li>
            <li> A lot of other devices just give temporary results.  </li>
            <li> The other night I went to turn it on</li>
            <li> Also, if you want to do your entire face, neck, etc, it is time consuming as the unit is so small.</li>
            <li> Obsessed and want the big professional one.</li>
            <li> I always look forward to sitting down with my lightstim, the warmth of it is so relaxing.</li>
            <li> You can feel the increased tightness and the buildup of the collagen after each treatment, that feeling gradually decreases between treatments and you will eventually learn when it is time to sit down for another treatment.</li>
            <li> and might be slight improvement</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> LightStim for wrinkles is absolutely a waste of money because using the directions provided it has done nothing to improve my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I could probably get by with 3-4 treatments a week rather then everyday, but it is because it relaxes me that I am doing it everyday.</li>
            <li> A few dirt marks on the handle contributed to this suspicion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting, patiently, and although I do see very slight results I am hoping with continued use</li>
            <li> WASTE, waste of money!</li>
            <li> My usual  LightStim routine is 30 to 45 minutes in the morning five days a week using two LightStims.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s usually the cord.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Skin tone and texture improved. Obsessed and want the big professional one. Recommend to everyone... Healing for skin before and after procedures too</li>
            <li> I have this \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; and honstly after using it for 3 months have noticed my skin feels a l cittle thicker.  I don&#x27;t know if its all in my head, but apparently it helps to build collagen.  The lines around my eyes also seem diminished.  It can be a little drying if used in winter months so a good serum or misture cream is necessary.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This item made my pores look smaller but I had to use it every day.  No improvement at all on wrinkles...they look deeper than before using the lightstim.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.&lt;br /&gt;Too difficult to return/exchange. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this.</li>
            <li> LightStim for wrinkles is absolutely a waste of money because using the directions provided it has done nothing to improve my wrinkles.  It is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on #The Steve Harvey Show.  I really trusted him to be real so I spent more than $200 on it.  Not only does it burn you after five minutes, but there was NO appreciable difference after a month of faithfully using it.  Even took it on vacation with me.  VERY frustrating purchase.  WASTE, waste of money!</li>
            <li> I used this faithfully for weeks with no result whatsoever  for fine lines and wrinkles. It does seem to help with pain-- but worthless for wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Four year update: 05/2016  It has been four years since I  began using this product and I am as happy with the product as I was then.  No new wrinkles have formed in that time. My usual  LightStim routine is 30 to 45 minutes in the morning five days a week using two LightStims. Please note that this time could easily be cut in half (about 20 minutes) three to four times a week with similiar results. I am an early riser so I have time  to devote to the longer and more frequent sessions. It is an amazing product.  Five year update:  03/2017  This product is still part of my morning (and sometimes evening) routine.  I can&#x27;t imagine being without it.  04/2012   I am 60 years old and have been using LightStim for just over four weeks and saw results after only three days!  Fortunately, I have never had crows feet but I did have some redness at  the outside corners of my eyes which has been greatly reduced since I began using Lightstim twice a day.  I have been fortunate to always have younger looking skin, but I do have the typical frown lines as well as forehead wrinkles all of which have greatly been reduced. My skin is much softer, the pores smaller, and the wrinkles are less defined. I was complimented by a kind stranger last week about how beautiful my skin was.  That is when I knew for sure that my lightstim was doing what was promised. I am anxious to see what the results will be after the recommended eight weeks! I always look forward to sitting down with my lightstim, the warmth of it is so relaxing. After each treatment I apply a moisturizer. Before applying my foundation (which has sunscreen in it) I apply a moisturizer with sunscreen as well, which I highly recommend. I never thought that a product could do what Lightstim is doing for me, and that is to reverse the aging process without having a face lift. I can&#x27;t imagine ever being without this product again!  Product Updates: It has now been eight weeks and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! It is niceto look in the mirror and see a younger version of me again!  I am so happy that I took the risk with this product.  It is now eight months later and am still using my Lightstims. Yes, I did say Lightstims, I have actually purchased a second unit to cut my treatment time in half. My normal Lightstim routine is now a one half hour treatment in the morning, occasionally I will do an additional treatment in the evening only because it is so relaxing. You can feel the increased tightness and the buildup of the collagen after each treatment, that feeling gradually decreases between treatments and you will eventually learn when it is time to sit down for another treatment. I could probably get by with 3-4 treatments a week rather then everyday, but it is because it relaxes me that I am doing it everyday. No new wrinkles have appeared in the eight months since I started using my Lightstims! I love, love, love this product!  I have now been using my Lightstims for eighteen months. I normally use my Lightstims daily, but there are times when I need to skip  two or three treatments and that has proved not be a problem. I needed to replace a cord on one of my units, and I received excellent customer service from Lightstim when they sent me a new cord. I have noticed that the new cords are of better quality then they previously were.  It is now two years and two months since I have started using Lightstim.  I am still seeing consistent results.  I am so happy to have discovered this product when I did!</li>
            <li> I love that the results are permanent. A lot of other devices just give temporary results.  I started to see good results after four weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using the LightStim every night since it arrived which has been four weeks now.  I can tell a difference already. Further evidence of this is when I went to see my hairdresser last week, he wanted to know if I had had something done because I looked younger than I did when I saw him last which was back at the end of October.  I will continue to use this every day for the full 8 weeks and then plan to use it at least 3 to 4 times a week..</li>
            <li> I checked all the previous reviews before purchasing this product, but sorry to say it did nothing for me. Tried it faithfully every night for 8 weeks, but saw no difference at all. Guess I&#x27;ll check out some of the fillers available.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t acquired the results I had hoped for however don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s not had enough time yet to be able to judge it.</li>
            <li> I love the facial like feeling the LIfeStim affords while at the same time diminishing wrinkles.  Together with a healthy lifestyle and daily skin care this product is a must have to further enhance your skin&#x27;s beauty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Lightstim going on 3 yrs.  I used it off and on, but never months at a time.  I couldn&#x27;t say or not say that I&#x27;ve had positive reults, but, I think it does help.  The last couple weeks I&#x27;ve been using it about 4 days a week.  The other night I went to turn it on and it went on and off.  I called Customer Service at Lightstim.  They were wonderful!  I read somewhere else that this happens and it&#x27;s usually the cord.  As I described it to them (customer service) they said it sounds like the cord and are sending me another.  I told them that I hoped that&#x27;s all it is.  They said that if it isn&#x27;t to just call them back and they&#x27;ll have me send it in and fix it.  They didn&#x27;t charge me for the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to call Lightstim!  They do want to help, and apparently with patience and being religious with using it, it will do some good!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my wrinkles.  Good luck to you.</li>
            <li> This product works. I read about similar products that stop working this one is to work for a lifetime even if you use it up to 250 hours a week!! LOOOVE IT! It does what it promises and I love what it is doing for my face.</li>
            <li> OK. I&#x27;m waiting, patiently, and although I do see very slight results I am hoping with continued use I will see more. Let&#x27;s face it- there are no miracles out there, so whatever help I can get I&#x27;ll take it. Combined with my Clarisonic and good skin products I am positive I will see more results.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t read the reviewsâ€¦.I can&#x27;t deal with it being a plug-in item. I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it had I known. It&#x27;s a fabulous product otherwise but such a pain to not be cordless/chargeable.</li>
            <li> Be patient!  I was so skeptical at first then disappointed, then happy.  Because of the cost of the unit I hung in there.  I started about 2 years ago when I was 66 years old.  Low and behold, about 4 months later (of regular daily use)I began to see improvement in fine lines.  I also noticed my sagging neck was looking better and more lifted.  I will use this unit forever as I believe it really works.</li>
            <li> Have been using it as directed for a month and have seen no change.  Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> At the spa I work at, we use the LightStim and we also use the Omnilux New-U.  The LightStim is very lightweight. . feels cheap.  Not to mention the Omnilux is twice as bright as this. I&#x27;m surprised they are about the same price, when the Omnilux seems like a far superior product to the LightStim.  The TV show The Doctors even recommended the Omnilux on one of their shows, it&#x27;s on YouTube. But what do I know, I&#x27;m just a licensed esthetician.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I saw it on Dr. Oz  and it sounded like it would help improve my skin and soften those old lady wrinkles!  The instructions say to take a picture of yourself before you start using it and then again in 8 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t take the picture but when I saw a friend who hadn&#x27;t seen me in almost a year, she said that my skin looked great.  No one has ever told me that before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the LightStim semi-regularly all over my face and neck, not just in the \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; area.  I use it on my frown lines, in the area below my eyes/cheeks ( but you have to either wear the goggles provided or close your eyes for eye protection), my upper lip and under my chin.  They include a 10 ml bottle of Collagen Peptide Serum that they recommend putting on your skin twice a day before you use the laser.  I do wish this came with a rechargeable battery instead of an electric cord.  I have to use an extension cord if I use it while watching TV, which is most of the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 4 weeks, I noticed less lines above my lips and my overall skin looked brighter.  I will continue using it, and try to be more regular with the treatments to see if it continues to improve my skin.  I will be visiting some family who haven&#x27;t seen me in quite awhile so it will be interesting to see if they notice my younger looking skin:). I am now a laser fan.</li>
            <li> Just another gimmicke that I fell for. I&#x27;ve used this product for 5 weeks and&lt;br /&gt;sometimes I think my wrinkles are coming in thicker. No visible sign that this&lt;br /&gt;lightstim is working. I would return it but I did not keep the recipt.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and after 18 months of use, it broke. It is not sturdy, and I would not purchase this product again. I will look for something more durable. Also, I did use it about 3- 5 times per week for a year, and then twice per week after that. I saw some changes, but mainly it cleared my skin better than it addressed wrinkles. Also, if you want to do your entire face, neck, etc, it is time consuming as the unit is so small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very well. Still to early to see permanent results but&lt;br /&gt;my skin started to glow after 1st use.</li>
            <li> Have used this for about 2 months now &amp; it is worth the price.  Really has almost erased the lines at the outside corners of my eyes completely already. (I am 62 years old).  Also lines on other areas on my face overall are now much less noticeable as well. Easy to use, I just do the treatments while I watch TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also have used it on my hands and they have a much better texture and appearance overall too. Looking forward in the months to come to see some even greater results as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pleasure to find a product that actually delivers what it claims.  Might want to give it a try if you are looking for something more direct and results oriented than just all those \\&quot;creams\\&quot; that are out there.</li>
            <li> I love the LightSlim. My skins always feels very&lt;br /&gt;soft after using. It is easy... a bit time consuming. Results - hard to tell, as I have&lt;br /&gt;not been using it consistently. Me bad.  But my skin feels and looks great after use!</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny -- I have been using for approximately 2 months and I can tell a major difference in my skin tone.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Item arrived safely and works as described. Best observed over a period of time.  Good idea to take pictures before, during and after.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use! Combine it with a professional facial every so often &#x3D; even better results!!!!</li>
            <li> Low rating because it might be too soon to tell any significant difference.  It&#x27;s been a month.  Used it regularly (daily).  Check back in a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> I have only used this light 3 times, but after the first use the pores were dramatically smaller. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it or looking for it. I just looked in the mirror while washing my hands the next morning and was shocked at the difference. That result alone was worth it. I hate large pores.</li>
            <li> I purchased the LightStim about 4 months ago.  I did my research prior to purchasing the product so there was some thought into it, not some random impulse buy. I purchased it as part of my skin care regime and I must say that even though you may not see immediate results, they do come over time.  I did as the company recommended and took some photos.  My fine lines did reduce around my eyes, forehead and mouth. Nothing dramatic but noticeable through the pictures and that&#x27;s good enough for me. I plan to use this for maintenance care and to booster collagen growth in my nightly skin care ritual. When we get older, every little bit helps!&lt;br /&gt;If nothing else, it has helped dramatically with my adult acne and that alone is worth the price for me!  The one draw back is that it takes about 40 minutes to an hour to complete the neck and face nightly, with three minutes in each spot treated.  It is a small matter really but I thought I would mention that.</li>
            <li> After spending several hours researching different products I anxiously awaited two day delivery of the Lightstim.  So sad tonight when I plug it in for the first time and it won&#x27;t turn on, and I even tried it in several outlets to be sure it wasn&#x27;t the outlet.This must not be uncommon in that the manual clearly states if this happens to return it for a refund.  At over $200 I believe they should have worked this stuff out beforehand.  Also, I am wondering if I was shipped a first quality product.  The Lightstim did not arrive in the packaging as shown on Amazon, rather it was placed in a clear plastic case, somewhat like a cheap make-up bag.  A few dirt marks on the handle contributed to this suspicion but I would have set that aside if the product powered on.&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve printed the RA and back it goes tomorrow. Not sure if I will try this brand again as I&#x27;m turned off by the experience.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really give this a fair shake because I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  I think it is a good product and think it will work, but I just haven&#x27;t disciplined myself to do it. You need to hold it for 3 minutes in each spot of your face.  So a person needs to give themselves 20 - 30 minutes to cover their face.  I asked my esthetician if LightStim really works and she told me it does.  The product states that you need to use LightStim 5 days a week for the first 6 - 8 weeks and after that 2 days a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old and purchased this 2 years ago and I have to say this one of my best buys ever!!! It is my little secret. I dont use it religiously. Ill go a month when I do it every night, then skip a month.  I actually have good skin, but I am obsessed about maintaining my youthful looking skin. And I have to say my skin is so much better since I started using this.  I noticed my frown lines and wrinkles around my eyes are slowly going away. Highly recommended! Dont hesitate, BUY THIS NOW!</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Four weeks and might be slight improvement but nothing really noticeable.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom who has beautiful skin.  She has been using for chronic knee pain and loves it!  First thing that has helped in years! She uses it on her knee every night for 30 minutes with surprisingly good results!</li>
