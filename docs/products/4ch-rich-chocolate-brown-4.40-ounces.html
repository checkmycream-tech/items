    <ol>
            <li>The color is brilliant!</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li>Colors hair perfectly, smells good and no skin irritation!  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find a dye that was 60% organic</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue using it!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled that I did.  </li>
            <li>Love this color, it&#x27;s true to my own; i was growing out my own hair</li>
            <li>lovely photo bears no resemblance to reality ...     </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>It was okay, I think I need a darker color which is my own fault for not ordering the right shade</li>
            <li>This hair color was very rich in color and it was easy to do as well.</li>
            <li>The shipment was very quick and I like this product</li>
            <li>cause it doesn&#x27;t smell strong and nature.</li>
            <li>the color looks good on me, so I am happy but be for-warned, if you have darker hair or hair that sucks up a lot of color, you may want to pick a shade or two lighter in this brand of color.</li>
            <li>Super easy to mix, and no toxic ammonia smell.</li>
            <li>rich brown color.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t seem right, but I followed them to a T!</li>
            <li>no bad smell.</li>
            <li>having a sensitive highly allergic system, I was able to safely apply this to my hair.</li>
            <li>DO the skin test first !</li>
            <li>Also it has more natural ingredients so there is no foul smell during coloring.</li>
            <li>I used this product without washing and drying hair first....</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing this brand.</li>
            <li>though priced higher than Nuturtint ...</li>
            <li>I would absolutely go for this product again</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels after the color</li>
            <li>as many of the other brands do.  </li>
            <li>price is high, compare to say Herbatint.</li>
            <li>I thought, so I am dying my hair clean and wet????</li>
            <li>I do recommend not washing your hair first, as when you apply color to wet hair it absorbs the color more so it may wind up too dark.  </li>
            <li>definitely an inferior product ...    have to pile on hot coconut oil to help condition hair ...     </li>
            <li>My hair is really soft, shiny and the color looks so natural!</li>
            <li>On the upside, my hair came out silky soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>The color, on my hair,  was nowhere near the color on the box.</li>
            <li>It holds the color very well, and is much truer in shade than other brands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is barely any conditioner in the conditioner packet that is inside the box, and for people with longer hair</li>
            <li>Neverthless, I am a newly converted believer, will see how long this color will last</li>
            <li>On the down side, the color came out much darker than the color on the box.</li>

            <li> i do not have grey</li>
            <li> with Nuturtint one can wash hair the day before ... then apply product to dry hair ...     </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t dry up your hair</li>
            <li> this product ... requires shampoo before applying product to wet hair ...</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair in the past and it would often break my hair or cause it to dry out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this dye for a few months</li>
            <li> a waste of time and money ...</li>
            <li> If u keep your hair dirty, your natural oils will protect your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical once I read the directions; wash hair, towel dry....</li>
            <li> i was determined to stop dying my hair and leave the gray alone, I was disappointed with how the gray hair looked, just not has classy as i thought.</li>
            <li> One thing that I don&#x27;t like its a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Seemed to dry my hair out really badly.</li>
            <li> need to re-apply a Nuturtint color to cover-up this ugly orange color ...</li>
            <li> blech! ! !  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product without washing and drying hair first....actually applying color to slightly dirty hair, as usually recommended with salon coloring, and the results were just as beautiful, even covering my grays.....I don&#x27;t use anything else......LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li> i like this color. no bad smell. rich brown color. i do not have grey so i can not say if it works well for that.</li>
            <li> I have been using this dye for a few months and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is barely any conditioner in the conditioner packet that is inside the box, and for people with longer hair it is truly pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is high, compare to say Herbatint.</li>
            <li> For years, I colored my hair with Naturtint, until one day, when the store ran out of it, and I had to get this brand instead.  I was thrilled that I did.  It holds the color very well, and is much truer in shade than other brands.  This is now my go-to box.</li>
            <li> The shipment was very quick and I like this product cause it doesn&#x27;t smell strong and nature. One thing that I don&#x27;t like its a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> This hair color was very rich in color and it was easy to do as well. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on the idea of coloring my hair at home. I was very pleased with the results. Super easy to mix, and no toxic ammonia smell. I would absolutely go for this product again</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Colors hair perfectly, smells good and no skin irritation!  The only hair color I will use!</li>
            <li> Love this color, it&#x27;s true to my own; i was growing out my own hair i was determined to stop dying my hair and leave the gray alone, I was disappointed with how the gray hair looked, just not has classy as i thought. I had a spot in the front that was practically all white, then dusting of white here and there, i was not liking it.  I was happy to find a dye that was 60% organic and i&#x27;m very pleased.  I do recommend not washing your hair first, as when you apply color to wet hair it absorbs the color more so it may wind up too dark.  If u keep your hair dirty, your natural oils will protect your scalp.  Neverthless, I am a newly converted believer, will see how long this color will last</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing this brand. I was skeptical once I read the directions; wash hair, towel dry....I thought, so I am dying my hair clean and wet???? Just didn&#x27;t seem right, but I followed them to a T! The color is brilliant! No stains on my skin. My hair is really soft, shiny and the color looks so natural! DEFINITELY sticking with this brand!</li>
            <li> blech! ! !  yucko ... ugly-simo ...     goes on orange ... clashes w/ skin tone ...DO NOT GET IF ASIAN/golden SKIN COLOR ... CLASHES ...     inferior to Nuturtint in every way ...    with Nuturtint one can wash hair the day before ... then apply product to dry hair ...     w/ this product ... requires shampoo before applying product to wet hair ... inessential extra step ... time-consuming ...    amount of conditioner is paltry and an inferior product ... does nothing to condition hair after destruction to hair strand ... does nothing to seal the cuticle of the hair strands ... no gloss, no nothing ...     product box lovely photo bears no resemblance to reality ...     instructions lack clarity and organization or any graphics or color to help comprehend application process ...    overpriced ...    though priced higher than Nuturtint ... definitely an inferior product ...    have to pile on hot coconut oil to help condition hair ...     regret purchase ... regret applying this to my hair ...     need to re-apply a Nuturtint color to cover-up this ugly orange color ... yuck-o! ! !    a waste of time and money ... never again ...    back to Nuturtint!</li>
            <li> Seemed to dry my hair out really badly.</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels after the color and it didn&#x27;t dry up your hair as many of the other brands do.  Also it has more natural ingredients so there is no foul smell during coloring.</li>
            <li> On the upside, my hair came out silky soft and radiant. The color has not faded and I colored it about a month ago. I absolutely love the way it made my hair feel. On the down side, the color came out much darker than the color on the box. the color looks good on me, so I am happy but be for-warned, if you have darker hair or hair that sucks up a lot of color, you may want to pick a shade or two lighter in this brand of color.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this product! I have dyed my hair in the past and it would often break my hair or cause it to dry out. This isn&#x27;t the case with tints of nature. I love it and will continue using it!</li>
            <li> It was okay, I think I need a darker color which is my own fault for not ordering the right shade</li>
            <li> having a sensitive highly allergic system, I was able to safely apply this to my hair. color is as shown, it will hold, covered the grays, and added shine. DO the skin test first !</li>
            <li> The color, on my hair,  was nowhere near the color on the box.</li>
