            <li>Love the pinkish tone, and the price was worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>Service was fast, packaging great!</li>
            <li>Two coats is all you need and you get full coverage, and a beautiful sparkle.</li>
            <li>Just one swipe gives a nice level of sparkle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because I really enjoyed wearing this gorgeous color with all the sparkle - like jewelry on my fingernails.......</li>
            <li>After a week of great fun wearing it, I set about the task of removal.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this-and so do my friends!</li>
            <li>I very rarely buy nail polish, but I fell in love with this one!</li>
            <li>I love this and don&#x27;t regret buying it one bit..</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this color -- the pictures don&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
            <li>I have recieved so many compliments :)</li>
            <li>Can be used alone (2-3 coats recommended) or on top of another color to make it pop.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>I totally love this polish.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite polishes from OPI.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very long-lasting and it looks great on the nails.</li>
            <li>I think it would be better with another color underneath.</li>
            <li>I love the sparkle in this color.   </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this nail polish</li>
            <li>I love this OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li>i love love love love the katy perry polish.</li>
            <li>i have gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love love love it.</li>
            <li>With two coats, the color is a lot more sparkly and more glittery.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE holographic glitter polishes.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s 10x more glitter in this</li>
            <li>and I LOVE sparkles.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color and polish.  </li>
            <li>I have used it many times and have yet to find a polish close to it to use once this one runs out.</li>
            <li>OPI is the best nail polish ever and these colors are great not to bold or dramatic, and i also purchased for my neice who loves katy perry, and she loved it</li>
            <li>I love this as a top coat over another light shade to add sparkle.  </li>
            <li>This color wasn&#x27;t my favorite Katy Perry color, but it has quickly become one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>Very sweet and discrete tone.</li>
            <li>But to be honest, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for quite some time, and still have plenty left, decent sized bottle, great color, good for the price, arrived quickly! :)</li>
            <li>Good polish, highly overpriced.</li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorite OPI colors!  </li>
            <li>but i will enjoy my mini</li>
            <li>I have been using cheap store brands of nail polish all my life.   </li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous and the glitter is soft yet sparkly.</li>
            <li>This is my main polish...goes with most everything!</li>
            <li>But despite this issue, I would still purchase more because it really is a pretty color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so FUN to wear!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this gorgeous pink glitter.</li>
            <li>so it is fun to wear but not so overpowering or bright that you can wear it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful color, and it is hard to imagine something more sparkly.  </li>
            <li>Not what I&#x27;m expected but it was a welcome surprise.</li>
            <li>i wont be buying the full size bottle</li>
            <li>I was actually wearing Sally Hansem Strobe Light when I bought this, and I love this so much more.</li>
            <li>I am 20, a full time student, and work full time.</li>
            <li>picture doesn&#x27;t do any justice compare to how lovely it looks in real life.</li>
            <li>When I want a super glittery effect, I use 2 to 3 coats without needing any color underneath.  </li>
            <li>I have to use it quickly</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase this because I never owned a O.P.I nail polish before because of its high price, well this color looked very pretty and have seen this in many haul videos.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY pretty.  </li>
            <li>This is a very pretty sparkly nail polish from OPI</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite color.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is really pretty and the color look so lovely on your nails, like very sparkly</li>
            <li>This is a PRETTY color!  </li>
            <li>as with most glitter polishes, the pieces of glitter means that the color does not dry smoothly</li>
            <li>This should remove most if not all of the glitter, and it will be easy to wipe off the bits that are left.</li>
            <li>It was very pretty but still wasn&#x27;t the right tint</li>
            <li>Very delicate and feminine, and best of all, flattering.  </li>
            <li>Great polish, but my nails chipped after a few days.  </li>
            <li>The color is really cute although the color in the picture looks to be only one light coat.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very much worth the time.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful sparkly princess pink!</li>
            <li>and I have had the experience with it getting caught on my clothing and litterally tearing right off my nails.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Received very quickly ordered on 3/17 received 3/21  overall its fine.</li>
            <li>As a recommendation to everyone, when applying this nail polish, make sure you put first a coat of clear nail polish on your nails before applying the shimmer.</li>
            <li>I do however still love it more than any other glitter polish I have found!</li>
            <li>It is a very sparkled pretty girl color, however is a little more nude and not overbearing, and I found it stays on longer and better than full out glitter nail polish.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and long lasting color though.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more then likely the lighting or camera.</li>
            <li>-- this is really pretty with a gold polish.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely my \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; nail color, fitting for any occasion, any holiday, if you want to wear sparkle.</li>
            <li>However be aware ...</li>
            <li>but I insisted they just do 2 top coats of Teenage Dream.  </li>
            <li>I really like it though it looked golden in the picture which is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li>With only one application the glitter is very noticeable, so by the third you&#x27;ve got intense, beautiful, glittery nails.</li>
            <li>it gets clumpy fast though!</li>
            <li>But.. It is pretty...</li>
            <li>The first time the nail polish just peeled off.</li>
            <li>Teenage dream is my favorite nail polish by OPI.</li>
            <li>It is one of my ultimate favorite polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wished it to be...</li>
            <li>It is pretty, but it&#x27;s more sheer with glitter instead of the intense glitter of this shade.  </li>
            <li>The color is really pretty and in the sun, the glitter is really cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i was afraid it would be so clear it would be more of a top coat but its amazing.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to remove as well unlike other glitter polishes.</li>
            <li>First of all: I love pink</li>
            <li>Fire\\&quot; by Pure Ice (sold at Wal Mart)</li>
            <li>my nail tech has to really work at it, and even then, some glitter remains.  </li>
            <li>Lovely pink color with tons of glitter</li>
            <li>and it wears very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this polish.</li>
            <li>You do have to put a couple of coats before it gets that really pertty color</li>
            <li>Very feminine and not gaudy.  </li>
            <li>If you love glitter and the color pink then you MUST order this!</li>
            <li>A handy method is the tinfoil method, which is as follows: soak 10 cotton balls in acetone remover as you usually would, but instead of wiping your nail, put one soaked cotton ball on each nail and wrap a strip of tinfoil around each one to hold it in place.</li>
            <li>This is a classic nail polish for todays sparkling nails.</li>
            <li>Goes opaque in 3 coats and looks especially great under a thin coat of Black Shatter.</li>
            <li>But, the only thing I DO NOT LIKE is that it is so chunky and sharp when dry and no amount of top coat seems to smooth it out for me.  </li>
            <li>gorgeous pale pink sparkles.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s EXACTLY the same, and</li>
            <li>However I completely recommend this for any ones collection!</li>
            <li>At 63 years old I never thought I&#x27;d be wearing sparkly nail polish!</li>
            <li>The formula is a little goopy and thick (wait for each coat to dry a bit to avoid dragging issues), but it dries very fast (ideal if you want to apply a shatter polish).</li>
            <li>I love girly colors as well as bright blues and other crazy colors.  </li>
            <li>The smaller glitter and larger reflective chunks make for a very nice visual effect, but it basically shredded the cotton I used to take it off, and I had to drape cotton soaked in polish remover over the nail for a few minutes to even attempt the onerous chore of getting it off.</li>
            <li>Its a soft, pretty pink and very shiny.</li>
            <li>The little glitter specks sparkle like tiny diamonds when the light hits!</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to put some shellac / gel polish in clear over it in order to wear the polish.  </li>
            <li>the color its self is actually a bit lighter than the picture (not by much though).</li>
            <li>Applies evenly and drys fast enough for a fast second coat.</li>
            <li>Same price as you find in stores but delivers fast.</li>
            <li>A word on removal: glitter polishes can be frustrating to remove the traditional way (and scrubbing your nails isn&#x27;t good, as it will make the glitter scratch them).</li>
            <li>I told them to put just this color on, and at first they tried to get me to pick a bottom coat of another pink</li>
            <li>It makes your nails look like pretty pink discoballs</li>
            <li>it is so blingy but still very soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>The last and final 3rd coat gave me the exact color I wanted and looked just like the photo.</li>
            <li>teenage dream is a very pretty pink with pinkish silvery tiny glitter with some bigger chunks throughout.</li>
            <li>The color is hard to find in stores now, and this is the original.</li>
            <li>I have tried it both with the black OPI crackle over top, and also plain.</li>
            <li>I really want black shatter</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have had it for quite some time, and still have plenty left, decent sized bottle, great color, good for the price, arrived quickly! :)</li>
            <li> Good polish, highly overpriced.</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite OPI colors!  </li>
            <li> but i will enjoy my mini</li>
            <li> I have been using cheap store brands of nail polish all my life.   </li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous and the glitter is soft yet sparkly.</li>
            <li> This is my main polish...goes with most everything!</li>
            <li> But despite this issue, I would still purchase more because it really is a pretty color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so FUN to wear!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this gorgeous pink glitter.</li>
            <li> so it is fun to wear but not so overpowering or bright that you can wear it pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color, and it is hard to imagine something more sparkly.  </li>
            <li> Not what I&#x27;m expected but it was a welcome surprise.</li>
            <li> i wont be buying the full size bottle</li>
            <li> I was actually wearing Sally Hansem Strobe Light when I bought this, and I love this so much more.</li>
            <li> I am 20, a full time student, and work full time.</li>
            <li> picture doesn&#x27;t do any justice compare to how lovely it looks in real life.</li>
            <li> When I want a super glittery effect, I use 2 to 3 coats without needing any color underneath.  </li>
            <li> I have to use it quickly</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase this because I never owned a O.P.I nail polish before because of its high price, well this color looked very pretty and have seen this in many haul videos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY pretty.  </li>
            <li> This is a very pretty sparkly nail polish from OPI</li>
            <li> Very pretty color.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite color.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is really pretty and the color look so lovely on your nails, like very sparkly</li>
            <li> This is a PRETTY color!  </li>
            <li> as with most glitter polishes, the pieces of glitter means that the color does not dry smoothly</li>
            <li> This should remove most if not all of the glitter, and it will be easy to wipe off the bits that are left.</li>
            <li> It was very pretty but still wasn&#x27;t the right tint</li>
            <li> Very delicate and feminine, and best of all, flattering.  </li>
            <li> Great polish, but my nails chipped after a few days.  </li>
            <li> The color is really cute although the color in the picture looks to be only one light coat.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very much worth the time.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful sparkly princess pink!</li>
            <li> and I have had the experience with it getting caught on my clothing and litterally tearing right off my nails.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly ordered on 3/17 received 3/21  overall its fine.</li>
            <li> As a recommendation to everyone, when applying this nail polish, make sure you put first a coat of clear nail polish on your nails before applying the shimmer.</li>
            <li> I do however still love it more than any other glitter polish I have found!</li>
            <li> It is a very sparkled pretty girl color, however is a little more nude and not overbearing, and I found it stays on longer and better than full out glitter nail polish.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and long lasting color though.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more then likely the lighting or camera.</li>
            <li> -- this is really pretty with a gold polish.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely my \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; nail color, fitting for any occasion, any holiday, if you want to wear sparkle.</li>
            <li> However be aware ...</li>
            <li> but I insisted they just do 2 top coats of Teenage Dream.  </li>
            <li> I really like it though it looked golden in the picture which is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> With only one application the glitter is very noticeable, so by the third you&#x27;ve got intense, beautiful, glittery nails.</li>
            <li> it gets clumpy fast though!</li>
            <li> But.. It is pretty...</li>
            <li> The first time the nail polish just peeled off.</li>
            <li> Teenage dream is my favorite nail polish by OPI.</li>
            <li> It is one of my ultimate favorite polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wished it to be...</li>
            <li> It is pretty, but it&#x27;s more sheer with glitter instead of the intense glitter of this shade.  </li>
            <li> The color is really pretty and in the sun, the glitter is really cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i was afraid it would be so clear it would be more of a top coat but its amazing.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to remove as well unlike other glitter polishes.</li>
            <li> First of all: I love pink</li>
            <li> Fire\\&quot; by Pure Ice (sold at Wal Mart)</li>
            <li> my nail tech has to really work at it, and even then, some glitter remains.  </li>
            <li> Lovely pink color with tons of glitter</li>
            <li> and it wears very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish.</li>
            <li> You do have to put a couple of coats before it gets that really pertty color</li>
            <li> Very feminine and not gaudy.  </li>
            <li> If you love glitter and the color pink then you MUST order this!</li>
            <li> A handy method is the tinfoil method, which is as follows: soak 10 cotton balls in acetone remover as you usually would, but instead of wiping your nail, put one soaked cotton ball on each nail and wrap a strip of tinfoil around each one to hold it in place.</li>
            <li> This is a classic nail polish for todays sparkling nails.</li>
            <li> Goes opaque in 3 coats and looks especially great under a thin coat of Black Shatter.</li>
            <li> But, the only thing I DO NOT LIKE is that it is so chunky and sharp when dry and no amount of top coat seems to smooth it out for me.  </li>
            <li> gorgeous pale pink sparkles.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s EXACTLY the same, and</li>
            <li> However I completely recommend this for any ones collection!</li>
            <li> At 63 years old I never thought I&#x27;d be wearing sparkly nail polish!</li>
            <li> The formula is a little goopy and thick (wait for each coat to dry a bit to avoid dragging issues), but it dries very fast (ideal if you want to apply a shatter polish).</li>
            <li> I love girly colors as well as bright blues and other crazy colors.  </li>
            <li> The smaller glitter and larger reflective chunks make for a very nice visual effect, but it basically shredded the cotton I used to take it off, and I had to drape cotton soaked in polish remover over the nail for a few minutes to even attempt the onerous chore of getting it off.</li>
            <li> Its a soft, pretty pink and very shiny.</li>
            <li> The little glitter specks sparkle like tiny diamonds when the light hits!</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to put some shellac / gel polish in clear over it in order to wear the polish.  </li>
            <li> the color its self is actually a bit lighter than the picture (not by much though).</li>
            <li> Applies evenly and drys fast enough for a fast second coat.</li>
            <li> Same price as you find in stores but delivers fast.</li>
            <li> A word on removal: glitter polishes can be frustrating to remove the traditional way (and scrubbing your nails isn&#x27;t good, as it will make the glitter scratch them).</li>
            <li> I told them to put just this color on, and at first they tried to get me to pick a bottom coat of another pink</li>
            <li> It makes your nails look like pretty pink discoballs</li>
            <li> it is so blingy but still very soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> The last and final 3rd coat gave me the exact color I wanted and looked just like the photo.</li>
            <li> teenage dream is a very pretty pink with pinkish silvery tiny glitter with some bigger chunks throughout.</li>
            <li> The color is hard to find in stores now, and this is the original.</li>
            <li> I have tried it both with the black OPI crackle over top, and also plain.</li>
            <li> I really want black shatter</li>
            <li> Pink Flare or Jordana Fairy Dust look EXACTLY the same and cost less than $5.</li>
            <li> I mean EXACTLY.</li>
            <li> I let it dry (which takes no time at all) and applied the 2nd coat.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I am off-put by some of the reviews that this color is difficult to remove however, because my only complaint about this color is that fact that it peels STRAIGHT off my nails so easily.</li>
            <li> The first coat was very faint, yet still pretty.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m rubbing my fingernails in there, then using a swab with the other hand, and back and forth tons of time....</li>
            <li> If you put it directly onto your nails, later on when you remove it, you will spend a hard-long time doing it so, since it&#x27;s hard to remove it with the polish remover.</li>
            <li> I will admit it&#x27;s a little different</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a little kid when it comes to nail polish...</li>
            <li> The only thing about this color is that the larger glitter pieces are hard to remove.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of glitter effect and is a softer pink.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the other OPI sparkle polishes -</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t leave this color for any other color.</li>
            <li> I spent over a half hour, tons of remover, and tons of cotton swabs....</li>
            <li> My only complaint is in removing the polish.  </li>
            <li> I used OPI base coat and OPI top coat with this nail polish both times I have used it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just not feeling the pale pink, girly vibe, this would also work as a layering polish.   </li>
            <li> Every time I look down at my hands I find myself mesmerized!</li>
            <li> My only negative is that it is hard to get off my nails.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding it in a store</li>
            <li> am only giving it a four because it is a chore for the poor nail tech to take off.</li>
            <li> It is not too childish, but it still reminds me of my girly side.</li>
            <li> I decided to take it off and apply another color for the weekend and that&#x27;s where I ran into trouble.  </li>
            <li> It wears like iron and my hands were raw from all the remover (non-acetone - and have read it doesn&#x27;t matter where this polish is</li>
            <li> when i put it on i used 2 coats and it lasted a over a week (no top coat)</li>
            <li> this is SO hard to get off ...</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever have anyone make any comments towards my nail color.</li>
            <li> BUT, it is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I used Aphrodites Pink Nightie as a base then topped with one coat of Teenage Dream.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well unless you use a base coat, it just peels off like glitter.  </li>
            <li> However, because of the color, chipping didn&#x27;t look as bad or obvious as it usually does.  </li>
            <li> I have serious doubts whether I&#x27;ll use this polish again or any Katy Perry ones.  </li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> At least to me!</li>
            <li> I must say, I am obsessed with the nail polish.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t have it at the store :(</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use a base coat of color</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is gorgeous, but there is no need to pay $22 for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milani Pink Flare or Jordana Fairy Dust look EXACTLY the same and cost less than $5.</li>
            <li> I love this and don&#x27;t regret buying it one bit..but I just wanted to let you all know that if you want a cheaper version of this, you can find the color \\&quot;Spit Fire\\&quot; by Pure Ice (sold at Wal Mart) and it&#x27;s EXACTLY the same, and I mean EXACTLY. If I knew that ahead of time, I would have saved myself $10. lol. BUT I do like this polish and if you insist on using only OPI then go ahead and buy this one!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish! I will admit it&#x27;s a little different then the picture, but that&#x27;s more then likely the lighting or camera. However I completely recommend this for any ones collection! The little glitter specks sparkle like tiny diamonds when the light hits! Gorgeous!!!</li>
            <li> I love this as a top coat over another light shade to add sparkle.  It&#x27;s so beautiful.  Or also to add a French nail tip on the nail -- this is really pretty with a gold polish.  I would definitely purchase again.  Maybe will buy another bottle soon in case they decide to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Great service! Great Product! Thank you!! The polish was just beautiful. I was having trouble finding it in a store and so I tried Amazon. I am so glad I did! Service was fast, packaging great! It arrived in time to give as a Christmas gift for my daughter</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this color -- the pictures don&#x27;t do it justice. It is feminine and light while being daring and sexy... MUST HAVE!!! I have recieved so many compliments :)</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear this.  Looks great on fingers and/or toes.  Very delicate and feminine, and best of all, flattering.  Can be used alone (2-3 coats recommended) or on top of another color to make it pop.  This is definitely my \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; nail color, fitting for any occasion, any holiday, if you want to wear sparkle.</li>
            <li> Color of product not as shown in pic, Pic is darker.  Received very quickly ordered on 3/17 received 3/21  overall its fine.</li>
            <li> This a very appealing to the eye polish. It has a lot of glitter effect and is a softer pink. The polish stays on a good amount of time. My only negative is that it is hard to get off my nails.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. Two coats is all you need and you get full coverage, and a beautiful sparkle. I have to admit that I am off-put by some of the reviews that this color is difficult to remove however, because my only complaint about this color is that fact that it peels STRAIGHT off my nails so easily. as with most glitter polishes, the pieces of glitter means that the color does not dry smoothly and I have had the experience with it getting caught on my clothing and litterally tearing right off my nails. But despite this issue, I would still purchase more because it really is a pretty color.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this polish!  I actually bought 2 bottles so that I have it to take when I get my pedicures after it is no longer in the salon.  However be aware ... this is SO hard to get off ... my nail tech has to really work at it, and even then, some glitter remains.  But to be honest, it is worth it.  The color is really pretty and in the sun, the glitter is really cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving it a four because it is a chore for the poor nail tech to take off.</li>
            <li> i got this polish in the katy perry mini set. when i put it on i used 2 coats and it lasted a over a week (no top coat) the color its self is actually a bit lighter than the picture (not by much though). when you apply the polish the glitter has a good pay off. not too sparse and not too packed on. i wont be buying the full size bottle but i will enjoy my mini</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite OPI colors!  When I saw it at my favorite salon(that always gets in the newest OPI collections, thank God), I knew I had to try it!  I&#x27;m such a little kid when it comes to nail polish... I love girly colors as well as bright blues and other crazy colors.  I told them to put just this color on, and at first they tried to get me to pick a bottom coat of another pink but I insisted they just do 2 top coats of Teenage Dream.  It turned out so well I brought the color home with me!  It makes your nails look like pretty pink discoballs and I can&#x27;t get enough! Expensive, but well worth it.  At least to me!</li>
            <li> teenage dream is a very pretty pink with pinkish silvery tiny glitter with some bigger chunks throughout. I really like it though it looked golden in the picture which is why I ordered it. Not what I&#x27;m expected but it was a welcome surprise. I&#x27;m using it as a french tip over vampsterdam by opi.</li>
            <li> I totally love this polish.  Just one swipe gives a nice level of sparkle.  It&#x27;s VERY pretty.  When I want a super glittery effect, I use 2 to 3 coats without needing any color underneath.  I recommend this polish to anyone! :D</li>
            <li> This has to be the sparkliest polish ever!  I have \\&quot;Last Friday Night\\&quot; too.  It is pretty, but it&#x27;s more sheer with glitter instead of the intense glitter of this shade.  It&#x27;s so FUN to wear!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite polishes from OPI. The color is gorgeous and the glitter is soft yet sparkly. It is very easy to remove as well unlike other glitter polishes. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color, and it is hard to imagine something more sparkly.  Someone commented that it was like liquid gem stones.  After a week of great fun wearing it, I set about the task of removal.  Yowza!  It was such a pain, I don&#x27;t think I will ever wear it again.  The smaller glitter and larger reflective chunks make for a very nice visual effect, but it basically shredded the cotton I used to take it off, and I had to drape cotton soaked in polish remover over the nail for a few minutes to even attempt the onerous chore of getting it off.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase this because I never owned a O.P.I nail polish before because of its high price, well this color looked very pretty and have seen this in many haul videos. I had to get it, I love it! very happy. although you do have to put on up to 3 coats for the color and glitter to stand out, i am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish when I went to the Katy Perry concert--- It looks great alone or over any color.  Its darling!  It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well unless you use a base coat, it just peels off like glitter.  I do however still love it more than any other glitter polish I have found!</li>
            <li> great item and person to buy from, I would definately buy from again, the color is awesome, love opi polish</li>
            <li> This polish is great. My daughter loved it. I also used it and I&#x27;m not a teenager. It&#x27;s very long-lasting and it looks great on the nails. Next time I&#x27;m thinking to use it with French manicure to see how it works. Loved it!</li>
            <li> I very rarely buy nail polish, but I fell in love with this one! It&#x27;s great and stays on exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty sparkly nail polish from OPI but I made the mistake of painting it on my nails by itself. I think it would be better with another color underneath.</li>
            <li> I have been using cheap store brands of nail polish all my life.   I tried a friend&#x27;s OPI Teenage Dream polish over the summer and now I am hooked.  I love the sparkle in this color.   My only complaint is in removing the polish.  You basically have to scrub your nails with the remover and cotton ball.  Beautiful and long lasting color though.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this nail polish and I didn&#x27;t think I ever would or could with nail polish. The first coat was very faint, yet still pretty. I let it dry (which takes no time at all) and applied the 2nd coat. It was very pretty but still wasn&#x27;t the right tint I wanted like I have seen in the picture on amazon. The last and final 3rd coat gave me the exact color I wanted and looked just like the photo. Its a soft, pretty pink and very shiny. I got several compliments on it and I hardly ever have anyone make any comments towards my nail color. Would recommend and glad I purchased this color!</li>
            <li> I love this OPI nail polish. Very sweet and discrete tone. With only one application the glitter is very noticeable, so by the third you&#x27;ve got intense, beautiful, glittery nails. As a recommendation to everyone, when applying this nail polish, make sure you put first a coat of clear nail polish on your nails before applying the shimmer. If you put it directly onto your nails, later on when you remove it, you will spend a hard-long time doing it so, since it&#x27;s hard to remove it with the polish remover. Love the pinkish tone, and the price was worth it!!!! I&#x27;ll be getting more for sure!!! I recommend it to everyone out there!!!</li>
            <li> Good polish, highly overpriced. I would not buy again. This is one of those things that was discontinued. Thus over priced.</li>
            <li> Love this! I used Aphrodites Pink Nightie as a base then topped with one coat of Teenage Dream. The result...well...beautiful. At 63 years old I never thought I&#x27;d be wearing sparkly nail polish!</li>
            <li> i love love love love the katy perry polish. i was afraid it would be so clear it would be more of a top coat but its amazing. it is so blingy but still very soft at the same time. It is so cute and looks great on toes too. i have gotten so many compliments. DEF a must have for this spring/summer!!!</li>
            <li> This color wasn&#x27;t my favorite Katy Perry color, but it has quickly become one of my favorites! I love it!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite opi color! it gets clumpy fast though! I have to use it quickly and you cant add nail polish remover to glitter it messes up the color</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite color. I love love love it. You don&#x27;t even need to put on multiple coats. Sometimes you need to with glittery polish but this stuff is wonderful! OPI is great. I really want black shatter but they didn&#x27;t have it at the store :(</li>
            <li> Great polish, but my nails chipped after a few days.  However, because of the color, chipping didn&#x27;t look as bad or obvious as it usually does.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Just love this polish! Lovely pink color with tons of glitter and it wears very well. I get lots of compliments on my nails. This is my main polish...goes with most everything!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! The color is really cute although the color in the picture looks to be only one light coat. With two coats, the color is a lot more sparkly and more glittery. The only thing about this color is that the larger glitter pieces are hard to remove. I have to use one nail to scrape them off after and during the use of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE holographic glitter polishes. I was actually wearing Sally Hansem Strobe Light when I bought this, and I love this so much more. there&#x27;s 10x more glitter in this so I don&#x27;t have to use a base coat of color, it&#x27;s all glitter. BUT, it is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I must say, I am obsessed with the nail polish. Every time I look down at my hands I find myself mesmerized! It is not too childish, but it still reminds me of my girly side. I am 20, a full time student, and work full time. Love love love this-and so do my friends!</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful sparkly princess pink! Goes opaque in 3 coats and looks especially great under a thin coat of Black Shatter. The larger &#x27;silver&#x27; glitters are holographic, so they flash all the colors of the rainbow! The formula is a little goopy and thick (wait for each coat to dry a bit to avoid dragging issues), but it dries very fast (ideal if you want to apply a shatter polish). If you&#x27;re just not feeling the pale pink, girly vibe, this would also work as a layering polish.   A word on removal: glitter polishes can be frustrating to remove the traditional way (and scrubbing your nails isn&#x27;t good, as it will make the glitter scratch them). A handy method is the tinfoil method, which is as follows: soak 10 cotton balls in acetone remover as you usually would, but instead of wiping your nail, put one soaked cotton ball on each nail and wrap a strip of tinfoil around each one to hold it in place. This allows the remover to soak through all the layers of glitter. Leave for 5 to 10 minutes, then apply pressure as you remove the foil and cotton ball. This should remove most if not all of the glitter, and it will be easy to wipe off the bits that are left. It does work--trust me, if I hadn&#x27;t discovered this trick, I would have forever sworn off glitter polishes because of the removal issues.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is really pretty and the color look so lovely on your nails, like very sparkly pink.&lt;br /&gt;That picture doesn&#x27;t do any justice compare to how lovely it looks in real life. I love OPI and this product!</li>
            <li> First of all: I love pink and I LOVE sparkles.  This is a PRETTY color!  But, the only thing I DO NOT LIKE is that it is so chunky and sharp when dry and no amount of top coat seems to smooth it out for me.  I feel like I have to put some shellac / gel polish in clear over it in order to wear the polish.  Not good.  But.. It is pretty...</li>
            <li> This is a classic nail polish for todays sparkling nails. Put Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s Candy Shop as accents over teenage dream.</li>
            <li> I love this OPI color! It is a very sparkled pretty girl color, however is a little more nude and not overbearing, and I found it stays on longer and better than full out glitter nail polish. I have tried it both with the black OPI crackle over top, and also plain. It just looks good no matter what! I have had it for quite some time, and still have plenty left, decent sized bottle, great color, good for the price, arrived quickly! :)</li>
            <li> I used OPI base coat and OPI top coat with this nail polish both times I have used it. The first time the nail polish just peeled off. The second time I did lighter coats and it chips and peeled off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color and polish.  I wore it from Sunday through Thursday and even though one finger had chips, because of the sparkle and color you don&#x27;t notice it.....I decided to take it off and apply another color for the weekend and that&#x27;s where I ran into trouble.  Just TRY taking it off!  I spent over a half hour, tons of remover, and tons of cotton swabs....I have a remover bottle so I&#x27;m rubbing my fingernails in there, then using a swab with the other hand, and back and forth tons of time....It wears like iron and my hands were raw from all the remover (non-acetone - and have read it doesn&#x27;t matter where this polish is concerned)....I have serious doubts whether I&#x27;ll use this polish again or any Katy Perry ones.  I don&#x27;t know about the other OPI sparkle polishes - and I have several - so will have to see.....It&#x27;s a shame, because I really enjoyed wearing this gorgeous color with all the sparkle - like jewelry on my fingernails.......</li>
            <li> I consider this *my color* I just can&#x27;t leave this color for any other color. It&#x27;s just so perfect and just so me. Applies evenly and drys fast enough for a fast second coat.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish. It is sparkly so it is fun to wear but not so overpowering or bright that you can wear it pretty much anywhere. I have used it many times and have yet to find a polish close to it to use once this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Teenage dream is my favorite nail polish by OPI. If you love glitter and the color pink then you MUST order this! The color is hard to find in stores now, and this is the original. Same price as you find in stores but delivers fast. I LOVE THIS POLISH!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this gorgeous pink glitter. It is one of my ultimate favorite polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not too sheer, when you put it on, it is enough to use without having to put any color polish underneath.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. I use it all the time. You do have to put a couple of coats before it gets that really pertty color but it&#x27;s very much worth the time.</li>
            <li> OPI is the best nail polish ever and these colors are great not to bold or dramatic, and i also purchased for my neice who loves katy perry, and she loved it</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful.  It is exactly what I wished it to be...gorgeous pale pink sparkles. Very feminine and not gaudy.  Just right.</li>
