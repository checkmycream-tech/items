            <li>They are so strong and durable</li>
            <li>The trio has tips that work great on larger areas and in small sections so that my eyebrows are perfectly shaped on their own.</li>
            <li>Also got to try these for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Each comes in a case to easily fit in a pocket or purse.  </li>
            <li>They packaging was fantastic,, but they product</li>
            <li>But secondly, these are great tweezers.</li>
            <li>and you have the sight of a plastic tube with cork plug, filled with decorative &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; and your tweezers.</li>
            <li>but the actual box was lovely and would make a good gift as is.</li>
            <li>Very useful item to have on hand  </li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy with a decent edge.</li>

            <li>the come all boxed up and wrapped with a ribbon, making it insanely easy to send these as a gift (one that will be much appreciated!!)</li>
            <li>My new tweezers work amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>The Excalibur collection is made from the highest quality stainless steel that&#x27;s forged by fire in Solingen, Germany, which is synonymous with European Royalty and brilliant quality.</li>
            <li>I’m very happy that I purchased the Wick &amp; Strom Tweezer Set, I’ve had a hard time finding a pair of tweezers that worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>High quality, sharp edges, very nice tweezers set and the travel tweezers are simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>This company definitely takes pride in what they send out as this was ready for gift giving and beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li>one is a full sized pair.  </li>
            <li>Smaller ones would be good to keep in purse or for travel.</li>
            <li>These are Fantastic  and worth the purchase. .</li>
            <li>I gave one of the smaller ones to my husband and he loved using it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a full size tweezer along with two travel size ones.</li>
            <li>This Wick &amp; Strom Tweezer set is seriously the best tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an exceptional set of tweezers , you receive three different ones for all your tweezing needs .I</li>
            <li>more than highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>So, yes, very pretty packaging.</li>
            <li>I love how I was able to get fine hairs that I could not get with other tweezers.</li>
            <li>They are really sturdy durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have a cute, little pair of tweezers in my bag instead of a full sized one.</li>
            <li>This tweezer set came in such cute packaging that I wasn&#x27;t even sure what I was opening at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been fortunate that my eyebrows grow in pretty well on their own, but if I don&#x27;t take great care a few stray into the middle and attempt to create a unibrow.</li>
            <li>it would make a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself comes with basically three tweezers two are in little covers</li>
            <li>Even the small one are great, specially for your purse.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these after reading all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>This set is nice because you get 2 different sizes.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are high quality and easy to grasp.</li>
            <li>the packaging was unique and I kept the tube with the cork to keep the large tweezers in so they dont get lost as my others did.</li>
            <li>Very precise gripping of the hairs (on the little tweezers) I like the fact that they have little covers too, a great item to toss in your purse or kitchen drawer or bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>and they went into my purse right away.</li>
            <li>The bigger tweezers are very strong and durable</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great deal and thanks for the amount of time spent in the presentation.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice but a little over the top for tweezers, guessing it was added in the high cost.</li>
            <li>Very high quality tweezers set!</li>
            <li>The little ones would be great to keep on hand for things like splinters as well as just normal things like plucking your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I always love solingen,, i was so shock to open the box,,wow</li>
            <li>For $27.99, it was disappointingly pretty meh.</li>
            <li>pretty package and all.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made set!</li>
            <li>the came in as it looks pretty and the shavings protect the tweezers tips.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this set.</li>
            <li>is what counts, not how pretty the package is.</li>
            <li>I would definitely focus on product more than packaging.  </li>
            <li>first off, this came in the cutest packaging.</li>
            <li>The grabbing part of the tweezer has a textured inside so the hairs grip and don&#x27;t slide through making the hair pull out on your first try because it doesn&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li>Not only by providing such a superior product but also with the care and attention to detail in their packaging .This</li>
            <li>These tweezers come in a nifty little packaging which I thought was very cute.</li>
            <li>They are made with pure quality.</li>
            <li>and I had always gone back to the fine tweezers that you find in a Swiss army</li>
            <li>Very high quality tweezer set wrapped to perfection.</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice little gift set as well</li>
            <li>Its hard buying a good pair that really works.</li>
            <li>OMG- the whole package has me amaze.</li>
            <li>This product came really well packaged and</li>
            <li>This set of tweezers is so precise and solid</li>
            <li>Not only did they fit in the hand</li>
            <li>The tweezers are crafted in Germany of stainless steel</li>
            <li>I was blown away before even using the tweezers, the packaging is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My husband has VERY bushy eyebrows but refuses to go for a wax, so he plucks.</li>
            <li>The tweezers is as pictured and are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers look like the more expensive Tweezerman brand tweezers I own.</li>
            <li>Felt like an early Mother&#x27;s Day present to myself when I received the box :)</li>
            <li>Nice set odd that the two small ones are the same but very nice.</li>
            <li>The large tweezer is okay, but only a &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; better than what I already have that cost far less.</li>
            <li>I started using these right away and noticed a huge difference using these tweezers compared to any other pair I have.</li>
            <li>These tweezers feels top notch, and the various sizes allow for at least one of them to be usable for many scenarios.  </li>
            <li>I received a full sized one and two smaller ones.</li>
            <li>The box contained a vial with shavings along with 3 white sets of tweezers ( 1 full size and 2 travel sized).</li>
            <li>its like an expensive gift,,i love the way they design it,,i will love to order again to.</li>
            <li>They are well made and work decently.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>but they are still nice but not as sharp as the larger.</li>
            <li>They also come in a cute little package so If you&#x27;re giving as a gift</li>
            <li>They are easy to handle, they are sharp and they have two travel pair that come in the container.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the small one to be able to have it in my purse.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure they will last a long time.</li>
            <li>They are also wider than normal tweezers</li>
            <li>normally I use tweezerman brand</li>
            <li>Once I finally got up the nerve to open the box, I was thrilled further.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the cheap ones that you need to purchase multiple tweezers or when you hope that they actually grip your eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>The 2 smaller pair of tweezers come in a convenient carry/storage case in which the top clicks/locks when closed, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off and losing the tweezers.</li>
            <li>Pretty great tweezer set - the larger one I had a little trouble getting the hang of, but the mall ones work fantastically.</li>
            <li>Love the larger tweezers in the set the tip is sharp, hopefully it will remain that way.</li>
            <li>I used the larger one first and found that the tweezers did not grip quite as well as they looked.  </li>
            <li>I love the protective sleeve for the small ones too</li>
            <li>Presentation of an item makes a big first impression.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Because of the exceptional craftsmanship of the Excalibur Collection, it grips any hair from baby hairs to coarse, thick ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it can be used to clean up your eyebrow and relieve you of foreign objects in your feet or wherever a splinter might lodge.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this purchase is the smaller ones that have the little casing over them.  </li>
            <li>Also having a lifetime Warranty they really will last forever.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised when I received these,  </li>
            <li>The tweezers we currently had, did not grip very well for him at all.</li>
            <li>I find there to be a small gap when closed, so it doesn&#x27;t get super fine or short hairs for me.</li>
            <li>One of the small pairs will conveniently fit in my purse.</li>
            <li>One of the small pairs will conveniently fit in my purse.</li>
            <li>If I were to purchase three of my normal brand the cost would have been about the same as this set.  </li>
            <li>I can finally shape and clean my eyebrows myself as I lost my previous ones.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing worse than discovering an out-of-place hair and not being able to do something about it.</li>
            <li>Not only are you able to pluck hair that other tweezers are not able to, these tweezers also do not harm my skin in the process.</li>

            <li> I’m very happy that I purchased the Wick &amp; Strom Tweezer Set, I’ve had a hard time finding a pair of tweezers that worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> High quality, sharp edges, very nice tweezers set and the travel tweezers are simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> This company definitely takes pride in what they send out as this was ready for gift giving and beautifully packaged.</li>

            <li> Smaller ones would be good to keep in purse or for travel.</li>
            <li> These are Fantastic  and worth the purchase. .</li>
            <li> I gave one of the smaller ones to my husband and he loved using it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a full size tweezer along with two travel size ones.</li>
            <li> This Wick &amp; Strom Tweezer set is seriously the best tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an exceptional set of tweezers , you receive three different ones for all your tweezing needs .I</li>
            <li> more than highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> So, yes, very pretty packaging.</li>
            <li> I love how I was able to get fine hairs that I could not get with other tweezers.</li>
            <li> They are really sturdy durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to have a cute, little pair of tweezers in my bag instead of a full sized one.</li>
            <li> This tweezer set came in such cute packaging that I wasn&#x27;t even sure what I was opening at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fortunate that my eyebrows grow in pretty well on their own, but if I don&#x27;t take great care a few stray into the middle and attempt to create a unibrow.</li>
            <li> it would make a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself comes with basically three tweezers two are in little covers</li>
            <li> Even the small one are great, specially for your purse.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these after reading all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> This set is nice because you get 2 different sizes.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are high quality and easy to grasp.</li>
            <li> the packaging was unique and I kept the tube with the cork to keep the large tweezers in so they dont get lost as my others did.</li>
            <li> Very precise gripping of the hairs (on the little tweezers) I like the fact that they have little covers too, a great item to toss in your purse or kitchen drawer or bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> and they went into my purse right away.</li>
            <li> The bigger tweezers are very strong and durable</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great deal and thanks for the amount of time spent in the presentation.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice but a little over the top for tweezers, guessing it was added in the high cost.</li>
            <li> Very high quality tweezers set!</li>
            <li> The little ones would be great to keep on hand for things like splinters as well as just normal things like plucking your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I always love solingen,, i was so shock to open the box,,wow</li>
            <li> For $27.99, it was disappointingly pretty meh.</li>
            <li> pretty package and all.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made set!</li>
            <li> the came in as it looks pretty and the shavings protect the tweezers tips.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this set.</li>
            <li> is what counts, not how pretty the package is.</li>
            <li> I would definitely focus on product more than packaging.  </li>
            <li> first off, this came in the cutest packaging.</li>
            <li> The grabbing part of the tweezer has a textured inside so the hairs grip and don&#x27;t slide through making the hair pull out on your first try because it doesn&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li> Not only by providing such a superior product but also with the care and attention to detail in their packaging .This</li>
            <li> These tweezers come in a nifty little packaging which I thought was very cute.</li>
            <li> They are made with pure quality.</li>
            <li> and I had always gone back to the fine tweezers that you find in a Swiss army</li>
            <li> Very high quality tweezer set wrapped to perfection.</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice little gift set as well</li>
            <li> Its hard buying a good pair that really works.</li>
            <li> OMG- the whole package has me amaze.</li>
            <li> This product came really well packaged and</li>
            <li> This set of tweezers is so precise and solid</li>
            <li> Not only did they fit in the hand</li>
            <li> The tweezers are crafted in Germany of stainless steel</li>
            <li> I was blown away before even using the tweezers, the packaging is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My husband has VERY bushy eyebrows but refuses to go for a wax, so he plucks.</li>
            <li> The tweezers is as pictured and are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers look like the more expensive Tweezerman brand tweezers I own.</li>
            <li> Felt like an early Mother&#x27;s Day present to myself when I received the box :)</li>
            <li> Nice set odd that the two small ones are the same but very nice.</li>
            <li> The large tweezer is okay, but only a &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; better than what I already have that cost far less.</li>
            <li> I started using these right away and noticed a huge difference using these tweezers compared to any other pair I have.</li>
            <li> These tweezers feels top notch, and the various sizes allow for at least one of them to be usable for many scenarios.  </li>
            <li> I received a full sized one and two smaller ones.</li>
            <li> The box contained a vial with shavings along with 3 white sets of tweezers ( 1 full size and 2 travel sized).</li>
            <li> its like an expensive gift,,i love the way they design it,,i will love to order again to.</li>
            <li> They are well made and work decently.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> but they are still nice but not as sharp as the larger.</li>
            <li> They also come in a cute little package so If you&#x27;re giving as a gift</li>
            <li> They are easy to handle, they are sharp and they have two travel pair that come in the container.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the small one to be able to have it in my purse.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sure they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are also wider than normal tweezers</li>
            <li> normally I use tweezerman brand</li>
            <li> Once I finally got up the nerve to open the box, I was thrilled further.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the cheap ones that you need to purchase multiple tweezers or when you hope that they actually grip your eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> The 2 smaller pair of tweezers come in a convenient carry/storage case in which the top clicks/locks when closed, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off and losing the tweezers.</li>
            <li> Pretty great tweezer set - the larger one I had a little trouble getting the hang of, but the mall ones work fantastically.</li>
            <li> Love the larger tweezers in the set the tip is sharp, hopefully it will remain that way.</li>
            <li> I used the larger one first and found that the tweezers did not grip quite as well as they looked.  </li>
            <li> I love the protective sleeve for the small ones too</li>
            <li> Presentation of an item makes a big first impression.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Because of the exceptional craftsmanship of the Excalibur Collection, it grips any hair from baby hairs to coarse, thick ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it can be used to clean up your eyebrow and relieve you of foreign objects in your feet or wherever a splinter might lodge.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this purchase is the smaller ones that have the little casing over them.  </li>
            <li> Also having a lifetime Warranty they really will last forever.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I received these,  </li>
            <li> The tweezers we currently had, did not grip very well for him at all.</li>
            <li> I find there to be a small gap when closed, so it doesn&#x27;t get super fine or short hairs for me.</li>
            <li> One of the small pairs will conveniently fit in my purse.</li>
            <li> One of the small pairs will conveniently fit in my purse.</li>
            <li> If I were to purchase three of my normal brand the cost would have been about the same as this set.  </li>
            <li> I can finally shape and clean my eyebrows myself as I lost my previous ones.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than discovering an out-of-place hair and not being able to do something about it.</li>
            <li> Not only are you able to pluck hair that other tweezers are not able to, these tweezers also do not harm my skin in the process.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough &amp;#34;tension&amp;#34; with the tweezers to get a firm grip...</li>
            <li> I really like the two little small ones that come in a little To protect them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tips are fairly sharp but no too sharp since they are made for removing hair and shaping your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> A regular sized and two small pairs.</li>
            <li> A regular sized and two small pairs.</li>
            <li> The other plus with these is the travel sets that come with the product.</li>
            <li> found these to pluck the hairs easier then any other tweezers I have ever owned .As</li>
            <li> The small ones work so well to grab and pluck the smaller hairs.</li>
            <li> Little pricey</li>
            <li> little pricey.</li>
            <li> but their precision has never let me down!</li>
            <li> heavy duty feeling.</li>
            <li> product is a Wick &amp; Str&amp;ouml;m tweezer set, if you&#x27;ve ever dealt with low quality tweezers, you&#x27;ll know how frustrating and time consuming it is to shape and pluck your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Two of them are 2&amp;#34; in length and the 3rd is approximately 4&amp;#34; in length.</li>

            <li> I love love love these tweezers I tried them when they came in and I absolutely love them</li>
            <li> Great set of tweezers. Very impressive packaging. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set. I really like the two little small ones that come in a little To protect them. The larger pair is easier to hold though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips are fairly sharp but no too sharp since they are made for removing hair and shaping your eyebrows. They are lightweight and seem well made.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s on but the first thing I want to rave about is the packaging it comes in a beautiful box wrapped with a very pretty ribbon.  Inside is a tube that is also beautiful and the tweezers are inside. They are white and presteen. I just couldn&#x27;t believe that a seller would package something so nicely it would make a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself comes with basically three tweezers two are in little covers one is a full sized pair.  They work awesome. I tried all three and they deliver.  My favorite thing about this purchase is the smaller ones that have the little casing over them.  I like to carry a pair in my purse but I always have issues with stabbing myself when I&#x27;m reaching in there or ruining them.  These are great for travel or your car.  I absolutely think they are worth the price and the quality is wonderful.  I would recommend this for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased feedback</li>
            <li> Got these in the mail today. Also got to try these for free for my unbiased opinion. The packaging was nice but a little over the top for tweezers, guessing it was added in the high cost. Love the larger tweezers in the set the tip is sharp, hopefully it will remain that way. Smaller ones would be good to keep in purse or for travel. Don&#x27;t reall like the shortness but they are still nice but not as sharp as the larger.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great, but the best part was certainly the packaging - I felt like I was opening an exquisite gift rather than tweezers.  Great presentation!  Really lovely!</li>
            <li> I always love solingen,, i was so shock to open the box,,wow its like an expensive gift,,i love the way they design it,,i will love to order again to. send as a gift</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough &amp;#34;tension&amp;#34; with the tweezers to get a firm grip...</li>
            <li> The packaging on this product is SOOOOO CUTE!!!! We received the item at a discount in exchange for our unbiased opinion, and opening the box felt like opening a present. It would make an excellent gift. The tweezers look like the more expensive Tweezerman brand tweezers I own. The two travel tweezers are an extra bonus, I&#x27;ve put one in my purse and one in my desk drawer at work. There&#x27;s nothing worse than discovering an out-of-place hair and not being able to do something about it. With this set, you&#x27;ll never have to go without.</li>
            <li> So, yes, very pretty packaging. But. The large tweezer is okay, but only a &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; better than what I already have that cost far less. One of the travel tweezers is totally useless - the gripping ends did not meet up. For $27.99, it was disappointingly pretty meh. It&#x27;s all going back, pretty package and all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Wick &amp; Strom Tweezer Set. They are so strong and durable i feel like they will last forever. Being someone that lives somewhere that gets a lot of moisture these are great because they won&#x27;t rust. Also having a lifetime Warranty they really will last forever. These are Fantastic  and worth the purchase. . ** Disclaimer** I received this Product in Exchange for My Unbiased Review.</li>
            <li> OMG- the whole package has me amaze. Beautiful presentations, just the way it come its great for a gift. Let talk about the tweezers, they are wonderful. Its hard buying a good pair that really works. This come with 3. Even the small one are great, specially for your purse.</li>
            <li> What an amazing tweezer set. This product came really well packaged and the build quality is great. I&#x27;m very happy with this product, the item description was right on and i&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> i was highly impressed by the quality of this set when I opened the&lt;br /&gt;box it was shipped in.  The brown box was wrapped in twine and sealed,&lt;br /&gt;and the tweezers came in a glass tube that was sealed with a cork.  I&lt;br /&gt;really couldn&#x27;t wait to use the tweezers.  I used the larger one first and found that the tweezers did not grip quite as well as they looked.  I found&lt;br /&gt;the weight and the size to feel great in my hand and eased the use of them.  I next attempted to use the travel sized tweezers and found&lt;br /&gt;they worked a lot better.  I would recommend this as a gift for a&lt;br /&gt;beauty day basket or by themselves.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE BEST TWEEZERS I HAVE EVER USED!!  THEY ARE EASY TO GRIP AND ALLOW ME TO TWEEZE WITH EASE.  THE PACKAGING WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li> Incredible quality. This set of tweezers is so precise and solid, they&#x27;re such a welcome addition to my household! I love the protective sleeve for the small ones too, it&#x27;s a great feature and they went into my purse right away. Let&#x27;s not forget the presentation of the tweezers...the come all boxed up and wrapped with a ribbon, making it insanely easy to send these as a gift (one that will be much appreciated!!) Felt like an early Mother&#x27;s Day present to myself when I received the box :) Great purchase, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this tweezers set!  I have officially replaced the one I kept in my purse for more years than I can even remember.  These tweezers feels top notch, and the various sizes allow for at least one of them to be usable for many scenarios.  I also cannot go without mentioning the box opening...it was truly an experience, and felt more like opening the box of an expensive men&#x27;s watch.  I don&#x27;t even want to toss it, and have decided to recycle it for use to gift someone else.  Great tweezers that get the job done!  A good buy.</li>
            <li> The packaging made it feel like a loving gift. Love the tweezers Even more. And the mini tweezers with enclosing sleve, I&#x27;m impressed, will certainly purchase as gift</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY UNBIASED REVIEW. I received my tweezers today and love them. My package included 3 pairs. A regular sized and two small pairs. One of the small pairs will conveniently fit in my purse. The tips were great and worked perfectly on all 3 pairs. They are very well made, I&#x27;ve purchased tweezers before that wouldn&#x27;t grip the hairs and if have to try a few times to pull out a hair. Don&#x27;t have that issue with these tweezers. They also come in a cute little package so If you&#x27;re giving as a gift there&#x27;s no need to wrap them.</li>
            <li> These make an amazing gift and their quality, utility, and packaging are amazing.</li>

            <li> Very nice set! Little pricey I was nervous about that but I was tired of the cheap tweezers that didn&#x27;t hold or pull. These come in a very nice set, beautifully packaged. Would recommend as a gift for that reason alone!  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> High quality, sharp edges, very nice tweezers set and the travel tweezers are simply amazing.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Wick &amp; Strom Tweezers Set is awesome. I love this product. I did receive this product to give my unbiased opinion. I open the box and was very impressed by the packaging. It was so pretty and good be use for gift. I love how I was able to get fine hairs that I could not get with other tweezers. I gave one of the smaller ones to my husband and he loved using it.I highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever! I received a full sized one and two smaller ones. They are solid and get ever last hair out. Search no more.</li>
            <li> These are a really nice set of tweezers. The bigger tweezers are very strong and durable They have a nice end to them that it is easy to pluck the hair or get ahold of a stubborn splinter. They are really sturdy durable and easy to use. They have a nice grip to them and I really like the small one to be able to have it in my purse. I received this set at a promotional price to share my honest thoughts and opinions about it.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made set! My wife loves that there is a travel tweezer set that she can take with her. The packaging was fantastic, and the customer service was superb. I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> These tweezers come in beautiful packaging and would make a wonderful gift. The box contained a vial with shavings along with 3 white sets of tweezers ( 1 full size and 2 travel sized). The tweezers are high quality and easy to grasp. They came just in time to remove a splinter from my 2 year olds foot. They are easy to use and i&#x27;m sure they will last a long time. I have been storing them in the plastic vial the came in as it looks pretty and the shavings protect the tweezers tips. I received this set for review purposes all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> When I was asked to review this product I was thankful as I was about to go purchase another pair of &amp;#34;xxxxx&amp;#34; tweezers as mine disappeared.  I have to say... the packaging was unique and I kept the tube with the cork to keep the large tweezers in so they dont get lost as my others did. Now as to the product.....  I have arthritic hands and some things like tweezers are difficult to use. Not so with these from Wick &amp; Strom... Not only did they fit in the hand well but they did in fact grab hold of the smallest of hairs and objects I tried to pick up with no problem. Not only did they grab hold of them but held the hairs/objects until I released the tweezers from the grab position....  The other plus with these is the travel sets that come with the product. Each comes in a case to easily fit in a pocket or purse.  Now I have one to carry with me and one to keep in the car where it seems like I always need a set of tweezers... If I were to purchase three of my normal brand the cost would have been about the same as this set.  I actually prefer the way these work compared to my former brand.  &amp;#34;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR  MY UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very useful item to have on hand  it can be used to clean up your eyebrow and relieve you of foreign objects in your feet or wherever a splinter might lodge. The package threw me for a while because I was expecting a smaller box but it was inside a larger box than need be but the actual box was lovely and would make a good gift as is.The tweezers are crafted in Germany of stainless steel the handles are white with the company name on then they are packaged in a tube which holds three tweezers two of same size and a longer one. THEY  were easy to grasp and easy and effective to use.</li>
            <li> These tweezers come in a nifty little packaging which I thought was very cute. These are very sturdy and the mini ones are great to keep in your purse. They are also wider than normal tweezers so it makes getting the hairs a lot easier.</li>
            <li> best tweezers ever i hide them from my kids</li>
            <li> Upon receiving these tweezers they were packaged very beautifully. Presentation of an item makes a big first impression. I started using these right away and noticed a huge difference using these tweezers compared to any other pair I have. I was very impressed with how these tweezers pull out the hairs. Not only are you able to pluck hair that other tweezers are not able to, these tweezers also do not harm my skin in the process.</li>
            <li> This tweezer set came in such cute packaging that I wasn&#x27;t even sure what I was opening at first. It&#x27;s a nice touch by the company. There&#x27;s a full size tweezer along with two travel size ones. I like that the travel ones have there own &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them getting stuck in anything else when I throw them in a bag. They are well made and work decently.</li>
            <li> Very high quality tweezers set! Make an amazing gift as it comes in a very cute packaging!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it and will buy more as gifts for my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, impressive packaging, works great and very good value</li>
            <li> Pretty great tweezer set - the larger one I had a little trouble getting the hang of, but the mall ones work fantastically. Very precise gripping of the hairs (on the little tweezers) I like the fact that they have little covers too, a great item to toss in your purse or kitchen drawer or bathroom cabinet. The little ones would be great to keep on hand for things like splinters as well as just normal things like plucking your eyebrows. Overall I am pleased with this set.</li>
            <li> My new tweezers work amazingly well.  I’m very happy that I purchased the Wick &amp; Strom Tweezer Set, I’ve had a hard time finding a pair of tweezers that worked well for me.  These have proven to be the least painful as they pull the hairs out on the first try and I’m not trying over and over again to yank on them.  The packaging that they arrived in were perfect if I was giving them as a gift, but there is no way I can part with these.  Thanks for the great deal and thanks for the amount of time spent in the presentation.</li>
            <li> Nice set odd that the two small ones are the same but very nice. Comes in a nice little gift set as well</li>
            <li> the package is very nice and the tWeezer are very well made and easy to use</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try these at a discount in lieu of my review,  and my review is based on my opinion only. I was really surprised when I received these,  normally I use tweezerman brand so I thought I would try something different.  They packaging was fantastic,, but they product it&#x27;s self is what counts, not how pretty the package is. They are sturdy well made but they ones I received had metal shavings still on their product  as if they had been  sharpened. I would definitely focus on product more than packaging.  Would not recommend at that price.</li>
            <li> Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezer well removed my Beard.</li>
            <li> These are really the best tweezers I have ever owned.  They are easy to handle, they are sharp and they have two travel pair that come in the container.  Not to mention the packaging is awesome</li>
            <li> nice set of tweezers. heavy duty feeling. nice point/tip to them. little pricey. would rate them a 7/8 out of 10</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fortunate that my eyebrows grow in pretty well on their own, but if I don&#x27;t take great care a few stray into the middle and attempt to create a unibrow. This tweezer set has been absolutely perfect! The trio has tips that work great on larger areas and in small sections so that my eyebrows are perfectly shaped on their own. The set came in a beautiful gift box in their own tube, which I&#x27;ve happily kept to use to store them. I am phenomenally pleased with how gorgeous and functional this set is! I did receive a discount on this product but price doesn&#x27;t change how great they work, nor does it effect my review!</li>
            <li> What an amazing tweezers set, this product arrived just as described . This product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly , it arrived in excellent condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a Wick &amp; Str&amp;ouml;m tweezer set, if you&#x27;ve ever dealt with low quality tweezers, you&#x27;ll know how frustrating and time consuming it is to shape and pluck your eyebrows. The excalibur collection is specifically designed to grab on to even the tiniest hairs and make it effortless to pluck them out making shaping your eyebrows incredibly easy.The Excalibur collection is made from the highest quality stainless steel that&#x27;s forged by fire in Solingen, Germany, which is synonymous with European Royalty and brilliant quality. Because of the exceptional craftsmanship of the Excalibur Collection, it grips any hair from baby hairs to coarse, thick ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an exceptional set of tweezers , you receive three different ones for all your tweezing needs .I found them to work amazingly , they really grab any kind of hair with ease, they are also perfect for removing splinters with out causing to much pain .I found these to pluck the hairs easier then any other tweezers I have ever owned .As you can see in the photos attached that this company spares nothing in providing an excellent packaging , it is quite incredible what they do.Not only by providing such a superior product but also with the care and attention to detail in their packaging .This is truly am amazing company with an amazing product .If you are looking for a product like this for yourself or as a gift look no further you have found it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I more than highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Love these tweezer set. Great product. Would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Wow! I was blown away before even using the tweezers, the packaging is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers did not disappoint, they feel sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> If you ever need to buy another pair of tweezers. Buy these! first off, this came in the cutest packaging. Second, you get 2 travel size types of tweezers, perfect for on the go moms to carry around in a coin purse, wallet or handbag. But secondly, these are great tweezers. They are made with pure quality. Nothing like the cheap ones that you need to purchase multiple tweezers or when you hope that they actually grip your eyebrow hairs. Ladies, this is the tweezers for you!</li>
            <li> This Wick &amp; Strom Tweezer set is seriously the best tweezers I have ever owned. My husband has VERY bushy eyebrows but refuses to go for a wax, so he plucks. The tweezers we currently had, did not grip very well for him at all. This set is nice because you get 2 different sizes. Two of them are 2&amp;#34; in length and the 3rd is approximately 4&amp;#34; in length. They are very easy and comfortable to hold in your hand. The grabbing part of the tweezer has a textured inside so the hairs grip and don&#x27;t slide through making the hair pull out on your first try because it doesn&#x27;t slip out. The ends line up perfectly when gripped. The small ones work so well to grab and pluck the smaller hairs. The 2 smaller pair of tweezers come in a convenient carry/storage case in which the top clicks/locks when closed, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off and losing the tweezers. These are perfect for carrying in your purse, pocket, keep in the car, travel or wherever you want to have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed when the set arrived. They showed up in a nice gift box. Upon opening the box, there is a beautiful ribbon tied across. Untie the ribbon and you have the sight of a plastic tube with cork plug, filled with decorative &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; and your tweezers. This has got to be one of the nicest gift packages I have ever seen. This company definitely takes pride in what they send out as this was ready for gift giving and beautifully packaged. Who ever thought you would order tweezers and get a package like this? Highly impressed and highly recommend this set if you are looking for one or know someone who loves to pluck and shape their eyebrows. No more going to the salon and having them done and will save you lots of money in the end making the perfect gift! This set also comes with a LIFETIME warranty which is a huge bonus! I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own from testing and reviewing this item.iewing this item.</li>
            <li> Very high quality tweezer set wrapped to perfection. This is a great product, quality made.  Works well!  I got this on a promotion to provide my experience about it.</li>
            <li> This product came in a very elegant packaging ready to be gifted.  I don&#x27;t even want to open it but when I did, the packaging inside was even nicer.  The tweezers were in a tube covered by a cork.  The tweezers is as pictured and are very sturdy.  I inspected all of them and they are of great quality.  I can finally shape and clean my eyebrows myself as I lost my previous ones.  I also tried to use it and they are very easy to use and was able to pull even the smallest of eyebrow hair I have.  I&#x27;m satisfied with this product so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  This product was bought at a promotional price for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy with a decent edge. I find there to be a small gap when closed, so it doesn&#x27;t get super fine or short hairs for me. The tweezers are really nice looking though. What I love best about it though is the 2 mini tweezers it comes with. One for my purse, one for my daughter&#x27;s. They work quite well for their size and it&#x27;s nice to have a cute, little pair of tweezers in my bag instead of a full sized one. It&#x27;s not all &amp;#34;meh, look, I&#x27;m so hairy I carry tweezers around with me all the time!&amp;#34; every time I open my bag up. The package it came in is just like the display picture and is wicked cute opening up.  **I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review**</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work as well as i would like</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these after reading all the positive reviews but unfortunately they did not work for me at all! None of the three tweezers could actually grasp the hair and on the off chance that it did, it just broke the hair instead of pulling it out. I had never had that experience before! So, they&#x27;re going back and my search continues...</li>
            <li> I have never been so excited to find hairs and splinters to pluck. The box this set came in is amazing! The packaging made me feel like I just received something a princess or millionaire would have delivered to them! Once I finally got up the nerve to open the box, I was thrilled further. The set contains 3 tweezers, all of excellent quality, with one being large and the others being &#x27;travel&#x27; tweezers. I will admit to having tried tweezers of all kinds- and I had always gone back to the fine tweezers that you find in a Swiss army knife- horrible I know, but their precision has never let me down! Now I feel like a real grown up with a set of tweezers not made for a pocket knife, and they work wonderfully. This would be a good gift someone that you know is in need of good tweezers (someone like me using Swiss army knife tweezers on their eyebrows and such...)!</li>
