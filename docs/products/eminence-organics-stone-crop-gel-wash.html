            <li>It seems to do a good job</li>
            <li>Eminence Organic Skincare Stone Crop Gel Wash smell good and relaxing</li>
            <li>Once you get used to not having the foam/suds this is really really good stuff.</li>
            <li>label says it is for all skin types &amp; it feels good &amp; soothing.</li>
            <li>Really good face wash.</li>
            <li>the Stone Crop Gel Wash and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>until you use a really good one.  </li>
            <li>I cant say how good this produce is</li>
            <li>The Stone Crop Gel Wash from Eminence worked so good for her that I had to try it too just to see if it would make a difference for me with my aging and acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Good for acne skin as it clears up the scars.</li>
            <li>A pleasant fragrance and cleanses nicely.</li>
            <li>it is refreshing and heavenly!</li>

            <li>Love eminence!</li>
            <li>LOVE this Eminence product!</li>
            <li>I love this line and what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash EVER!</li>
            <li>Like the smell and happy I can use all eminence organic products while pregnant / bfing!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This line of products is amazing.  </li>
            <li>has a nice smell...</li>
            <li>Nice scrub.  </li>
            <li>I do kind of like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The results are great though, so it is worth it for me!</li>
            <li>It does a great job, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as clean and refreshed as I would like it.</li>
            <li>or I might try another type of wash in the Eminence line as there are so many great options available to choose</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and the product is smooth.</li>
            <li>good, and seems genuine...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the higher price sway you from purchasing this great product.</li>
            <li>is that it is very light</li>
            <li>most days i follow with the stone crop hydrating mist.  </li>
            <li>Which ends up making this wash probably cheaper than most things I used to buy at Sephora.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I notice that my face doesn&#x27;t seem to have as many breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they included more product for the price.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to have perfect skin so tried to deal with them.</li>
            <li>I LoVE Eminence.</li>
            <li>Love love love....</li>
            <li>I LOVE this face wash.</li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing and not over powering at all.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Eminence skincare products.</li>
            <li>Also, one of these lasts about 6 months if you use twice daily which is awesome!</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this at MGM Grand Detroit at the spa there.</li>
            <li>Great gentle face wash, solved all my skin problems within a couple weeks.  </li>

            <li>I love the smell and the way my skin feels when I use it.</li>
            <li>And, I love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li>It brightens my skin and makes it look extremely healthy.</li>
            <li>I have never been comfortable without make up on until now!</li>
            <li>I had a lot of congestion under my skin, mostly around my chin and in my cheeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>and I really love the smell.</li>
            <li>Makes it more enjoyable to wash my face:)</li>

            <li>Simply the best!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this Gel wash.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more from this product since I love the moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li>I want to just be able to splash the product off.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love these products.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea, and nothing I did made it better -- including dermatologist-prescribed treatments.</li>
            <li>and it did not make it more oily.</li>
            <li>Excellent facial product</li>
            <li>Also love the smell.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;m using this product it got better.</li>
            <li>but i like the exfoliator better.</li>
            <li>recommend this to people who love organic skincare and appreciate radiant and healthy skin.</li>
            <li>The top was taped with scotch tape...</li>
            <li>Even better, the customer service experience I had was an A++.</li>
            <li>Wash arrived promptly and I love the line.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I do like all of the eminence products I have tried, but this one is just ok.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>I could go on and on, I just love these products by Eminence.</li>
            <li>This cleanser, and the Eminence skin care line, is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>The best facial wash.  </li>
            <li>I had a sample size from Christmas and am very pleased with the full sized version.  </li>

            <li>After one use my skin was as smooth as smooth can be and glowing!  </li>
            <li>Smooth and light!</li>
            <li>does not take off makeup well but has great antibacterial elements, great smell, and have not had one breakout in the past six months since using it</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the gel wash cleans and removes mascara, concealer and powders blush easily without leaving a residue.  </li>
            <li>This gentle face wash is perfect for sensitive or aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Read the labels on these products and be amazed that you can pronounce each one easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved every eminence product I&#x27;ve gotten so far :)</li>
            <li>I am 45 and this makes my skin and pores feel fresh clean and as if it is getting more oxygen!  </li>
            <li>I am a new convert to Eminence and decided on this face wash after looking at the Bright Skin Cleanser and Acai Cleanser by Eminence.</li>
            <li>I am a new Eminence convert and I can&#x27;t stop saying good things about these products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that was first used on me at a local spa.  </li>

            <li>This is a great facial wash!</li>
            <li>I have used a 1000 different brands in my life and this is a great brand.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have a few Eminence products now, and have been using them for about a month and each one smells wonderful!</li>

            <li>This is a great facial wash.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>

            <li>I have mild rosacea and easily irritated skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and having to use a wash cloth to rinse your face is very cumbersome.</li>
            <li>After using this product every night along with the Jane Iredale Magic Mit to double ensure that all traces of make up and pollution has been removed, we are happy to say that we are finally clear faced and have that dewy healthy glow we have all heard about and have always wanted.  </li>

            <li>My skin feels so clean.</li>
            <li>You think you&#x27;re getting more from the bottle that you see in the picture, but this bottle is kind of tiny.  </li>
            <li>But it gets my skin clean.</li>
            <li>The cons - I thing to effectively clean your skin from the day&#x27;s make-up, dirt and oil</li>
            <li>now my skin is getting washed more regularly and getting more attention which makes this a worthwhile product right there alone.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s because I switched to this more gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to find natural products that don&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stone Crop gets face SUPER clean &amp; clears up all \\&quot;marks\\&quot; on face.&lt;br /&gt;Evens skin tone.  </li>

            <li>love this gentle face wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel like consistency and glides on with a cool feel to it.  </li>
            <li>i think ever one should use it it last for every and its really good to the face.</li>
            <li>Love it, could really tell a difference in the bumps under my eyes but this also could be from he witch hazel</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone who wants healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best gel wash for sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and fresh after I use this.</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash, just wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the cost.</li>
            <li>and it will make a mild lather.</li>
            <li>I have mild Rosacea and their cleansers and moisturizers</li>
            <li>Great with breakouts and dark spots.</li>
            <li>Skin feels fresh and clean right after.</li>
            <li>I also use the Stone Crop Serum at night which is probably a large contributor to my new amazing skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you to Amazon for offering these great products and saving us girls a little on the price.  </li>
            <li>but I still like the wash and think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>great all natural face wash just wish it came in a larger container.  </li>
            <li>I also use the whip moisturizer and hydrating mist and love them all so far.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle, effective, and moisturizing and my skin has suffered far fewer breakouts than before I began using the gel wash a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li>But an esthetician at a spa where I had a fabulous facial suggested that cleansing my face more thoroughly, rather than shying away from that, might improve the rosacea.</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy, youthful, and clear..</li>
            <li>I am allergicc to many fragrances and though this poduct has a scent, it is so fresh and natural</li>
            <li>I use both the STONE CROP + RED ROSE CLEANSERS.</li>
            <li>I also love that all the ingredients are natural.  </li>
            <li>it can be bought on amazon for much cheaper than in these salons that want your first born child!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it has done the job very nicely without ever causing my skin any trouble.</li>
            <li>Everyone else is right--</li>
            <li>Well, she was right.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Eminence skin care exclusively for almost 2 years now, and what a positive difference that has made!</li>
            <li>It has antibacterial properties for those of us who are acne prone; hydrating properties for the dry skinned folks; lightening properties for hyperpigmentation (sun spots, etc.); and great ingredients for those concerned with aging skin, as well as sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is great but the bottle is so small.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for morning cleansing, it isn&#x27;t harsh and the smell is so clean its a nice scent to wake up to!</li>
            <li>I really recommend it for anyone looking for a natural solution. :-)</li>
            <li>She used Eminence during the facial, and I later bought some Eminence cleansing and moisturizing products (Amazon has great prices on them, by the way).</li>
            <li>My 53 year old skin feels fresh and smooth and plump and dewy.  </li>
            <li>i have been very pleased with other &#x27;eminence&#x27; products that i&#x27;ve used ie.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use very much, it cleans well</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser because my skin gets very clean and isn&#x27;t dried out at all from</li>
            <li>Does a fine job cleaning my combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have 64-year old normal/dry olive/tan skin and this is now my primary cleanser.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for the first time with a clarisonic.</li>
            <li>First time to purchase this facewash.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t order again, but I&#x27;m satisfied enough to finish the product</li>
            <li>It is so thick that great globs want to come out at t time.</li>
            <li>Check out the website if you&#x27;re really interested.</li>
            <li>To be honest, putting strange chemicals is a big concern for me as my skin doesn&#x27;t react well to some of them, and itching and red splotches just isn&#x27;t a good look for me.</li>
            <li>love these products and can&#x27;t recommend them enough!</li>
            <li>I love all of Eminence products and had learned about them after having a facial.</li>
            <li>The first item I purchased&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>Purchased for my wife and it is exactly what she wanted</li>
            <li>I have finally found a product I can say I&#x27;m totally in love with.  </li>
            <li>I use various Emminence products and I just love them.  </li>
            <li>, it makes my skin skin so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>After a long day of dealing with kids, dogs, cleaning the house and cooking, my skin feels clean and soft, something I love to feel as I get into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much cleared of my breakouts.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty horrified by the cost, but the woman assured me I only needed a pea-sized dab to clean my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I started using this after a facial and it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I will say that it doesn&#x27;t always get my waterproof mascara all the way off (even after targeting my eyelashes gently with my fingers and gel wash)</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My esthetician recommended Stone Crop Gel Wash because it is so gentle</li>
            <li>and I have been breakout free for the last eight months.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper through amazon though, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and works well.</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li>so I can really work the product in.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it feels like it isn&#x27;t cleansing very efficiently.</li>
            <li>I use the whole line of stone crop and the poppy seed and pear.</li>
            <li>Now her friend&#x27;s parents ask me what shes been using because her skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li>I really like how this feels on my face.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I tried the stone crop gel wash because I wanted to have a gentle cleanser that didn&#x27;t strip moisture from my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling super clean but soft and moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it is and at the same time washes all the make up.</li>
            <li>I compliment it with another eminence product (the lemon scrub cleanser), which I alternate when I need a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>This all natural product really gets the job done!</li>
            <li>I love using Stone Crop during the initial cleanse during a facial (I am an Esthetician).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly for all types of skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Stone Crop Gel Wash to anyone.</li>
            <li>After years of searching for a product that cleaned my skin well, left it feeling calm and refreshed, and cleared up acne and blackheads</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks, my skin looked MUCH, MUCH better.</li>
            <li>So the price is ok since it will last so long.</li>
            <li>This wash is very economical, only a tiny drop is needed to wash whole face.</li>
            <li>I previously used Korres Milk Protein Cleanser, as I was already concerned about using more natural ingredients on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried other Eminence products, and they are good products, but not right for my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I have a very sensitive skin and have been using this for a few years now and never have problems.</li>
            <li>My new facial  product line, so fresh and natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been prone to occasional minor T-zone breakouts, as well as more consistant hormonal breakouts (especially with being pregnant).</li>
            <li>The skin around my nose and my cheeks doesn&#x27;t have that red tinge to it that I often get in the winter, leaving me with smoother looking skin, and I have found that this wash is very gentle, and yet cleans my face.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>after the first week I noticed my pores were smaller</li>
            <li>I have to admit the product smells nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Battery life long, keyboard is as comfortable as standard size.</li>
            <li>I like the citrus exfoliator better as a daily face wash compared to this gel wash.&lt;br /&gt;Although, when i recieved this package it was not sealed and it looked like it was previously used once?&lt;br /&gt;Either</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin and struggled in the past with finding a good facial cleanser that keeps the occasional breakout at bay.</li>
            <li>No water added so it needs just a little on your hands or face to go on smooth.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was expecting it to foam a little more.  </li>
            <li>I tend to use more product than I should (old habits die hard)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt that this cleans my face, but it is not that squeaky clean feeling that I am used to with my previous cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Plus it leaves your skin feeling cleansed, clear, and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>have acne prone skin that is sensitive</li>
            <li>It made my skin to even out and is gentle enough where it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I like this face wash so far.</li>
            <li>Not harsh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old</li>
            <li>Each one is gentle on my skin, and seems to actually do what it claims to do!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with tendency to break outs</li>
            <li>I have battled adult acne and do not find the gel wash aggravating to my skin.</li>
            <li>Never harsh or drying.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It removes oil from my skin (but the oil comes right back shortly after).  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased the Stone Crop Gel Wash for my teenage daughter (13) that was suffering from extreme acne and blackheads.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for a daily cleanser!</li>
            <li>If you want high quality skincare, look no further.  </li>
            <li>The bottle lasts a long time as you dont need much each time you use it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face fresh but not dried out or tight.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bit mild for my tastes, that is why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t strip natural barrier, so there&#x27;s no dry feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>Within a week we could see and feel a major improvement in the condition of our skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I am at a spa every day and now look forward to washing my face twice a day (where as for years before, I could barely manage to wash my face twice a week).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not great, it&#x27;s not horrible...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who has trouble finding the right product for their skin.</li>
            <li>and if you use this along with the other products it really keeps my face from drying up.</li>
            <li>I hardly even have to wear any concealer besides under my eyes and only use a light mineral powder on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit as you add water so it also goes quite far.</li>
            <li>that is a cleanser and not a mask - yet it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>first products I&#x27;ve used in years that  require so little effort to feel cleansed and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>no more dry blotchy patches, my pores are smaller, tone is more even, and i my skin looks younger overall.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it in conjunction with other Eminence products.  </li>

            <li> until you use a really good one.  </li>
            <li> I cant say how good this produce is</li>

            <li> LOVE this Eminence product!</li>
            <li> I love this line and what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash EVER!</li>
            <li> Like the smell and happy I can use all eminence organic products while pregnant / bfing!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This line of products is amazing.  </li>
            <li> has a nice smell...</li>
            <li> Nice scrub.  </li>
            <li> I do kind of like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The results are great though, so it is worth it for me!</li>
            <li> It does a great job, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as clean and refreshed as I would like it.</li>
            <li> or I might try another type of wash in the Eminence line as there are so many great options available to choose</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and the product is smooth.</li>
            <li> good, and seems genuine...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the higher price sway you from purchasing this great product.</li>
            <li> is that it is very light</li>
            <li> most days i follow with the stone crop hydrating mist.  </li>
            <li> Which ends up making this wash probably cheaper than most things I used to buy at Sephora.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I notice that my face doesn&#x27;t seem to have as many breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they included more product for the price.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to have perfect skin so tried to deal with them.</li>
            <li> I LoVE Eminence.</li>
            <li> Love love love....</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face wash.</li>
            <li> The smell is refreshing and not over powering at all.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Eminence skincare products.</li>
            <li> Also, one of these lasts about 6 months if you use twice daily which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this at MGM Grand Detroit at the spa there.</li>
            <li> Great gentle face wash, solved all my skin problems within a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way my skin feels when I use it.</li>
            <li> And, I love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> It brightens my skin and makes it look extremely healthy.</li>
            <li> I have never been comfortable without make up on until now!</li>
            <li> I had a lot of congestion under my skin, mostly around my chin and in my cheeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> and I really love the smell.</li>
            <li> Makes it more enjoyable to wash my face:)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...</li>

            <li> Simply the best!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this Gel wash.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this product since I love the moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li> I want to just be able to splash the product off.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these products.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and nothing I did made it better -- including dermatologist-prescribed treatments.</li>
            <li> and it did not make it more oily.</li>
            <li> Excellent facial product</li>
            <li> Also love the smell.</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;m using this product it got better.</li>
            <li> but i like the exfoliator better.</li>
            <li> recommend this to people who love organic skincare and appreciate radiant and healthy skin.</li>
            <li> The top was taped with scotch tape...</li>
            <li> Even better, the customer service experience I had was an A++.</li>
            <li> Wash arrived promptly and I love the line.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I do like all of the eminence products I have tried, but this one is just ok.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> I could go on and on, I just love these products by Eminence.</li>
            <li> This cleanser, and the Eminence skin care line, is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> The best facial wash.  </li>
            <li> I had a sample size from Christmas and am very pleased with the full sized version.  </li>

            <li> Love the smell of this product and each time I wash my face</li>
            <li> I love this facewash.  </li>
            <li> Tried a cream one from Eminence before this, I like this one MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> I use this stone crop in the mornings and it&#x27;s so refreshing and hydrating.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling wonderful, clean but not tight.</li>
            <li> Stone Crop Gel is gentle and effective!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and light, leaves my face feel refreshed and healthy.</li>
            <li> After one use my skin was as smooth as smooth can be and glowing!  </li>
            <li> Smooth and light!</li>
            <li> does not take off makeup well but has great antibacterial elements, great smell, and have not had one breakout in the past six months since using it</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the gel wash cleans and removes mascara, concealer and powders blush easily without leaving a residue.  </li>
            <li> This gentle face wash is perfect for sensitive or aging skin.  </li>
            <li> Read the labels on these products and be amazed that you can pronounce each one easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved every eminence product I&#x27;ve gotten so far :)</li>
            <li> I am 45 and this makes my skin and pores feel fresh clean and as if it is getting more oxygen!  </li>
            <li> I am a new convert to Eminence and decided on this face wash after looking at the Bright Skin Cleanser and Acai Cleanser by Eminence.</li>
            <li> I am a new Eminence convert and I can&#x27;t stop saying good things about these products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that was first used on me at a local spa.  </li>
            <li> but i love it, smells good, cleans my skin and does not dry it out</li>
            <li> HUGE difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> face feels smooth, dewy after use.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial wash!</li>
            <li> I have used a 1000 different brands in my life and this is a great brand.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I have a few Eminence products now, and have been using them for about a month and each one smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Definitely does a great job of cleansing.  </li>

            <li> Both leave my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea and easily irritated skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and having to use a wash cloth to rinse your face is very cumbersome.</li>
            <li> After using this product every night along with the Jane Iredale Magic Mit to double ensure that all traces of make up and pollution has been removed, we are happy to say that we are finally clear faced and have that dewy healthy glow we have all heard about and have always wanted.  </li>
            <li> This stuff IS worth the money in my opinion!</li>
            <li> it makes me smile! :0)</li>

            <li> My skin feels so clean.</li>
            <li> You think you&#x27;re getting more from the bottle that you see in the picture, but this bottle is kind of tiny.  </li>
            <li> But it gets my skin clean.</li>
            <li> The cons - I thing to effectively clean your skin from the day&#x27;s make-up, dirt and oil</li>
            <li> now my skin is getting washed more regularly and getting more attention which makes this a worthwhile product right there alone.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s because I switched to this more gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to find natural products that don&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stone Crop gets face SUPER clean &amp; clears up all \\&quot;marks\\&quot; on face.&lt;br /&gt;Evens skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I like it good enough.</li>
            <li> love this gentle face wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gel like consistency and glides on with a cool feel to it.  </li>
            <li> i think ever one should use it it last for every and its really good to the face.</li>
            <li> Love it, could really tell a difference in the bumps under my eyes but this also could be from he witch hazel</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who wants healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel wash for sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and fresh after I use this.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash, just wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the cost.</li>
            <li> and it will make a mild lather.</li>
            <li> I have mild Rosacea and their cleansers and moisturizers</li>
            <li> Great with breakouts and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Skin feels fresh and clean right after.</li>
            <li> I also use the Stone Crop Serum at night which is probably a large contributor to my new amazing skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you to Amazon for offering these great products and saving us girls a little on the price.  </li>
            <li> but I still like the wash and think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> great all natural face wash just wish it came in a larger container.  </li>
            <li> I also use the whip moisturizer and hydrating mist and love them all so far.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle, effective, and moisturizing and my skin has suffered far fewer breakouts than before I began using the gel wash a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> But an esthetician at a spa where I had a fabulous facial suggested that cleansing my face more thoroughly, rather than shying away from that, might improve the rosacea.</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy, youthful, and clear..</li>
            <li> I am allergicc to many fragrances and though this poduct has a scent, it is so fresh and natural</li>
            <li> I use both the STONE CROP + RED ROSE CLEANSERS.</li>
            <li> I also love that all the ingredients are natural.  </li>
            <li> it can be bought on amazon for much cheaper than in these salons that want your first born child!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it has done the job very nicely without ever causing my skin any trouble.</li>
            <li> Everyone else is right--</li>
            <li> Well, she was right.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eminence skin care exclusively for almost 2 years now, and what a positive difference that has made!</li>
            <li> It has antibacterial properties for those of us who are acne prone; hydrating properties for the dry skinned folks; lightening properties for hyperpigmentation (sun spots, etc.); and great ingredients for those concerned with aging skin, as well as sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is great but the bottle is so small.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for morning cleansing, it isn&#x27;t harsh and the smell is so clean its a nice scent to wake up to!</li>
            <li> I really recommend it for anyone looking for a natural solution. :-)</li>
            <li> She used Eminence during the facial, and I later bought some Eminence cleansing and moisturizing products (Amazon has great prices on them, by the way).</li>
            <li> My 53 year old skin feels fresh and smooth and plump and dewy.  </li>
            <li> i have been very pleased with other &#x27;eminence&#x27; products that i&#x27;ve used ie.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use very much, it cleans well</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser because my skin gets very clean and isn&#x27;t dried out at all from</li>
            <li> Does a fine job cleaning my combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have 64-year old normal/dry olive/tan skin and this is now my primary cleanser.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time with a clarisonic.</li>
            <li> First time to purchase this facewash.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order again, but I&#x27;m satisfied enough to finish the product</li>
            <li> It is so thick that great globs want to come out at t time.</li>
            <li> Check out the website if you&#x27;re really interested.</li>
            <li> To be honest, putting strange chemicals is a big concern for me as my skin doesn&#x27;t react well to some of them, and itching and red splotches just isn&#x27;t a good look for me.</li>
            <li> love these products and can&#x27;t recommend them enough!</li>
            <li> I love all of Eminence products and had learned about them after having a facial.</li>
            <li> The first item I purchased&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife and it is exactly what she wanted</li>
            <li> I have finally found a product I can say I&#x27;m totally in love with.  </li>
            <li> I use various Emminence products and I just love them.  </li>
            <li> , it makes my skin skin so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> After a long day of dealing with kids, dogs, cleaning the house and cooking, my skin feels clean and soft, something I love to feel as I get into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much cleared of my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty horrified by the cost, but the woman assured me I only needed a pea-sized dab to clean my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I started using this after a facial and it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I will say that it doesn&#x27;t always get my waterproof mascara all the way off (even after targeting my eyelashes gently with my fingers and gel wash)</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended Stone Crop Gel Wash because it is so gentle</li>
            <li> and I have been breakout free for the last eight months.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper through amazon though, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and works well.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li> so I can really work the product in.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it feels like it isn&#x27;t cleansing very efficiently.</li>
            <li> I use the whole line of stone crop and the poppy seed and pear.</li>
            <li> Now her friend&#x27;s parents ask me what shes been using because her skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li> I really like how this feels on my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I tried the stone crop gel wash because I wanted to have a gentle cleanser that didn&#x27;t strip moisture from my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling super clean but soft and moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it is and at the same time washes all the make up.</li>
            <li> I compliment it with another eminence product (the lemon scrub cleanser), which I alternate when I need a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> This all natural product really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I love using Stone Crop during the initial cleanse during a facial (I am an Esthetician).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly for all types of skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Stone Crop Gel Wash to anyone.</li>
            <li> After years of searching for a product that cleaned my skin well, left it feeling calm and refreshed, and cleared up acne and blackheads</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, my skin looked MUCH, MUCH better.</li>
            <li> So the price is ok since it will last so long.</li>
            <li> This wash is very economical, only a tiny drop is needed to wash whole face.</li>
            <li> I previously used Korres Milk Protein Cleanser, as I was already concerned about using more natural ingredients on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other Eminence products, and they are good products, but not right for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have a very sensitive skin and have been using this for a few years now and never have problems.</li>
            <li> My new facial  product line, so fresh and natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been prone to occasional minor T-zone breakouts, as well as more consistant hormonal breakouts (especially with being pregnant).</li>
            <li> The skin around my nose and my cheeks doesn&#x27;t have that red tinge to it that I often get in the winter, leaving me with smoother looking skin, and I have found that this wash is very gentle, and yet cleans my face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li> after the first week I noticed my pores were smaller</li>
            <li> I have to admit the product smells nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Battery life long, keyboard is as comfortable as standard size.</li>
            <li> I like the citrus exfoliator better as a daily face wash compared to this gel wash.&lt;br /&gt;Although, when i recieved this package it was not sealed and it looked like it was previously used once?&lt;br /&gt;Either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin and struggled in the past with finding a good facial cleanser that keeps the occasional breakout at bay.</li>
            <li> No water added so it needs just a little on your hands or face to go on smooth.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was expecting it to foam a little more.  </li>
            <li> I tend to use more product than I should (old habits die hard)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt that this cleans my face, but it is not that squeaky clean feeling that I am used to with my previous cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus it leaves your skin feeling cleansed, clear, and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> have acne prone skin that is sensitive</li>
            <li> It made my skin to even out and is gentle enough where it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash so far.</li>
            <li> Not harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old</li>
            <li> Each one is gentle on my skin, and seems to actually do what it claims to do!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with tendency to break outs</li>
            <li> I have battled adult acne and do not find the gel wash aggravating to my skin.</li>
            <li> Never harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It removes oil from my skin (but the oil comes right back shortly after).  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Stone Crop Gel Wash for my teenage daughter (13) that was suffering from extreme acne and blackheads.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for a daily cleanser!</li>
            <li> If you want high quality skincare, look no further.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time as you dont need much each time you use it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face fresh but not dried out or tight.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit mild for my tastes, that is why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t strip natural barrier, so there&#x27;s no dry feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Within a week we could see and feel a major improvement in the condition of our skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am at a spa every day and now look forward to washing my face twice a day (where as for years before, I could barely manage to wash my face twice a week).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, it&#x27;s not horrible...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has trouble finding the right product for their skin.</li>
            <li> and if you use this along with the other products it really keeps my face from drying up.</li>
            <li> I hardly even have to wear any concealer besides under my eyes and only use a light mineral powder on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit as you add water so it also goes quite far.</li>
            <li> that is a cleanser and not a mask - yet it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> first products I&#x27;ve used in years that  require so little effort to feel cleansed and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> no more dry blotchy patches, my pores are smaller, tone is more even, and i my skin looks younger overall.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it in conjunction with other Eminence products.  </li>
            <li> We had tried virtually everything from a year&#x27;s worth of dermatology visits and endless sample products that did little but burn and peel her face and still left blackheads and acne, Proactive, Philosophy, Cetaphil, Clairsonic, a multitude of drug store products, etc.  </li>
            <li> Eminence does not use fillers so a little goes a long way and lasts much longer than the cheaper cleansers.</li>
            <li> It last a long time from May till just recently.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is affordable, and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Our skin calmed down and old acne marks are fading as well.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I wish Eminence would do (and this is very minor) is make a travel size</li>
            <li> I believe they changed the formula on this because my skin became red and dry.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that tends to get rough during the colder months despite regular exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> Takes a lot to shower so wont go a long way.</li>
            <li> but the bottle goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Seller delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and you only need a little bit and the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get the right amt out of the container.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to purchase for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It is not drying and I sometimes leave it on very long forgetting</li>
            <li> and then will last only after a few showers.  </li>
            <li> - feels cleansed but not dry or tight.  </li>
            <li> The price is steep for a facial wash however, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it is only about half way gone.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> seems to be clearing my blocked enlarged pores and they seem to look a little smaller, I&#x27;ll keep going with it and see how it works for my skin..</li>
            <li> Not enough to use everyday, maybe once a week</li>
            <li> Not much is needed and my skin feels tighter after each use of this gel wash product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and she was right.  </li>
            <li> It is not very effective in removing deep dirt or make-up and traces etc.</li>
            <li> However this stuff I received from Amazon seems watered down compared to the little amount I had left in the other bottle.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The Eminence products are so concentrated that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> little drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> No more red bumps!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it has improved acne or other skin issues.  </li>
            <li> We are now investing in other Eminence products.  </li>
            <li> and I find that my skin feels a little dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> No more white bumps and less blackheads.</li>
            <li> A very little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was also made to believe that sunscreens over the counter are somehow fake or don&#x27;t have the real</li>
            <li> etc never let down with these products</li>
            <li> Only need to use a small amount and it cleanses without drying!</li>
            <li> bought a few other eminence products here on amazon &amp; waiting for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wash only requires a very small amt thus prolonging the use.  </li>
            <li> I have typical combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m replacing my regular washes &amp; sunscreens because they are over the counter &amp; the esthetician said are not good products because of the chemicals.</li>
            <li> and I have tried nearly every cleanser on the market, including Obagi and other expensive skin care lines.  </li>
            <li> Cleanses and doesn&#x27;t leave a tight skin</li>
            <li> All you need is a little</li>
            <li> We noticed that the Stone Crop Gel Wash did not burn our face the way the other products had in the past.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for a few days while on vacation</li>
            <li> I go through these in a few weeks....</li>
            <li> I use the Stone Crop Gel Wash as recommended by my esthetician for my uneven skin tone associated with hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> (gel is not easy to get in and out of a travel bottle).</li>
            <li> I add a little bit of water to a small amount and a bottle lasts me around six months.</li>
            <li> Enough that I purchased some expensive acne creams.    </li>
            <li> I had small white bumps on my chin area and even despite using an expensive over priced cream, they were still there.</li>
            <li> This a.m I washed my face w/ it &amp; used a small face sponge/scrub to massage.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will be buying anything from this line of skincare.</li>
            <li> Too expensive to buy on the regular though.</li>
            <li> No more redness, irritation, or sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less expensive or</li>
            <li> but I found Stone Crop Gel a little bit of thin comparing the one which I had bought.</li>
            <li> I recommend it at least to try.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I&#x27;m 45 and only found this product now.  </li>

            <li> Love this product, I have a very sensitive skin and have been using this for a few years now and never have problems. I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleansing and leaves my skin smooth and refreshed - feels cleansed but not dry or tight.  I have 64-year old normal/dry olive/tan skin and this is now my primary cleanser.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and light, leaves my face feel refreshed and healthy.</li>
            <li> i am 65 and have skin that isn&#x27;t perfect.  the gel wash cleans and removes mascara, concealer and powders blush easily without leaving a residue.  face feels smooth, dewy after use.  most days i follow with the stone crop hydrating mist.  first products I&#x27;ve used in years that  require so little effort to feel cleansed and hydrated.  now that winter has arrived i will probably be using the mist intraday. i have been very pleased with other &#x27;eminence&#x27; products that i&#x27;ve used ie. cream moisturizer and masks.</li>
            <li> I am a new convert to Eminence and decided on this face wash after looking at the Bright Skin Cleanser and Acai Cleanser by Eminence. I felt this Stone Crop was a good introductory product into the line. Everyone else is right-- I would almost buy this and use it again just for the smell of it-- it is refreshing and heavenly! I feel like I am at a spa every day and now look forward to washing my face twice a day (where as for years before, I could barely manage to wash my face twice a week). I previously used Korres Milk Protein Cleanser, as I was already concerned about using more natural ingredients on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now my skin is getting washed more regularly and getting more attention which makes this a worthwhile product right there alone. I will say that it doesn&#x27;t always get my waterproof mascara all the way off (even after targeting my eyelashes gently with my fingers and gel wash) but I still like the wash and think it is worth the money. I would buy this again when it is gone or I might try another type of wash in the Eminence line as there are so many great options available to choose from!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have been using this twice a day for 3 1/2 months and it is only about half way gone. A little goes a long way! Which ends up making this wash probably cheaper than most things I used to buy at Sephora.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and if you use this along with the other products it really keeps my face from drying up. I really recommend it for anyone looking for a natural solution. :-)</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients. This wash is very economical, only a tiny drop is needed to wash whole face. it leaves skin squeaky clean but it doesn&#x27;t strip natural barrier, so there&#x27;s no dry feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time with a clarisonic. I have mild rosacea and easily irritated skin. It improved within a week. I have to say I gave the credit to the clarisonic until I ran out of my stonecrop gel. I continued using the clarisonic but with cetaphil and noticed my skin getting steadily worse. This stuff IS worth the money in my opinion! Try it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve only been prone to occasional minor T-zone breakouts, as well as more consistant hormonal breakouts (especially with being pregnant). I didn&#x27;t use it for a few days while on vacation and my breakouts flared back up but 2 days into reusing it I&#x27;m pretty much cleared of my breakouts. Only use a dime size if that each wash.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It seems to do a good job and I notice that my face doesn&#x27;t seem to have as many breakouts.  I just wish they included more product for the price.</li>
            <li> In one word, Eminence&#x27;s Stone Crop Gel Wash is incredible.      I have combination skin that tends to get rough during the colder months despite regular exfoliation.  A friend swears by Eminence&#x27;s products and gave me a sample of this wash to try; I believe her words were \\&quot;It&#x27;ll change your skin, I swear!\\&quot;.  I was skeptical and she was right.  After one use my skin was as smooth as smooth can be and glowing!  My skin has continuously behaved since I began using this and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> great all natural face wash just wish it came in a larger container.  I go through these in a few weeks....</li>
            <li> I have typical combination skin.  For years I used a foamy face wash, like Origins \\&quot;Checks &amp; Balances.\\&quot;  I never felt clean unless lots of suds were involved.  However, I still suffered from monthly break outs.  Enough that I purchased some expensive acne creams.    Then I was treated to a facial at a local spa that uses Eminence products.  I bought the 4 oz. Stone Crop Gel Wash even though I was skeptical with it&#x27;s lack of suds.  That was in January 2011.  It&#x27;s Aug 2011 now and I&#x27;ve only had one zit in that eight months.  I know it&#x27;s because I switched to this more gentle cleanser.  I changed nothing else in my skin care routine or diet.    After eight months, and daily use, the 4 oz bottle is just now getting low enough for me to reorder.      *Note, I use eye make-up remover before the Gel Wash (it will not remove eye make up)</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a new Eminence convert and I can&#x27;t stop saying good things about these products.&lt;br /&gt;This gel wash leaves your skin feeling clean and oil free. A little goes a long way. No water added so it needs just a little on your hands or face to go on smooth. A tiny amount goes a long way. Addicted to this.</li>
            <li> Love this product !!! This has improved my skin I love this product and I buy eminence for everything creams face mask face oils etc never let down with these products</li>
            <li> This gel cleanser is great! I compliment it with another eminence product (the lemon scrub cleanser), which I alternate when I need a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> I started using this face wash a couple of months ago.  I absolutely LOVE IT!  I had small white bumps on my chin area and even despite using an expensive over priced cream, they were still there. They drove me crazy!  I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to have perfect skin so tried to deal with them. Then I started using the stone crop on recommendation. My skin is nearly perfect. No more white bumps and less blackheads. I have not broke out once using this product. I LoVE Eminence. I am sold!!</li>
            <li> I love the Stone Crop line and the way it smells!  If you are used to organic products, you will appreciate the smell of this.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.  The only reason why I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was expecting it to foam a little more.  I like my face to feel squeaky clean.  I don&#x27;t doubt that this cleans my face, but it is not that squeaky clean feeling that I am used to with my previous cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin that is sensitive and this product has not affected my skin negatively at all!  I highly recommend using it in conjunction with other Eminence products.  I also use the whip moisturizer and hydrating mist and love them all so far.</li>
            <li> This product is great but the bottle is so small.  Not enough to use everyday, maybe once a week and then will last only after a few showers.  Takes a lot to shower so wont go a long way.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash, just wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the cost. It would be nice to find natural products that don&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> Smooth and light! Very refreshing! Love love love....this product!  Non- drying, it makes my skin skin so soft and clean. Your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> I love using Stone Crop during the initial cleanse during a facial (I am an Esthetician).  It has something for everyone.  It is a great well-rounded cleanser.  It has antibacterial properties for those of us who are acne prone; hydrating properties for the dry skinned folks; lightening properties for hyperpigmentation (sun spots, etc.); and great ingredients for those concerned with aging skin, as well as sensitive skin.  No matter your skin type its a great cleanser.  I highly recommend it for morning cleansing, it isn&#x27;t harsh and the smell is so clean its a nice scent to wake up to!</li>
            <li> An aesthetician recommended this product to me and I decided to give it a try. It doesn&#x27;t give me clean skin feeling. I had increased acne and shiny skin and had to stop using it. It is expensive, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face wash. It made my skin to even out and is gentle enough where it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. The smell is refreshing and not over powering at all. I add a little bit of water to a small amount and a bottle lasts me around six months. Eminence makes the best products.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash so far. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and I like how my skin feels after.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit is all you need. Great hydrating cleanser! Stone crop is perfect for healing, hydrating and hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Eminence skincare products. My esthetician recommended to me as she is from Hungary and that is where these products are made and from. Extremely good products, cream of the crop!</li>
            <li> I had really bad hormonal breakouts and tried everything. My esthetician recommended Stone Crop Gel Wash because it is so gentle and I have been breakout free for the last eight months. Also, one of these lasts about 6 months if you use twice daily which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this at MGM Grand Detroit at the spa there. It last a long time from May till just recently. However this stuff I received from Amazon seems watered down compared to the little amount I had left in the other bottle. Also it didn&#x27;t seem to lather up as well. Smelled about the same. Still cleans your face but there seems to be a difference unless they changed the formula...</li>
            <li> Great gentle face wash, solved all my skin problems within a couple weeks.  A bit expensive but the bottle goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Seller delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Great cleaner for face.  Not much is needed and my skin feels tighter after each use of this gel wash product.</li>
            <li> I came across this stuff at a spa after having a facial. I was pretty horrified by the cost, but the woman assured me I only needed a pea-sized dab to clean my face and neck. Well, she was right. This product is gentle, effective, and moisturizing and my skin has suffered far fewer breakouts than before I began using the gel wash a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cleanser.  I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;stone crop\\&quot; is, but my skin LOVES it!  Leaves my skin clean &amp; clear.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to get the Hydrating Mist!&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:March 9, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Stone Crop gets face SUPER clean &amp; clears up all \\&quot;marks\\&quot; on face.&lt;br /&gt;Evens skin tone.  No more red bumps!</li>
            <li> good, and seems genuine...skin looks great...and happy with it...has a nice smell...only need a tiny amount to wash your face so it lasts longer than you think</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. Skin feels fresh and clean right after. A little goes a long way. It is also a bit moisturizing. Great with breakouts and dark spots. Its not an overnight results but results are visible.</li>
            <li> First time to purchase this facewash.  I like it good enough.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cleanser.  I am 57 but still have oily/combination skin and this stuff works great.  I love the smell and the way my skin feels when I use it.</li>
            <li> Love eminence! Lasts forever and you literally need a tiny dot of facewash to cover your entire face and neck! I&#x27;ve loved every eminence product I&#x27;ve gotten so far :)</li>
            <li> The smell alone is the best part of waking up in the morning and best way to go to bed at night not to mention it is great on your skin... It is not harmful in any way possible...  It makes your skin feel fantastic. and best news ever... it can be bought on amazon for much cheaper than in these salons that want your first born child!!  Great stuff!!  I would suggest it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after I wash it with this gel. And, I love the citrus smell. I have been looking for a face wash for the longest time. I am sticking with this.</li>
            <li> I started using this after a facial and it has made a huge difference. It&#x27;s pricey but it lasted way longer so the price evens out to store bought products. And buying it online is cheaper than in store.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial wash! Only need to use a small amount and it cleanses without drying! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Stone Crop Gel is gentle and effective! It brightens my skin and makes it look extremely healthy. I wish it was a little less expensive or the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> My face has never looked as good as it does since I started using Eminence products!! I use the Stone Crop Gel Wash as recommended by my esthetician for my uneven skin tone associated with hyperpigmentation. I have never been comfortable without make up on until now! I hardly even have to wear any concealer besides under my eyes and only use a light mineral powder on the rest of my face. I had a lot of congestion under my skin, mostly around my chin and in my cheeks and it is GONE! I could go on and on. I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I also use the Stone Crop Serum at night which is probably a large contributor to my new amazing skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love this cleanser. It&#x27;s great for combination skin.</li>
            <li> Great gel wash. Not harsh. Smells great. My salon used this on me during my facial and I was hooked. Much cheaper through amazon though, which is always a plus. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use very much, it cleans well and I really love the smell. Makes it more enjoyable to wash my face:)</li>
            <li> I use this daily and sometimes twice a day. It&#x27;s gentle and works well. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...A one!!1</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash. I have used a 1000 different brands in my life and this is a great brand. I have used Murad, Peter Thomas Roth, Rodan and Fields, Clinique...ext...and I love the Eminence brand. I&#x27;m 30 years old and I have some concerns about my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it is that it is very light and you only need a little bit and the bottle will last a long time. My face feels so clean and fresh after I use this. I use it in conjunction with the Eminence Strawberry Rhubard Dermafoliant and the Eminence coconut anti-age moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin and struggled in the past with finding a good facial cleanser that keeps the occasional breakout at bay. When I was in my teens I used proactive with mixed results until finally one day I saw the Eminence products at my yoga studio. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it has done the job very nicely without ever causing my skin any trouble. I would highly recommend this product... The only thing I wish Eminence would do (and this is very minor) is make a travel size so I could have one of those for traveling (gel is not easy to get in and out of a travel bottle).</li>
            <li> Eminence Organic Skincare Stone Crop Gel Wash smell good and relaxing which makes my skin clean and smooth but I found Stone Crop Gel a little bit of thin comparing the one which I had bought.</li>
            <li> Simply the best!! Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> expensive but i love it, smells good, cleans my skin and does not dry it out</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this Gel wash. Was recommended by my Dermatologist. It is fantastic.  Would recommend highly for all types of skin.</li>
            <li> Nice scrub.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this product since I love the moisturizer cream. The smell is very strong and having to use a wash cloth to rinse your face is very cumbersome. I want to just be able to splash the product off.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel wash for sensitive and dry skin.  The smell is intoxicating!  Stone Crop Gel leaves your skin refreshed, clean and balanced.  There is no drying feeling whatsoever.  Highly recommend for a daily cleanser!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and a half.  HUGE difference in my skin.  I love, love, love these products.  I also use the Bamboo firming lotion and the coconut mosturizer.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if</li>
            <li> I am 45 and this makes my skin and pores feel fresh clean and as if it is getting more oxygen!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 yrs now and after the first week I noticed my pores were smaller and my face was clearer too!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Once you get used to not having the foam/suds this is really really good stuff. I love the smell. It does not over-dry or leave my face feeling slimy. A very little of this product goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had this bottle for about 3 months and have not even used a 1/4 of it yet and I use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now. I get compliments on the smoothness of my skin. I continue to recommend this product to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must buy!</li>
            <li> I am big into organic beauty products. I have to admit the product smells nice and a little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation but hasn&#x27;t improved the quality of my skin. I like using this with my clairsonic so I can really work the product in. Otherwise it feels like it isn&#x27;t cleansing very efficiently. I wouldn&#x27;t order again, but I&#x27;m satisfied enough to finish the product</li>
            <li> A pleasant fragrance and cleanses nicely. A little hard to get the right amt out of the container.  It is so thick that great globs want to come out at t time.</li>
            <li> LOVE this Eminence product! It leaves my face feeling super clean but soft and moisturized at the same time. I&#x27;ve used Eminence skin care exclusively for almost 2 years now, and what a positive difference that has made! I have rosacea, and nothing I did made it better -- including dermatologist-prescribed treatments. But an esthetician at a spa where I had a fabulous facial suggested that cleansing my face more thoroughly, rather than shying away from that, might improve the rosacea. She used Eminence during the facial, and I later bought some Eminence cleansing and moisturizing products (Amazon has great prices on them, by the way). Within a few weeks, my skin looked MUCH, MUCH better. I am very happy with the Eminence line and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li> If I could give this 10 stars I would.. I started to break out in my 30&#x27;s. I tried everything!! I ended up going and getting a facial and the girl recommended this to me. I noticed a difference right away. I have oily skin and it did not make it more oily. All you need is a little and it goes a long way. I use the whole line of stone crop and the poppy seed and pear. This product is the best! I have tried other Eminence products, and they are good products, but not right for my skin. I will keep using eminence stone crop set. I would recommend this product to anyone who has trouble finding the right product for their skin. My skin looks healthy, youthful, and clear.. I get complements on my skin all the time!!! Buy this.. it&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
            <li> Excellent facial product</li>
            <li> Amazing. My skin feels so clean. Also love the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that was first used on me at a local spa.  I love this line and what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for cleansing, I just got it yesterday and used it evening and morning and already I see a difference with my skin which feels softer, Cleaner, seems to be clearing my blocked enlarged pores and they seem to look a little smaller, I&#x27;ll keep going with it and see how it works for my skin..</li>
            <li> Check out the website if you&#x27;re really interested. I got this one based on a recommendation of an esthetician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin condition is some hyper pigmentation, some acne scars, whatever happens to your skin when you don&#x27;t exfoliate regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label says it is for all skin types &amp; it feels good &amp; soothing. This a.m I washed my face w/ it &amp; used a small face sponge/scrub to massage. I used a SPF 30 sunscreen afterward that is not over the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m replacing my regular washes &amp; sunscreens because they are over the counter &amp; the esthetician said are not good products because of the chemicals. I was also made to believe that sunscreens over the counter are somehow fake or don&#x27;t have the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a few other eminence products here on amazon &amp; waiting for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always trying to find what celebrities use, but can&#x27;t afford what is equivalent to a mortgage payment for me, so this will have to do...</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the Eminence skin care line during a surprise trip to the spa arranged for me by my husband. To be honest, putting strange chemicals is a big concern for me as my skin doesn&#x27;t react well to some of them, and itching and red splotches just isn&#x27;t a good look for me. So, when I heard that this line was about as organic as a skin care line can get I was intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked the aesthetician a lot of questions and she helped me pick out some products that would work. Of course being that this is an organic upscale line, everything costs and arm and a leg, so when i saw the price on Amazon for this wash, I jumped at the chance to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m so glad I did! I have a few Eminence products now, and have been using them for about a month and each one smells wonderful! Each one is gentle on my skin, and seems to actually do what it claims to do!  The skin around my nose and my cheeks doesn&#x27;t have that red tinge to it that I often get in the winter, leaving me with smoother looking skin, and I have found that this wash is very gentle, and yet cleans my face. After a long day of dealing with kids, dogs, cleaning the house and cooking, my skin feels clean and soft, something I love to feel as I get into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these products and can&#x27;t recommend them enough!</li>
            <li> Really good face wash. I have sensitive skin with tendency to break outs but since I&#x27;m using this product it got better.</li>
            <li> I like the citrus exfoliator better as a daily face wash compared to this gel wash.&lt;br /&gt;Although, when i recieved this package it was not sealed and it looked like it was previously used once?&lt;br /&gt;Either way, i was introduced to this product line when i recieved a facial.. They recommended this wash but i like the exfoliator better.</li>
            <li> It feels so good!  My 53 year old skin feels fresh and smooth and plump and dewy.  This line of products is amazing.  I am allergicc to many fragrances and though this poduct has a scent, it is so fresh and natural I wish I could just smell it all of the time.  Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser because my skin gets very clean and isn&#x27;t dried out at all from this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to people who love organic skincare and appreciate radiant and healthy skin.</li>
            <li> There is no safety seal how do I know if it&#x27;s legit? The top was taped with scotch tape...</li>
            <li> This gentle face wash is perfect for sensitive or aging skin.  It leaves my face fresh but not dried out or tight.  This is my go to wash and I miss it terribly when I have to use a different product.</li>
            <li> does not take off makeup well but has great antibacterial elements, great smell, and have not had one breakout in the past six months since using it</li>
            <li> love this gentle face wash. leaves my skin feeling wonderful, clean but not tight. great for problematic / acne skin. definitely have to remove makeup before cleansing though.</li>
            <li> I got this along with a moisturizer from the same company.  The moisturizer made me break out in an itchy rash.  The wash only requires a very small amt thus prolonging the use.  I felt like it cleaned without stripping the moisture out of my skin.  I don&#x27;t feel like it has improved acne or other skin issues.  I would not purchase this again.  Not sure I will be buying anything from this line of skincare.</li>
            <li> Definitely does a great job of cleansing.  The smell is pleasant and the product is smooth. Even better, the customer service experience I had was an A++.</li>
            <li> I switched to this gel wash after it was recommended to my boyfriend as a shave gel. He loves it and so do I. The price is steep for a facial wash however, a little goes a long way. I have battled adult acne and do not find the gel wash aggravating to my skin.</li>
            <li> I use both the STONE CROP + RED ROSE CLEANSERS. Both leave my skin feeling clean and smooth. Never harsh or drying. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Eminence line of skincare is amazing!  I highly recommend the Stone Crop Gel Wash to anyone.</li>
            <li> I believe they changed the formula on this because my skin became red and dry.</li>
            <li> Like the smell and happy I can use all eminence organic products while pregnant / bfing!</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I love all of Eminence products and had learned about them after having a facial. I left the&lt;br /&gt;salon with glowing skin and the products they used were all Eminence. The first item I purchased&lt;br /&gt;was the Stone Crop Gel Wash and absolutely loved it. You don&#x27;t realize how important a facial wash&lt;br /&gt;is until you use a really good one.  I use this along with my Jan Marini and Ayur Medic Lemon Grass&lt;br /&gt;wash--all of which are wonderful washes.  My daughter started using this wash as well and it helped&lt;br /&gt;with her acne.  She is hooked and now I have to buy two bottles...</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Battery life long, keyboard is as comfortable as standard size.</li>
            <li> I do kind of like this cleanser.  It removes oil from my skin (but the oil comes right back shortly after).  It&#x27;s a gel like consistency and glides on with a cool feel to it.  I think it&#x27;s too pricey, and that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.  The bottle is very small.  You think you&#x27;re getting more from the bottle that you see in the picture, but this bottle is kind of tiny.  I think I would purchase this again though.</li>
            <li> Wash arrived promptly and I love the line.  I wish it came in the larger bottle so I don&#x27;t have to purchase for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Love It!!!! Everything Eminence is amazing and smells great</li>
            <li> This is the third time I purchased this product. I will continue to do so because it always comes without any leakage and on time. Great product I have been using it for about 8 months now. Best face wash ever.</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling and feeling when I use it. It is concentrated so I use a tiny bit and put my hand under the water for a second and it will make a mild lather. So the price is ok since it will last so long. Was introduced to the product when I was getting a facial.</li>
            <li> I cant say how good this produce is i think ever one should use it it last for every and its really good to the face.</li>
            <li> I had a facial recently and the estictian used the Eminiance stone crop line on my skin.  i immeadiatley went to Amazong and purchased both the wash and the moisturizer.  since using this product my skin has improved 110%!  no more dry blotchy patches, my pores are smaller, tone is more even, and i my skin looks younger overall.  bonus, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife and it is exactly what she wanted so I am happy as I can be now</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash EVER!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use for my skin care. It is affordable, and long lasting.  My skin loves Eminence!</li>
            <li> Love it, could really tell a difference in the bumps under my eyes but this also could be from he witch hazel I have been using. Too expensive to buy on the regular though.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works on all skin types.</li>
            <li> I do like all of the eminence products I have tried, but this one is just ok. I use this in the evening and I find that my skin feels a little dry afterwards. I do love the smell. I have not noticed any difference in my skin after using this. But it gets my skin clean. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eminence brand for years so I was happy to find it at a great price.  A little goes a long way so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin. I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> After years of searching for a product that cleaned my skin well, left it feeling calm and refreshed, and cleared up acne and blackheads I have finally found a product I can say I&#x27;m totally in love with.  Too bad I&#x27;m 45 and only found this product now.  I originally purchased the Stone Crop Gel Wash for my teenage daughter (13) that was suffering from extreme acne and blackheads.  We had tried virtually everything from a year&#x27;s worth of dermatology visits and endless sample products that did little but burn and peel her face and still left blackheads and acne, Proactive, Philosophy, Cetaphil, Clairsonic, a multitude of drug store products, etc.  The Stone Crop Gel Wash from Eminence worked so good for her that I had to try it too just to see if it would make a difference for me with my aging and acne prone skin.  After using this product every night along with the Jane Iredale Magic Mit to double ensure that all traces of make up and pollution has been removed, we are happy to say that we are finally clear faced and have that dewy healthy glow we have all heard about and have always wanted.  Within a week we could see and feel a major improvement in the condition of our skin.  No more redness, irritation, or sensitivities.  We noticed that the Stone Crop Gel Wash did not burn our face the way the other products had in the past.  Our skin calmed down and old acne marks are fading as well.  We are now investing in other Eminence products.  Also use the Stone Crop Moisturizer which is AMAZING!  Thank you to Amazon for offering these great products and saving us girls a little on the price.  The Eminence products are so concentrated that a little goes a long way.  One bottle used by both of us nightly has lasted us approximately 4 months.  I tend to use more product than I should (old habits die hard) so it could last even longer.  A pea size is all you need on a moist face to do the job. I also love that all the ingredients are natural.  Read the labels on these products and be amazed that you can pronounce each one easily.  We&#x27;ve been using the product for approximately one year.  Now her friend&#x27;s parents ask me what shes been using because her skin has improved so much. I could go on and on, I just love these products by Eminence.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin and I have tried nearly every cleanser on the market, including Obagi and other expensive skin care lines.  This cleanser, and the Eminence skin care line, is my favorite.  My skin has never looked better.  Plus it leaves your skin feeling cleansed, clear, and hydrated.  GREAT product!</li>
            <li> I love how soft it is and at the same time washes all the make up.</li>
            <li> The best facial wash.  Freshens your skin and leaves it bright. Good for acne skin as it clears up the scars.</li>
            <li> I really like how this feels on my face. It is not drying and I sometimes leave it on very long forgetting that is a cleanser and not a mask - yet it does not dry out my skin. The cons - I thing to effectively clean your skin from the day&#x27;s make-up, dirt and oil you would need to pre-wash your face with another cleanser and then use this. It is not very effective in removing deep dirt or make-up and traces etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this cleanser.  It&#x27;s not drying yet cleans my skin well.  I had a sample size from Christmas and am very pleased with the full sized version.  You only need a tiny bit as you add water so it also goes quite far.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser. It is a little bit mild for my tastes, that is why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars. It does a great job, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as clean and refreshed as I would like it. The results are great though, so it is worth it for me!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the higher price sway you from purchasing this great product. Eminence does not use fillers so a little goes a long way and lasts much longer than the cheaper cleansers. Does a fine job cleaning my combination sensitive skin. No break outs. Works well for my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> This all natural product really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> This product was used on me during a facial. I bought it because it feels luscious on my face. Second time I&#x27;ve purchased  it. Try it. You are guaranteed to like it.</li>
            <li> The product is great...kind of slimy...but works great!</li>
            <li> Stone crop not only works, the smell is delightful...</li>
            <li> i have been using this for years and love it. i used to buy this from the spa but its about $10 cheaper on here.... so its a no brainer!</li>
            <li> This is a great facial wash.  Love the smell of this product and each time I wash my face it makes me smile! :0)</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  Clears up my skin by the next day.  The bottle lasts a long time as you dont need much each time you use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, it&#x27;s not horrible... I probably will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great product, quality shipping</li>
            <li> My new facial  product line, so fresh and natural!</li>
            <li> I use various Emminence products and I just love them.  I have mild Rosacea and their cleansers and moisturizers are the only ones I have found that I can use again and again without my skin errupting.  In fact, they help soothe it.</li>
            <li> If you want high quality skincare, look no further.  This is the product line to buy.  I love this facewash.  Tried a cream one from Eminence before this, I like this one MUCH better.  I don&#x27;t feel like it &amp;#34;evens&amp;#34; my skin tone at all, but it definitely helps break outs.</li>
            <li> I tried the stone crop gel wash because I wanted to have a gentle cleanser that didn&#x27;t strip moisture from my skin. I have oily skin and some scars from horomonal teenage acne and I have noticed that my scars already look lighter. I use this stone crop in the mornings and it&#x27;s so refreshing and hydrating. Smells like spring! I would recommend this product for anyone who wants healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> It gives a shine to the face. I apply it with proactve brush once in three days. I recommend it at least to try.</li>
            <li> I haved used Eminance products for about 7 years.  Don&#x27;t even consider anything else because of it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The Stone Crop gel wash is fabulous.  Cleanses and doesn&#x27;t leave a tight skin feeling.&lt;br /&gt;A little drop goes a long way.</li>
