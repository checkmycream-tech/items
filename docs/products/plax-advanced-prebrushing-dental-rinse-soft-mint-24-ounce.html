            <li>Every time we go to the dentist, he says, &amp;#34;their teeth look great!  </li>
            <li>The best order to do is, swish Plax in your mouth for 30 seconds, then floss your teeth, then brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>Great Item, As Described</li>
            <li>It is a great adjunct to flossing and brushing.</li>

            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>My plaque issues have improved remarkably.</li>
            <li>was hoping to find it for a better price, but this was the best price i could find</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>removes a good amount of plaque built up throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Good product, will buy again.</li>
            <li>This product is good and works well.</li>
            <li>Since flossing for them is done weekly, at best, I started buying Plax when they were still in elementary school</li>
            <li>I have very healthy teeth</li>
            <li>Plus better dental check ups!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My mouth feels a lot more clean, and I&#x27;m grateful for finding this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>But even with my once-a-day usage, it&#x27;s still been extremely effective in preventing and removing plaque and tartar.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it also makes scraping or brushing my tongue a lot easier and effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m kind of obsessive about my teeth,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some kind of rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, while I&#x27;ve liked this, I do have reservations about continuing to use it</li>
            <li>This is a very strong tasting and drying kind of mouth wash.  </li>
            <li>It is inexpensive, effective, and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not the most reliable brusher.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with this product, it use to have more of a flavor to it, but it seems to have changed.</li>
            <li>My dentist says I&#x27;m doing a good job at keeping my teeth clean, and I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;m making up for those missed brushings by using this.</li>
            <li>if i run out i notice a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I feel more confident using Plax though, and I&#x27;m convinced it helps remove more plaque.</li>
            <li>It does work better than brushing alone.</li>
            <li>I need three more words to meet Amazon&#x27;s minimum for a review, so this should do it.</li>
            <li>BETTER PUT</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are my recommendations for a better at home dental hygiene:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the Plax to be refreshing and it appears my teeth are whiter.  </li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>Love this mouth wash.</li>
            <li>I checked a couple local stores and the Amazon price was best.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m sure the product works as well as others have stated.</li>
            <li>It leaves a refreshing taste in my mouth, and reduces plaque and tartar.</li>
            <li>worked really glad i got this.</li>
            <li>My hygienist thought I did a whooooooooooooole lot more work than I did.</li>
            <li>It works well in getting rid of more plaque.</li>
            <li>Amazon is good in many ways, but one of the ways that it consistently falls over is in the listing of products&#x27; ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Favorite brand - easy to purchase</li>
            <li>very mild taste.</li>
            <li>I love that silky clean.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my mouth and teeth feel after a brushing; super clean!</li>
            <li>It tastes fine.  </li>
            <li>Tastes fine too.  </li>
            <li>The thing Plax does is, it takes off a huge amount of plaque off your teeth</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I did some light flossing and before I knew it, the tartar along the bottom of my mouth was breaking off and</li>
            <li>I would give this five stars if it were alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I only use this during the night time, so it reduces the dryness I experienced when I used it twice a day.</li>
            <li>When I first started using Plax, my dental hygienist remarked, unprompted, how much better my gums/teeth were.  </li>
            <li>After using this product, my teeth felt EXTREMELY clean.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel clean and shiney.  </li>
            <li>In the week I haven&#x27;t been using Plax, my mouth feels noticeably not as clean.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised to see greater whitening on all of my teeth (not just the fronts like the strips) than I&#x27;d witnessed in many years.  </li>
            <li>just feel your teeth before and after the rinse; I prefer to use it after brushing to truly get a clean mouth; I also use it between brushings to freshen up.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make teeth sensitive, and it has a  nice flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Spearmint, 33.8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years and get consistently good dental checkups.</li>
            <li>genetics might share in the credit (I eat regular stuff and a fair share of chocolate and pastry), but I&#x27;ve been cavity-free and halitosis-free for years.</li>
            <li>This product really helps with loosening the material on your teeth so that when you brush and then floss, you&#x27;ll have a greater propensity to prevent plaque buildup and tartar from forming.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>We used this growing up and it helps keep teeth clean and fresh</li>
            <li>The Plax helps my husband make sure he has brushed thoroughly, so it is doing what it was supposed to do - spotlight areas that need more brushing.</li>
            <li>Oh, you do not need to rinse with water afterwards like with some others, because the minty taste disappears veery quickly.  </li>
            <li>This has been the single most helpful product that I&#x27;ve tried in my search to better my gums.</li>
            <li>The Soft Mint is refreshing before brushing.</li>
            <li>and you will just have to try it for yourself; it will make you a believer with a cleaner smile, not to mention the dental health benefits of the removal of tartar and plaque.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that use of this product isn&#x27;t more widespread, in fact.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not crazy about that either.  </li>
            <li>It tastes great and is not strong at all.</li>
            <li>This is the right alternative for Plaque removals.</li>
            <li>In fact, it feels as if I&#x27;m washing my mouth out with sugar water as my mouth becomes sticky right after....</li>
            <li>&#x27;s of Maine Clean and Gentle Care, Peppermint with Fluoride, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 2)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I use to use this product when it first came out years ago.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll make sure I always have an extra bottle on hand!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>picks many years back</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>was first then brush your teeth after.</li>
            <li>On the first use I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>Definitely removes more junk.  </li>
            <li>It is used exactly like a mouthwash just BEFORE you brush rather than after brushing.  </li>
            <li>That seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>This one is good enough to use several times a day and for me that is a miracle.</li>
            <li>I was reading all these reviews and figured that these other people that had all these great experiences must have just started actually brushing their teeth for the first time.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are not grubby, nor do they have years of plaque build-up in large part &#x27;cause</li>
            <li>I was ready to buy it here on amazon when I found it at Wal-Mart.com for $4 plus shipping.</li>
            <li>Now let&#x27;s fast forward to 2012.  </li>
            <li>Plax works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>and it was beginning to really scare me.  </li>
            <li>off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really helps I use it twice a day and don&#x27;t have a problem with tarter building up.  </li>
            <li>Lately I have discovered this product, and together with good brushing, and the use of a quality mouth wash, it gives me the biggest bang in that</li>
            <li>And my mouth feels extra fresh!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have health insurance to go to regular dentist cleanings and also for anybody looking to keep their teeth clean.</li>
            <li>It has considerably brightened my teeth with consistent use.</li>
            <li>Rinse with it for about a minute (double the time recommended for maximum value), keep it in the mouth as I insert toothbrush with Colgate Total Care and brush away for about 90 seconds, as the liquid plax falls out completely and the toothpaste takes over (almost like a car wash), and last but not least, one generous serving of in this case Costco Mouth Wash (not the greatest but advertises to combat 6 common problems), together with the toothpaste and the mouthwash gurgling away for a full minute.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended mouthwash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell how effective it is, but I think it is a good supplement at the very least.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found it harder and harder to find this product in local stores but have been successfully using it for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have bought Plax for years because: the soft mint does NOT have the harsh puckery or medicinal taste of other rinses, so you can rinse for the optimum length of time; it really does remove plaque -</li>
            <li>Used before brushing removes plaque, fresh taste, you don&#x27;t need to use very much so the bottle will last long.</li>
            <li>Note that this is different from many other rinses in that you are supposed to use it for 30 seconds BEFORE brushing.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even finished the first bottle and not even been using for a month, only a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I researched different products and read a lot of positive reviews about PLAX.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is kind of weak in strength.</li>
            <li>Our family has been using the Plax Soft Mint for years.  </li>
            <li>I know this is because I haven&#x27;t had a professional cleaning in years.  </li>
            <li>It softens up old tartar in which you can either pick or brush away.</li>
            <li>I decided to order this product remembering how it was sort of a miracle cure, and 4 days from now using it, my gum problem is nearly 100% reversed.  </li>
            <li>Reduces plaque, so I don&#x27;t have to visit the dentist for cleaning as frequently.</li>
            <li>I use I before I brush my teeth each day and it works fine, I tend to mix it up every other day with a different brand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh like some other antiseptics and it makes my breath smell fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not dead certain it&#x27;s causing the lip-peeling but even independent of that, alcohol is not necessarily a great ingredient in a mouth rinse (you can Google it if you want more info).</li>
            <li>caught my curiosity initially was that it is used before brushing, curious enough to buy two of the Plax Advanced Pre-Brushing Dental Rinse, Soft Mint, 24 Ounce.</li>
            <li>Been able to flake off some white hard build up with my scaler</li>
            <li>I prefer this mouthwash, its gives you such a clean feeling without the harsh chemical burn that some mouthwashes can have.</li>
            <li>The generic brands don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I have had much less tartar buildup once I started using it, and now my dental checkups are much easier and faster!  </li>
            <li>I am able to remove my plaque(50%) within 3 days of PLAX usage but its been 3 to 4 weeks i am using it still but other side of PLAX is not able to remove.</li>
            <li>I used it about 15 years ago when I had tarter build up on the back of my bottom teeth when I was 12 years old and using it religiously actually removed almost all of the tarter</li>
            <li>I mean it makes my mouth feel clean and shiney.  </li>
            <li>(I decided NOT to be my generally frugal self and  succumb to the temptation to buy a knock-off brand while at the various stores -</li>
            <li>My only concern is that after using it and doing a little more research on it, I found that it does have a substantial amount of alcohol in it, and apparently studies show that it is linked to oral cancer; I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that.</li>
            <li>I was looking for mouth washes and found a tartar removal one that&#x27;s a powder for a little over $29; I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much</li>
            <li>(brushing teeth alone removes a little plaque but not too much) by swishing it in your mouth for 30 seconds and as soon as you spit it out in the sink, a lot of plaque is either gone from your teeth</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The Plax helps my husband make sure he has brushed thoroughly, so it is doing what it was supposed to do - spotlight areas that need more brushing.</li>
            <li> Oh, you do not need to rinse with water afterwards like with some others, because the minty taste disappears veery quickly.  </li>
            <li> This has been the single most helpful product that I&#x27;ve tried in my search to better my gums.</li>
            <li> The Soft Mint is refreshing before brushing.</li>
            <li> and you will just have to try it for yourself; it will make you a believer with a cleaner smile, not to mention the dental health benefits of the removal of tartar and plaque.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that use of this product isn&#x27;t more widespread, in fact.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not crazy about that either.  </li>
            <li> It tastes great and is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> This is the right alternative for Plaque removals.</li>
            <li> In fact, it feels as if I&#x27;m washing my mouth out with sugar water as my mouth becomes sticky right after....</li>
            <li> &#x27;s of Maine Clean and Gentle Care, Peppermint with Fluoride, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 2)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I use to use this product when it first came out years ago.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll make sure I always have an extra bottle on hand!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> picks many years back</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> was first then brush your teeth after.</li>
            <li> On the first use I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> Definitely removes more junk.  </li>
            <li> It is used exactly like a mouthwash just BEFORE you brush rather than after brushing.  </li>
            <li> That seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> This one is good enough to use several times a day and for me that is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I was reading all these reviews and figured that these other people that had all these great experiences must have just started actually brushing their teeth for the first time.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are not grubby, nor do they have years of plaque build-up in large part &#x27;cause</li>
            <li> I was ready to buy it here on amazon when I found it at Wal-Mart.com for $4 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> Now let&#x27;s fast forward to 2012.  </li>
            <li> Plax works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> and it was beginning to really scare me.  </li>
            <li> off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really helps I use it twice a day and don&#x27;t have a problem with tarter building up.  </li>
            <li> Lately I have discovered this product, and together with good brushing, and the use of a quality mouth wash, it gives me the biggest bang in that</li>
            <li> And my mouth feels extra fresh!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have health insurance to go to regular dentist cleanings and also for anybody looking to keep their teeth clean.</li>
            <li> It has considerably brightened my teeth with consistent use.</li>
            <li> Rinse with it for about a minute (double the time recommended for maximum value), keep it in the mouth as I insert toothbrush with Colgate Total Care and brush away for about 90 seconds, as the liquid plax falls out completely and the toothpaste takes over (almost like a car wash), and last but not least, one generous serving of in this case Costco Mouth Wash (not the greatest but advertises to combat 6 common problems), together with the toothpaste and the mouthwash gurgling away for a full minute.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell how effective it is, but I think it is a good supplement at the very least.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it harder and harder to find this product in local stores but have been successfully using it for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought Plax for years because: the soft mint does NOT have the harsh puckery or medicinal taste of other rinses, so you can rinse for the optimum length of time; it really does remove plaque -</li>
            <li> Used before brushing removes plaque, fresh taste, you don&#x27;t need to use very much so the bottle will last long.</li>
            <li> Note that this is different from many other rinses in that you are supposed to use it for 30 seconds BEFORE brushing.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even finished the first bottle and not even been using for a month, only a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I researched different products and read a lot of positive reviews about PLAX.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is kind of weak in strength.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using the Plax Soft Mint for years.  </li>
            <li> I know this is because I haven&#x27;t had a professional cleaning in years.  </li>
            <li> It softens up old tartar in which you can either pick or brush away.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this product remembering how it was sort of a miracle cure, and 4 days from now using it, my gum problem is nearly 100% reversed.  </li>
            <li> Reduces plaque, so I don&#x27;t have to visit the dentist for cleaning as frequently.</li>
            <li> I use I before I brush my teeth each day and it works fine, I tend to mix it up every other day with a different brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh like some other antiseptics and it makes my breath smell fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not dead certain it&#x27;s causing the lip-peeling but even independent of that, alcohol is not necessarily a great ingredient in a mouth rinse (you can Google it if you want more info).</li>
            <li> caught my curiosity initially was that it is used before brushing, curious enough to buy two of the Plax Advanced Pre-Brushing Dental Rinse, Soft Mint, 24 Ounce.</li>
            <li> Been able to flake off some white hard build up with my scaler</li>
            <li> I prefer this mouthwash, its gives you such a clean feeling without the harsh chemical burn that some mouthwashes can have.</li>
            <li> The generic brands don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I have had much less tartar buildup once I started using it, and now my dental checkups are much easier and faster!  </li>
            <li> I am able to remove my plaque(50%) within 3 days of PLAX usage but its been 3 to 4 weeks i am using it still but other side of PLAX is not able to remove.</li>
            <li> I used it about 15 years ago when I had tarter build up on the back of my bottom teeth when I was 12 years old and using it religiously actually removed almost all of the tarter</li>
            <li> I mean it makes my mouth feel clean and shiney.  </li>
            <li> (I decided NOT to be my generally frugal self and  succumb to the temptation to buy a knock-off brand while at the various stores -</li>
            <li> My only concern is that after using it and doing a little more research on it, I found that it does have a substantial amount of alcohol in it, and apparently studies show that it is linked to oral cancer; I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that.</li>
            <li> I was looking for mouth washes and found a tartar removal one that&#x27;s a powder for a little over $29; I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much</li>
            <li> (brushing teeth alone removes a little plaque but not too much) by swishing it in your mouth for 30 seconds and as soon as you spit it out in the sink, a lot of plaque is either gone from your teeth</li>
            <li> Thought it would be like other mouthwashes but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It has amazed me, due to how I was having such a progressive problem for 2 weeks straight that didn&#x27;t seem to go down at all.  </li>
            <li> - and go with the real thing, at least initially.)  </li>
            <li> This plax mouth wash really work, I had some hard plax on one of my teeth and by using this product it got loosen up and fall of piece by piece.</li>
            <li> Plax really helps remove all the plaque in your mouth, especially since plaque is worse than cavities and tartar which I learned from a commercial.  </li>
            <li> Because it does have alcohol, it can dry your mouth out.</li>
            <li> And tartar is basically as hard as concrete btw.</li>
            <li> I decided to head to Wal-Mart (its only down the street) and that&#x27;s where I found it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another bottle to get rid of this last little bit.</li>
            <li> I leave for work early and get home late.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product a few times but can already feel the difference with the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy astringent in it, so it doesn&#x27;t pucker your mouth like a regular mouthwash does.  </li>
            <li> This product is not available locally so I must order it online.</li>
            <li> But I have noticed an increase in plaque as I&#x27;ve aged</li>
            <li> and the other where the parent of a child did a school science project</li>
            <li> This pre-dental mouthwash did get rid of a lot of my plaque but on the other hand a lot of it wasn&#x27;t removed.</li>
            <li> like the refreshment and does help reduce plaque with other oral care of course.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That would be my only complaint that has nothing to do with the product.</li>
            <li> successfully I mean I&#x27;ve gotten away with brushing only once each day (mornings) for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> build up that was supposed to be said impossible to be removed exception of without true dental</li>
            <li> I did this every day for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> a little bit is chipped away every time I brush and floss.</li>
            <li> I got a little bit calculus on my teeth, brushing and flossing didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive been having trouble with plaque buildup for a while now.</li>
            <li> I stopped using for a few months</li>
            <li> It really does work, and it doesn&#x27;t taste too bad, either.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is in my head or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, I started developing an issue on a small part of my gums for about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple of months ago, but when I went to the dentist she told me that this product was basically no better than rinsing my mouth with water.</li>
            <li> Take a trip to to Wal-Mart and buy it for a lot less!!</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a serious reduction in the little bit of plaque I had along the gum line</li>
            <li> Hard to believe amazon&#x27;s price over twice the price what Walmart sells it for.</li>
            <li> And believe me, this was the HARD stuff.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my little secret.</li>
            <li> toothbrush and I flossed at least once a day.</li>
            <li> That being said, this product works, does wonders to your teeth if you use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> definitely those who are afraid of dental doctors visit.</li>
            <li> been using it since it came out in the late 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this and was forced to use  Crest Pro Rinse.  </li>
            <li> Bleed no more they say!</li>
            <li> Even after brushing w/biotene tooth paste and then rinsing w/biotene mouthwash the plax is still present in my mouth drying it out and leaving and unpleasant flavor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very difficult task teaching them and making it habit to floss daily.</li>
            <li> The prices here for a bottle of Plax have incremented to ridiculous prices per bottle and also the shipping and handling are a joke.</li>
            <li> I can 100% vouch that in combination with brushing AND flossing, Plax WILL get the HARD TARTAR build up off your teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really poor and don&#x27;t have the money to go to a dentist, so I was trying to figure out how to fix the situation before it got worse.  </li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but I say it works for me.</li>
            <li> Helps me to never have bad breath and isn&#x27;t medicinal tasting.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, and 5 stars for it does work, price on this flavor isn&#x27;t bad, and it does come to my door too.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not the most reliable brusher. I leave for work early and get home late. In the evenings I don&#x27;t always brush as well as I should, and I miss an evening brush once or twice a week. I feel more confident using Plax though, and I&#x27;m convinced it helps remove more plaque. My dentist says I&#x27;m doing a good job at keeping my teeth clean, and I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;m making up for those missed brushings by using this. Call me crazy, but I say it works for me.</li>
            <li> I was prompted  by a video I saw on YouTube to purchase this product.  The lady on video claimed this product helped her resolve her reoccurring plaque.  Having a similar issue, I decided to give it a try.  I must say this product lived up fully to my expectations.  I am regular user.  My plaque issues have improved remarkably.</li>
            <li> Ok...that isnt supposed to matter but I don&#x27;t like medicinal tasting rinses and if I don&#x27;t like them I don&#x27;t use them. This one is good enough to use several times a day and for me that is a miracle.</li>
            <li> Ive been having trouble with plaque buildup for a while now. I researched different products and read a lot of positive reviews about PLAX. I was ready to buy it here on amazon when I found it at Wal-Mart.com for $4 plus shipping. I decided to head to Wal-Mart (its only down the street) and that&#x27;s where I found it. They sell it for $4.88 +tax. Wal-Mart also has the equate brand for $2 and change (I haven&#x27;t tried the store brand so I can&#x27;t vouch for it). I&#x27;ve only used the product a few times but can already feel the difference with the product. It does work better than brushing alone. I recommend it!! But I wouldn&#x27;t buy it through amazon. Take a trip to to Wal-Mart and buy it for a lot less!!</li>
            <li> Plax is the best plaque remover mouth wash , My wife is a science teacher and a student used it in a science project and it beat all others.</li>
            <li> Paid 4.53 for it at Walmart. Excellent product. Will buy again, just not from amazon.Hard to believe amazon&#x27;s price over twice the price what Walmart sells it for.</li>
            <li> I was always told that the ONLY way to remove tartar was by visiting a dentist. That information is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tartar build up along the inside of my mouth where the bottom teeth are. And believe me, this was the HARD stuff. I bought some plax, decided to give it a shot. I used the prebrush rinse twice a day - once in the morning and once at night, along with an Oral-B Pulsar (nifty thing for $5!!) toothbrush and I flossed at least once a day. After using this product, my teeth felt EXTREMELY clean. I did this every day for about a week and a half. Yesterday, I did some light flossing and before I knew it, the tartar along the bottom of my mouth was breaking off and a little bit is chipped away every time I brush and floss. I have also noticed a serious reduction in the little bit of plaque I had along the gum line and my teeth are noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can 100% vouch that in combination with brushing AND flossing, Plax WILL get the HARD TARTAR build up off your teeth!</li>
            <li> Great Item, As Described</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, properly packaged, no damages.  Price, size were competitive. A pleasure to have bought my Plax from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This mouth wash is excellent for reducing plaque on teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t make teeth sensitive, and it has a  nice flavor. With the subscribe and save plan,it is convienent and well priced.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  It is a great adjunct to flossing and brushing. My dental hygienist was amazed at the difference.  Great taste.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Shipped promptly. Good price. I recommend this vendor. What else is there to say. I need three more words to meet Amazon&#x27;s minimum for a review, so this should do it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with this product, it use to have more of a flavor to it, but it seems to have changed.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel clean and shiney.  I mean it makes my mouth feel clean and shiney.  I don&#x27;t have to brace for impact, use with my electric tooth brush, seems to get the plaque off. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this and was forced to use  Crest Pro Rinse.  Ugh.  In the week I haven&#x27;t been using Plax, my mouth feels noticeably not as clean.  When I first started using Plax, my dental hygienist remarked, unprompted, how much better my gums/teeth were.  Note that this is different from many other rinses in that you are supposed to use it for 30 seconds BEFORE brushing.  It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy astringent in it, so it doesn&#x27;t pucker your mouth like a regular mouthwash does.  It tastes fine.  HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using the Plax Soft Mint for years.  The Soft Mint is refreshing before brushing. Receive great checkups from the dentist.  Hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I use to use this product when it first came out years ago. I stopped using it because I heard a report on a health report on a News show where the dentist said it&#x27;s not the product working but the brushing that is removing plague.  Now let&#x27;s fast forward to 2012.  I read two reviews, the one where she says \\&quot;this stuff works and don&#x27;t let the dentist tell you otherwise and the other where the parent of a child did a school science project and this Plax blew the others away.  The one reviewer stated she uses it 2x a day and flosses and the plaque actually flaked off.  Well plaque becomes tartar after you haven&#x27;t removed it in a 24 hr. period.  I have the same issue where it looks like a kid took a a brown crayon and out lined the inside and outside of my bottom teeth along the gum line.  I know this is because I haven&#x27;t had a professional cleaning in years.  (Do to disability).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was looking for mouth washes and found a tartar removal one that&#x27;s a powder for a little over $29; I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much and it was a powder that you would have to mix.  Didn&#x27;t want that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this from AMAZON on May 23rd; and started using it faithfully once a day before my morning brushing and on June the 9th I was checking out my teeth and I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT I SAW OR BETTER PUT WHAT I DIDN&#x27;T SEE!!!  THE YELLOW TARTAR AROUND MY TEETH ON THE INSIDE AND OUT ALONG THE GUM LINE WAS GONE AND MY TEETH ACTUALLY ARE WHITER AND BRIGHTER.  I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works but it does and you will just have to try it for yourself; it will make you a believer with a cleaner smile, not to mention the dental health benefits of the removal of tartar and plaque.  I haven&#x27;t even finished the first bottle and not even been using for a month, only a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t ever stop using this ever again and I&#x27;ll make sure I always have an extra bottle on hand!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I ALREADY PURCHASED ANOTHER BOTTLE AND THIS WILL BE IN MY HOME ARSENAL FOR ORAL HYGIENE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my recommendations for a better at home dental hygiene:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Spearmint, 33.8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H54RB0/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush, (colors vary) (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Collins-Perio-Toothbrush-colors/dp/B0036ZA40W/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1339479295&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;dr+collins+perio+toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s of Maine Clean and Gentle Care, Peppermint with Fluoride, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 2)&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UQ6V9Y/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o01_s00_i00</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop making this. Best pre-brushing rinse. Helps me to never have bad breath and isn&#x27;t medicinal tasting. Plus better dental check ups!</li>
            <li> I would give this five stars if it were alcohol free. Because it does have alcohol, it can dry your mouth out. I only use this during the night time, so it reduces the dryness I experienced when I used it twice a day. But even with my once-a-day usage, it&#x27;s still been extremely effective in preventing and removing plaque and tartar. It has considerably brightened my teeth with consistent use. It softens up old tartar in which you can either pick or brush away. I noticed that it also makes scraping or brushing my tongue a lot easier and effective. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have health insurance to go to regular dentist cleanings and also for anybody looking to keep their teeth clean.</li>
            <li> For those looking to buy Plax, do it at Walmart, either online or at the store. The prices here for a bottle of Plax have incremented to ridiculous prices per bottle and also the shipping and handling are a joke. $4 for this product at Walmart. Sellers here are trying to get $23 (S&amp;H included) for 2 bottles of Plax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would be my only complaint that has nothing to do with the product. That being said, this product works, does wonders to your teeth if you use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I prefer this mouthwash, its gives you such a clean feeling without the harsh chemical burn that some mouthwashes can have.</li>
            <li> easy seller to work with AAAAA!!!!!</li>
            <li> I find the Plax to be refreshing and it appears my teeth are whiter.  Not sure if this is in my head or not.</li>
            <li> Would rather have cherry flavor but this was about 1/4 the price. It does help with cleaning up the ick and breath aid too. This product is not available locally so I must order it online. Have been using this product for years, and 5 stars for it does work, price on this flavor isn&#x27;t bad, and it does come to my door too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that use of this product isn&#x27;t more widespread, in fact.  It really does work, and it doesn&#x27;t taste too bad, either.</li>
            <li> This product definitely made my mouth feel cleaner; however, i&#x27;m still waiting for results of plaque removal. I have been using it for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it 3 pr 4 times a day with regular flossing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mouthwash,not a product you can go on and on about. Would I buy it again once it&#x27;s finished? Sure.</li>
            <li> Favorite brand - easy to purchase</li>
            <li> I use I before I brush my teeth each day and it works fine, I tend to mix it up every other day with a different brand</li>
            <li> Love this mouth wash. It&#x27;s not harsh like some other antiseptics and it makes my breath smell fresh afterwards. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my mouth and teeth feel after a brushing; super clean! My only concern is that after using it and doing a little more research on it, I found that it does have a substantial amount of alcohol in it, and apparently studies show that it is linked to oral cancer; I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that. I will be asking my dentist and get back to you on the facts!</li>
            <li> I use this along with a dental scraper to remove plaque.  It&#x27;s hard to tell how effective it is, but I think it is a good supplement at the very least.</li>
            <li> Used before brushing removes plaque, fresh taste, you don&#x27;t need to use very much so the bottle will last long.</li>
            <li> I am a flosser but my children aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a very difficult task teaching them and making it habit to floss daily. Since flossing for them is done weekly, at best, I started buying Plax when they were still in elementary school and it works wonders. Every time we go to the dentist, he says, &amp;#34;their teeth look great!  How do you get them to floss?!?&amp;#34;  Makes me chuckle but shhhhh. It&#x27;s my little secret.</li>
            <li> Plax works very well for me.  I have had much less tartar buildup once I started using it, and now my dental checkups are much easier and faster!  The generic brands don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I was reading all these reviews and figured that these other people that had all these great experiences must have just started actually brushing their teeth for the first time.  The product couldn&#x27;t possibly be that effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kind of obsessive about my teeth, and I have to say that after three days using this, my teeth were whiter and shinier than they were after my last use of a $80+ dollar whiting system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
            <li> All the terrific reviews sold me on Plax.  I checked a couple local stores and the Amazon price was best. (I decided NOT to be my generally frugal self and  succumb to the temptation to buy a knock-off brand while at the various stores - did you know everybody and his brother makes a version of this product?!  - and go with the real thing, at least initially.)  My teeth are not grubby, nor do they have years of plaque build-up in large part &#x27;cause I bought one of those metal dental picks many years back and it&#x27;s a beaut for scraping around those pesky inside lower front teeth that are plaque repositories.  But I have noticed an increase in plaque as I&#x27;ve aged and I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some kind of rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I wouldn&#x27;t review a product that so many others have already weighed in on, but there&#x27;s an issue I don&#x27;t remember seeing (could be wrong; there are some 50 reviews as I write this), so I&#x27;m adding my comments.  I have been using Plax once a day and it does make my mouth seem fresher, but after two weeks, my lips are peeling, and I can&#x27;t help but suspect it&#x27;s from the drying effects of the alcohol in Plax.  I&#x27;m not dead certain it&#x27;s causing the lip-peeling but even independent of that, alcohol is not necessarily a great ingredient in a mouth rinse (you can Google it if you want more info). There&#x27;s also Sorbitol in it (one of those newer sweeteners) and I&#x27;m not crazy about that either.  So, while I&#x27;ve liked this, I do have reservations about continuing to use it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: When I stopped using Plax, my lips stopped peeling. I&#x27;m just going to use it occasionally till I finish the bottle and then try a non-alcohol brand.</li>
            <li> This pre-dental mouthwash did get rid of a lot of my plaque but on the other hand a lot of it wasn&#x27;t removed. So I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another bottle to get rid of this last little bit.</li>
            <li> Its a 50-50 review from me for PLAX. I am able to remove my plaque(50%) within 3 days of PLAX usage but its been 3 to 4 weeks i am using it still but other side of PLAX is not able to remove.But it may be my mistake where i may not use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But definitely those who are afraid of dental doctors visit.This is the right alternative for Plaque removals.Thanks!</li>
            <li> The Plax helps my husband make sure he has brushed thoroughly, so it is doing what it was supposed to do - spotlight areas that need more brushing.</li>
            <li> works. very mild taste. Thought it would be like other mouthwashes but was pleasantly surprised. removes a good amount of plaque built up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all of my life? I have such problems with plaque &amp; despite what the dentist says, floss does not do the trick. After using this for 5 days, the plaque is literally falling off my teeth!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues with periodontal disease on and off for years and after ONE week of using this stuff (in addition to using Periotheraphy and flossing), a piece of tartar flaked off today. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. This product is helping to get rid of six years of tartar buildup... And tartar is basically as hard as concrete btw. For four bucks, you should definitely stock up.</li>
            <li> I have been using Plax for over 5 years now.  I use it before I brush my teeth twice a day.  I feel it has made such a big difference in my dental health.  My mouth feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Amazon is good in many ways, but one of the ways that it consistently falls over is in the listing of products&#x27; ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product based on the reviews here and, being health-conscious, simply cannot use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the offending ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium lauryl sulfate&lt;br /&gt;Sodium saccharin&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Blue 1\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Yellow 5\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its list of ingredients also lists \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; that are unspecified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these don&#x27;t bother you then I&#x27;m sure the product works as well as others have stated. If these sort of ingredients do, then I&#x27;d stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I used it about 15 years ago when I had tarter build up on the back of my bottom teeth when I was 12 years old and using it religiously actually removed almost all of the tarter build up that was supposed to be said impossible to be removed exception of without true dental work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I started developing an issue on a small part of my gums for about 2 weeks.  It continued to get swollen and red and it was beginning to really scare me.  I&#x27;m really poor and don&#x27;t have the money to go to a dentist, so I was trying to figure out how to fix the situation before it got worse.  I decided to order this product remembering how it was sort of a miracle cure, and 4 days from now using it, my gum problem is nearly 100% reversed.  It has amazed me, due to how I was having such a progressive problem for 2 weeks straight that didn&#x27;t seem to go down at all.  My mouth feels a lot more clean, and I&#x27;m grateful for finding this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This plax mouth wash really work, I had some hard plax on one of my teeth and by using this product it got loosen up and fall of piece by piece. I used this product twice a day, it take like a week to start working. You have to garggle with the mouth was first then brush your teeth after.</li>
            <li> I got a little bit calculus on my teeth, brushing and flossing didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Plax ~Nov 20, and on Dec 2nd, I tried to use needle to scratch calculus.. somehow the calculus&lt;br /&gt;fall off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> I have not opened the bottle.  I purchased this a couple of months ago, but when I went to the dentist she told me that this product was basically no better than rinsing my mouth with water.</li>
            <li> This really helps I use it twice a day and don&#x27;t have a problem with tarter building up.  I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. Been able to flake off some white hard build up with my scaler a lot easier then before using Plax.</li>
            <li> On the first use I could tell a difference.  Definitely removes more junk.  Tastes fine too.  I prefer this to Scope.</li>
            <li> This has been the single most helpful product that I&#x27;ve tried in my search to better my gums. Bleed no more they say! And my mouth feels extra fresh!</li>
            <li> Been using plax for 3 week now and there is improvement in reducing tartar on my teeth.Good product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is good and works well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it every morning before flossing and brushing. It leaves a refreshing taste in my mouth, and reduces plaque and tartar. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> like the refreshment and does help reduce plaque with other oral care of course. I have no problem with my teeth i was getting dental equipment and the advertising on here worked really glad i got this.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong tasting and drying kind of mouth wash.  I undersand the intent is to use it before brushing.  I do that.  Even after brushing w/biotene tooth paste and then rinsing w/biotene mouthwash the plax is still present in my mouth drying it out and leaving and unpleasant flavor.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.  I have used this for several years and get consistently good dental checkups.</li>
            <li> The difference between this and the others is that it&#x27;s a PRE-brushing rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it harder and harder to find this product in local stores but have been successfully using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;By successfully I mean I&#x27;ve gotten away with brushing only once each day (mornings) for years.&lt;br /&gt;My genetics might share in the credit (I eat regular stuff and a fair share of chocolate and pastry), but I&#x27;ve been cavity-free and halitosis-free for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for health benefits for my teeth and gums.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see greater whitening on all of my teeth (not just the fronts like the strips) than I&#x27;d witnessed in many years.  It is inexpensive, effective, and very easy to use.  It is used exactly like a mouthwash just BEFORE you brush rather than after brushing.  Running my tongue over my teeth, I feel as if my teeth are getting cleaner as well.  In any case, I&#x27;ll never be without this product.</li>
            <li> Lately I have discovered this product, and together with good brushing, and the use of a quality mouth wash, it gives me the biggest bang in that department.&lt;br /&gt;What caught my curiosity initially was that it is used before brushing, curious enough to buy two of the Plax Advanced Pre-Brushing Dental Rinse, Soft Mint, 24 Ounce. I knew I was going to like it, because I despise plaque and this product picks it apart according to its advertisement. Rinse with it for about a minute (double the time recommended for maximum value), keep it in the mouth as I insert toothbrush with Colgate Total Care and brush away for about 90 seconds, as the liquid plax falls out completely and the toothpaste takes over (almost like a car wash), and last but not least, one generous serving of in this case Costco Mouth Wash (not the greatest but advertises to combat 6 common problems), together with the toothpaste and the mouthwash gurgling away for a full minute. Then big shot of shower water, and trust me, the feeling of well being in the mouth has all my attention. Plax is a keeper. I think is doing what it claims so for now 4 Stars!</li>
            <li> Reduces plaque, so I don&#x27;t have to visit the dentist for cleaning as frequently. xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx.</li>
            <li> My hygienist thought I did a whooooooooooooole lot more work than I did. I love that silky clean. You still have to floss but you won&#x27;t be in that chair for an hour.</li>
            <li> My hygenist thoght I quit smoking but all I did was add plax as part of my brushing. I stopped using for a few months and I had a lot of tarter build up on my next cleaning so I started using again.</li>
            <li> Is to be used before brushing and as a pre brush treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want something with alcohol. The taste is good.&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of weak in strength.</li>
            <li> Like others that talked about plaque build up under the front bottom teeth I had  the same problems.  This stuff softens the plaque up so that it is easier to remove.  I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to wrok</li>
            <li> It works well in getting rid of more plaque. I can tell the difference in my teeth now that I am using Plax.</li>
            <li> Plax really helps remove all the plaque in your mouth, especially since plaque is worse than cavities and tartar which I learned from a commercial.  The thing Plax does is, it takes off a huge amount of plaque off your teeth (brushing teeth alone removes a little plaque but not too much) by swishing it in your mouth for 30 seconds and as soon as you spit it out in the sink, a lot of plaque is either gone from your teeth and/or it loosens a lot of plaque on your teeth and then when you start brushing your teeth, all the plaque is removed from your teeth.  The best order to do is, swish Plax in your mouth for 30 seconds, then floss your teeth, then brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb with this one but I just don&#x27;t think it cleans as name brand mouthwash... In fact, it feels as if I&#x27;m washing my mouth out with sugar water as my mouth becomes sticky right after.... I&#x27;d steer away.</li>
            <li> The Costco stuff works just as well and is cheaper</li>
            <li> I have bought Plax for years because: the soft mint does NOT have the harsh puckery or medicinal taste of other rinses, so you can rinse for the optimum length of time; it really does remove plaque - just feel your teeth before and after the rinse; I prefer to use it after brushing to truly get a clean mouth; I also use it between brushings to freshen up.  Oh, you do not need to rinse with water afterwards like with some others, because the minty taste disappears veery quickly.  Hope they never stop making Plax!</li>
            <li> We as a family like this product.  We used this growing up and it helps keep teeth clean and fresh</li>
            <li> been using it since it came out in the late 80&#x27;s. if i run out i notice a huge difference! was hoping to find it for a better price, but this was the best price i could find</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a lot of plaque to being with, but I had enough that you could notice it was there. After only two days of using Plax I noticed it had been reduced about 50%! I can only imagine what it will do after a month or two of use. It tastes great and is not strong at all. I do use it about twice per day and I did follow one of the reviewers advice by brushing my teeth at the same I had the mouthwash in my mouth. That seems to work pretty well. Highly recommended mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have very healthy teeth but for whatever reason, there&#x27;s still a lot of plaque buildup.  This product really helps with loosening the material on your teeth so that when you brush and then floss, you&#x27;ll have a greater propensity to prevent plaque buildup and tartar from forming.</li>
