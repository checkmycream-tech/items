            <li>My Wife uses this all the time, she gets the best results, and no gloves or lotion before.</li>
            <li>after applying it for a good week, every night in a row!</li>
            <li>I even used it on my face (once), and am really happy with the results.  </li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The color is great and does not turn out orange or anything.</li>
            <li>I tried this and was not too happy with the result.</li>
            <li>As many before me have said, this is the best sunless tanner that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Since Bain du Soleil discontinued their great tanning gel, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good alternative.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s best to use sparingly, unless you have money like that :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS:  I am fair skinned and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Great price, no streaking, good color results.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage and color.  </li>
            <li>Best self tanner for light skin tone.</li>
            <li>I have ruined 2 good pairs of sheets from them getting stained even after I wore it all day and not feeling it on my skin any longer.</li>
            <li>Seems to work good.  </li>
            <li>It is good and it works so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but good.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>We tried this for the \\&quot;refresher\\&quot; tan and liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t require hands-on application and produced a nice result.</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely and you can tell where you have already put it.</li>
            <li>Once for spring/summer and again in winter for a warm glow.&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage and color.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the tan going rather easily!</li>
            <li>True I am fair</li>
            <li>Smells GREAT and, if you apply all over before bedtime, let the small amount you used seep into your skin before heading for bed and awakening like I did - VERY IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li>Will keep looking for a better product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve self-tanned many times over the years.  </li>
            <li>I found it do be OK.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this gel.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I put a bunch on my ankle and it looked streaky around my ankle and the top of my foot.</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li>Been using this for many years.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product I have used it Since 1982.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite self-tanner.</li>
            <li>I would assume that if I used it more often, I would get darker, but haven&#x27;t tried yet.  </li>
            <li>Also, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly as in the directions.</li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t up to the hype for me, I&#x27;m gonna try st. tropez, now and hope that the foam is easier and more evenly applied then this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many of the over the counter&lt;br /&gt;self tanners.  </li>
            <li>I now found Tanwise and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It got good reviews and seemed promising.  </li>
            <li>It is so much safer than the sun and a tanning bed and looks just as good.  </li>
            <li>nice color, not oily and well absorbed.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I would easily rate it 5 stars if it lasted longer between applications-2 or 3 baths/showers max.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so I burn easy and freckles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered more,  the price is right and works great,  Very natural.</li>
            <li>Honestly.. giving one star feels too much for this product: The acetone smell, was beyond overpowering!</li>
            <li>This is best tanning gel that money can buy, hands down.</li>
            <li>After the very first application, the beautiful bronze color was already becoming apparent to  me.</li>
            <li>The gel is smooth, perfect color,and the color is easily buildable over a few applications.</li>
            <li>at best gave me a little color</li>
            <li>I let the color build by using 3 light applications.</li>
            <li>Although we got a couple of shades darker, the gel is oily and sticky and never seems to reach an \\&quot;absorbed\\&quot; state where you feel comfortable putting clothes on over it.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to go on my vacation without my Casper white legs!</li>
            <li>This product is overall great.</li>
            <li>I. Love the golden brown color.  </li>
            <li>The gel dries really quickly and is easy to apply evenly.  </li>
            <li>Smell, instant color, overall very happy to finally have that real-looking gorgeous tan!</li>
            <li>This tanning gel is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>First one I can safely use on my face that doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different sunless tanners and I haven&#x27;t liked any.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is to use very sparingly around your ankle/foot area and knee.  </li>
            <li>Given its price &amp; good reviews I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most believable tan from a self tanner I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li>The color this product gives is nice and natural looking, even after one application.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice as far as self tann ers go.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my legs and it leaves a nice natural color.</li>
            <li>and then the next day showers off and good to go.</li>
            <li>No harsh smell, tans nicely except on ankles and knees...</li>
            <li>32.00 for 1 year, not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Yes, I know better, but read such convincing reviews that I just had to try it.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in rather quickly compared to others.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, no smell, not greasy, works quickly and looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li>That said, the color is the most natural tan color I&#x27;ve seen yet, goes on like a dream and without streaks!</li>
            <li>That probably helps distribute the clear gel more evenly.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Low odor and nice color.</li>
            <li>Worth a try, though.</li>
            <li>It also was not sealed under the cap, which should have tipped me off right away.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for a quick fix for my pale skin, I read many reviews and most seemed to say that they didn&#x27;t have problems with orange color</li>
            <li>Golden Avenue really delivered on this!</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you barely brush it on.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried them all - top shelf (Dior, Channel, Clinique, etc.,) and have not had any luck until accidentally stumbled across Bare Escentuals Faux Tan.</li>
            <li>I have tried countless self tanners and this is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>The first time I did it</li>
            <li>it does last longer than most self tanning creams.  </li>
            <li>Looks like a real tan!</li>
            <li>Be sure to exfoliate prior to using and put some lotion on elbows knees and ankles before putting clarions on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me brown/tan, but adds just enough color to make me look healthy again.  </li>
            <li>I get the same &amp;/or better results from Loreal Sublime Bronze albeit</li>
            <li>I did a test section with this first and noticed no difference at all.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice compared to other self tanners that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>My legs feel so sexy when I use it and am able to wear shorts earlier than other people.  </li>
            <li>After you dry them off &amp; then rub the top of your hands over parts of your body with the lotion on it.</li>
            <li>Smell is a bit strong but overall</li>
            <li>Nice natural color, goes on evenly, lasts long and fades evenly.</li>
            <li>Strongly advise applying several days before event..</li>
            <li>I use a little more economically priced tanner for my body... and save clarins for my face and chest.  </li>
            <li>FAST shipping from seller.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>Clarins Gelee auto bronzante work very well.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much in a tube but (don&#x27;t judge</li>
            <li>really like this product and tell my friends and family about it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and tell my friends and family about it.  </li>
            <li>It did not get my stretch marks to blend in with the rest of me, but I don&#x27;t know that a real tan would do that, either.  </li>
            <li>Smells absolutely repulsive, stays sticky for longer than it should, and does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t get it in your eyes as it&#x27;s very irritating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually, better than expected.  </li>
            <li>but for me it work so fast.</li>
            <li>Works well on face and arms not as much with abs.</li>
            <li>very pale.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didnt really make me tan at all</li>
            <li>Looks like a real tanner.  </li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to try a self tanner, but this product made a believer out of me.</li>
            <li>I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smell much and&lt;</li>
            <li>So far, so good, with a slow gentle change in color.</li>
            <li>Not bad considering a mystic tan costs 20 a session whereas this entire bottle costs about 30 and can keep you tan for months.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and applied the Gel 4 times, but only got a little tan.</li>
            <li>I read reviews and would not usually spend this much on tanning lotion (even though I considered paying $35.00 for a spray on tan).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and are far better than this.</li>
            <li>and my arm was a little tanner in one area for a day :)</li>
            <li>and my arm was a little tanner in one area for a day :)      </li>
            <li>Have tried many self tanners in a effort to have a little color but avoid the sun and tanning beds for health reasons.  </li>
            <li>Looked natural, I was told!!</li>
            <li>, I am throwing this junk out and promising myself to not stupidly waste money anymore on products like these.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>A very natural looking sunless tan.</li>
            <li>It works and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Just start getting ready a little earlier and you&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural!  </li>
            <li>but I would say that it looks great for 4 as it slowly fades due to your skin replenishing itself and</li>
            <li>I am naturally milk-white with horrid vericose veins, and this is just the product for me!  </li>
            <li>This product was easy to apply, did not smell bad (although it does have a strong smell), and tanned me to a golden brown in a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>The color is very gradual and natural yet you can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li>The gel was clear itself.</li>
            <li>It gives a truly natural color.</li>
            <li>Gives natural color....</li>
            <li>/&gt;by far.  </li>
            <li>This is the most subtle tanning gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>the color was fine but no better than the $10.00 products.  </li>
            <li>Especially for the high price.</li>
            <li>The only two downsides are the price and drying time (longer than normal).</li>
            <li>It left my skin looking orange and was very sticky feeling for several hours</li>
            <li>It also has never come out looking streaky and makes your skin feel very soft after the initial application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little spendy, but in this case it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I usually use it once a week over the entire body and then use it once more a few days later on the areas that dont tan very well.</li>
            <li>, I do have to say I had a little problem with certain places getting a orange tint like the elbows and knees, but it does help to put some other type of lotion on first and problem solved.</li>
            <li>Just be extra careful you blend very evenly</li>
            <li>We used a moderate coverage, like I have with other tanning gels, and applied a second coat about 2 hours after the first.  </li>
            <li>This particular item seems to be old or outdated because I have no tanning results when I use it as opposed to positive result when using the same product purchased elsewhere.</li>

            <li> so I burn easy and freckles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered more,  the price is right and works great,  Very natural.</li>
            <li> Honestly.. giving one star feels too much for this product: The acetone smell, was beyond overpowering!</li>
            <li> This is best tanning gel that money can buy, hands down.</li>
            <li> After the very first application, the beautiful bronze color was already becoming apparent to  me.</li>
            <li> The gel is smooth, perfect color,and the color is easily buildable over a few applications.</li>
            <li> at best gave me a little color</li>
            <li> I let the color build by using 3 light applications.</li>
            <li> Although we got a couple of shades darker, the gel is oily and sticky and never seems to reach an \\&quot;absorbed\\&quot; state where you feel comfortable putting clothes on over it.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy to go on my vacation without my Casper white legs!</li>
            <li> This product is overall great.</li>
            <li> I. Love the golden brown color.  </li>
            <li> The gel dries really quickly and is easy to apply evenly.  </li>
            <li> Smell, instant color, overall very happy to finally have that real-looking gorgeous tan!</li>
            <li> This tanning gel is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> First one I can safely use on my face that doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different sunless tanners and I haven&#x27;t liked any.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is to use very sparingly around your ankle/foot area and knee.  </li>
            <li> Given its price &amp; good reviews I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most believable tan from a self tanner I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> The color this product gives is nice and natural looking, even after one application.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice as far as self tann ers go.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my legs and it leaves a nice natural color.</li>
            <li> and then the next day showers off and good to go.</li>
            <li> No harsh smell, tans nicely except on ankles and knees...</li>
            <li> 32.00 for 1 year, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know better, but read such convincing reviews that I just had to try it.  </li>
            <li> It rubs in rather quickly compared to others.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, no smell, not greasy, works quickly and looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li> That said, the color is the most natural tan color I&#x27;ve seen yet, goes on like a dream and without streaks!</li>
            <li> That probably helps distribute the clear gel more evenly.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Low odor and nice color.</li>
            <li> Worth a try, though.</li>
            <li> It also was not sealed under the cap, which should have tipped me off right away.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a quick fix for my pale skin, I read many reviews and most seemed to say that they didn&#x27;t have problems with orange color</li>
            <li> Golden Avenue really delivered on this!</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you barely brush it on.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried them all - top shelf (Dior, Channel, Clinique, etc.,) and have not had any luck until accidentally stumbled across Bare Escentuals Faux Tan.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless self tanners and this is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> The first time I did it</li>
            <li> it does last longer than most self tanning creams.  </li>
            <li> Looks like a real tan!</li>
            <li> Be sure to exfoliate prior to using and put some lotion on elbows knees and ankles before putting clarions on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me brown/tan, but adds just enough color to make me look healthy again.  </li>
            <li> I get the same &amp;/or better results from Loreal Sublime Bronze albeit</li>
            <li> I did a test section with this first and noticed no difference at all.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice compared to other self tanners that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My legs feel so sexy when I use it and am able to wear shorts earlier than other people.  </li>
            <li> After you dry them off &amp; then rub the top of your hands over parts of your body with the lotion on it.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit strong but overall</li>
            <li> Nice natural color, goes on evenly, lasts long and fades evenly.</li>
            <li> Strongly advise applying several days before event..</li>
            <li> I use a little more economically priced tanner for my body... and save clarins for my face and chest.  </li>
            <li> FAST shipping from seller.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> Clarins Gelee auto bronzante work very well.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much in a tube but (don&#x27;t judge</li>
            <li> really like this product and tell my friends and family about it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and tell my friends and family about it.  </li>
            <li> It did not get my stretch marks to blend in with the rest of me, but I don&#x27;t know that a real tan would do that, either.  </li>
            <li> Smells absolutely repulsive, stays sticky for longer than it should, and does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t get it in your eyes as it&#x27;s very irritating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually, better than expected.  </li>
            <li> but for me it work so fast.</li>
            <li> Works well on face and arms not as much with abs.</li>
            <li> very pale.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didnt really make me tan at all</li>
            <li> Looks like a real tanner.  </li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to try a self tanner, but this product made a believer out of me.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smell much and&lt;</li>
            <li> So far, so good, with a slow gentle change in color.</li>
            <li> Not bad considering a mystic tan costs 20 a session whereas this entire bottle costs about 30 and can keep you tan for months.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and applied the Gel 4 times, but only got a little tan.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and would not usually spend this much on tanning lotion (even though I considered paying $35.00 for a spray on tan).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and are far better than this.</li>
            <li> and my arm was a little tanner in one area for a day :)</li>
            <li> and my arm was a little tanner in one area for a day :)      </li>
            <li> Have tried many self tanners in a effort to have a little color but avoid the sun and tanning beds for health reasons.  </li>
            <li> Looked natural, I was told!!</li>
            <li> , I am throwing this junk out and promising myself to not stupidly waste money anymore on products like these.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li> A very natural looking sunless tan.</li>
            <li> It works and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Just start getting ready a little earlier and you&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural!  </li>
            <li> but I would say that it looks great for 4 as it slowly fades due to your skin replenishing itself and</li>
            <li> I am naturally milk-white with horrid vericose veins, and this is just the product for me!  </li>
            <li> This product was easy to apply, did not smell bad (although it does have a strong smell), and tanned me to a golden brown in a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> The color is very gradual and natural yet you can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> The gel was clear itself.</li>
            <li> It gives a truly natural color.</li>
            <li> Gives natural color....</li>
            <li> /&gt;by far.  </li>
            <li> This is the most subtle tanning gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> the color was fine but no better than the $10.00 products.  </li>
            <li> Especially for the high price.</li>
            <li> The only two downsides are the price and drying time (longer than normal).</li>
            <li> It left my skin looking orange and was very sticky feeling for several hours</li>
            <li> It also has never come out looking streaky and makes your skin feel very soft after the initial application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little spendy, but in this case it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I usually use it once a week over the entire body and then use it once more a few days later on the areas that dont tan very well.</li>
            <li> , I do have to say I had a little problem with certain places getting a orange tint like the elbows and knees, but it does help to put some other type of lotion on first and problem solved.</li>
            <li> Just be extra careful you blend very evenly</li>
            <li> We used a moderate coverage, like I have with other tanning gels, and applied a second coat about 2 hours after the first.  </li>
            <li> This particular item seems to be old or outdated because I have no tanning results when I use it as opposed to positive result when using the same product purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li> :  I would say that the main thing that I don&#x27;t like is it is hard to get it to look natural around the ankle and sides of the foot.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of tries, I ended up a little streaky</li>
            <li> I have used Clarins Self Tanning Instant Gel in the past and it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> biggest recommendation I can make is to put it on after a early morning shower, wear dark cloths for the day, and then shower again before bed.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the woman at the store counter told me it would.  </li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate during the shower with scrubs, then follow up with the self tending instant gel and leave it to dry before going to bed.</li>
            <li> It will make your first trip to the beach a little less glaring.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It darkened my skin JUST enough to hide the pink tones and give me a tan glow (1 coat).</li>
            <li> I did get a little color, but not enough to warrant regular use.  </li>
            <li> A winner I will continue to use as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time if just using it on your face.</li>
            <li> I put the gel on my legs and waited and waited and waited for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I add some moisturizer as my face feels very dry.  </li>
            <li> I was so pale that I had to use two coats until my legs had been in the sun long enough to get some color.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t streak, however, I applied with a large thin sponge pad, rather than my hand.</li>
            <li> I am not going to apply a third time - that would be too dark for me (and remember, I started out milk-white!).  </li>
            <li> but I also have a pink undertone in my arms, legs and face.</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;ve wanted to do is hide the pink tones in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Be careful around your ankles and knees.  </li>
            <li> I expected a deeper, richer color.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get any water on your legs while it is drying.</li>
            <li> The initial smell is good but, like all others it turns to that awful self tanning smell.</li>
            <li> I am a pale Irish girl and it takes me forever to catch a tan.  </li>
            <li> and I am pale white.</li>
            <li> It never felt completely dry and after 45 minutes, I gave up and had to wash the sticky, smelly mess off.  </li>
            <li> This tanner didn&#x27;t give me the orange color like some of the other ones do.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands</li>
            <li> I have only used it no more than once a week.  </li>
            <li> This will only put a small amount on them and does not leave a tan line at the wrist like it does when you just wash your hands and are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took to spray tanning only but was tired of the constant orange glow that comes with even the versa.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only negative about this product is the drying time</li>
            <li> Even if the product feels a little &#x27;tacky&#x27; on your skin the color never comes off on your clothes like other products can.</li>
            <li> Sticky, smelly and no color except a slight orange tint to my skin</li>
            <li> I noticed a little product around the hole, which was dark brown, before even using it.</li>
            <li> (Highly recommend getting a tan application body buffing brush as well, since it gives an instant tan to the palms of your hands, that is nearly impossible to get rid off...)&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> price is a little steep, so</li>
            <li> It just turns a little smelly</li>
            <li> You still might feel a little sticky after 15 minutes, depending on your humidity.  </li>
            <li> It does smell (I think all sunless tanners do though), and it makes my skin a little tacky for a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but would use this product again.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my face and a natural-looking tan develops within a few hours with no breakouts.</li>
            <li> It has to be reapplied a few times.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and it inflamed the skin on my cheeks for a few hours and still no change.</li>
            <li> Exfoliated those areas, all blended evenly after a few days..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale</li>
            <li> I used this product but did not get the results I was looking for, it also had an odor to it after a few hours, not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, specially for such an expensive product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps if you use an extremely thin coat, it might dry.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet, but wouldn&#x27;t feel anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Clarins Self-Tanning Instant Gel was not the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t horrible but is noticeable most the day.</li>
            <li> It made me look dirty, not a sexy natural sun kissed tan as the reviews stated.</li>
            <li> apply all over, rub in well, wash your hands, and wait at least 15 minutes to dress.  </li>
            <li> No better than the much less expensive ones that I have used before.</li>
            <li> I was looking to get seriously bronze</li>
            <li> I figured it was just so subtle that maybe I&#x27;d just use it on my face and something else on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews these days, but this product is so awful, I couldn&#x27;t help myself.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not good</li>
            <li> only is it an expensive choice, but the process was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with an unpleasant odor like other self tanners.</li>
            <li> It does what it claims &amp; isn&#x27;t orangey (bonus) but the color is very faint even used every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor, but the results were not worth the effort of getting through the application time.  </li>
            <li> I think the product I got was probably tampered with or outdated or something, but I will never try it again.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the lack of directions, so here are my suggestions:  </li>
            <li> Too bad because the color is not orange and the tan lasts for at least 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> $33 seems expensive for a 4.4 ounce tube of stuff-</li>
            <li> It felt really uncomfortable when I slept in it also.</li>
            <li> Can not tell you anything about the color or the streaks - because if was nearly impossible to get any tan...</li>
            <li> So after putting up with uncomfortable stickiness, the awful smell - it was very disappointing to see no change in color!</li>
            <li> I tried the product on my face and hated it .</li>
            <li> Very disappointed about everything in this product - would never ever buy it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item.  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell awful</li>
            <li> The problem is the horrible smell!  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Maybe it is just how these type of products affect me personally, but I still got the dreaded orange glow from using this product.</li>
            <li> This tanner didn&#x27;t give me the orange color like some of the other ones do. It doesn&#x27;t streak, however, I applied with a large thin sponge pad, rather than my hand. That probably helps distribute the clear gel more evenly. I let the color build by using 3 light applications.I didn&#x27;t have a problem with an unpleasant odor like other self tanners. It&#x27;s a little spendy, but in this case it was worth it. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet, but wouldn&#x27;t feel anxious to try it. FAST shipping from seller. Would purchase from again.</li>
            <li> As many before me have said, this is the best sunless tanner that I have ever used. It looks like I just stepped out of a mystic tan booth about 4 hours after I apply the gel. After 2 days I apply another layer and then apply gradual tanner by Neutrogena to maintain it. It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell, you can smell is on you until you shower again but it has some fragrance to it so it is not really a big deal. It doesn&#x27;t look orange at all on my paper white skin and lasts about a week. Not bad considering a mystic tan costs 20 a session whereas this entire bottle costs about 30 and can keep you tan for months. Worth every penny. It also has never come out looking streaky and makes your skin feel very soft after the initial application. Hope this helps. Sunless tanning is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work. I put the gel on my legs and waited and waited and waited for it to dry. It never felt completely dry and after 45 minutes, I gave up and had to wash the sticky, smelly mess off.  I did get a little color, but not enough to warrant regular use.  Will keep looking for a better product.</li>
            <li> Clarins Gelee auto bronzante work very well.  It is very easy to apply.  I always wear latex gloves for application.  Golden Avenue really delivered on this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve self-tanned many times over the years.  Since Bain du Soleil discontinued their great tanning gel, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good alternative.  Unfortunately Clarins Self-Tanning Instant Gel was not the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it an expensive choice, but the process was disappointing. My sister and I (50s-60s) both had the same experience.  Although we got a couple of shades darker, the gel is oily and sticky and never seems to reach an \\&quot;absorbed\\&quot; state where you feel comfortable putting clothes on over it.  We waited over an hour and sitll had a greasy, tacky coating on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps if you use an extremely thin coat, it might dry.  We used a moderate coverage, like I have with other tanning gels, and applied a second coat about 2 hours after the first.  We couldn&#x27;t wait to get the stuff off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor, but the results were not worth the effort of getting through the application time.  I think in the future, I will switch to Neutrogena Micro-Mist spary-on application.  We tried this for the \\&quot;refresher\\&quot; tan and liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t require hands-on application and produced a nice result.</li>
            <li> I found it do be OK. No better than the much less expensive ones that I have used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale but I also have a pink undertone in my arms, legs and face. All I&#x27;ve wanted to do is hide the pink tones in my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different sunless tanners and I haven&#x27;t liked any. I just got this tonight and it is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It darkened my skin JUST enough to hide the pink tones and give me a tan glow (1 coat). It&#x27;s not orange. The initial smell is good but, like all others it turns to that awful self tanning smell. Oh and it doesn&#x27;t streak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you know what, I can put up with that smell until I shower if it means I finally have the color I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little steep, so I guess it&#x27;s best to use sparingly, unless you have money like that :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So over all, it does what it says it will. It just turns a little smelly and it&#x27;s kinda pricey.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this gel. There isn&#x27;t much in a tube but (don&#x27;t judge me!)...I just buy it to use on my face and do the tanning bed for my body. I cover my face in the tanning bed so I don&#x27;t get wrinkles on my face! People never know that I have a \\&quot;real\\&quot; tan on the body and a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; tan on the face, as they blend perfectly. I will NEVER use anything different. I don&#x27;t know why somebody says not to use it if you have acne? The formula is a gel and lightweight. I get acne occasionally and this does not add to it or aggravate it. The gel is smooth, perfect color,and the color is easily buildable over a few applications. Worth the money. Oh, and I don&#x27;t find the smell to be offensive at all..I apply it before bed and never see any color on my pillowcase. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I bought this after researching self tanners online.  It got good reviews and seemed promising.  I used it on my legs in the spring so I could start wearing shorts without having to go to the tanning bed.  I haven&#x27;t tried applying it anywhere else on my body yet, but I have faith in the product that it would do fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  I am fair skinned and it works great.  I was so pale that I had to use two coats until my legs had been in the sun long enough to get some color.  The color is brown- not orange and if applied correctly provides even color.  Looks so natural!  It is so much safer than the sun and a tanning bed and looks just as good.  My legs feel so sexy when I use it and am able to wear shorts earlier than other people.  The gel dries really quickly and is easy to apply evenly.  The smell is nice compared to other self tanners that I&#x27;ve tried.  $33 seems expensive for a 4.4 ounce tube of stuff- but it goes far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  I would say that the main thing that I don&#x27;t like is it is hard to get it to look natural around the ankle and sides of the foot.  You have to make sure you barely brush it on.  The first time I did it I put a bunch on my ankle and it looked streaky around my ankle and the top of my foot. Also, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the woman at the store counter told me it would.  She said seven days...but I would say that it looks great for 4 as it slowly fades due to your skin replenishing itself and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS FOR USE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my legs, put on regular lotion and then wait about 10 minutes before applying the tanning gel.  You can also exfoliate your legs before shaving to make it last longer (but I don&#x27;t always do this).  I&#x27;ve applied it without lotion and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as well.  I use a rubber kitchen glove to rub it in so my hands don&#x27;t turn color.  I apply the gel on my legs except my knees, lower ankle, and sides of feet.  The most important thing is to use very sparingly around your ankle/foot area and knee.  I wait until it is almost all of the glove and then rub whats left on the glove briskly on my ankles and foot and knee.  I also put on pj pants afterwards- not shorts.  I accidentally rested my arm for a while on my legs after I had applied it and my arm was a little tanner in one area for a day :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and tell my friends and family about it.  I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I wished soemone had told me about this last summer so I would not have worn pants until I could get myself tan!almost all of the glove and then rub whats left on the glove briskly on my ankles and foot and knee.

            <li> Wonderful self-tanner!</li>
            <li> I used this product but did not get the results I was looking for, it also had an odor to it after a few hours, not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Clarin&#x27;s Self Tanning instant Gel: It rubbes off and stainend my cloth.I have fair skin and applied the Gel 4 times, but only got a little tan. Very disappointing, specially for such an expensive product.Marla</li>
            <li> I am now on my third coat, I have yet to see a change in color.  True I am fair but I suspected to see something that looked like a tan.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Honestly.. giving one star feels too much for this product: The acetone smell, was beyond overpowering! Can not tell you anything about the color or the streaks - because if was nearly impossible to get any tan... after applying it for a good week, every night in a row! So after putting up with uncomfortable stickiness, the awful smell - it was very disappointing to see no change in color! Very disappointed about everything in this product - would never ever buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I&#x27;ve tried them all - top shelf (Dior, Channel, Clinique, etc.,) and have not had any luck until accidentally stumbled across Bare Escentuals Faux Tan. Smell, instant color, overall very happy to finally have that real-looking gorgeous tan! Read up on it! (Highly recommend getting a tan application body buffing brush as well, since it gives an instant tan to the palms of your hands, that is nearly impossible to get rid off...)&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I was nervous to try a self-tanner, having only used Jergens moisturizing lotion with tanner before.  This product was easy to apply, did not smell bad (although it does have a strong smell), and tanned me to a golden brown in a couple of hours.  I am naturally milk-white with horrid vericose veins, and this is just the product for me!  I was a little disappointed in the lack of directions, so here are my suggestions:  apply all over, rub in well, wash your hands, and wait at least 15 minutes to dress.  You still might feel a little sticky after 15 minutes, depending on your humidity.  If you are not brown enough by next day, apply again.  I am not going to apply a third time - that would be too dark for me (and remember, I started out milk-white!).  I even used it on my face (once), and am really happy with the results.  No weirdness in my hairline or splotchy patches.  My knees are the tiniest bit browner than the rest of me, but not enough for me to care.  It did not get my stretch marks to blend in with the rest of me, but I don&#x27;t know that a real tan would do that, either.  I am using their after-sun lotion with tanner to keep the tan going.</li>
            <li> it worked well but was blotchy on my knees and feet.  Just be extra careful you blend very evenly</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews these days, but this product is so awful, I couldn&#x27;t help myself.  Sticky, smelly and no color except a slight orange tint to my skin, I am throwing this junk out and promising myself to not stupidly waste money anymore on products like these.  Yes, I know better, but read such convincing reviews that I just had to try it.  Smells absolutely repulsive, stays sticky for longer than it should, and does absolutely nothing but make me look like an orange-tinted fool.</li>
            <li> would not buy again, claimed to not to turn orange and for this price&lt;br /&gt;it should not have. Could see all lines where application stopped.</li>
            <li> The best I have used yet.  Good coverage and color.  No odor and dries fat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product for a number of years, however, It isn&#x27;t what it used to be!  It makes some areas darker than the others, and it looks blotchy!!  It gets orangy on larger parts of the body.  Probably won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> THis stuff is the best face tanner on the market. Love it love it love it. I will use this forever. It lasts a very long time if just using it on your face. It only takes about a dime amount. I have had it for almost a year and just running out. 32.00 for 1 year, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> it does last longer than most self tanning creams.  The problem is the price.  I have already used 2 tubes and we are not even officially into summer yet.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and would not usually spend this much on tanning lotion (even though I considered paying $35.00 for a spray on tan). This stuff is great. Not streaky. Not orange. I am so happy to go on my vacation without my Casper white legs!</li>
            <li> Been using this for many years. I buy one or two tubes a year and it lasts as I only use on my face twice a week. Great price, no streaking, good color results.  But don&#x27;t get it in your eyes as it&#x27;s very irritating.&lt;br /&gt;after it dries on my face I add some moisturizer as my face feels very dry.  Works great.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> nice color, not oily and well absorbed. The smell is not good</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Best self tanner for light skin tone. Looks like a real tan! Gradually gets darker thru the day. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I worked in the tanning industry for four years but recently quit indoor tanning because of the health risks. I took to spray tanning only but was tired of the constant orange glow that comes with even the versa. This is AMAZING. I have tried countless self tanners and this is my absolute favorite! The color is very gradual and natural yet you can definitely see a difference. ZERO orange tint. The only two downsides are the price and drying time (longer than normal). Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have used it Since 1982.  It rubs in rather quickly compared to others. It gives a truly natural color. Be sure to exfoliate prior to using and put some lotion on elbows knees and ankles before putting clarions on. I have tried other brands but I still prefer Clarins. Anyone considering it should definitely try it. They won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I tried the product on my face and hated it . It left my skin looking orange and was very sticky feeling for several hours</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Low odor and nice color.</li>
            <li> Actually, better than expected.  No lingering odor and don&#x27;t turn orange.  It works!</li>
            <li> One of the best tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used.  Smell is a bit strong but overall the best color/coverage.  I use disposable gloves when putting mine on.</li>
            <li> I was looking to get seriously bronze and this product was lacking in that area.&lt;br /&gt;It at best gave me a little color but nothing what I was hoping to get.</li>
            <li> Awful. Turns you orange.</li>
            <li> It works! just don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate during the shower with scrubs, then follow up with the self tending instant gel and leave it to dry before going to bed. For some people it wouldn&#x27;t work once, so you have to do it again the next night. but for me it work so fast.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self-tanner. I would easily rate it 5 stars if it lasted longer between applications-2 or 3 baths/showers max. It does have a smell as do all others I&#x27;ve ever tried and is pricey. That said, the color is the most natural tan color I&#x27;ve seen yet, goes on like a dream and without streaks! A winner I will continue to use as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing a sunless tanner.  I am a pale Irish girl and it takes me forever to catch a tan.  In the middle of winter, I would describe myself as translucent.  This sunless tanner takes that edge off.  I have only used it no more than once a week.  It doesn&#x27;t make me brown/tan, but adds just enough color to make me look healthy again.  I would assume that if I used it more often, I would get darker, but haven&#x27;t tried yet.  It does smell (I think all sunless tanners do though), and it makes my skin a little tacky for a couple of hours.  You can put your clothes on after about 5-10 minutes though.  The first couple of tries, I ended up a little streaky but now I have the hang of it.  I put regular lotion on my knees and elbows before the tanner, and apply both in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> This product is overall great. It spreads nicely and you can tell where you have already put it. The smell isn&#x27;t horrible but is noticeable most the day. The color is great and does not turn out orange or anything. I usually use it once a week over the entire body and then use it once more a few days later on the areas that dont tan very well. IE: Leg&#x27;s and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest recommendation I can make is to put it on after a early morning shower, wear dark cloths for the day, and then shower again before bed. I have ruined 2 good pairs of sheets from them getting stained even after I wore it all day and not feeling it on my skin any longer. Also, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly as in the directions. After you dry them off &amp; then rub the top of your hands over parts of your body with the lotion on it. This will only put a small amount on them and does not leave a tan line at the wrist like it does when you just wash your hands and are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember, it will stain any lighter colored fabrics, my sheets were a tan color and there is still a noticeable darker spot from where I slept. This is the only drawback of the product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work good.  No streaking I like it.  A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> Love it! A very natural looking sunless tan. Be careful around your ankles and knees.  Wash hands afterwards. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Works well on face and arms not as much with abs.</li>
            <li> It is good and it works so I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> It made me look dirty, not a sexy natural sun kissed tan as the reviews stated. Of course maybe my skin tone is different, I am chronically very pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just wasn&#x27;t up to the hype for me, I&#x27;m gonna try st. tropez, now and hope that the foam is easier and more evenly applied then this stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried this and was not too happy with the result. Too pricy for the product. I&#x27;ve tried other products and are far better than this. It didnt really make me tan at all and I am pale white.It felt really uncomfortable when I slept in it also. It didn&#x27;t smell awful but I will never buy this product again.Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of self tannners and they all turned my skin orange.  The Clarins tanner does not turn orange on my skin.  Looks like a real tanner.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Great color that lasts for days! I even use it on my face and a natural-looking tan develops within a few hours with no breakouts. The only negative about this product is the drying time but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker. Just start getting ready a little earlier and you&#x27;ll be ok. Even if the product feels a little &#x27;tacky&#x27; on your skin the color never comes off on your clothes like other products can. This tanning gel is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> After the very first application, the beautiful bronze color was already becoming apparent to  me. Smells GREAT and, if you apply all over before bedtime, let the small amount you used seep into your skin before heading for bed and awakening like I did - VERY IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li> I buy this every season.  Once for spring/summer and again in winter for a warm glow.&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage and color.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a quick fix for my pale skin, I read many reviews and most seemed to say that they didn&#x27;t have problems with orange color, I do have to say I had a little problem with certain places getting a orange tint like the elbows and knees, but it does help to put some other type of lotion on first and problem solved. Over all this product is great, I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve ordered more,  the price is right and works great,  Very natural.</li>
            <li> Given its price &amp; good reviews I expected a lot more. It&#x27;s stinky but that fades. I expected a deeper, richer color. It does what it claims &amp; isn&#x27;t orangey (bonus) but the color is very faint even used every other day. I get the same &amp;/or better results from Loreal Sublime Bronze albeit that tends to be on the orange side. Maybe it&#x27;s my skin tone..... Worth a try, though.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, no smell, not greasy, works quickly and looks completely natural.  I was really hesitant to try a self tanner, but this product made a believer out of me.</li>
            <li> This is the most subtle tanning gel I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s pricey but good. It will make your first trip to the beach a little less glaring.</li>
            <li> It has to be reapplied a few times.</li>
            <li> The color this product gives is nice and natural looking, even after one application.  The problem is the horrible smell!  The odor  remains for over 12 hours and I will be switching to another brand.  Too bad because the color is not orange and the tan lasts for at least 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> This is best tanning gel that money can buy, hands down. Nice natural color, goes on evenly, lasts long and fades evenly.</li>
            <li> paid apprx $40.00 for this product.  the color was fine but no better than the $10.00 products.  would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Have tried many self tanners in a effort to have a little color but avoid the sun and tanning beds for health reasons.  First one I can safely use on my face that doesn&#x27;t break me out.  Gives natural color.... I do a dab daily to keep up the color.  Smells nice as far as self tann ers go.  I use a little more economically priced tanner for my body... and save clarins for my face and chest.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have very white skin. I use it for my legs and it leaves a nice natural color. It fully dries in about an hour and doesn&#x27;t come off on my sheets when I sleep or my clothes when I sweat. I re-apply about 5 days. It does not leave streak marks on my legs. Be careful not to get any water on your legs while it is drying.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the over the counter&lt;br /&gt;self tanners.  This is the best I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;by far.  I wish it lasted longer than a few&lt;br /&gt;days.  If you plan well you can keep&lt;br /&gt;the tan going rather easily!</li>
            <li> So far, so good, with a slow gentle change in color. Easy to apply. Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My Wife uses this all the time, she gets the best results, and no gloves or lotion before. She will leave it on all night sometimes and then the next day showers off and good to go.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item.  I have used Clarins Self Tanning Instant Gel in the past and it has worked very well.  This particular item seems to be old or outdated because I have no tanning results when I use it as opposed to positive result when using the same product purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I. Love the golden brown color.  Im a redhead so I burn easy and freckles.  This is by far the most believable tan from a self tanner I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> So the product bottle I got did not look like the picture to start. It also was not sealed under the cap, which should have tipped me off right away. I noticed a little product around the hole, which was dark brown, before even using it. The gel was clear itself. I did a test section with this first and noticed no difference at all. I am light/medium skin toned. I figured it was just so subtle that maybe I&#x27;d just use it on my face and something else on the rest of my body. I used it on my face and it inflamed the skin on my cheeks for a few hours and still no change. I threw it away. I think the product I got was probably tampered with or outdated or something, but I will never try it again. Especially for the high price. I now found Tanwise and absolutely love it. It works and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Looked natural, I was told!!</li>
            <li> I like this product and have used it for years.  It lasts about 5 days and then needs to be reapplied.  I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smell much and&lt;br /&gt;tans evenly.  I sleep with it on, and then shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> No harsh smell, tans nicely except on ankles and knees...Strongly advise applying several days before event..gave me time to see areas that didn&#x27;t tan evenly. Exfoliated those areas, all blended evenly after a few days.. A little pricey, but would use this product again.</li>
