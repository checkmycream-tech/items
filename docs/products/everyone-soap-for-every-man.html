            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to strip your body of moisture, a good thing to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good scent.  </li>

            <li>Personally I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>And honestly, it cleans just as well</li>
            <li>Nice manly smell for us non-girly man types.</li>
            <li>The soap is a nice alternative to Bronner&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap smells great and leaves skin clean without over-drying.  </li>
            <li>The scent is great, its a fresh/clean smell with just the right amount of manliness!</li>
            <li>It seemed pricey to me at first, but honestly, I think it&#x27;s a good value because there&#x27;s a lot of it!</li>
            <li>Like the smell , does not lather up that good but easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>JUST RIGHT !!!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent soap with a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>it smalls great and is really useful for washing hair and body.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, love that it has no phthalates, etc.</li>
            <li>Not bad - good smell</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Good smell, manly, but not too powerful.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel better than any soap I&#x27;ve tried for 5+ years.</li>
            <li>Just put in some better soap.</li>
            <li>from the lavender bit, the soap smell was not that appealing to me and reminded me of a surface cleaner or dish soap.</li>
            <li>Again, my favorite liquid soap.</li>
            <li>Need lots of soap top lather</li>
            <li>My husband and I make sure to read the ingredient lists of &amp;#34;natural products&amp;#34; as many of them are misleading.</li>
            <li>so we go through soap quicker than most</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, smells great, but don&#x27;t like how much I have to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shampoo- not quite as sudsy as most shampoos,</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>This scent is lovely, and I think *</li>
            <li>everyone* would love it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a fragrance that was more on the citrusy side with wood undertone.  </li>
            <li>I like the price, but the smell is just ok.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love.</li>
            <li>Actually it&#x27;s the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used, better than shaving creams even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man, and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the lather of this soap.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s a nice neutral (unisex) clean scent.</li>
            <li>It suds up nicely with a wash cloth or shower puff, and after showering you feel and smell clean...</li>
            <li>So warm and clean.</li>
            <li>Great soap, good buy, lasted me a long time!</li>
            <li>LEAVES SKIN SO SOFT , SMELLS WONDERFUL, GREAT FOR EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE FAMILY.&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>Great for young people that are in a hurry!</li>
            <li>it is very true to the way it&#x27;s advertised.  </li>
            <li>The soap itself is all natural which is great, but while looking at the ingredients in the bottle I saw lavender oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great value, much larger than most.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it is not an exceptional shaving cream, I REALLY appreciate the idea that I can shave, shampoo, and shower with just this one product.</li>
            <li>Cleans dirt and oil off fine though.</li>
            <li>the scent isn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting, but certainly fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Soap- decent lather, good cleaning, clean rinse.</li>
            <li>As a dude, the smell of this soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Have had it for a few weeks now - don&#x27;t need a huge amount to cover the entire body, making the good price excellent.  </li>
            <li>You will not find a better all-around bath and body soap!</li>
            <li>This is a great soap, but it actually IS NOT natural.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide as well either since the lather isn&#x27;t as rich or dense as a shave soaps would be.</li>
            <li>Its also great value and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is the most convenient, kind to the skin soap I&#x27;ve found for the shower.  </li>
            <li>It leaves no residue and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Clean but cedar smell not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>soap, not such a pleasant opening experience.</li>
            <li>bottle is HUGE, and I feel is a great deal compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve tried many others that I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much of to get clean.</li>
            <li>Bought this because I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and was kind of freaked out by the ingredients in my major-label-with-a-bird-name body wash.</li>
            <li>It did an OK job but a bit too much friction for my taste.</li>
            <li>I used to use the dove for men (mild clean?)</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband who is a true shower minimalist.</li>
            <li>and also i know that it&#x27;s not bad for my skin.</li>
            <li>Also - they ship quickly.</li>
            <li>I do find that I&#x27;m going through fairly quickly and</li>
            <li>It may be adequate for those who shave legs etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this brand, and recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Great scent, decent lather for skin, but not enough for hair.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know what you are looking at, when reading an ingredient list, I can say this one is better than many, but still not completely natural.</li>
            <li>It is a very mild scent, and my wife cannot really smell it on me after a shower except sometimes in my hair.</li>
            <li>as soon as it is back in stock I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>Loved it more when the bottle only cost me about $6 recently.</li>
            <li>The cedar is not &#x27;in your face&#x27; and more like being near a cedar forest.</li>
            <li>it will be nice to only carry the one bottle!</li>
            <li>I have dry skin in the winter and this is pretty good at not drying me out.</li>
            <li>Very good price and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I guess citrus is not the right scent for</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t clean very well.  </li>
            <li>Nice smelling, mild soap with some good cleaning/scrubbing qualities, particularly not irritating sensitive skin while not working the scrubber to hard to remove dirt.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long, but is worlds better than what is available at most stores.</li>
            <li>You have to really use a lot of water, here-get your puffy good and soaked, stay wet while you shower.</li>
            <li>THEN you get a decent lather, and a chance of getting it rinsed clean.</li>
            <li>gentle, smells clean not like an over sprayed with cheap drugstore chemical Old Spice fledgling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li>That was the first thing my hubs said, when I asked him what he would want me to say about this product ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (eczema), and this rinses clean, and doesn&#x27;t cause issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can pretty much use for everything, hands, body, and face.</li>
            <li>Got this for my dad for his birthday he has super sensitive skin and loves it.</li>
            <li>Scent is okay, but as soon as you dry off you don&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li>I brought this for my teenage son, is so easy as its a hair and body wash.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want a moderate to strong smelling body wash</li>
            <li>Nice soap, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind the scent being a little stronger.</li>
            <li>my kids use this and really like it.</li>
            <li>Big plus though from a animal free testing product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This soap isn&#x27;t very soapy, and my kids didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend really loves it.</li>
            <li>I found this brand by walking into a Whole Foods, and since they raised the price I ordered it here.</li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t build as much of a lather as those, but I researched it and the stuff that makes the lather is the stuff that you don&#x27;t want in your body wash.</li>
            <li>give it 3 stars because we think the packaging and marketing are very well done (we believe presentation says a lot, but not everything) and</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the smell of the combo, doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This means that this handy dandy ~$14, 32oz bottle of soap will last a lot less time than the 16.9oz versions of normal body wash available everywhere.</li>
            <li>so I am familiar with the low sudsing qualities of SLS-free products.</li>
            <li>I have to use so much to get a decent lather to cover my body.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product and really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a safe alternative to typical showering products (no parabens, sls, etc.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a decent soap for the bucks at 32 oz.</li>
            <li>Decent lather</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously a decent amount spilled into the bag is was wrapped in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap to all.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend you try it too.</li>
            <li>works well for shaving,bathing and hair washing - more citrus than cedar - sent is fresh and subtle</li>
            <li>my husband has been looking for a soap that would clean and not leave patches of dry</li>
            <li>Solid product, worth the price.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a few weeks now, and love it.</li>
            <li>My body skin is oily and I live in a humid climate-I&#x27;m not looking to being covered in wax.&lt;br /&gt;According</li>
            <li>As I am reviewing this product it is only available as an add on product and is currently unavailable.</li>
            <li>my wife loves the scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>ALL NATURAL !  </li>
            <li>FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN TYPES !</li>
            <li>I am not sure what I like most about this product...</li>
            <li>I did a direct test compared to my normal brand, the Dove Men+Care body wash.</li>
            <li>This is Thick like the normal liquid soap you can get but does not set off my skin allergy like most do</li>
            <li>I just pour in an old dispenser.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>Chemicals are added to the natural materials during the process, pruducing a then synthetic product.</li>
            <li>Not heavy like perfume scented washes.</li>
            <li>1 shower/shave so far........</li>
            <li>So far I have not grown a beard or a dong.</li>
            <li>This soap required 6 times as much soap to produce a lather equal to the Dove product.</li>
            <li>....doesn&#x27;t really want me to repurchase, says it&#x27;s ok, not great.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling very clean, perhaps only a little drying.</li>
            <li>both love the smell, masculine, but subtle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn my face at all, so ill certainly be buying more</li>
            <li>It works fine, at least in my non-demanding shortish</li>
            <li>-it has a sharp, green smell and that is ok.</li>
            <li>A simple, natural product for all uses.</li>
            <li>I completely replaced my shampoo and bodywash with this and never looked back.</li>
            <li>I only use natural soaps</li>
            <li>Barely makes any bubbles but still works the way any shampoo would</li>
            <li>It is kind of weird to me that lavender oil would be in a product marketed for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside</li>
            <li>but as I&#x27;ve found with other oil-based products, it doesn&#x27;t allow the razor to rinse cleanly without effort and time spent not shaving.</li>
            <li>My preference is for a slightly warmer scent with woody products, but I can&#x27;t complain too much-</li>
            <li>Not a very good soap, didn&#x27;t lather very well and didn&#x27;t seem to clean like I expected from other reviews.</li>
            <li>poor pump for shampoo use, fine for hands;  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as bad as say, jojoba oil that I&#x27;ve used as a pre-shave, but it&#x27;s not as good as a traditional shave soap (I like Proraso).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The soap is a nice alternative to Bronner&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and leaves skin clean without over-drying.  </li>
            <li> The scent is great, its a fresh/clean smell with just the right amount of manliness!</li>
            <li> It seemed pricey to me at first, but honestly, I think it&#x27;s a good value because there&#x27;s a lot of it!</li>
            <li> Like the smell , does not lather up that good but easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> JUST RIGHT !!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soap with a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> it smalls great and is really useful for washing hair and body.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, love that it has no phthalates, etc.</li>
            <li> Not bad - good smell</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Good smell, manly, but not too powerful.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel better than any soap I&#x27;ve tried for 5+ years.</li>
            <li> Just put in some better soap.</li>
            <li> from the lavender bit, the soap smell was not that appealing to me and reminded me of a surface cleaner or dish soap.</li>
            <li> Again, my favorite liquid soap.</li>
            <li> Need lots of soap top lather</li>
            <li> My husband and I make sure to read the ingredient lists of &amp;#34;natural products&amp;#34; as many of them are misleading.</li>
            <li> so we go through soap quicker than most</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, smells great, but don&#x27;t like how much I have to use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shampoo- not quite as sudsy as most shampoos,</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This scent is lovely, and I think *</li>
            <li> everyone* would love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fragrance that was more on the citrusy side with wood undertone.  </li>
            <li> I like the price, but the smell is just ok.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love.</li>
            <li> Actually it&#x27;s the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used, better than shaving creams even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man, and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the lather of this soap.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s a nice neutral (unisex) clean scent.</li>
            <li> It suds up nicely with a wash cloth or shower puff, and after showering you feel and smell clean...</li>
            <li> So warm and clean.</li>
            <li> Great soap, good buy, lasted me a long time!</li>
            <li> LEAVES SKIN SO SOFT , SMELLS WONDERFUL, GREAT FOR EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE FAMILY.&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> Great for young people that are in a hurry!</li>
            <li> it is very true to the way it&#x27;s advertised.  </li>
            <li> The soap itself is all natural which is great, but while looking at the ingredients in the bottle I saw lavender oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a great value, much larger than most.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is not an exceptional shaving cream, I REALLY appreciate the idea that I can shave, shampoo, and shower with just this one product.</li>
            <li> Cleans dirt and oil off fine though.</li>
            <li> the scent isn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting, but certainly fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Soap- decent lather, good cleaning, clean rinse.</li>
            <li> As a dude, the smell of this soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a few weeks now - don&#x27;t need a huge amount to cover the entire body, making the good price excellent.  </li>
            <li> You will not find a better all-around bath and body soap!</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, but it actually IS NOT natural.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t glide as well either since the lather isn&#x27;t as rich or dense as a shave soaps would be.</li>
            <li> Its also great value and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the most convenient, kind to the skin soap I&#x27;ve found for the shower.  </li>
            <li> It leaves no residue and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Clean but cedar smell not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> soap, not such a pleasant opening experience.</li>
            <li> bottle is HUGE, and I feel is a great deal compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve tried many others that I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much of to get clean.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and was kind of freaked out by the ingredients in my major-label-with-a-bird-name body wash.</li>
            <li> It did an OK job but a bit too much friction for my taste.</li>
            <li> I used to use the dove for men (mild clean?)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who is a true shower minimalist.</li>
            <li> and also i know that it&#x27;s not bad for my skin.</li>
            <li> Also - they ship quickly.</li>
            <li> I do find that I&#x27;m going through fairly quickly and</li>
            <li> It may be adequate for those who shave legs etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this brand, and recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Great scent, decent lather for skin, but not enough for hair.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know what you are looking at, when reading an ingredient list, I can say this one is better than many, but still not completely natural.</li>
            <li> It is a very mild scent, and my wife cannot really smell it on me after a shower except sometimes in my hair.</li>
            <li> as soon as it is back in stock I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> Loved it more when the bottle only cost me about $6 recently.</li>
            <li> The cedar is not &#x27;in your face&#x27; and more like being near a cedar forest.</li>
            <li> it will be nice to only carry the one bottle!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter and this is pretty good at not drying me out.</li>
            <li> Very good price and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I guess citrus is not the right scent for</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t clean very well.  </li>
            <li> Nice smelling, mild soap with some good cleaning/scrubbing qualities, particularly not irritating sensitive skin while not working the scrubber to hard to remove dirt.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long, but is worlds better than what is available at most stores.</li>
            <li> You have to really use a lot of water, here-get your puffy good and soaked, stay wet while you shower.</li>
            <li> THEN you get a decent lather, and a chance of getting it rinsed clean.</li>
            <li> gentle, smells clean not like an over sprayed with cheap drugstore chemical Old Spice fledgling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> That was the first thing my hubs said, when I asked him what he would want me to say about this product ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (eczema), and this rinses clean, and doesn&#x27;t cause issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can pretty much use for everything, hands, body, and face.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad for his birthday he has super sensitive skin and loves it.</li>
            <li> Scent is okay, but as soon as you dry off you don&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my teenage son, is so easy as its a hair and body wash.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want a moderate to strong smelling body wash</li>
            <li> Nice soap, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind the scent being a little stronger.</li>
            <li> my kids use this and really like it.</li>
            <li> Big plus though from a animal free testing product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This soap isn&#x27;t very soapy, and my kids didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend really loves it.</li>
            <li> I found this brand by walking into a Whole Foods, and since they raised the price I ordered it here.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t build as much of a lather as those, but I researched it and the stuff that makes the lather is the stuff that you don&#x27;t want in your body wash.</li>
            <li> give it 3 stars because we think the packaging and marketing are very well done (we believe presentation says a lot, but not everything) and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the smell of the combo, doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This means that this handy dandy ~$14, 32oz bottle of soap will last a lot less time than the 16.9oz versions of normal body wash available everywhere.</li>
            <li> so I am familiar with the low sudsing qualities of SLS-free products.</li>
            <li> I have to use so much to get a decent lather to cover my body.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a safe alternative to typical showering products (no parabens, sls, etc.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent soap for the bucks at 32 oz.</li>
            <li> Decent lather</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously a decent amount spilled into the bag is was wrapped in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap to all.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend you try it too.</li>
            <li> works well for shaving,bathing and hair washing - more citrus than cedar - sent is fresh and subtle</li>
            <li> my husband has been looking for a soap that would clean and not leave patches of dry</li>
            <li> Solid product, worth the price.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks now, and love it.</li>
            <li> My body skin is oily and I live in a humid climate-I&#x27;m not looking to being covered in wax.&lt;br /&gt;According</li>
            <li> As I am reviewing this product it is only available as an add on product and is currently unavailable.</li>
            <li> my wife loves the scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> ALL NATURAL !  </li>
            <li> FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN TYPES !</li>
            <li> I am not sure what I like most about this product...</li>
            <li> I did a direct test compared to my normal brand, the Dove Men+Care body wash.</li>
            <li> This is Thick like the normal liquid soap you can get but does not set off my skin allergy like most do</li>
            <li> I just pour in an old dispenser.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Chemicals are added to the natural materials during the process, pruducing a then synthetic product.</li>
            <li> Not heavy like perfume scented washes.</li>
            <li> 1 shower/shave so far........</li>
            <li> So far I have not grown a beard or a dong.</li>
            <li> This soap required 6 times as much soap to produce a lather equal to the Dove product.</li>
            <li> ....doesn&#x27;t really want me to repurchase, says it&#x27;s ok, not great.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling very clean, perhaps only a little drying.</li>
            <li> both love the smell, masculine, but subtle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my face at all, so ill certainly be buying more</li>
            <li> It works fine, at least in my non-demanding shortish</li>
            <li> -it has a sharp, green smell and that is ok.</li>
            <li> A simple, natural product for all uses.</li>
            <li> I completely replaced my shampoo and bodywash with this and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I only use natural soaps</li>
            <li> Barely makes any bubbles but still works the way any shampoo would</li>
            <li> It is kind of weird to me that lavender oil would be in a product marketed for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside</li>
            <li> but as I&#x27;ve found with other oil-based products, it doesn&#x27;t allow the razor to rinse cleanly without effort and time spent not shaving.</li>
            <li> My preference is for a slightly warmer scent with woody products, but I can&#x27;t complain too much-</li>
            <li> Not a very good soap, didn&#x27;t lather very well and didn&#x27;t seem to clean like I expected from other reviews.</li>
            <li> poor pump for shampoo use, fine for hands;  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bad as say, jojoba oil that I&#x27;ve used as a pre-shave, but it&#x27;s not as good as a traditional shave soap (I like Proraso).</li>
            <li> Shaves as well as any other liquid soap, and worse than most shampoos.</li>
            <li> It will clean you, but is too thin to shave with.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t lather up like the average brand (dove, old spice, etc.)</li>
            <li> (tone it down, old spice).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled he&#x27;s using something a little less harsh than his usual soap/shampoo.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strange.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave cream- again, not much lather, and not quite as lubricating as shaving cream or oils, but it works well enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> Minor razor burn as the blade ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasts long!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin and buy the &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; types of body washes, this may not bother you.</li>
            <li> Seems to be chemically less than traditional shampoos/bodywash.</li>
            <li> higher price than Whole Foods in store :-(</li>
            <li> I bought a few different varieties, and will just combine them into this one review.  </li>
            <li> Smells fragrant, in a masculine way, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty confusing when by everyone, you don&#x27;t realllly mean everyone.</li>
            <li> I will continue to look for other products/vendors.</li>
            <li> OTHER SKIN CONDITIONS TOO.&lt;br /&gt;THE</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this scent again, try other ones by this company.</li>
            <li> Might purchase again, depends on cost vs. other options.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is that it is hard to rinse off my skin.</li>
            <li> It cleans about as well as watered down shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is inexpensive because it is watered down.</li>
            <li> Breaking it down into elements-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not nourishing for your skin or hair, BUT it is less harsh than other synthetic surfactants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only weird thing is switching from the chemical-packed stuff I used in the past that made massive amounts of soapy froth.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a little adjustment.</li>
            <li> I must say however, It did arrive damaged and messy.</li>
            <li> IRRITATE THE SKIN , ALL YEAR ROUND CLEANSER, SUMMER, WINTER  </li>
            <li> I used it a few times when I ran out of body wash, and it didn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a dude, as sometimes happens when I need to borrow his deodorant in a pinch</li>
            <li> This is a plant DERIVED cleanser, meaning the raw materials come from coconut, but how it is then processed in the lab creates a unnatural reaction and thus product.</li>
            <li> only thing that it fails at is shaving.</li>
            <li> Everyone soap is usually marketed to ummmm...</li>
            <li> The dispenser keeps soap scum cleaning to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for a less expensive alternative to Dr.</li>
            <li> Pump is weak &amp; can&#x27;t handle my manly PSI...</li>
            <li> A bit weak in cleaning and fragrance</li>
            <li> I used to use Dr Bronners but always had an issue with how thin it was.</li>
            <li> soap is too thin for shaving, we both think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like how THIN the liquid is.</li>
            <li> Too bad it isn&#x27;t truly natural... :(</li>
            <li> Bronner&#x27;s, which is just silly overpriced.</li>
            <li> If I accidentally use the wrong soap or shampoo I am sorry 10 minutes later.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in the sense that it&#x27;s not overpowering or too faint an odor.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather smell like a Cedar Chip, but that&#x27;s me.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find the pump broken when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> ARTIFICIAL PERFUMES , COLOR,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too bad</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t bad, but I wish the scent was stronger.</li>
            <li> DO NOT do that-it&#x27;s awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my kids use this and really like it. They said it smells great!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap to all. Great fragrance, good quality ingredients (no sodium laurel sulfate, parabens, etc) and 32oz value size too boot. I also like the cucumber mint fragrance. I must say however, It did arrive damaged and messy.</li>
            <li> great!&lt;br /&gt;I use this for everything, including shaving!  my wife loves the scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Not a very good soap, didn&#x27;t lather very well and didn&#x27;t seem to clean like I expected from other reviews. Big plus though from a animal free testing product. I will continue to look for other products/vendors.</li>
            <li> Scent does not last and it does not lather like it should to me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My wife enjoys getting in the shower after me, cause it smells so good.</li>
            <li> This soap smells just as I hoped, and cleans just as well.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with a &amp;#34;lack of lather&amp;#34; though, as I use a wash cloth and it lathers very well after a few squirts.  Will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strange.  I know I should have known this, but it just feels like I&#x27;m bathing with pieces of wood.</li>
            <li> Awesome, great smell and smooth on skin. Will definitely buy over and over again. You can pretty much use for everything, hands, body, and face. Thanks</li>
            <li> Everyman needs a tub of this soap.  It smell good without being girly.  And it is multi-purpose for multi-tasking go for it</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a less expensive alternative to Dr.Bronner&#x27;s, which is just silly overpriced. So I ordered this, and you do get a lot of wash for the money.&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t smell like Citrus and Cedar-it has a sharp, green smell and that is ok. I was just looking forward to the title sniff. My main complaint is that it is hard to rinse off my skin. You have to really use a lot of water, here-get your puffy good and soaked, stay wet while you shower. THEN you get a decent lather, and a chance of getting it rinsed clean. If you have dry skin and buy the &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; types of body washes, this may not bother you. My body skin is oily and I live in a humid climate-I&#x27;m not looking to being covered in wax.&lt;br /&gt;According to the bottle, you can wash your hair in this. DO NOT do that-it&#x27;s awful. Zero lather, and you&#x27;ll spend forever trying to figure out if you got it all rinsed out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent soap for the bucks at 32 oz. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> This is a great soap. Good smell, manly, but not too powerful. Works great on hair and skin. I have very sensitive skin (eczema), and this rinses clean, and doesn&#x27;t cause issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that it fails at is shaving. It never thickens up enough, even with a brush.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad for his birthday he has super sensitive skin and loves it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite soap. I used to use Dr Bronners but always had an issue with how thin it was. This is Thick like the normal liquid soap you can get but does not set off my skin allergy like most do and it doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit that it tends to be cheaper.It also smells terrific.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and leaves skin clean without over-drying.  It&#x27;s just too bad they don&#x27;t make a sandalwood scented soap.  I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I like this concept. A simple, natural product for all uses. Great for young people that are in a hurry!</li>
            <li> Scent is okay, but as soon as you dry off you don&#x27;t smell it. Cleans dirt and oil off fine though. If you don&#x27;t want a moderate to strong smelling body wash I guess this stuff might be for you. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s soap&amp;#34;....doesn&#x27;t really want me to repurchase, says it&#x27;s ok, not great.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling, mild soap with some good cleaning/scrubbing qualities, particularly not irritating sensitive skin while not working the scrubber to hard to remove dirt.  Have had it for a few weeks now - don&#x27;t need a huge amount to cover the entire body, making the good price excellent.  The dispenser keeps soap scum cleaning to a minimum.  Overall, this is the most convenient, kind to the skin soap I&#x27;ve found for the shower.  Also - they ship quickly.</li>
            <li> The soap smells good and does the job.  I was disappointed to find the pump broken when it arrived.  I just pour in an old dispenser.</li>
            <li> Great scent, decent lather for skin, but not enough for hair.  I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars because the scent is so good and it makes my skin feel better than any soap I&#x27;ve tried for 5+ years.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soap with a clean fresh scent. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.  It just doesn&#x27;t clean very well.  This soap isn&#x27;t very soapy, and my kids didn&#x27;t like it.  I bought a few different varieties, and will just combine them into this one review.  They&#x27;re basically all the same, just different scents.  It cleans about as well as watered down shampoo.  That&#x27;s the best I phrase it.  I would skip this.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  Still using the bottle though!  Just put in some better soap.</li>
            <li> I definitely like the convenience of a all in one, pump bottle.  I do find that I&#x27;m going through fairly quickly and the scent isn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting, but certainly fine.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant scent. Good for man or woman. Leaves skin soft. Will definitely purchase again. Very good price and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, smell like a lumber jack.</li>
            <li> Smells good, does a good job as an all-in-one body/hair cleanser. I love that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> it smalls great and is really useful for washing hair and body. I&#x27;ve used this to simplify the products I use.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really loves it.</li>
            <li> I Like this soap cause it makes good lather and it smells good and also i know that it&#x27;s not bad for my skin.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and really wanted to like it. The soap itself is all natural which is great, but while looking at the ingredients in the bottle I saw lavender oil. Lavender oil is thought to be a testosterone blocker and is potentially harmful to boys and men. It is kind of weird to me that lavender oil would be in a product marketed for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the lavender bit, the soap smell was not that appealing to me and reminded me of a surface cleaner or dish soap. I guess citrus is not the right scent for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally the bottle showed up leaking with about 1/8 of the liquid gone.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and was kind of freaked out by the ingredients in my major-label-with-a-bird-name body wash. I found this brand by walking into a Whole Foods, and since they raised the price I ordered it here. The Cedar and Citrus smells great, it&#x27;s a massive bottle, and my partner loves it too -- he uses his on his hair as well. The only weird thing is switching from the chemical-packed stuff I used in the past that made massive amounts of soapy froth. This soap doesn&#x27;t build as much of a lather as those, but I researched it and the stuff that makes the lather is the stuff that you don&#x27;t want in your body wash. And honestly, it cleans just as well, it&#x27;s just a little adjustment. Love this brand, and recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Again, my favorite liquid soap. Great lather, scent, function, and value. You will not find a better all-around bath and body soap!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my husband, who is leary of anything &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t tell him it was &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;, I just told him I&#x27;d ordered him some soap since he&#x27;s always running out. He tried it and said it smelled good. I have gotten no complaints and I&#x27;m thrilled he&#x27;s using something a little less harsh than his usual soap/shampoo. I was also really impressed with the size of it. It seemed pricey to me at first, but honestly, I think it&#x27;s a good value because there&#x27;s a lot of it!</li>
            <li> Good product for head to toe cleaning. Nice manly smell for us non-girly man types. Priced fairly for every day use.</li>
            <li> The only thing I regret is that I cant brush my teeth with the stuff.  Solid product, worth the price.</li>
            <li> Need lots of soap top lather</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, but it actually IS NOT natural. My husband and I make sure to read the ingredient lists of &amp;#34;natural products&amp;#34; as many of them are misleading. If you don&#x27;t know what you are looking at, when reading an ingredient list, I can say this one is better than many, but still not completely natural. Why?&lt;br /&gt;The second ingredient, after water (making it the second largest amount of any ingredient in the bottle) is cocomidopropyl Hydroxysultaine. This is a plant DERIVED cleanser, meaning the raw materials come from coconut, but how it is then processed in the lab creates a unnatural reaction and thus product. Chemicals are added to the natural materials during the process, pruducing a then synthetic product. It is not nourishing for your skin or hair, BUT it is less harsh than other synthetic surfactants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both love the smell, masculine, but subtle. Wonderful. Not heavy like perfume scented washes. Also, the pump is awesome. That was the first thing my hubs said, when I asked him what he would want me to say about this product ;)&lt;br /&gt;It is a great value, much larger than most. Although my husband is a daily bubble-bather (.... I know...) so we go through soap quicker than most would anyway.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is too thin for shaving, we both think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We give it 3 stars because we think the packaging and marketing are very well done (we believe presentation says a lot, but not everything) and the scent is well thought out. Too bad it isn&#x27;t truly natural... :(</li>
            <li> works well for shaving,bathing and hair washing - more citrus than cedar - sent is fresh and subtle</li>
            <li> 1 shower/shave so far........</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells good, does not leave a lingering overly-perfumed smell. I would say it&#x27;s a nice neutral (unisex) clean scent. It lathers well in the hair and on the body. It leaves no residue and rinses clean. I completely replaced my shampoo and bodywash with this and never looked back. I have dry skin in the winter and this is pretty good at not drying me out. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a hydrated skin solution by any means, but that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s billed anyhow. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to strip your body of moisture, a good thing to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as a facial-shave soap once. I use a DE Razor with a brush. It lathers well enough but as I&#x27;ve found with other oil-based products, it doesn&#x27;t allow the razor to rinse cleanly without effort and time spent not shaving. It&#x27;s not as bad as say, jojoba oil that I&#x27;ve used as a pre-shave, but it&#x27;s not as good as a traditional shave soap (I like Proraso). It doesn&#x27;t glide as well either since the lather isn&#x27;t as rich or dense as a shave soaps would be. It did an OK job but a bit too much friction for my taste. It may be adequate for those who shave legs etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, it is not too manly or anything. But I don&#x27;t like how THIN the liquid is. I have to use so much to get a decent lather to cover my body. I only use natural soaps so I am familiar with the low sudsing qualities of SLS-free products. But I&#x27;ve tried many others that I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much of to get clean. I think this product is inexpensive because it is watered down. I like it a lot, smells great, but don&#x27;t like how much I have to use so I will probably not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Personally I love this stuff! It suds up nicely with a wash cloth or shower puff, and after showering you feel and smell clean... The scent is great, its a fresh/clean smell with just the right amount of manliness! 32oz. bottle is HUGE, and I feel is a great deal compared to other brands. I used to use the dove for men (mild clean?) bodywash since it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but now i perfer this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t burn my face at all, so ill certainly be buying more and I highly recommend you try it too.</li>
            <li> Clean but cedar smell not what I was looking for. Need balsam</li>
            <li> Like the smell , does not lather up that good but easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> A fine product, great scent, great price.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks now, and love it. Loved it more when the bottle only cost me about $6 recently. Breaking it down into elements-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent- It is a very mild scent, and my wife cannot really smell it on me after a shower except sometimes in my hair. The cedar is not &#x27;in your face&#x27; and more like being near a cedar forest. Same for the citrus/orange scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap- decent lather, good cleaning, clean rinse. I like the way my skin feels after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo- not quite as sudsy as most shampoos, but that is not a key factor for me (suds&#x3D;detergent, not cleaning). It works fine, at least in my non-demanding shortish hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave cream- again, not much lather, and not quite as lubricating as shaving cream or oils, but it works well enough for my needs. Minor razor burn as the blade ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is not an exceptional shaving cream, I REALLY appreciate the idea that I can shave, shampoo, and shower with just this one product. I have some in a travel bottle for my Dopp kit as well- it will be nice to only carry the one bottle!</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;My son at 13  is looking for that \\&quot;manly scent\\&quot;- because he does seem convinced he is one already.&lt;br /&gt;But....13... YOU ARE ONLY 13.&lt;br /&gt;Its gentle, smells clean not like an over sprayed with cheap drugstore chemical Old Spice fledgling.&lt;br /&gt;Win WIn.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  When used with a scrub sponge it lathers well.  Didn&#x27;t care for using it as a shampoo though.</li>
            <li> poor pump for shampoo use, fine for hands;  higher price than Whole Foods in store :-(</li>
            <li> Nice smell, love that it has no phthalates, etc. Decent lather although I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s enough for shaving.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the smell of the combo, doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li> Very nice lather and cedar/citrus scent.  My preference is for a slightly warmer scent with woody products, but I can&#x27;t complain too much- it is very true to the way it&#x27;s advertised.  Leaves skin feeling very clean, perhaps only a little drying.</li>
            <li> my husband has been looking for a soap that would clean and not leave patches of dry skin.this is it! he loves the smell of the cedar/citrus.</li>
            <li> Is anyone else seeing the irony in &amp;#34;everyone soap for every man&amp;#34;? Everyone soap is usually marketed to ummmm... everyone. I haven&#x27;t seen everyone soap for women. or maybe the everyone soap that is for everyone is actually for women? it&#x27;s pretty confusing when by everyone, you don&#x27;t realllly mean everyone. I have only lady parts and used this soap. So far I have not grown a beard or a dong. Also, just to let ya know eo, women also shave. just a (penis)head&#x27;s up! This scent is lovely, and I think *everyone* would love it. (everyone implies everyone. Thus, gender neutral.)</li>
            <li> Good scent.  Seems to be chemically less than traditional shampoos/bodywash.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fragrance that was more on the citrusy side with wood undertone.  This product was just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; on that expectation.</li>
            <li> Great soap, good buy, lasted me a long time!</li>
            <li> Barely makes any bubbles but still works the way any shampoo would so it&#x27;s alright in my books</li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; enough.  I always ended up re-lathering several times.  Moving on.</li>
            <li> LEAVES SKIN SO SOFT , SMELLS WONDERFUL, GREAT FOR EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE FAMILY.&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T IRRITATE THE SKIN , ALL YEAR ROUND CLEANSER, SUMMER, WINTER  ETC,&lt;br /&gt;NO ARTIFICIAL PERFUMES , COLOR, ALL NATURAL !  GREAT FOR KIDS, WOMEN, MEN , SENIORS ,AND BABIES !&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN TYPES ! CLEARS RASHES  AND OTHER SKIN CONDITIONS TOO.&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE IS GREAT AND AFFORDABLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF A 32 OZ SIZE , JUST RIGHT !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 20s and still suffer with acne.  If I accidentally use the wrong soap or shampoo I am sorry 10 minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;Switched to everyone soap and have had no adverse reactions, it also smells really good. This is my second tub.  Lasts long!</li>
            <li> I like the price, but the smell is just ok.  I won&#x27;t buy this scent again, try other ones by this company.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what I like most about this product... It&#x27;s a safe alternative to typical showering products (no parabens, sls, etc.) It saves you money and hassle because I use it as shampoo, face wash, shower gel, and shave cream. Not to mention it smells great in my opinion. As I am reviewing this product it is only available as an add on product and is currently unavailable. as soon as it is back in stock I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance is calming yet neutral...in the sense that it&#x27;s not overpowering or too faint an odor.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather smell like a Cedar Chip, but that&#x27;s me.  LoL&lt;br /&gt;The Pump is weak &amp; can&#x27;t handle my manly PSI... I&#x27;ll probably switch to another container and refill when needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who is a true shower minimalist. He doesn&#x27;t like having a bunch of bottles in the shower for hair, body and shaving, so this is perfect for him. Smells fragrant, in a masculine way, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming! I used it a few times when I ran out of body wash, and it didn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a dude, as sometimes happens when I need to borrow his deodorant in a pinch (tone it down, old spice).  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t bad, but I wish the scent was stronger. It also doesn&#x27;t lather up like the average brand (dove, old spice, etc.) For someone else, this may be the perfect soap, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> This is now one of our house staples! Smells great and can be used for everything. What&#x27;s not to love.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the smell.  So warm and clean.</li>
            <li> A bit weak in cleaning and fragrance</li>
            <li> The soap is a nice alternative to Bronner&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the packaging came with an open push squirt top.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously a decent amount spilled into the bag is was wrapped in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good soap, not such a pleasant opening experience.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my teenage son, is so easy as its a hair and body wash.And he doesn&#x27;t mind the smell.Its also great value and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Best aroma of all the Everyone Soaps. Works great for shaving! Actually it&#x27;s the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used, better than shaving creams even.</li>
            <li> As a dude, the smell of this soap is fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t last long, but is worlds better than what is available at most stores. My only issue with it is the lather. There is practically none. I did a direct test compared to my normal brand, the Dove Men+Care body wash. This soap required 6 times as much soap to produce a lather equal to the Dove product. This means that this handy dandy ~$14, 32oz bottle of soap will last a lot less time than the 16.9oz versions of normal body wash available everywhere. For that, it gets 3 stars only. If it had a proper lather, this would be a 5 star item, IMO.</li>
            <li> Nice soap, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind the scent being a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man, and I love this stuff. I use this stuff all over me,  including my shoulder length hair. It smells great. Chicks think it&#x27;s great too.</li>
            <li> Not bad - good smell but sometimes the lather leaves a bit to be desired. Might purchase again, depends on cost vs. other options.</li>
            <li> It will clean you, but is too thin to shave with.  Shaves as well as any other liquid soap, and worse than most shampoos.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the lather of this soap. Cedar smells great and stays with you all day. Definitely recommended!</li>
