            <li>The clock is a great feature.</li>
            <li>Great mirror but</li>

            <li>Great while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Not the best, but ok.</li>
            <li>It runs off AAA batteries, so water isn&#x27;t good for it.</li>
            <li>Best Overall and Best Value\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Handy mirror with bright lighting allowing me to see well in the shower when shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>and I paid more than the sticker price!</li>
            <li>great fit</li>
            <li>amazing fog-proof solution)  </li>
            <li>Yes - this is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he loved it, until it fell off the wall too many times to count, and that was tolerable.</li>
            <li>If you want to mount with tape or glue you have to figure that out on your own.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice, just not practical with out somewhere to hang my razor.</li>
            <li>so they fall off very easily.  </li>
            <li>The bright side is that Amazon and shipping were fine.</li>
            <li>Good for a light and a shave.  </li>
            <li>The mirror itself does stay fairly fogless during the extent of the shower and the three suction cups held true for the three days that I had this up.  </li>
            <li>make sure you get a squeegee for this</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was packaged appropriately.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed, the picture looks better then the actual product.</li>
            <li>But the light does not turn off!  </li>
            <li>The most &#x60;glaring&#x27; error here is the light.  </li>
            <li>They both love the idea of being able to shave right in the shower and not at the sink.  </li>
            <li>The mirror fogs, the light never worked even after changing the battery.  </li>
            <li>But the light works</li>
            <li>The light start malfunctioning, I turned it on and it never turned off.</li>
            <li>However, the light is quite convenient.</li>
            <li>It is a mirror with a light</li>
            <li>Light glares up into your eyes rather than on the mirror.</li>
            <li>I put batteries in the light works</li>
            <li>I came with the original price tag from another store</li>
            <li>The light is the only good thing about this product.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews or respond to surveys, but feel in this instance I must break my own</li>
            <li>thats OK because thats all I really bought it for.</li>
            <li>but in truth I paid waaay too much and should have gotten so much better quality.</li>
            <li>Make sure that there are always that many left.  </li>
            <li>I had a previous one that worked great.</li>
            <li>If it happens a couple more times it will probably break completely.    </li>
            <li>The lighting is pretty cool though.</li>
            <li>This um is worth maybe $2.00.</li>
            <li>This would probably stick better on a wall with the contemporary large square tile.</li>
            <li>Other issue is that the clock does not keep good time.</li>
            <li>Worked great for the first several months, but slowly starting to fog up.</li>
            <li>Overall they love this product.</li>
            <li>Was surprised that I had to get a flashlight to see if the light was on.</li>
            <li>It fogged first use and it wasn&#x27;t even a hot shower.</li>
            <li>It is funny that a fogless mirror made for the shower foods up every time.</li>
            <li>First, the mirror is NOT fogless and furthermore somewhat distorts your image when shaving.  </li>
            <li>fogs immediately upon turning on the hot water.</li>
            <li>That is exactly what I am going to do.  </li>
            <li>- I like to be positive).  </li>
            <li>While the LED works fairly well, the small clock gets waterlogged and quits working in about two days.</li>
            <li>Overall, for what it is ... not worth $35 (If I were to estimate the fair market value, it might be worth $10-$15)  </li>
            <li>The moist towelette that came with it, did not work very well.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really work.    </li>
            <li>Cheaply made,  and fogs up almost instantly</li>
            <li>For the price I paid I expected more.</li>
            <li>It fogs up, the light only blinds</li>
            <li>We have 5 different razors here to try and none of them fit the holders.</li>
            <li>The mirror isn&#x27;t real glass, which works for this porduct, since it falls off tile all the time.</li>
            <li>two very flimsy</li>
            <li>Replace the whole darn thing.  </li>
            <li>; is purely a fantasy-even brand new.</li>
            <li>The razor holders may hold an old fashion safety razor or injector razor, but they certainly will not hold a modern cartridge</li>
            <li>Small size although I was aware of that before I ordered and to top it off the clock/calender didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The clock&#x27;s a decent feature.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly surprised the Amazon would offer such a crummy, cheap product.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely &amp; highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Eh... the light is a nice feature, but after 1 week, the tiny clock display as already broken.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only fogless until you turn on the hot water.</li>
            <li>The light this put off was comparable to shaving in the dark.</li>
            <li>We need to clean ours like every other day to keep it &amp;</li>
            <li>However, the mirror is no longer clear and has some bubbling look to it.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy a bottle of the fogless liquid, but that sucks because then they will be getting more of my money.</li>
            <li>First of all the part that holds the razor is too small and it constantly falls off, the light is below the mirror just shines up into your eyes, and it is NOT fogless.  </li>
            <li>When you turn it on, it shines directly into your eyes.</li>
            <li>But the place where you would hang your razors, is very flimsy, and is not universal.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m back in the market for a new shower mirror.</li>
            <li>The light&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s functional if you get really close to the mirror.   </li>
            <li>I bought this exact item from another website, but I want to protect other buyers from wasting their money so I am posting this review.    </li>
            <li>That&#x27;ll keep it clear long enough to shave.</li>
            <li>, plastic razor holders are asking to be broken and my razors got easily knocked off repeatedly.  </li>

            <li> , plastic razor holders are asking to be broken and my razors got easily knocked off repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> Have had this mirror for a few years now  Fogless for a few months, but a quick &#x27;pro-tip&#x27; fill your mouth with water and spray it on the mirror.</li>
            <li> The three suckers at the back don&#x27;t stay on our wall, which has the old smaller square tile, hence grout lines are unavoidable.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the hooks for the razor are not very stable.</li>
            <li> After a few days the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; quality started to go and soon it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> To keep me from taking long showers.</li>
            <li> only suction about half the time.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only had it for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> Fogs regularly but a little water does the trick.</li>
            <li> The light is placed in an awkward position.</li>
            <li> and it is really not a hook</li>
            <li> The mirror was as expected.</li>
            <li> But the digital clock never worked (I thought I&#x27;d give it a few days to kick in</li>
            <li> ordered this item in picture not what I got , got a round mirror ,looks like a cheaper one did not send it back not worth the shipping cost to do it</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to be a fogless mirror and it still fogs up just like any other mirror.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I should have read the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line: Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Product is definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the \\&quot;Z&#x27; Fogless Lighted Mirror\\&quot; really knocked my trust.  </li>
            <li> This is not a fog less mirror.</li>
            <li> The fog less part never worked always had to keep wiping it with isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> Wish I could put less than one star.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> It wastes five minutes of battery time until it automatically turns off.  </li>
            <li> I love to review products, but I hate to give a product a poor review.  </li>
            <li> No more razor cuts and or chaffing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the clock finally went out</li>
            <li> Also one thing you have to be careful about is sometimes the mirror will fall off the wall randomly.</li>
            <li> The auto shut off light is very annoying because you can&#x27;t turn it off if you want to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for a bit over a month now and find it seriously lacking.  </li>
            <li> but in my opinion it&#x27;s a poor choice of product.</li>
            <li> And the mirror itself is of poor quality.</li>
            <li> Poorly made product.</li>
            <li> We were very disappointed in the overall quality.</li>
            <li> It is completely useless now because it fogs up immediately after I turn the water on.</li>
            <li> Had one just like it for years before it got CLR cleaner in it and it failed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was almost a month before I got around to checking it out</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I am terribly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the quality.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Gave this mirror to my husband as a Christmas gift last year.  The mirror fogs, the light never worked even after changing the battery.  We were very disappointed in the overall quality.</li>
            <li> Yes - this is a nice product.  I got one for my husband and one for my son.  They both love the idea of being able to shave right in the shower and not at the sink.  The only thing is that the hooks for the razor are not very stable. The razor just lays on there and it is really not a hook so they fall off very easily.  Overall they love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact item from another website, but I want to protect other buyers from wasting their money so I am posting this review.    It worked great for about a week. After a few days the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; quality started to go and soon it was completely gone. It is completely useless now because it fogs up immediately after I turn the water on. The moist towelette that came with it, did not work very well. It was supposed to restore the fogless quality but it didn&#x27;t really work.    Also one thing you have to be careful about is sometimes the mirror will fall off the wall randomly. It happened twice already, both times when I wasn&#x27;t home. If it happens a couple more times it will probably break completely.    So it is basicly a clock, but thats OK because thats all I really bought it for. To keep me from taking long showers. I will probably buy a bottle of the fogless liquid, but that sucks because then they will be getting more of my money.</li>
            <li> Had one just like it for years before it got CLR cleaner in it and it failed. The clock is a great feature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only fogless until you turn on the hot water.</li>
            <li> The mirror was as expected. It is not the best quality but it serves the purpose that it was intended for which is shaving in the shower. The one issue I have is it does not stick to the tile or wall for any length of time so I have to press on it each time I see it start to move. I only put it on the shower wall when I need to use it.</li>
            <li> Product is as described.</li>
            <li> Received this $35.00 item. Was surprised that I had to get a flashlight to see if the light was on. Small size although I was aware of that before I ordered and to top it off the clock/calender didn&#x27;t work. Unfortunately it was almost a month before I got around to checking it out and then I took it to the shower before testing anything. Oh well my fault but in my opinion it&#x27;s a poor choice of product. The bright side is that Amazon and shipping were fine.</li>
            <li> Handy mirror with bright lighting allowing me to see well in the shower when shaving</li>
            <li> I have never seen suction cup mounting work properly, but this promised three mounting methods.  They lied, you have the option of suction cups or hanging it from the shower head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even going to try, just going to return it.  If they are lying about this, they are probably lying about the fogless too.</li>
            <li> We need to clean ours like every other day to keep it &amp;#34;fog less&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is not a fog less mirror. It fogged first use and it wasn&#x27;t even a hot shower. But the light works</li>
            <li> Anti-fog doesn&#x27;t last. Clock quit working after a couple weeks.  It is not as well made as it is advertised to be.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he loved it, until it fell off the wall too many times to count, and that was tolerable. However, the mirror is no longer clear and has some bubbling look to it. We&#x27;ve only had it for a little over a year. Bottom line: Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made,  and fogs up almost instantly</li>
            <li> make sure you get a squeegee for this I recommend https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NVA5HM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_36 worrks great fit</li>
            <li> Eh... the light is a nice feature, but after 1 week, the tiny clock display as already broken. Despite that, being fogless is an overstatement. I find myself constantly splashing water on the mirror to get rid of the fog. The only thing that seems to help is to smear conditioner over the mirror, then rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Fogless?  Ha.  Also, the &amp;#34;suction&amp;#34; cups on the back only suction about half the time.  The rest of the time I find it laying in the bottom of the shower.  Waste of time.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. The light start malfunctioning, I turned it on and it never turned off. The fog less part never worked always had to keep wiping it with isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> This mirror remained fogless for two weeks. Now, there is no amount of cleaner (which I also bought from Zadro) will keep this thing from getting cloudy. However, the light is quite convenient.</li>
            <li> First of all the part that holds the razor is too small and it constantly falls off, the light is below the mirror just shines up into your eyes, and it is NOT fogless.  Wished I hadn&#x27;t tossed the packaging I would so I could return it.  Bought 2 never opened 1 so it going back.</li>
            <li> The three suckers at the back don&#x27;t stay on our wall, which has the old smaller square tile, hence grout lines are unavoidable. This would probably stick better on a wall with the contemporary large square tile. Also, the mirror produces a warped image. I kept telling my husband to let me return it for him, but he said he would just make do. The lighting is pretty cool though.</li>
            <li> Good for a light and a shave.  As advertised. I don&#x27;t care about the clock or it holding my razors. It is a mirror with a light and it doesn&#x27;t fog.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the quality. For the price I paid I expected more. All plastic even the mirror. The light is the only good thing about this product. Overall I would pay around$ 9.99 -$12.00 not almost $30.00</li>
            <li> It fogs up, the light only blinds you and you can&#x27;t turn it off because it&#x27;s on a timer. And the mirror itself is of poor quality.</li>
            <li> This is great! No more razor cuts and or chaffing.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product! I would definitely &amp; highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Didtn&#x27;t work on arrival.  Fell off the wall daily.  &amp;#34;Fogless&amp;#34; is purely a fantasy-even brand new.</li>
            <li> Have had this mirror for a few years now  Fogless for a few months, but a quick &#x27;pro-tip&#x27; fill your mouth with water and spray it on the mirror. That&#x27;ll keep it clear long enough to shave. (Human saliva &#x3D; amazing fog-proof solution)  The light&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s functional if you get really close to the mirror.   The clock&#x27;s a decent feature.  The two razor holders need to be redesigned. You&#x27;ll spend a lot of time picking your razors off the ground.   Overall, for what it is ... not worth $35 (If I were to estimate the fair market value, it might be worth $10-$15)  With that said, I&#x27;ve had it and used it for quite a while now. Too cheap/lazy to replace it. Unfortunately, the clock finally went out so I&#x27;m back in the market for a new shower mirror.</li>
            <li> ordered this item in picture not what I got , got a round mirror ,looks like a cheaper one did not send it back not worth the shipping cost to do it</li>
            <li> It is funny that a fogless mirror made for the shower foods up every time. Made of cheap plastic, poorly designed, one area on the mirror doesn&#x27;t attempt to be fogless while the rest will fog after a couple minutes. Way too expensive for what you get. Wish I could put less than one star. I would like to say you get what you pay for but in truth I paid waaay too much and should have gotten so much better quality. This um is worth maybe $2.00.</li>
            <li> Light function broken. I had a previous one that worked great. Will look for a different brand.</li>
            <li> Not the best, but ok.</li>
            <li> Great mirror but the holders for the razors don&#x27;t work.  We have 5 different razors here to try and none of them fit the holders.</li>
            <li> The hangers for the razors do not handle some of the newer five blade systems.  Do not like the mounting with the rubber squeegee included.  If you want to mount with tape or glue you have to figure that out on your own.  Light glares up into your eyes rather than on the mirror.</li>
            <li> Great buy I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> The shower mirror was a Christmas gift for my husband.  It arrived on time and was packaged appropriately.  The mirror itself works well and is used daily.</li>
            <li> The light this put off was comparable to shaving in the dark. I returned it. I came with the original price tag from another store and I paid more than the sticker price!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed, the picture looks better then the actual product. I put batteries in the light works but I couldn&#x27;t get the clock to work. Disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The mirror isn&#x27;t real glass, which works for this porduct, since it falls off tile all the time. The light is placed in an awkward position. When you turn it on, it shines directly into your eyes. Contrary to what the product claims, it does fog up. It runs off AAA batteries, so water isn&#x27;t good for it. This is not well made for a shower. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everything about this mirror was great until a couple months of use. Now, I can&#x27;t see the clock. Perhaps water got into the clock area. It has fallen off the glass shower wall and the mirror remains fogged up. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews or respond to surveys, but feel in this instance I must break my own rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for a bit over a month now and find it seriously lacking.  First, the mirror is NOT fogless and furthermore somewhat distorts your image when shaving.  Second, the mirror is NOT waterproof.  While the LED works fairly well, the small clock gets waterlogged and quits working in about two days. The razor holders may hold an old fashion safety razor or injector razor, but they certainly will not hold a modern cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this was a $40.00 mistake.  I&#x27;m truly surprised the Amazon would offer such a crummy, cheap product.  I just checked and there are 6 of these mirrors left.  Make sure that there are always that many left.  Product is definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to be a fogless mirror and it still fogs up just like any other mirror.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t of bought this item.  The auto shut off light is very annoying because you can&#x27;t turn it off if you want to.  Poorly made product.</li>
            <li> Mirror looks great. But the place where you would hang your razors, is very flimsy, and is not universal. My razor will not hang on there. Looks nice, just not practical with out somewhere to hang my razor.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first several months, but slowly starting to fog up. Fogs regularly but a little water does the trick. Great while it lasted. Other issue is that the clock does not keep good time.</li>
            <li> fogs immediately upon turning on the hot water. I have no idea why they claim it&#x27;s fogless to any degree at all. You have to keep splashing water on it the entire time of use.</li>
            <li> I love to review products, but I hate to give a product a poor review.  It&#x27;s a company&#x27;s revenue.  Unfortunately, the \\&quot;Z&#x27; Fogless Lighted Mirror\\&quot; really knocked my trust.  Having said that, I should have read the other reviews.  The mirror itself does stay fairly fogless during the extent of the shower and the three suction cups held true for the three days that I had this up.  However, not all was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two very flimsy, plastic razor holders are asking to be broken and my razors got easily knocked off repeatedly.  So, no big deal yet.  But the digital clock never worked (I thought I&#x27;d give it a few days to kick in - I like to be positive).  So I cannot even mention if the MODE or SET buttons work.  The most &#x60;glaring&#x27; error here is the light.  It runs on three (AAA) batteries that are not included.  C&#x27;mon, for this price?  But the light does not turn off!  It wastes five minutes of battery time until it automatically turns off.  Now, how simple an invention is an on/off switch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says, \\&quot;WINNER - The Wall Street Journal - Best Overall and Best Value\\&quot;.  The box also says \\&quot;Replaceable Fog-Free Mirror\\&quot;.  That is exactly what I am going to do.  Replace the whole darn thing.  Sorry, I am terribly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased at Best Buy.</li>
