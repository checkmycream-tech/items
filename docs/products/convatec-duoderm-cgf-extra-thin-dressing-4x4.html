            <li> its ok  not as good as duoderm cgf (signal)  not water repellant. actuallythis product is not what I thought I was ordering. This one looks like older packaging and is called convatech duoderm cgf.  Not like duoderm cgf signal.</li>
            <li> I like the product, it holds up well for what i need. The drainage does sneak out some in my situation.</li>

            <li> Will work find but if you use them under a leg socking it will roll up because this product is thicker then what the doc will use</li>
            <li> This a great product. I would recomend it to everyone who has an ulcer that will not heal, and the prise is very good.</li>
            <li> If you know what this is and how to use them correctly ther is nothing like them.  But, be careful about the packaging and shipping!  Mine came in crushed and folded, not sterile</li>
            <li> good price.  received as promised</li>
            <li> Takes pressure off wart on bottom of foot - works great</li>

            <li> they should pit thickness as well.  this was too thick for face.</li>
            <li> Thick enough to cushion bedsores.</li>
            <li> I got these for a family member. It is exactly the same product we got from  the local pharmacy but at a much better price.</li>
            <li> It is working great. It is very absorbent and is helping to with the healing of wound.</li>
            <li> excellent wound coverage</li>
            <li> It does help heal a wound,  but the problem reoccurs and may need to be used from time to time.</li>
            <li> This product is one I am familiar with and worked as I expected. It has helped prevent skin breakdown in sacral area and has helped heal early breakdown in a family member.</li>
