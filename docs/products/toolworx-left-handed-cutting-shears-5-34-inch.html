            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to find shears for a lefty, (which I proudly am).  </li>
            <li>These were a great buy and cut my husband&#x27;s hair just fine.</li>

            <li>Pleased with the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use them comfortably without taking out the trim rings.</li>
            <li>You can easily pull them out if you have fat fingers.  </li>
            <li>They do not look or feel like pro-level shears, but for home use, they work just fine.</li>
            <li>These are a great middle ground, no so inexpensive that they are made cheaply.</li>
            <li>Comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li>The shear tips are pointy, so care around the eyes is important.</li>
            <li>They are built well and cut nice and clean with no need to adjust so far.</li>

            <li>I am left handed and they fit great in my hand (especially compared to the right hand ones that I was using before).</li>
            <li>t o say that she said they were very nice, the same pair that her sister owned, who IS a professional stylist.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and for the money you cannot beat the scissors I say Buy them while you can.</li>

            <li>Overall better quality than I was expecting.</li>

            <li>They are extremely sharp and cut hair nicely.</li>
            <li>:love it, It&#x27;s hard to find the lefty handed shear at this price and such a good quality.  </li>
            <li>As a man with large hands</li>
            <li>Excellent cutting edge, well balanced and not cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>The tips are not made to cut very close to the ends like some shears and this can be a disadvantage with close trimming.  </li>
            <li>the went to open and close the they where smooth till they got to the end and the stopped</li>
            <li>Easily tightened if they become loose.</li>
            <li>got here on time-but a great pair of scissors-made extremely well -very sharp- showed them to my stylist-</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is not worth spending more money on a pair of scissors unless you are a professional.</li>
            <li>Definitely not professional grade but work well for those that want a scissor for quick trims at home.  </li>
            <li>He has thick, curly hair and the scissors are sharp enough to give him a good and precise cut.</li>

            <li> He has thick, curly hair and the scissors are sharp enough to give him a good and precise cut.</li>
            <li> Razor sharp and smooth cutting action makes these professional shears.</li>

            <li> Sharp and solid build.  </li>

            <li> Very sharp hoping it holds an edge.</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and have maintained their edge over the past year or so of use.</li>
            <li> On the other hand they are not so expensive that they are unaffordable or that the increase in price is not worth the difference in performance.</li>

            <li> Good product use just a few times now and they work great thank you for a quality product like this</li>
            <li> Contrary to a few reviews I read prior to purchasing these scissors, they \\&quot;ARE\\&quot; left handed scissors.  Sharp and solid build.  They come with plastic finger sizing inserts.  You can easily pull them out if you have fat fingers.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price of these scissors.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and for the money you cannot beat the scissors I say Buy them while you can.</li>

            <li> These scissors are worth the money. I did a lot of research before purchasing them and am pleased with the product. They are extremely sharp and cut hair nicely. They are adjustable which is convenient because cheaper ones that are not adjustable, or at least easily adjustable, often fail to cut hair because the blades are too far apart. I am left handed and they fit great in my hand (especially compared to the right hand ones that I was using before). In my opinion it is not worth spending more money on a pair of scissors unless you are a professional. These are a great middle ground, no so inexpensive that they are made cheaply. On the other hand they are not so expensive that they are unaffordable or that the increase in price is not worth the difference in performance.</li>
            <li> I received these but they are not the offset as pictured. They were unable to replace with correct ones so I have to assume they do not carry the offset shears.</li>
            <li> I am a barber and I own a barber school and one of the guys i am teaching is left handed i order these shears for him and when i opened them up they looked great. the went to open and close the they where smooth till they got to the end and the stopped and they was not all the way closed yet the tips are bent in</li>
            <li> They are perfect! I use them to trim show dogs&#x27; paws and ears - not one problem with them!</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair - she&#x27;s a lefty. These scissors are sharp and have maintained their edge over the past year or so of use. They do not look or feel like pro-level shears, but for home use, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an amateur hairstylist and didn&#x27;t want to spend big bucks on hair scissors. These were a great buy and cut my husband&#x27;s hair just fine. He has thick, curly hair and the scissors are sharp enough to give him a good and precise cut.</li>
            <li> Overall better quality than I was expecting. Didn&#x27;t make my wife a better barber though. Very sharp tip, be careful.</li>
            <li> They were bought to trim my kids hair on occasion. Bangs, etc. They are built well and cut nice and clean with no need to adjust so far. I wish they came with a case but for the price, I&#x27;ll improvise. The shear tips are pointy, so care around the eyes is important. As a man with large hands I&#x27;ve been able to use them comfortably without taking out the trim rings. But keep in mind I&#x27;m not doing full hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I bought this prodcut for my girlfriend who is left handed, so that she could cut my hair.  I have no way to personally review this product except t o say that she said they were very nice, the same pair that her sister owned, who IS a professional stylist.  She mentioned they were very nice and comfortable, and the tightening screw allows for exacting sharpness.  I give 4 of 5 stars only because I will never really be using them on anyone else myself. Pleased with the product</li>
