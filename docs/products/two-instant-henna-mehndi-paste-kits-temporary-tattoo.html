    <ol>
            <li>But all together a wonderful product and it is one I will continually use.</li>
            <li>There is also a very  good amount of henna.</li>
            <li>Prompt shipping, great volume for price.</li>
            <li>This product is great for a beginner henna user to introduce them to the process of using henna.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The applicator nozzles are good but lines can appear blob-y.</li>
            <li>artisticadornment.com is a great place to find pre-made henna cones and paste if you don&#x27;t want to mix your own.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to get started doing your own henna.</li>
            <li>I bought the henna paste and have relatively good results.</li>
            <li>I tried it out on paper to see if I liked the look of henna</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have to mix my own paste.</li>
            <li>It stains your skin nicely and keeps for about 1-1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li>just wish that somehow you could attach your own tips on b/c</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s a ton of it, which is nice in case of mistakes.</li>
            <li>A nice consistency and color.</li>
            <li>But this henna shipped amazingly fast,and when I tried it out, I was really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>some of them did great, and others just blobbed the paste all over, but they had fun.</li>
            <li>I love the applicator tips and that it is premixed as opposed to the powdered kind.  </li>
            <li>For a first time, just playing around with it product, this was great.</li>
            <li>Also comes with a LOT more paste than one would expect.</li>
            <li>The Shelly brand henna is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I purchased this henna product with the intention of using it to see what henna was like and if it was something I&#x27;d enjoy using more often.</li>
            <li>Mixing your own is the most efficient way, and also the safest, since you will know what exactly you are putting on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is more financially conservative and also effective to buy henna powder and find a recipe to mix your own online.</li>
            <li>The texture is great and the paste is easy to use, but it doesn&#x27;t dye the skin at all even when it was left on overnight.</li>
            <li>This product is fun and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Works easily with the right tool.</li>
            <li>i love this ready to use henna paste.</li>
            <li>If you are only wanting to dabble, however, this is a good first purchase for hobbiers.</li>
            <li>they did use if and had alot of fun with it.</li>
            <li>The smallest of the applicators is still too big for much detailed work, but the color came out just fine.</li>
            <li>Best if left on skin for a few hours.</li>
            <li>They can fade relatively quickly if you bath too much.</li>
            <li>very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;i purchased a soft squeeze bottle with changeable tips that worked much better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought from this seller before, BUT I&#x27;ve used this is exact brand and product before</li>
            <li>This is the first henna product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I was able to make another one 7 or so days later when the first one came off.  </li>
            <li>All in all I&#x27;d really recommend this to anyone who likes to use henna for some fun.</li>
            <li>it came earlier than expected and of course i was happy about that.</li>
            <li>Works in only and hour, and has easy applicator tips.</li>
            <li>It also left a really great stain after it dried.</li>
            <li>Works real well with the henna oil.</li>
            <li>it is much lighter.</li>
            <li>so it is kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li>The henna wasn&#x27;t too watery and it wasn&#x27;t too thick, just the right consistency for nice patterns.</li>
            <li>It is a unique teen activity.</li>
            <li>At this decent price, give it a try</li>
            <li>I used this with a group of older kids...</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I played with it lol.</li>
            <li>A few tips they shared on how to tell if the paste you are using is organic and safe to use are:check for manufacture date, check for ingredients, and check for expiration dates.</li>
            <li>I would catagorize myself as a &#x27;beginner&#x27; mehndi artist, so using this paste is simple and economical.</li>
            <li>The one reason I gave this a four star instead of five is because when mine arrived it had a small hole twords the top where some Jenna leaked out.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I think I left it on about an hour.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pre-mixed and the tube it comes in goes a long way and is super simple to use.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, if you&#x27;re interested in any type of henna tattoo product that is premixed, purchase it from a reputable dealer that makes it themselves and packages it themselves.</li>
            <li>The two containers go a very long way, I done about 8 different tattoos, and I am still on the first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The colors came out very dark and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>After I purchased the product online, I was watching several YouTube videos by various well-established henna artists who said that many of these pre-mixed henna pastes contain harmful chemicals and dyes that can cause serious injury and scarring in some cases.</li>
            <li>Henna does not get very dark without some assistance from special techniques such as the application of lemon sugar paste or extra heat.</li>
            <li>and I actually don&#x27;t really want to try any other brand, just because it worked so well.</li>
            <li>The tips that it comes with get a little cloggeda times, but they still work very well.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used only half of one tube so far and have done several arms/hands already.</li>
            <li> Many of these dealers work out of their homes and depend on this business to keep them alive, so they will not sell you bad products.</li>
            <li> I had mine for a long time, and it lasted so long</li>
            <li> Lucky for me the hole wa small and jut a small amount of dry henna plugged it up</li>
            <li> The amount of henna paste can go a LONG way!</li>
            <li> I did some research and found that once henna is made into a paste it has a limited shelf life and looses it&#x27;s potency.  </li>
            <li> here&#x27;s one of the many designs I did on my friend&#x27;s back:  [...]</li>
            <li> If you leave it on for 6-12 hours and use a cotton ball to apply oil every hour or so, it&#x27;ll turn dark over the next 24-48 hours and stay on for at LEAST a week.</li>
            <li> The product barely leaves a stain on skin even though I left it on for hours, it looks like I drew on my skin with a faint orange marker.</li>
            <li> But after two attempts, I had no success.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a little hesitant buying pre-mixed henna online because I&#x27;ve done it in the past with not much luck.</li>
            <li> The metal tubes sometime cause it to continuously come out, causing a little waste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it actually dried up before I ran out!   </li>
            <li> Not sure where to buy them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried leaving the weak stuff on for hours and eventually it left a faint design</li>
            <li> not real happy with this henna product...it barely left a very faint stain if any</li>
            <li> the only bad thing i can say is that the tips are</li>
            <li> the only thing that was a teensy bit annoying was when i punctured the seal on one of the tubes, some of the henna gushed out</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My dog chewed up the packaging to this because I left it on the floor. She didn&#x27;t eat the Henna though, which may I say works quite well. Prompt shipping, great volume for price.</li>
            <li> This product is fun and easy to use.  My daughter enjoys creating temporary art on herself and her friends.  It is a unique teen activity.</li>
            <li> This product is great for a beginner henna user to introduce them to the process of using henna. The applicator nozzles are good but lines can appear blob-y. Henna does not get very dark without some assistance from special techniques such as the application of lemon sugar paste or extra heat. The amount of henna paste can go a LONG way! I did my hands several times, and still have some of that tube left.    It is more financially conservative and also effective to buy henna powder and find a recipe to mix your own online. If you are only wanting to dabble, however, this is a good first purchase for hobbiers.</li>
            <li> not real happy with this henna product...it barely left a very faint stain if any and it was left on for hours...like it&#x27;s lost it&#x27;s potency or something...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought from this seller before, BUT I&#x27;ve used this is exact brand and product before and it&#x27;s great. You have to follow the directions though.   If you leave it on for 6-12 hours and use a cotton ball to apply oil every hour or so, it&#x27;ll turn dark over the next 24-48 hours and stay on for at LEAST a week. It&#x27;s pre-mixed and the tube it comes in goes a long way and is super simple to use. I had mine for a long time, and it lasted so long it actually dried up before I ran out!   This is the first henna product I&#x27;ve used and I actually don&#x27;t really want to try any other brand, just because it worked so well.</li>
            <li> The texture is great and the paste is easy to use, but it doesn&#x27;t dye the skin at all even when it was left on overnight. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> The product barely leaves a stain on skin even though I left it on for hours, it looks like I drew on my skin with a faint orange marker. It also flakes off as it drys.</li>
            <li> I purchased this henna product with the intention of using it to see what henna was like and if it was something I&#x27;d enjoy using more often. After I purchased the product online, I was watching several YouTube videos by various well-established henna artists who said that many of these pre-mixed henna pastes contain harmful chemicals and dyes that can cause serious injury and scarring in some cases. A few tips they shared on how to tell if the paste you are using is organic and safe to use are:check for manufacture date, check for ingredients, and check for expiration dates. I did not use this product on my skin because I did not see any type of ingredient list on the packaging or the product itself. I tried it out on paper to see if I liked the look of henna and I&#x27;m waiting for results. Needless to say, if you&#x27;re interested in any type of henna tattoo product that is premixed, purchase it from a reputable dealer that makes it themselves and packages it themselves.

            <li> This is a great way to get started doing your own henna. The tips that it comes with get a little cloggeda times, but they still work very well. It&#x27;s nice to not have to mix my own paste. Also comes with a LOT more paste than one would expect. I&#x27;ve used only half of one tube so far and have done several arms/hands already. At this decent price, give it a try</li>
            <li> The Shelly brand henna is pretty good. About 7-10 days of henna. Works in only and hour, and has easy applicator tips. The one reason I gave this a four star instead of five is because when mine arrived it had a small hole twords the top where some Jenna leaked out. Lucky for me the hole wa small and jut a small amount of dry henna plugged it up so there was no problem when I applied the henna.  There is also a very  good amount of henna. I did a lot of different designs. I was able to make another one 7 or so days later when the first one came off.  here&#x27;s one of the many designs I did on my friend&#x27;s back:  [...]</li>
            <li> I would catagorize myself as a &#x27;beginner&#x27; mehndi artist, so using this paste is simple and economical. It stains your skin nicely and keeps for about 1-1/2 weeks. just wish that somehow you could attach your own tips on b/c the one they provide is a litter wider than I use. But all together a wonderful product and it is one I will continually use.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a little hesitant buying pre-mixed henna online because I&#x27;ve done it in the past with not much luck. But this henna shipped amazingly fast,and when I tried it out, I was really pleased with the results. The henna wasn&#x27;t too watery and it wasn&#x27;t too thick, just the right consistency for nice patterns. It also left a really great stain after it dried. the only thing that was a teensy bit annoying was when i punctured the seal on one of the tubes, some of the henna gushed out (it was probably under pressure so the released pressure caused that) but it wasn&#x27;t too bad. All in all I&#x27;d really recommend this to anyone who likes to use henna for some fun.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I think I left it on about an hour. My daughter woke up, so I had to take it off. It left a semi stain,but I lost the applicator tips! Not sure where to buy them. Needless to say, I played with it lol.</li>
            <li> For a first time, just playing around with it product, this was great. The smallest of the applicators is still too big for much detailed work, but the color came out just fine. And there&#x27;s a ton of it, which is nice in case of mistakes. I used this with a group of older kids...some of them did great, and others just blobbed the paste all over, but they had fun.</li>
            <li> Instead of a tattoo, I tried henna to tint the skin of my one thinning eyebrow.  But after two attempts, I had no success.  There was no tint at all.  My eyebrow has thinned before and then come back so I don&#x27;t need anything permanent.  I&#x27;ll have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I bought the henna paste and have relatively good results. Best if left on skin for a few hours. Works real well with the henna oil. [[ASIN:B000IBFXDU Beachcombers! Henna Tattoo Mehndi Myrtle Oil , 1bottle]]</li>
            <li> I have medium brown skin, but I also used this on my palms were it is much lighter. I left it on for hours and nothing. A waist of time.</li>
            <li> The colors came out very dark and it is worth the money. The two containers go a very long way, I done about 8 different tattoos, and I am still on the first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are:&lt;br /&gt;1) The metal tubes sometime cause it to continuously come out, causing a little waste.&lt;br /&gt;2) They can fade relatively quickly if you bath too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand a couple of times.  I love the applicator tips and that it is premixed as opposed to the powdered kind.  BUT I&#x27;ve found that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  I did some research and found that once henna is made into a paste it has a limited shelf life and looses it&#x27;s potency.  I have not found a seller who posts the date of when it is made which is stamped on the box.  I&#x27;ve tried leaving the weak stuff on for hours and eventually it left a faint design so it is kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i love this ready to use henna paste. it came earlier than expected and of course i was happy about that. the only bad thing i can say is that the tips are very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;i purchased a soft squeeze bottle with changeable tips that worked much better.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this and another book and the henna paste. We used it and it wiped off and didn&#x27;t stain our skin at all. So I returned both books and the paste.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teens to have a henna party with.  That never happened.  they did use if and had alot of fun with it.</li>
            <li> A nice consistency and color. Works easily with the right tool. Keeps well when left in the fridge before using.</li>
