            <li>They smell nice</li>
            <li>Everyone always wants to know what cologne I am wearing because it smells so delicious!!</li>
            <li>It is nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly my favorite of the declaration line.</li>
            <li>i love as my husband smell with this perfume</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of the best colognes I have.</li>
            <li>I love this fragance..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly my favorite of the declaration line.</li>
            <li>i will buy more of it, i love cartier , one tof the most muscluin cologne for men</li>
            <li>this is one of the most awesome colognes for men I&#x27;ve ever had, it&#x27;s fresh, masculine, mostly for young adventurous guys!!!</li>
            <li>However, the musky overtone is very nice and is a mature taste.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
            <li>It has strong notes of cardamon, which can seem overpowering at times.  </li>
            <li>We got the perfumes SO QUICKLY!</li>
            <li>Have used this fragrance for years and very aware of how it should smell - this is not it!</li>
            <li>Product was not the original.</li>
            <li>This was a special treat to myself.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery as always.</li>
            <li>I primarily bought this based off the glowing reviews, but my first impressions aren&#x27;t living up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Surely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Declaration Essence is an extremely elegant scent, but is definitely not for everyone.  </li>
            <li>First impression is that it&#x27;s spicy and reminds me of Christmas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very masculine and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>and I have positive feedback from admirers.   </li>
            <li>When you first apply it it smells almost like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>very masculine, you feel very confidence and elegant, this is not for young boys, it&#x27;s for men over 40, I really recommend it for those men who like a very decent fragance.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit different from the original Declaration for men but still has thesame basenote.</li>
            <li>My wife liked it but did not love it either.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest someone try it before they buy it.  </li>
            <li>One of the most soft smelling colognes out there, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it everyday like say a curve, only special occasions.</li>
            <li>Its the real thing, and for far cheaper than buying it in the mall if you can even find it.</li>
            <li>One coworker said it smells like Old Spice.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal for less than retail.</li>

            <li> I purchased this fragrance along with two other cartier products.  They smell nice and I have positive feedback from admirers.   Only thing is that the product I purchased in the dept stores seem to have a stronger smell and last longer than these items...oh well, could be that i&#x27;m immuned to the smell..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent, a little smokey and complex without being too pretentious. It&#x27;s certainly my favorite of the declaration line. Wow, that sounds pretentious.</li>
            <li> I think it is fake, when I use it, it makes me sick</li>
            <li> i love as my husband smell with this perfume</li>
            <li> I am from the US and I have been living in Chile for 6 months, I told my Chilean family about amazon and they were amazed when they found out amazon would ship to CHILE! We got the perfumes SO QUICKLY! It was awesome! Strongly recommend this product and the seller. xoxox</li>
            <li> Declaration Essence is an extremely elegant scent, but is definitely not for everyone.  I highly suggest someone try it before they buy it.  It has strong notes of cardamon, which can seem overpowering at times.  This scent exudes confidence and class and is perfect for a formal event where you want these attributes displayed.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal for less than retail. Macy&#x27;s sells this cologne for $100+ but found it on amazon for almost 1/2 off! I love this scent! It&#x27;s very masculine and clean smelling. Everyone always wants to know what cologne I am wearing because it smells so delicious!!</li>
            <li> Its the real thing, and for far cheaper than buying it in the mall if you can even find it.</li>
            <li> This is a pleasant smelling fragrance but not for me. I purchased a few trial sized fragrances searching for something new. It is pleasant but has a very strong cinnamon scent that I just can&#x27;t get passed. My wife liked it but did not love it either. It is nice but I will not be adding it to my collection. However, the musky overtone is very nice and is a mature taste. Try the trial size!</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for DH for xmas and he loves it. The sillage and staying power of this fragrance is long lasting. It smells a bit different from the original Declaration for men but still has thesame basenote.</li>
            <li> this is one of the most awesome colognes for men I&#x27;ve ever had, it&#x27;s fresh, masculine, mostly for young adventurous guys!!!</li>
            <li> I know this is a mans fragrance but I wear it all the time. Received it as a sample and just really loved how it smelled on me. AND I get compliments on it too. I wish Cartier would come out with a lotion as well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely one of the best colognes I have. Quick delivery as always. So happy with my order. Gonna have a great night out</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne since 2005 and have bought it in different countries.  The bottle that I received is definitely a knock-off.  When you first apply it it smells almost like the real thing.  Then it starts to deteriorate.  after 1.5 to two hours it almost does not smell.  The others that I have purchase have a morning to evening (late evening) duration.  Won&#x27;t buy from this provider again.</li>
            <li> Thank you. Good production.</li>
            <li> One of the most soft smelling colognes out there, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it everyday like say a curve, only special occasions.</li>
            <li> very good, on time, excelent product</li>
            <li> I love this fragance..very masculine, you feel very confidence and elegant, this is not for young boys, it&#x27;s for men over 40, I really recommend it for those men who like a very decent fragance.</li>
            <li> Product was not the original. I have been using this perfume for 15 years so I know</li>

            <li> It just arrived to my office and I applied one spray. First impression is that it&#x27;s spicy and reminds me of Christmas. One coworker said it smells like Old Spice. I primarily bought this based off the glowing reviews, but my first impressions aren&#x27;t living up to the hype. I&#x27;ll keep using it for a while and update if my opinion changes.</li>
