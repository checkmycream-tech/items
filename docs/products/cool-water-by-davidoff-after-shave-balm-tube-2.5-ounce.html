            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I got this in a gift set and it is great.</li>
            <li>The smell is great.</li>
            <li>Great price and delivery time.</li>
            <li>Great product, great seller</li>
            <li>Happily recommend.</li>
            <li>However, it smells great and is soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>Works good in a Gym bag with the screw on cap.</li>
            <li>Although it smells good the balm is like water and drips out of your hands.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with prompt shipping and product.</li>
            <li>GREAT FRAGRANCE, EASY APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>The smell is good but doesnt last-thats probably why the price was cheap!</li>
            <li>Nice distinguished fragrance and takes care of your skin.</li>
            <li>The fragarance is nice, but this product does not truly sooth your skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift, good price, one of my favorite scents</li>
            <li>Cool Water is a great product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, pleasant scent and is a great value--a little dab is all you need!</li>
            <li>Great price and love Cool Water.</li>
            <li>And -- the most important item -- my wife is not allergic to it!</li>
            <li>But this &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; is more like water.</li>
            <li>He could not believe he got so many ...  as he knew they are pricey....  </li>
            <li>Lots of strangers will tell you they love the way you smell and ask what you are wearing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>It was just OKay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this aftershave balm for 15 years and have always been pleased with how it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>However it is still my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It is more &amp;#34;Water&amp;#34; then Balm.  </li>
            <li>Also, the gift set balm tightens the skin much more after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very much satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>Husband and I both love the scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for decades and it draws a comment now and again from young women about it&#x27;s being pleasant without being overwhelming!  </li>
            <li>And quality is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The Cool Water after shave balm arrived promptly but it is more of a liquid than cream.</li>
            <li>If you like cool water you will love it.</li>
            <li>Cool water is one of my favorite perfume brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Order again was smooth and problem free.</li>
            <li>Just 10 drops and smooth it in; soothes away razor burn from blade or electric.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>After all, look how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>Burbury balms are far superior.</li>
            <li>A lot closer to the original formula in consistency and strength of scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Cool Water cologne, shower gel, deodorant as well as the after shave balm.  </li>
            <li>The price was more than reasonable, and I have to assume that the reason for this is that the after shave \\&quot;balm\\&quot; has the consistency of a liquid.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t even smell like cool water.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone that wants that light aftershave smell.</li>
            <li>Buy a bunch to make the shipping worth while.</li>
            <li>Use in combination with other cool water products for a refreshing light summer scent.</li>
            <li>Great scent, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very ,very runny.</li>
            <li>and you will most likely have to buy \\&quot;the set\\&quot; which includes the cologne at a higher price.</li>
            <li>Well, for a total of 20 or so dollars ... they arrived quickly and were the EXACT, REAL THING!  </li>
            <li>It is as described, but I thought it was very runny.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping, it shipped the day</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>scent, not sticky, and very affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The after shave balm was very &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; is like water, much much thinner than the one I bought in the mall.</li>
            <li>It seem very watery.</li>
            <li>The liquid looked really watery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just real runny.</li>
            <li>Nobody could complain too much.</li>
            <li>scent seems about right, but this stuff is far easier to spill and doesn&#x27;t seem to feel as much like a lotion on the face.</li>
            <li>Nice but does not last long</li>
            <li>high - balm was 2.00/each.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this balm that I originally purchased for 30.00  - same size tube - at a major department store.  </li>
            <li>The unit that I received was marked as not for individual sale and was very watery.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, the product works for me.</li>
            <li>I have  a little bit of Cool Water balm which I bought with a gift set about 3 months at a department store.  </li>
            <li>I have to be careful not to spill it out of my hand and not to squeeze too much from the tube.</li>
            <li>This is a watered down cheap imitation of a quality product.</li>
            <li>Been using Cool Water for some time, but after running out of after shave balm, I found it hard to find until I went to your website.</li>

I&#x27;ve used these for decades and it draws a comment now and again from young women about it&#x27;s being pleasant without being overwhelming!  And -- the most important item -- my wife is not allergic to it!</li>
            <li> The Cool Water after shave balm arrived promptly but it is more of a liquid than cream. All other balms i&#x27;ve ordered from other sellers have a cream style or thick consistancy. The smell is good but doesnt last-thats probably why the price was cheap! 3 stars for the smell and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> It is as described, but I thought it was very runny. Also on the tube it says not for individual resale.  That makes me wonder.</li>
            <li> Been using Cool Water for some time, but after running out of after shave balm, I found it hard to find until I went to your website. Order again was smooth and problem free.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping, it shipped the day o ordered it. But this &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; is more like water. It&#x27;s very ,very runny. It smell great, so will just finish it, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this balm that I originally purchased for 30.00  - same size tube - at a major department store.  He put it on his Christmas list, and by searching Amazon, I found it!  My daughter and I were skeptical, but what&#x27;a a few dollar gamble?  I ordered six because the shipping was high - balm was 2.00/each.  Well, for a total of 20 or so dollars ... they arrived quickly and were the EXACT, REAL THING!  He could not believe he got so many ...  as he knew they are pricey....  hope he does not read this review!  If you like after shave balm, go forthis one ... it&#x27;s soothing, nice odor - not obnoxious - and a great deal!  Buy a bunch to make the shipping worth while.</li>
            <li> Use in combination with other cool water products for a refreshing light summer scent. Lots of strangers will tell you they love the way you smell and ask what you are wearing.</li>
            <li> Nice distinguished fragrance and takes care of your skin. If you like cool water you will love it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Terrible product; it stinks!!! I have other Davidoff products that I like but this one was aweful I&#x27;d not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My husband has been using it for years.  Retail stores only sell the shaving balm in gift sets ( with cologne, soap, etc).  This is definitely a deal as I only need to purchase the shaving balm.</li>
            <li> I got this in a gift set and it is great. It soothes and doesn&#x27;t sting. The fragrance lasts most of the day. Gotta try to appreciate.</li>
            <li> Cool Water is a great product. It has a soothing smell that is relaxing and not over powering. I would recommend it to anyone that wants that light aftershave smell.</li>
            <li> It was just OKay.  It seemed a little watered down to me.  The smell is great. Works good in a Gym bag with the screw on cap.</li>
            <li> Great price and delivery time.</li>
            <li> The price was more than reasonable, and I have to assume that the reason for this is that the after shave \\&quot;balm\\&quot; has the consistency of a liquid. The fragarance is nice, but this product does not truly sooth your skin after shaving.  Burbury balms are far superior.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell the same as what we usually buy.</li>
            <li> Try buying After Shave Balm in any scent and you will most likely have to buy \\&quot;the set\\&quot; which includes the cologne at a higher price. Some men prefer just the balm and the only place I can find this is on Amazon. Thank you for supplying this and for the rapid delivery...this product arrived in record time!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this aftershave balm for 15 years and have always been pleased with how it makes my face feel. Just 10 drops and smooth it in; soothes away razor burn from blade or electric. And my wife always says, \\&quot;Mmmm! Someone smells good!\\&quot; She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, and best of all, my face is happy. I recommend it unconditionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an after shave balm that was so thin and wet. To make matters worst...it doesn&#x27;t even smell like cool water. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller</li>
            <li> the product is to &#x27;watery&#x27;,  not &#x27;creamy&#x27;  like a BALM  should be, and to oily. And alos has a sticky feel,</li>
            <li> The unit that I received was marked as not for individual sale and was very watery. The consistency is not at all the same others that I have bought before and has diluted smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;The seller should feel ashamed of cheating people out of their money. I will be contacting Amazon soon for a refund and if nothing works out, I will have to talk to the credit card company.</li>
            <li> Cool water is one of my favorite perfume brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good scent, not sticky, and very affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It was a gift, good price, one of my favorite scents</li>
            <li> The after shave balm was very &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;.  The fragrance didn&#x27;t last very long.  However it is still my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a knock-off. Do not buy it. Very thin, watery and does not smell like the real thing. Go to the dept store instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this one after buying a gift set from a store in the mall. This one is very different from the one I bought in the mall. The packaging is different: all black with some different fonts on the package. The &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; is like water, much much thinner than the one I bought in the mall. The small is different. The scent does not last as long on my skin as the one I bought in mall. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It is more &amp;#34;Water&amp;#34; then Balm.  Very runny and poor fragrance.  It was a mistake purchasing the product.</li>
            <li> Nice but does not last long</li>
            <li> Great price and love Cool Water.</li>
            <li> Great scent, not overwhelming. My only aftershave application. I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> GREAT FRAGRANCE, EASY APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap. But after having used it, I think this was expired one, because the smell of the balm is not fragrant like what I had used last month. But there is not any skin trouble so far. I hope so in future too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am updating my review. There was not any skin trouble directly from this balm so far since I began to use it. And quality is pretty good. I could not feel any more weird smell from this, maybe my nose has adopted its strange smell.</li>
            <li> I got this for my grandson. He has just starting shaving and loves the smell.</li>
            <li> I have  a little bit of Cool Water balm which I bought with a gift set about 3 months at a department store.  I compared this balm with what I received through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The scent is the same but the consistency is totally different.  The gift set balm is a lot thicker, almost like a cream, whereas the one bought online runs out of your hand if you don&#x27;t watch it.  Also, the gift set balm tightens the skin much more after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know the reason for this but except for the scent, they look like two different products.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> It seem very watery. The liquid looked really watery. I have the colonge and it smells different from this, but I have no clue how different it is suppose to smell. You do get the after shave effect from it though.</li>
            <li> Received the wrong Davidoff product. It was totally a counterfeit product. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is a watered down cheap imitation of a quality product.</li>
            <li> A lot closer to the original formula in consistency and strength of scent.  Very much satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with prompt shipping and product. Happily recommend.</li>
            <li> I only use balm aftershave and decided to try this product because of its name. I was disappointed to say the least as I expected a better product. Although it smells good the balm is like water and drips out of your hands. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say I got a knockoff, because my last tube lasted so long it&#x27;s possible they changed the formula. I just want to let people know that if your experience was with the creamy Davidoff aftershave balm that isn&#x27;t what I received. The liquid in the tubes I received were as thin as water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent seems about right, but this stuff is far easier to spill and doesn&#x27;t seem to feel as much like a lotion on the face. Who knows, thought, maybe this is just how it is sold now.</li>
            <li> Seems watered down. It&#x27;s just real runny. I have to be careful not to spill it out of my hand and not to squeeze too much from the tube.</li>
            <li> I agree that this balm does seem a bit runny. However, it smells great and is soothing to the skin. Nobody could complain too much. After all, look how cheap it is. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Husband and I both love the scent</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, the product works for me. Very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, pleasant scent and is a great value--a little dab is all you need!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the best and the price is great too!</li>
