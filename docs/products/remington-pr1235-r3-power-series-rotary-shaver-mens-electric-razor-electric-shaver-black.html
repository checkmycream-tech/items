            <li>Awesome price for a great product</li>
            <li>Very nice for price,  very happy with the shaver</li>
            <li>Thats one area that norelco might win but who cares</li>
            <li>Great starter electric razor.</li>
            <li>this item works great</li>
            <li>This is great to cut growing sideburns, bangs and around the ear trims.  </li>
            <li>It has a great price point.</li>
            <li>Great price!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The trimmer is great for trimming my beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li>Work great  </li>
            <li>price was great and it was in my hands in 4 days</li>
            <li>best description of the Remingon R3 is that it is adequate at best as an inexpensive electric razor.</li>
            <li>nice shaver!</li>
            <li>A good starter shaver.</li>
            <li>If it would run off the charge cord then I feel 4 stars would be a good rating.</li>
            <li>It is still IMO a good bargain.</li>
            <li>Good razor for the price.</li>
            <li>The shave quality from this razor is good, it leaves a close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good budget shaver.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re always on the lookout for a good deal for a razor.  </li>
            <li>but it still does a good job and at an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer is a good size and works</li>
            <li>fairly close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m finding this shaver a good match for my needs.</li>
            <li>It also has a lithium rechargeable battery which supposedly has a longer &amp;#34;power holding time&amp;#34; and it is listed as good for 30 minutes of shaving before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver also does without any fancy LCD screens telling you power remaining or time to change screens or any of that good</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>The Remington does have a good pop-up trimmer</li>
            <li>I have used good electric razors and this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>Good quality/</li>
            <li>It turns out to be one of most surprisingly great impulse buys of my life.  </li>
            <li>Scottish ancestors would be so proud. :)</li>
            <li>Nicely priced shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, when done, it did a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For $50, it&#x27;s a good price for an entry-level e-razor, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will give you a good clean shave with one pass, this is NOT it.  </li>
            <li>There are better razors out there, for considerably more money, but this one does the job at a good price.</li>
            <li>I like how this shaves, nice cut, I think better than norelco&#x27;s twice  the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did leave my face feeling very smooth, and it was a good clean</li>
            <li>It takes me about a minute to shave in the morning, does a GREAT job, and is really convenient.</li>
            <li>light and efficient!</li>
            <li>, it seems flimsy to me and when it wears out I&#x27;ll upgrade to a better model.</li>
            <li>Remington&#x27;s R3 works, but there are better electric razors out there.  </li>
            <li>The box claims a powerflex 360 allowing 33% more pivot in the head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great value for sure.</li>
            <li>Nice comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>/&gt;He has owned many electric razors</li>
            <li>Detail Trimmer is in a more strategic place then on most shavers.</li>
            <li>He still prefers the closer shave of a non-electric razor, but he was totally satisfied with this products.</li>
            <li>I got an &#x27;okay&#x27; shave</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>you are on a budget, this will do the job; I suggest you save $5-$10 more and get a slightly better model though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to get into why razors are better than electric.</li>
            <li>This razor is okay but could be much better.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, does a nice close shave, and is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it gave me a good shave -- not quite as close as the Panasonic, but then that costs more than four times the price of this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it felt very smooth and comfortable on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice useful product.</li>
            <li>He also said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s just a razor&amp;#34; â€” so no feature stood out as especially spectacular to him when compared to other electric razor&#x27;s that he&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good razor for the nice low price.</li>
            <li>The shavers always work fine</li>
            <li>Its light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works well on fine whiskers&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pull&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive</li>
            <li>Very handy for quick clean-ups as well as complete jobs.  </li>
            <li>I think if you need a cheap working shaver then this will do.</li>
            <li>my husband owns and when holding it in the palm of your hand there is the lack of a &amp;#34;gripper&amp;#34; that helps you keep a secure hold on it.  </li>
            <li>This gives a fairly comfortable shave too.</li>
            <li>Cheap and durable electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I have used rotary shavers for 20 plus years and Remington is by far superior to the Norelco product.</li>
            <li>Judging from the 16-hour charge time required, I am assuming this Remington uses good old ni-cads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good..</li>
            <li>The heads move to the contours of your face and therefor give you a smooth clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Using a variety of disposable blades, I can get a clean, close shave without issue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Panasonic is easier to clean because it&#x27;s a wet/dry.</li>
            <li>Not for the full bearded man.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be washed, for example, and it takes 16 hours for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good low priced razor.  </li>
            <li>Overall for the price it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Remington makes good products that last.</li>
            <li>The way the three shaving heads flex does a good job of following the contours of my face.</li>
            <li>That provides a slightly better shaving experience on any convex areas, but concave areas?  </li>
            <li>Nice complete kit.</li>
            <li>Usually that&#x27;s somewhere in the intersection of good price and effective shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad choice for a freshman going off to college, or to throw into luggage as a travel shaver.</li>
            <li>Does a quick close shave.</li>
            <li>I got this to use for a quick shave when not using my Gillette razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>but I found this electric razor to be quite adequate.  </li>
            <li>At first it felt somewhat light...</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a pop up sideburn trimmer that flips up easily and works very well.</li>
            <li>The pivoting heads do a pretty good job of following the contours and shaving closely.</li>
            <li>When I recently misplaced the battery charger for my beloved Panasonic ES-LA63 four-blade foil-screen shaver, I needed a cheap shaver to tide me over until I could replace the Panasonic&#x27;s charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yet so we can&#x27;t speak to how well this would work on &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; beards, but he is satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>This is not a very expensive razor but it offers a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, I tackled a two day growth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice and lightweight, but still not up to par with other Remington models I&#x27;ve been familiar</li>
            <li>husband has used multiple rotary razors and has become the guy who thinks you have to pay big money to get a good, accurate shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long and the charger light never shuts off or blinks to indicate a full charge, the light stays on all the time when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3 months old and going strong, I keep this one in the car for afternoon touch up,</li>
            <li>The razor is a nice weight, not too heavy and not too light.</li>
            <li>The main drawback for me is that you cannot run it under a sink to clean it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean out and his last one lasted 3 years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is essential and in cleaning this model, I found it more troublesome.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my son as his first razor.</li>
            <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last more than a couple of years at max, maybe just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, my son is pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Time will tell, as to its durability over time, especially as it relates to how many times it can be recharged before its battery runs its course.</li>
            <li>My husband says it seems to have higher RPM&#x27;s to cut faster.</li>
            <li>~ Overall, a satisfied user.</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The top of the shaver itself moves a bit, but not really enough to matter.  </li>
            <li>Even if you have to replace it a bit more frequently, it&#x27;s probably worth it to avoid having to pay nearly 300- in some cases for one of the newest &amp; fanciest brands.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve discovered that if you rinse them out and dry them out after using, they will last for many, many shaves.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like the R3, but found that it has the same problems that plague most electric razors--they&#x27;re not close-cutting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going back and forth between disposable razors and electric shavers for years, so I was more than ready to give this Remington model a try.</li>
            <li>My husbands entire shaving routine only takes about 5 minutes so the battery life is good</li>
            <li>Pretty much sums it up.  </li>
            <li>He reports that it works fine, feels comfortable, is simple enough to clean, and holds a charge for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>it projects too far from the body of the razor for true ease of use.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your face is dry before using...</li>
            <li>If what you looking for is simply a shaver that is easily disposable and inexpensive than this is one you should consider.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and is lighter than previous mocdel.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had it long enough to put it through more than the initial charging cycle yet, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for my teenage son.</li>
            <li>Very affordable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a dollar razor I bought on a trip -- disposable -- but it has worked very well since March 28 with that care --</li>
            <li>However, I cant really tell from the shave that the powerflex is an improvement.  </li>
            <li>It cuts the edges of my sideburns well, but not if I&#x27;m trying to cut them higher--the trimmer doesn&#x27;t really do well going through longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Upon opening this Remington R3 Power Shaver, my initial thought was that it&#x27;s made cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the lowest-cost shaver available at my local Harmon Discount store, so I took it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And modern rechargeable batteries, for another.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The real advantage of this shaver is its inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>it would be nice to have a charge stand that it mounted on to keep in in, but that is not such a big deal.</li>
            <li>razor has a very cheap feel to it, the \\&quot;so called\\&quot; floating heads are just pivots, the shave heads do not move other than the pivot points in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is not very expensive at $30 as of the time of this review, but you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Thus I will stay away from &amp;#34;real close&amp;#34; and simply finish off the tight edge around the goatee with a safety razor, to get up close and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is also very light weight and comfortable in hand, so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long they will work fine, but for the money you can get a decent shaver.</li>
            <li>The 16 hour charge time is a bit much, but the shaver works well enough for him to toss in his work bag for a quick touch up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I was recently given a $100 plus Norelco for my birthday  hoping for better but nothing ever seems to beat the low cost Remington.</li>
            <li>For a low-end model in the product line, it seems to do a decent job.</li>
            <li>It should not be your main</li>
            <li>The more expensive the better.</li>
            <li>Not comparable to a blade by any means, but decent for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you can buy a new Remington that shaves better every year for less than Norelco replacement  blades.</li>
            <li>He was incredibly impressed by the general quality, hand feel, and close cutting.</li>
            <li>but it is not as smooth and painless as other electric razors I have used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>His face has no more prickly hairs and is now very smooth.</li>
            <li>am giving it the full 5 stars because this one shaves just as well, but the battery lasts 3-4x as long as the old one did even when new</li>
            <li>when shopping for this type of shaver look to see that the cutting disks have all slots the more rows the better.</li>
            <li>The unit feels cheaply made and after a good long 5 minutes of shaving with very poor results I switched to a razor and finished in seconds.</li>
            <li>I have used other rotary shavers so am familiar with the way the work</li>
            <li>, i don&#x27;t think any modifications would make this shaver any better or worse - as long as they keep the cost of operation down, this is a good product to get.</li>
            <li>This shaver instead of having a 110 volt go into it directly has a little transformer and puts 4 volts into it and it charges the battery which is very fine especially at this price</li>
            <li>charging time&lt;br /&gt;Feels a little cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a clear plastic cutaway of the R3 itself that measures 6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Pulls and scrapes.. not a smooth comfortable shaver</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about any electric razor is the skin burn afterwards, but I don&#x27;t use it too often...great for emergencies or when you don&#x27;t have much time...</li>
            <li>absolutely a bargain at the price I paid (it was a Daily Deal).</li>
            <li>the on-off switch can be used with one hand, the old one required 2 hands.</li>
            <li>It it nothing like my old Philips Norelco, but that one was about $60.</li>
            <li>You have to charge it for at least 3 hours before you will be able to use it again.</li>
            <li>It seems Remington could have saved a lot in packaging materials, because the box really is too big for the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t verify that it takes the actual 16 hours, since it stays on the charger much longer than that.  </li>
            <li>His old one did not have the capability to hug his chin.</li>
            <li>My fourteen year old son is beginning to shave, so I decided to test this shaver on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this is the first rotary which I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery lasts about 30 minutes, so at night this gets plugged into an outlet so it will be ready for the next day.</li>
            <li>The shaver isn&#x27;t  heavy to hold and it fits comfortably in your hand while you use it.</li>
            <li>This baby reminds me of my old Norelco triple header.  </li>
            <li>This one is easier than my old Norelco models, but there&#x27;s still improvement that could be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>The shaver did a good, comfortable job on my difficult beard -- the hairs grow in several different directions, are pretty stiff, and my skin is quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>Does okay for soft beard, but no good for stiffer hair.</li>
            <li>At first blush, it look like it might be, but it is similar to a low stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it will give me a decent shave</li>
            <li>This makes cleaning a bit more bothersome and consequently it gets cleaned less frequently than other razors</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected and needed for my shaving routine.</li>
            <li>inner plastic housing looks a bit flimsy and it&#x27;s hard to be sure about the longevity potential.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The estimated half hour of operation on a charge is probably good enough to last through a few days of travel, so leaving the charger at home is an option.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to, if your beard is a bit on the long side I recommend using the trimmer that is on the back first to shorten your beard, otherwise the shaver will pull your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace the nearly identical model (same model number)</li>
            <li>this product doesn&#x27;t work any better or any worse.</li>
            <li>I have pretty stiff whiskers and this shaver took them down to a smooth face in just a few strokes, so it does work very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After charging the razor for the required 24 hour initial charge and turning it on for the first time, we noticed the lack of power compared to other razors.  </li>
            <li>Much lighter in weight then other razors</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I moved away from Norelco triple-heads is that they&#x27;re hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I had been using for 2-3 years upon which the blade had become dull; cheaper to get a whole new shaver than just a blade (do airlines set the pricing on razors &amp; shavers?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> this item works great</li>
            <li> This is great to cut growing sideburns, bangs and around the ear trims.  </li>
            <li> It has a great price point.</li>
            <li> Great price!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great for trimming my beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li> Work great  </li>
            <li> price was great and it was in my hands in 4 days</li>
            <li> best description of the Remingon R3 is that it is adequate at best as an inexpensive electric razor.</li>
            <li> nice shaver!</li>
            <li> A good starter shaver.</li>
            <li> If it would run off the charge cord then I feel 4 stars would be a good rating.</li>
            <li> It is still IMO a good bargain.</li>
            <li> Good razor for the price.</li>
            <li> The shave quality from this razor is good, it leaves a close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a good budget shaver.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re always on the lookout for a good deal for a razor.  </li>
            <li> but it still does a good job and at an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer is a good size and works</li>
            <li> fairly close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m finding this shaver a good match for my needs.</li>
            <li> It also has a lithium rechargeable battery which supposedly has a longer &amp;#34;power holding time&amp;#34; and it is listed as good for 30 minutes of shaving before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver also does without any fancy LCD screens telling you power remaining or time to change screens or any of that good</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> The Remington does have a good pop-up trimmer</li>
            <li> I have used good electric razors and this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> Good quality/</li>
            <li> It turns out to be one of most surprisingly great impulse buys of my life.  </li>
            <li> Scottish ancestors would be so proud. :)</li>
            <li> Nicely priced shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when done, it did a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For $50, it&#x27;s a good price for an entry-level e-razor, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will give you a good clean shave with one pass, this is NOT it.  </li>
            <li> There are better razors out there, for considerably more money, but this one does the job at a good price.</li>
            <li> I like how this shaves, nice cut, I think better than norelco&#x27;s twice  the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did leave my face feeling very smooth, and it was a good clean</li>
            <li> It takes me about a minute to shave in the morning, does a GREAT job, and is really convenient.</li>
            <li> light and efficient!</li>
            <li> , it seems flimsy to me and when it wears out I&#x27;ll upgrade to a better model.</li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s R3 works, but there are better electric razors out there.  </li>
            <li> The box claims a powerflex 360 allowing 33% more pivot in the head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great value for sure.</li>
            <li> Nice comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> /&gt;He has owned many electric razors</li>
            <li> Detail Trimmer is in a more strategic place then on most shavers.</li>
            <li> He still prefers the closer shave of a non-electric razor, but he was totally satisfied with this products.</li>
            <li> I got an &#x27;okay&#x27; shave</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> you are on a budget, this will do the job; I suggest you save $5-$10 more and get a slightly better model though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to get into why razors are better than electric.</li>
            <li> This razor is okay but could be much better.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, does a nice close shave, and is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it gave me a good shave -- not quite as close as the Panasonic, but then that costs more than four times the price of this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it felt very smooth and comfortable on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice useful product.</li>
            <li> He also said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s just a razor&amp;#34; â€” so no feature stood out as especially spectacular to him when compared to other electric razor&#x27;s that he&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good razor for the nice low price.</li>
            <li> The shavers always work fine</li>
            <li> Its light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works well on fine whiskers&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pull&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive</li>
            <li> Very handy for quick clean-ups as well as complete jobs.  </li>
            <li> I think if you need a cheap working shaver then this will do.</li>
            <li> my husband owns and when holding it in the palm of your hand there is the lack of a &amp;#34;gripper&amp;#34; that helps you keep a secure hold on it.  </li>
            <li> This gives a fairly comfortable shave too.</li>
            <li> Cheap and durable electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used rotary shavers for 20 plus years and Remington is by far superior to the Norelco product.</li>
            <li> Judging from the 16-hour charge time required, I am assuming this Remington uses good old ni-cads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good..</li>
            <li> The heads move to the contours of your face and therefor give you a smooth clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Using a variety of disposable blades, I can get a clean, close shave without issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Panasonic is easier to clean because it&#x27;s a wet/dry.</li>
            <li> Not for the full bearded man.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be washed, for example, and it takes 16 hours for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good low priced razor.  </li>
            <li> Overall for the price it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Remington makes good products that last.</li>
            <li> The way the three shaving heads flex does a good job of following the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> That provides a slightly better shaving experience on any convex areas, but concave areas?  </li>
            <li> Nice complete kit.</li>
            <li> Usually that&#x27;s somewhere in the intersection of good price and effective shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad choice for a freshman going off to college, or to throw into luggage as a travel shaver.</li>
            <li> Does a quick close shave.</li>
            <li> I got this to use for a quick shave when not using my Gillette razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> but I found this electric razor to be quite adequate.  </li>
            <li> At first it felt somewhat light...</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a pop up sideburn trimmer that flips up easily and works very well.</li>
            <li> The pivoting heads do a pretty good job of following the contours and shaving closely.</li>
            <li> When I recently misplaced the battery charger for my beloved Panasonic ES-LA63 four-blade foil-screen shaver, I needed a cheap shaver to tide me over until I could replace the Panasonic&#x27;s charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yet so we can&#x27;t speak to how well this would work on &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; beards, but he is satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> This is not a very expensive razor but it offers a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, I tackled a two day growth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and lightweight, but still not up to par with other Remington models I&#x27;ve been familiar</li>
            <li> husband has used multiple rotary razors and has become the guy who thinks you have to pay big money to get a good, accurate shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long and the charger light never shuts off or blinks to indicate a full charge, the light stays on all the time when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3 months old and going strong, I keep this one in the car for afternoon touch up,</li>
            <li> The razor is a nice weight, not too heavy and not too light.</li>
            <li> The main drawback for me is that you cannot run it under a sink to clean it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean out and his last one lasted 3 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is essential and in cleaning this model, I found it more troublesome.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son as his first razor.</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last more than a couple of years at max, maybe just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, my son is pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Time will tell, as to its durability over time, especially as it relates to how many times it can be recharged before its battery runs its course.</li>
            <li> My husband says it seems to have higher RPM&#x27;s to cut faster.</li>
            <li> ~ Overall, a satisfied user.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The top of the shaver itself moves a bit, but not really enough to matter.  </li>
            <li> Even if you have to replace it a bit more frequently, it&#x27;s probably worth it to avoid having to pay nearly 300- in some cases for one of the newest &amp; fanciest brands.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve discovered that if you rinse them out and dry them out after using, they will last for many, many shaves.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like the R3, but found that it has the same problems that plague most electric razors--they&#x27;re not close-cutting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going back and forth between disposable razors and electric shavers for years, so I was more than ready to give this Remington model a try.</li>
            <li> My husbands entire shaving routine only takes about 5 minutes so the battery life is good</li>
            <li> Pretty much sums it up.  </li>
            <li> He reports that it works fine, feels comfortable, is simple enough to clean, and holds a charge for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> it projects too far from the body of the razor for true ease of use.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your face is dry before using...</li>
            <li> If what you looking for is simply a shaver that is easily disposable and inexpensive than this is one you should consider.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and is lighter than previous mocdel.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had it long enough to put it through more than the initial charging cycle yet, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for my teenage son.</li>
            <li> Very affordable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a dollar razor I bought on a trip -- disposable -- but it has worked very well since March 28 with that care --</li>
            <li> However, I cant really tell from the shave that the powerflex is an improvement.  </li>
            <li> It cuts the edges of my sideburns well, but not if I&#x27;m trying to cut them higher--the trimmer doesn&#x27;t really do well going through longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon opening this Remington R3 Power Shaver, my initial thought was that it&#x27;s made cheap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the lowest-cost shaver available at my local Harmon Discount store, so I took it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And modern rechargeable batteries, for another.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The real advantage of this shaver is its inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> it would be nice to have a charge stand that it mounted on to keep in in, but that is not such a big deal.</li>
            <li> razor has a very cheap feel to it, the \\&quot;so called\\&quot; floating heads are just pivots, the shave heads do not move other than the pivot points in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is not very expensive at $30 as of the time of this review, but you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Thus I will stay away from &amp;#34;real close&amp;#34; and simply finish off the tight edge around the goatee with a safety razor, to get up close and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is also very light weight and comfortable in hand, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long they will work fine, but for the money you can get a decent shaver.</li>
            <li> The 16 hour charge time is a bit much, but the shaver works well enough for him to toss in his work bag for a quick touch up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I was recently given a $100 plus Norelco for my birthday  hoping for better but nothing ever seems to beat the low cost Remington.</li>
            <li> For a low-end model in the product line, it seems to do a decent job.</li>
            <li> It should not be your main</li>
            <li> The more expensive the better.</li>
            <li> Not comparable to a blade by any means, but decent for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you can buy a new Remington that shaves better every year for less than Norelco replacement  blades.</li>
            <li> He was incredibly impressed by the general quality, hand feel, and close cutting.</li>
            <li> but it is not as smooth and painless as other electric razors I have used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> His face has no more prickly hairs and is now very smooth.</li>
            <li> am giving it the full 5 stars because this one shaves just as well, but the battery lasts 3-4x as long as the old one did even when new</li>
            <li> when shopping for this type of shaver look to see that the cutting disks have all slots the more rows the better.</li>
            <li> The unit feels cheaply made and after a good long 5 minutes of shaving with very poor results I switched to a razor and finished in seconds.</li>
            <li> I have used other rotary shavers so am familiar with the way the work</li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t think any modifications would make this shaver any better or worse - as long as they keep the cost of operation down, this is a good product to get.</li>
            <li> This shaver instead of having a 110 volt go into it directly has a little transformer and puts 4 volts into it and it charges the battery which is very fine especially at this price</li>
            <li> charging time&lt;br /&gt;Feels a little cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a clear plastic cutaway of the R3 itself that measures 6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Pulls and scrapes.. not a smooth comfortable shaver</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about any electric razor is the skin burn afterwards, but I don&#x27;t use it too often...great for emergencies or when you don&#x27;t have much time...</li>
            <li> absolutely a bargain at the price I paid (it was a Daily Deal).</li>
            <li> the on-off switch can be used with one hand, the old one required 2 hands.</li>
            <li> It it nothing like my old Philips Norelco, but that one was about $60.</li>
            <li> You have to charge it for at least 3 hours before you will be able to use it again.</li>
            <li> It seems Remington could have saved a lot in packaging materials, because the box really is too big for the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t verify that it takes the actual 16 hours, since it stays on the charger much longer than that.  </li>
            <li> His old one did not have the capability to hug his chin.</li>
            <li> My fourteen year old son is beginning to shave, so I decided to test this shaver on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this is the first rotary which I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery lasts about 30 minutes, so at night this gets plugged into an outlet so it will be ready for the next day.</li>
            <li> The shaver isn&#x27;t  heavy to hold and it fits comfortably in your hand while you use it.</li>
            <li> This baby reminds me of my old Norelco triple header.  </li>
            <li> This one is easier than my old Norelco models, but there&#x27;s still improvement that could be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> The shaver did a good, comfortable job on my difficult beard -- the hairs grow in several different directions, are pretty stiff, and my skin is quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> Does okay for soft beard, but no good for stiffer hair.</li>
            <li> At first blush, it look like it might be, but it is similar to a low stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it will give me a decent shave</li>
            <li> This makes cleaning a bit more bothersome and consequently it gets cleaned less frequently than other razors</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected and needed for my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> inner plastic housing looks a bit flimsy and it&#x27;s hard to be sure about the longevity potential.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The estimated half hour of operation on a charge is probably good enough to last through a few days of travel, so leaving the charger at home is an option.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, if your beard is a bit on the long side I recommend using the trimmer that is on the back first to shorten your beard, otherwise the shaver will pull your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the nearly identical model (same model number)</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t work any better or any worse.</li>
            <li> I have pretty stiff whiskers and this shaver took them down to a smooth face in just a few strokes, so it does work very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After charging the razor for the required 24 hour initial charge and turning it on for the first time, we noticed the lack of power compared to other razors.  </li>
            <li> Much lighter in weight then other razors</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I moved away from Norelco triple-heads is that they&#x27;re hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I had been using for 2-3 years upon which the blade had become dull; cheaper to get a whole new shaver than just a blade (do airlines set the pricing on razors &amp; shavers?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The noise level is very quiet - I&#x27;ve used other electric shavers that were almost as loud as applying a blender to my face.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used straight line shavers, such as the Braun, which gave me closer shaves than rotaries, such as Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 7 close shaves, so far, and it is still running off of its first charge (and I have a fairly heavy, stiff beard).  </li>
            <li> far as the shave, my beard is coarse and dark.  </li>
            <li> (1) It doesn&#x27;t work plugged in (which is kind of silly for a razor which isn&#x27;t wet/dry), and (2) the charging time seems quite long compared to my other shavers.</li>
            <li> Also the battery life is not great; it averages about 25 minutes with a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> note, my disabled son was actually the person that shaved their face with the razor, I observed and wrote down the review, I chose the first person narrative since I was transcribing my son&#x27;s words</li>
            <li> The cutting action and trimmer work fine.</li>
            <li> My experience with triple head razors (Norelco models) was that blades get dull fairly fast.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are recessed and he says this leads to a sensation of not being exactly sure where the shaver is cutting.</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t works if you have a long beard.</li>
            <li> (in fact it ran so long</li>
            <li> My son is not very hairy and needs to shave only once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> If your beard is over a day long, it will pull or yank at the hairs, which is quite</li>
            <li> * LONG charge time -- 16 hours!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> It is similar to my other shavers that has a folding trimmer.  </li>
            <li> nothing different from other brands or models in this price range, tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have noted that second point.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging and manual would also seem to suggest a dry razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works well, and again, I suggest using a pre-electric lotion or face talc in conjunction with this DRY razor.</li>
            <li> The articulation, by the way, is limited.  </li>
            <li> recommend to stay clear of this product and don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> but this one seemed to &amp;#34;chatter&amp;#34; a lot while operating and there was occasional pulling and slight abrading of tender skin which has to be absolutely DRY</li>
            <li> I forgot where I put the charger when it finally ran down) AND</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it would make sense for someone that had a lot of facial hair, but for teenagers or the occasional shave it works well.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to come with some charge in it and the box states it only needs a half hour to fully charge thereafter.</li>
            <li> He has gone through a few previous ones before and this was the only one that could shave his throat and under his chin properly.</li>
            <li> The noise level does pick up a bit when it actually starts shearing the hair off my face, which is actually a little reassuring.</li>
            <li> This Remington rotary shaver isn&#x27;t bad at all for a lower priced razor, it&#x27;s actually pretty decent.</li>
            <li> At the price I paid I would have expected one that did not have a built in battery</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is as simple as pressing the button and brushing the hair out into the waste basket.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;A little difficult to clean since you can&#x27;t rinse it</li>
            <li> The only drawback if any is that this is a dry razor and cannot be used in wet environments...at least this is what I am assuming.  </li>
            <li> This was inferior to other Remington rotary razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have a combo goatee and mustache and the only negative I noticed,</li>
            <li> His facial hair isn&#x27;t thick or plentiful</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t cut the hairs down to the skin</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s see, four and a half months for a buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t yield a very close shave, and while the straight-headed Braun was difficult in a few areas, the articulated head of the Remington is no better in practice.  </li>
            <li> am a little concerned about the charging time as stated in the manual as it says it takes 16 hours to charge for 30 minutes of shave time, so</li>
            <li> I will be running a little chart on that and will update if I find anything</li>
            <li> He uses the shaver everyday.</li>
            <li> Problem areas behind the jawline, around the chin, and around the adams apple still need multiple passes and for me do not shave as close as a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> So you can shave a few times before recharging or just charge after every use.</li>
            <li> It cuts close, but you have to move it in circles over the area a few times to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> Not a comfortable shave whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> But having tried shaving with it a few times, I&#x27;ll stick with blades until I get another Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving is not cheap for razor or electric.</li>
            <li> This is one such poor unit.</li>
            <li> The charge time is a little excessive though, 16 hours for 30 mins of runtime.  </li>
            <li> irritation was slightly higher than the Panasonic, but wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> This razor is not as bad as shaving with sandpaper (not that I would actually know) but there are many instances when I use it that it catches my hair and is quite painful.</li>
            <li> no more 5</li>
            <li> It does have a small trimmer to do sideburns and for edging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Remington decided that feature could be omitted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I compared this to my usual electric shaver, the Panasonic ES8109.</li>
            <li> have a tough time recommending this razor for anything other</li>
            <li> The blades are beginning to dull</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit worried about what it will be like when the blades get dull.</li>
            <li> I noticed people leaving somewhat negative reviews</li>
            <li> There is some difficulty in shaving your neck area unless you do so in an upward motion and slowly.</li>
            <li> It does pull hairs on areas like the neck but the upward slow motion relieved some of this.</li>
            <li> Cheap-feeling, lightweight, slow to charge, slow to run.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s also not the sort of thing you want to give as a gift to someone with a thick beard.</li>
            <li> This is not a good razor.</li>
            <li> Will not run while charging which can be annoying if you found the battery completely out of charge.  </li>
            <li> both sides tend to do poor jobs.</li>
            <li> One annoying feature of this shaver is that you cannot run it off the charger after it has run down.</li>
            <li> I got this in Walmart and from day one it gives a lousy shave and taked forever to get a grainy surface...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is awkward to use -</li>
            <li> found the blades to tug on my beard -- a mildly painful experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> annoying characteristics:</li>
            <li> I had hairs caught by this unit and it did a horrible job of shaving my stubble.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pulls and scrapes.. not a smooth comfortable shaver</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t works if you have a long beard.</li>
            <li> Great shaver!  Does the job!</li>
            <li> best price on internet</li>
            <li> This was inferior to other Remington rotary razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is essential and in cleaning this model, I found it more troublesome. Parts are not attached well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and lightweight, but still not up to par with other Remington models I&#x27;ve been familiar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is not as close.</li>
            <li> Bought for my fiance for his birthday ðŸŽ‚  he loves it! He uses the shaver everyday. His face has no more prickly hairs and is now very smooth. ðŸ˜Š  very happy customer</li>
            <li> I purchased a number of similar shavers over the years from Amazon. At the price I paid I would have expected one that did not have a built in battery but this one does have a built in battery. The shavers always work fine and since I travel a lot I tend to have a number of shavers in a number of places. This shaver instead of having a 110 volt go into it directly has a little transformer and puts 4 volts into it and it charges the battery which is very fine especially at this price</li>
            <li> Very nice for price,  very happy with the shaver</li>
            <li> I have used rotary shavers for 20 plus years and Remington is by far superior to the Norelco product. I was recently given a $100 plus Norelco for my birthday  hoping for better but nothing ever seems to beat the low cost Remington. Now keep in mind I am talking about  the speed and quality of the shave not the build quality of the hardware. Thats one area that norelco might win but who cares, you can buy a new Remington that shaves better every year for less than Norelco replacement  blades. when shopping for this type of shaver look to see that the cutting disks have all slots the more rows the better. Stay away from the pin hole disks if they cut at all they will increase the time of your shave.</li>
            <li> This device actually works!  I have used it for 7 close shaves, so far, and it is still running off of its first charge (and I have a fairly heavy, stiff beard).  Very handy for quick clean-ups as well as complete jobs.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about any electric razor is the skin burn afterwards, but I don&#x27;t use it too often...great for emergencies or when you don&#x27;t have much time...absolutely a bargain at the price I paid (it was a Daily Deal).</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get the negative reviews.  I bought this shaver on impulse.  It turns out to be one of most surprisingly great impulse buys of my life.  The darn thing is great!  It takes me about a minute to shave in the morning, does a GREAT job, and is really convenient.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son as his first razor. Does okay for soft beard, but no good for stiffer hair. Not for the full bearded man.</li>
            <li> I like how this shaves, nice cut, I think better than norelco&#x27;s twice  the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the nearly identical model (same model number) I had been using for 2-3 years upon which the blade had become dull; cheaper to get a whole new shaver than just a blade (do airlines set the pricing on razors &amp; shavers?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it the full 5 stars because this one shaves just as well, but the battery lasts 3-4x as long as the old one did even when new (in fact it ran so long I forgot where I put the charger when it finally ran down) AND the on-off switch can be used with one hand, the old one required 2 hands.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for a great product</li>
            <li> Great starter electric razor. Just make sure your face is dry before using...</li>
            <li> 3 months old and going strong, I keep this one in the car for afternoon touch up, no more 5 o,clock shadow</li>
            <li> nice shaver! light and efficient!</li>
            <li> this item works great but i bought 3 and one doesnt work,</li>
            <li> i like it and no skin damaged</li>
            <li> Want a close shave..don&#x27;t get this model.  I got this in Walmart and from day one it gives a lousy shave and taked forever to get a grainy surface...won&#x27;t cut the hairs down to the skin..look elsewhere for a rotary razor....</li>
            <li> A good starter shaver. Very affordable</li>
            <li> excellent quality of this purchase</li>
            <li> The shaver did a good, comfortable job on my difficult beard -- the hairs grow in several different directions, are pretty stiff, and my skin is quite sensitive. So on that ground, I can use this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it seems flimsy to me and when it wears out I&#x27;ll upgrade to a better model. It can&#x27;t be washed, for example, and it takes 16 hours for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, frankly, I may go back to regular safety razors now that I&#x27;ve discovered that if you rinse them out and dry them out after using, they will last for many, many shaves. I&#x27;m using a dollar razor I bought on a trip -- disposable -- but it has worked very well since March 28 with that care -- let&#x27;s see, four and a half months for a buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Scottish ancestors would be so proud. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert C. Ross&lt;br /&gt;August, 2014</li>
            <li> This is not very expensive at $30 as of the time of this review, but you do get what you pay for. The cutting action and trimmer work fine. I don&#x27;t know how long they will work fine, but for the money you can get a decent shaver. The entire unit does have a plastic feel to it. It it nothing like my old Philips Norelco, but that one was about $60. I think if you need a cheap working shaver then this will do. But I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last more than a couple of years at max, maybe just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update 6.12.15 - I have to update after using this for a while. The battery seems to be loosing it capacity already. One annoying feature of this shaver is that you cannot run it off the charger after it has run down. You have to charge it for at least 3 hours before you will be able to use it again. The blades are beginning to dull but otherwise it is still working well. I have reduced it to 3 stars from 4. If it would run off the charge cord then I feel 4 stars would be a good rating. Hope this helps. It is still IMO a good bargain.</li>
            <li> Good razor for the price. Does a quick close shave. This is a durable razor and the heads move to adjust to the shape of the face. There is some difficulty in shaving your neck area unless you do so in an upward motion and slowly. It does pull hairs on areas like the neck but the upward slow motion relieved some of this. There are better razors out there, for considerably more money, but this one does the job at a good price.</li>
            <li> Good low priced razor.  The shave quality from this razor is good, it leaves a close shave.  The pivoting head gets the blades close to the skin.  I&#x27;m not sure it would make sense for someone that had a lot of facial hair, but for teenagers or the occasional shave it works well.  The charge time is a little excessive though, 16 hours for 30 mins of runtime.  This did not affect me, since it only takes a couple of minutes to shave, but could affect someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good budget shaver.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re always on the lookout for a good deal for a razor.  Usually that&#x27;s somewhere in the intersection of good price and effective shave.  Remington&#x27;s R3 works, but there are better electric razors out there.  Likewise, the R3 just can&#x27;t beat a disposable razor&#x27;s closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNBOXING:&lt;br /&gt;The Remington R3 comes in a box 9&amp;#34; x 5&amp;#34; x 3&amp;#34; (at widest part).  It&#x27;s got a clear plastic cutaway of the R3 itself that measures 6&amp;#34; x 2.5&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34;.  The box contains only the razor, charging cord, and instructions.  It seems Remington could have saved a lot in packaging materials, because the box really is too big for the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;The Remington R3 says it charges in 16 hours and runs for 30 minutes.  I leave it charged overnight and use it in the morning.  I can&#x27;t verify that it takes the actual 16 hours, since it stays on the charger much longer than that.  Likewise, if it takes you 30 minutes to shave, you might be sleeping while you do it.  For me, the R3 takes about 10 minutes to shave.  I&#x27;ve not charged it between 2 shaving sessions, and it seems to hold the charge.  I have not shaved 3 times before charging again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shave, my beard is coarse and dark.  Using a variety of disposable blades, I can get a clean, close shave without issue.  However, with the R3, I find myself having to re-shave constantly.  The box claims a powerflex 360 allowing 33% more pivot in the head.  However, I cant really tell from the shave that the powerflex is an improvement.  Problem areas behind the jawline, around the chin, and around the adams apple still need multiple passes and for me do not shave as close as a disposable razor.  There is a neat pop-up trimmer on the back of the R3, but when it&#x27;s up, the power of the razor decreases for some reason.  It cuts the edges of my sideburns well, but not if I&#x27;m trying to cut them higher--the trimmer doesn&#x27;t really do well going through longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like the R3, but found that it has the same problems that plague most electric razors--they&#x27;re not close-cutting.  For $50, it&#x27;s a good price for an entry-level e-razor, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will give you a good clean shave with one pass, this is NOT it.  You can probably keep this in your car or office for emergency use, but I&#x27;ll stick with my disposable razors for my daily shaver.</li>
            <li> I got this to use for a quick shave when not using my Gillette razor and shaving cream. This is not a very expensive razor but it offers a nice shave. It is not the closest but it still does a good job and at an inexpensive price. It takes awhile to charge and each charge lasts about 30 minutes.  So you can shave a few times before recharging or just charge after every use. It does have a small trimmer to do sideburns and for edging. Overall for the price it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Nicely priced shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has used multiple rotary razors and has become the guy who thinks you have to pay big money to get a good, accurate shave. He was incredibly impressed by the general quality, hand feel, and close cutting. The pop up trimmer is a good size and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His only complaints were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inner plastic housing looks a bit flimsy and it&#x27;s hard to be sure about the longevity potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are recessed and he says this leads to a sensation of not being exactly sure where the shaver is cutting. However, when done, it did a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for sure. Even if you have to replace it a bit more frequently, it&#x27;s probably worth it to avoid having to pay nearly 300- in some cases for one of the newest &amp; fanciest brands.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my son to take with him to college. His old one did not have the capability to hug his chin. Because it takes 16 hrs. to charge for 30 mins. of use, this razor basically needs to be plugged in all the time in order to be used daily.  My son is not very hairy and needs to shave only once or twice a week. So, this razor is perfect for him. The razor is a nice weight, not too heavy and not too light. Remington makes good products that last. That is why I chose this brand. Overall, my son is pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a rechargable electric razor. The head pivots so it hugs all the curves. It cuts close, but you have to move it in circles over the area a few times to get all the hair. Its light weight and easy to hold. it does not have a charging stand, it just has a cord that you plug into it and then into the wall. it would be nice to have a charge stand that it mounted on to keep in in, but that is not such a big deal. I think this is a good razor for the nice low price. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The R3 is a basic affordable rotary shaver.  It is similar to my other shavers that has a folding trimmer.  This is great to cut growing sideburns, bangs and around the ear trims.  Nice comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Takes a lot longer to charge the battery.  Will not run while charging which can be annoying if you found the battery completely out of charge.  Only operates at 120V.</li>
            <li> Upon opening this Remington R3 Power Shaver, my initial thought was that it&#x27;s made cheap.  Much lighter in weight then other razors my husband owns and when holding it in the palm of your hand there is the lack of a &amp;#34;gripper&amp;#34; that helps you keep a secure hold on it.  Feels a bit slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After charging the razor for the required 24 hour initial charge and turning it on for the first time, we noticed the lack of power compared to other razors.  The lack of &amp;#34;smooth moving&amp;#34; movements across the skin is noticable with red razor marks left in its wake.  Not a comfortable shave whatsoever.  After using it approximately a total of 20 combined minutes over 1 week, it needed to be rechargedâ€¦ for 16 HOURS!  Not having the option for a rapid charge makes this razor unreliable.  We don&#x27;t leave items on our countertops so there&#x27;s no way this would be plugged in on a daily basis for reliable, continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tough time recommending this razor for anything other then something you&#x27;d leave at your office for emergency uses.  But rememberâ€¦ keep it plugged in so in that emergency you&#x27;re guaranteed a charged razor!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> My fourteen year old son is beginning to shave, so I decided to test this shaver on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Gets fairly close.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on fine whiskers&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pull&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Head is designed to move to the contours of your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long charging time&lt;br /&gt;Feels a little cheap&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in&lt;br /&gt;A little difficult to clean since you can&#x27;t rinse it</li>
            <li> Hubby was the guinea pig for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has owned many electric razors this product doesn&#x27;t work any better or any worse. It has a great price point. He has dense hair growth. This product doesn&#x27;t shave as well as manual-blade razor. Also the battery life is not great; it averages about 25 minutes with a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Detail Trimmer is in a more strategic place then on most shavers.</li>
            <li> I noticed people leaving somewhat negative reviews but I found this electric razor to be quite adequate.  At first it felt somewhat light...lack of heft always seems to suggest lack of quality but this didn&#x27;t seem to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I did use a pre-electric lotion to help the hairs stick up for an easier shave and perhaps this is why this razor worked for me.  It is also suggested to use a shaving talc to help the razor glide across your skin.  The only drawback if any is that this is a dry razor and cannot be used in wet environments...at least this is what I am assuming.  I will not take the risk to test out.  The packaging and manual would also seem to suggest a dry razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well, and again, I suggest using a pre-electric lotion or face talc in conjunction with this DRY razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going back and forth between disposable razors and electric shavers for years, so I was more than ready to give this Remington model a try. For a low-end model in the product line, it seems to do a decent job. The way the three shaving heads flex does a good job of following the contours of my face. The noise level is very quiet - I&#x27;ve used other electric shavers that were almost as loud as applying a blender to my face. The noise level does pick up a bit when it actually starts shearing the hair off my face, which is actually a little reassuring. The pop-up trimmer works about as well as those ever do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to put it through more than the initial charging cycle yet, but so far so good. The estimated half hour of operation on a charge is probably good enough to last through a few days of travel, so leaving the charger at home is an option. That it won&#x27;t operate while charging is a bit of a nuisance if you run out of power in the middle of a shave. I&#x27;m not sure why Remington decided that feature could be omitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m finding this shaver a good match for my needs.</li>
            <li> If your beard is over a day long, it will pull or yank at the hairs, which is quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long and the charger light never shuts off or blinks to indicate a full charge, the light stays on all the time when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a very cheap feel to it, the \\&quot;so called\\&quot; floating heads are just pivots, the shave heads do not move other than the pivot points in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to stay clear of this product and don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> In the past I have used straight line shavers, such as the Braun, which gave me closer shaves than rotaries, such as Norelco. So this is the first rotary which I have used in a long time. Right out of the box, I tackled a two day growth. I have pretty stiff whiskers and this shaver took them down to a smooth face in just a few strokes, so it does work very well. The heads are spring loaded so they follow the contours of your face. I also have a combo goatee and mustache and the only negative I noticed, was that the shaver tugged on or caught some of the short hairs around the perimeter of my goatee, which causes insignificant discomfort. Thus I will stay away from &amp;#34;real close&amp;#34; and simply finish off the tight edge around the goatee with a safety razor, to get up close and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is also very light weight and comfortable in hand, so no complaints there. It also has a lithium rechargeable battery which supposedly has a longer &amp;#34;power holding time&amp;#34; and it is listed as good for 30 minutes of shaving before it needs to be recharged. I can&#x27;t attest to this benefit since I have not gone thru a charge recycle yet. It also has a pop up trimmer for sideburns which works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, as rotary razors go, this one performs well in the &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34; department. Time will tell, as to its durability over time, especially as it relates to how many times it can be recharged before its battery runs its course.</li>
            <li> My husband says this is the best Remington shaver yet! He has gone through a few previous ones before and this was the only one that could shave his throat and under his chin properly. It can be used with a cord or cordless. It seemed to come with some charge in it and the box states it only needs a half hour to fully charge thereafter. Easy to clean and is lighter than previous mocdel. My husband says it seems to have higher RPM&#x27;s to cut faster.</li>
            <li> Low price but a crappy shave. would not buy again.</li>
            <li> When I recently misplaced the battery charger for my beloved Panasonic ES-LA63 four-blade foil-screen shaver, I needed a cheap shaver to tide me over until I could replace the Panasonic&#x27;s charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the lowest-cost shaver available at my local Harmon Discount store, so I took it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it gave me a good shave -- not quite as close as the Panasonic, but then that costs more than four times the price of this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you give up at this price point?  A plastic head cover, for one thing.  And modern rechargeable batteries, for another.  Judging from the 16-hour charge time required, I am assuming this Remington uses good old ni-cads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver also does without any fancy LCD screens telling you power remaining or time to change screens or any of that good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for a spare shaver, this one does fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Great price!&lt;br /&gt;* Pivoting heads and head block, like Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;* Pop-up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;* 30 minutes of shave time on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* LONG charge time -- 16 hours!&lt;br /&gt;* No head cover or LCD screen.</li>
            <li> This is a spare electric shaver, the one you keep in your office or car for emergencies. It should not be your main shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Context of Use: I used it with a couple of days growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the blades to tug on my beard -- a mildly painful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave wasn&#x27;t close. At first blush, it look like it might be, but it is similar to a low stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m unimpressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Trendl&lt;br /&gt;anthonytrendl.com</li>
            <li> Worked fine for my teenage son. He still prefers the closer shave of a non-electric razor, but he was totally satisfied with this products. He had no complaints. He also said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s just a razor&amp;#34; â€” so no feature stood out as especially spectacular to him when compared to other electric razor&#x27;s that he&#x27;s used. ~ Overall, a satisfied user.</li>
            <li> This Remington rotary shaver isn&#x27;t bad at all for a lower priced razor, it&#x27;s actually pretty decent. This gives a fairly comfortable shave too. I even tried it on one of my legs, there was no pulling or scratching and  for an electric razor I got an &#x27;okay&#x27; shave, it felt very smooth and comfortable on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a pop up sideburn trimmer that flips up easily and works very well. The rechargeable battery lasts about 30 minutes, so at night this gets plugged into an outlet so it will be ready for the next day. My husbands entire shaving routine only takes about 5 minutes so the battery life is good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is as simple as pressing the button and brushing the hair out into the waste basket. The shaver isn&#x27;t  heavy to hold and it fits comfortably in your hand while you use it. The 16 hour charge time is a bit much, but the shaver works well enough for him to toss in his work bag for a quick touch up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Works well. Good price.</li>
            <li> This baby reminds me of my old Norelco triple header.  The heads move to the contours of your face and therefor give you a smooth clean shave.  The trimmer is great for trimming my beard and mustache.  Nice useful product.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I use to buy the same one at walmart but this one seems to have sharper blades</li>
            <li> OK. This razor is not as bad as shaving with sandpaper (not that I would actually know) but there are many instances when I use it that it catches my hair and is quite painful. Overall, it will give me a decent shave but it is not as smooth and painless as other electric razors I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PR1235 (awesome name by the way) does a satisfactory job for the price. The main drawback for me is that you cannot run it under a sink to clean it. This makes cleaning a bit more bothersome and consequently it gets cleaned less frequently than other razors I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on a budget, this will do the job; I suggest you save $5-$10 more and get a slightly better model though.</li>
            <li> Received as described. Shipped fast. Work great  The head replacement costs $24.95 at Walmarts. So far so good.. Thanks</li>
            <li> Cheap-feeling, lightweight, slow to charge, slow to run.  Pretty much sums it up.  My last electric razor - a 14 year-old Braun, had just died, so when the opportunity came up to review the Remington, it was timely.  The Remington simply doesn&#x27;t measure up.  It doesn&#x27;t yield a very close shave, and while the straight-headed Braun was difficult in a few areas, the articulated head of the Remington is no better in practice.  The articulation, by the way, is limited.  The top of the shaver itself moves a bit, but not really enough to matter.  The 3 shaving heads don&#x27;t float independently like some others.  Rather, they simply pivot inwards all together.  That provides a slightly better shaving experience on any convex areas, but concave areas?  No help at all.  The Remington does have a good pop-up trimmer and I&#x27;ll keep the shaver for that.  But having tried shaving with it a few times, I&#x27;ll stick with blades until I get another Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best description of the Remingon R3 is that it is adequate at best as an inexpensive electric razor. If you are committed to rotary head shavers, I suggest a model with independently articulating heads.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, if your beard is a bit on the long side I recommend using the trimmer that is on the back first to shorten your beard, otherwise the shaver will pull your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did leave my face feeling very smooth, and it was a good clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;I am a little concerned about the charging time as stated in the manual as it says it takes 16 hours to charge for 30 minutes of shave time, so I will be running a little chart on that and will update if I find anything significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*reviewer note, my disabled son was actually the person that shaved their face with the razor, I observed and wrote down the review, I chose the first person narrative since I was transcribing my son&#x27;s words</li>
            <li> My son is using this Remington Rotary Shaver and likes it, he uses it every day and has no complaints.  It is easy to use, does a nice close shave, and is comfortable to hold.  It is easy to clean out and his last one lasted 3 years.  I hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> This is not a good razor. I&#x27;m not going to get into why razors are better than electric. I have used good electric razors and this is not one of them. I had hairs caught by this unit and it did a horrible job of shaving my stubble. The unit feels cheaply made and after a good long 5 minutes of shaving with very poor results I switched to a razor and finished in seconds. If you must go with electric I say buy a Brawn. The more expensive the better. Shaving is not cheap for razor or electric. The cheaper items on  both sides tend to do poor jobs. This is one such poor unit.</li>
            <li> This razor is okay but could be much better.  I have used other rotary shavers so am familiar with the way the work but this one seemed to &amp;#34;chatter&amp;#34; a lot while operating and there was occasional pulling and slight abrading of tender skin which has to be absolutely DRY or it leaves a mark.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is awkward to use - it projects too far from the body of the razor for true ease of use.</li>
            <li> nothing different from other brands or models in this price range, tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at this point in time, i don&#x27;t think any modifications would make this shaver any better or worse - as long as they keep the cost of operation down, this is a good product to get.</li>
            <li> This is used by my 14o son. He reports that it works fine, feels comfortable, is simple enough to clean, and holds a charge for a decent amount of time. His facial hair isn&#x27;t thick or plentiful yet so we can&#x27;t speak to how well this would work on &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; beards, but he is satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected and needed for my shaving routine. price was great and it was in my hands in 4 days</li>
            <li> Cheap and durable electric shaver. If what you looking for is simply a shaver that is easily disposable and inexpensive than this is one you should consider.</li>
            <li> Nice complete kit. Good quality/ Quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> I compared this to my usual electric shaver, the Panasonic ES8109. The Panasonic is a foil model, more expensive, and a wet/dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington shaved a bit closer than the Panasonic foil. The pivoting heads do a pretty good job of following the contours and shaving closely. Not comparable to a blade by any means, but decent for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin irritation was slightly higher than the Panasonic, but wasn&#x27;t too bad. I&#x27;m a bit worried about what it will be like when the blades get dull. My experience with triple head razors (Norelco models) was that blades get dull fairly fast. We&#x27;ll see how this one goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is easier to clean because it&#x27;s a wet/dry. One of the reasons I moved away from Norelco triple-heads is that they&#x27;re hard to clean. This one is easier than my old Norelco models, but there&#x27;s still improvement that could be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two annoying characteristics: (1) It doesn&#x27;t work plugged in (which is kind of silly for a razor which isn&#x27;t wet/dry), and (2) the charging time seems quite long compared to my other shavers. Other reviewers have noted that second point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real advantage of this shaver is its inexpensive price. It&#x27;s not a bad choice for a freshman going off to college, or to throw into luggage as a travel shaver. But it&#x27;s also not the sort of thing you want to give as a gift to someone with a thick beard.</li>
