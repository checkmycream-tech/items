            <li>you want brushes spend the $$$ on good brushes!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Brushes are great they dont fall apart at all and hold the make up nicely.</li>
            <li>therefore they aren&#x27;t good to make up.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really nice and great quality.</li>
            <li>so i did have to get a mac 217 brush but its all good(:</li>
            <li>I found these to be good quality brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>She was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love the tinier brushes they work great.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these brushes.</li>
            <li>I really liked these make up brushes, good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>convenient to carry in wallet size, brushes are good quality, nice and practical.  </li>
            <li>The case is very nice, safe and has a premium appearance</li>
            <li>but it is adorable!</li>
            <li>With regards to the case, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This will be amazing for travel.</li>
            <li>All these brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li>It came packaged nicely and each and every brush has a plastic cover around it.</li>
            <li>I havent seen any kind of shedding yet and I have been using them for about a week.</li>
            <li>The case is nice as well.</li>
            <li>if u want nice makeup , it doesn&#x27;t do what it say it do</li>
            <li>I really liked the brushes sent.</li>
            <li>Brushes came in a nice case and I gave them as gifts.  </li>
            <li>the case is nice too.</li>
            <li>so that was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>The packaging it comes in is nice</li>
            <li>(looks like a croc wallet) and looks like it will travel nicely.  </li>
            <li>the brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush is the foundation brush which feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>they are worth their price and great for beginners.</li>
            <li>The powder and foundation brushes are great, the lip and eyeliner brushes are excellent, if a bit long (but bristles are easy to trim).</li>
            <li>SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOME GREAT QUALITY BRUSHES FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>They are very full, soft and work perfect for my makeup.</li>
            <li>What I liked about it is that it arrived on time, but it had a strong odor to it.</li>
            <li>While the cheap price may throw you off, they are amazing.</li>
            <li>My favorite is ELF Eyeshadow \\&quot;C\\&quot; brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been gaining more interest in make up</li>
            <li>The larger brushes are perfect.  </li>
            <li>Love all the brushes, I even bought two of them.</li>
            <li>When I reiceved it I was pleased with the varitey of the brushes.</li>
            <li>I am definitely a happy customer and I a very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I really love the case too.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The fan brush is okay, and the case is okay as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>still use some of the brushes that came with the set but threw away most of them.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap set I would get these, but if you&#x27;re looking to spoil yourself I would keep shopping around!</li>
            <li>Again, I was very impressed by the quality of the brushes and the quantity especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>She has more brushes than she knows what to do with.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it would have been smarter to invest in a better quality set from the beginning.</li>
            <li>On top of everything, the brushes and the case smells.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it in my cart many suggestions came up as to what to buy</li>
            <li>Waisted almost no time at all showing up at my doorstep :)</li>
            <li>i love my brushes  </li>
            <li>Sephora has better brushes</li>
            <li>Love the case and the brushes :)</li>
            <li>I  absolutely love these brushes the met my needs and more</li>
            <li>for such a price, it is awesome.</li>
            <li>YOU WILL LOVE IT LIKE ME AND BE HAPPPY WITH IT.</li>
            <li>The brushes are made out of cheap material that don&#x27;t even let you apply the makeup nicely.</li>
            <li>I am glad I am not gifting these till mid-January, might give the smell a chance to wear</li>
            <li>The case is beautiful with a lot of brushes but they are very soft</li>
            <li>The case is super cheap but the brushes are of good quality.</li>
            <li>That being said, this set a pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is great, and the black case it comes in is also very handy.  </li>
            <li>Overall, still a very good</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I love the quality of the brushes, also the case they came in was very cute.</li>
            <li>They are soft and great to work with.</li>
            <li>THE BRUSHES ARE VERYYYYYY SOFT AND FEEL GREAT WHEN YOU USE THEM.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I loved this product and it was a very affordable.</li>
            <li>So far, I love them!!</li>
            <li>The case makes it really easy to pack everything up.  </li>
            <li>SOME OF THE BRUSHES SHED EASILY ...</li>
            <li>SO I HAD TO SUPER GLUE IT!</li>
            <li>All of my brushes came with sleeves to protect the tops package was great and unharmed the only thing I didnt like was the smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hoped that they would not be this cheap, but I would not recommend these, even at cheap price.</li>
            <li>The brushes are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>They are soft, good quality, and the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>the brushes are decent but i was kind of disapointed in the variety.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the ferrules have detatched from the handle, but that&#x27;s an easy fix with a lil super glue.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a lot of fun!   </li>
            <li>Also, she was surprised how cheap they were and how many there was for that price!</li>
            <li>When ordering a fairly priced makeup brush set the most important to me was a foundation brush as my lancome one broke in half two weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li>She did not find either to be true.  </li>
            <li>so it took me a long time to find brushes that I really liked!</li>
            <li>Finally got some good makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes were okay for the price, although the heads of some of the brushes pop off the handle and are not secured on very well.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and picked up product pretty good.</li>
            <li>i mean for 19$ these brushes are great!</li>
            <li>I mostly got this particular product because of the variety of eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and everything was in placed.</li>
            <li>so I used super glue gel to reattach them.  </li>
            <li>super....</li>
            <li>el estuche super bien&lt;br /&gt;la</li>
            <li>brushes look nice enough, good enough for someone like my mom who isn&#x27;t a die-hard brand snob.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase so far, i love the brushes and have not experienced any shedding yet.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing, enough said.</li>
            <li>honestly, I like but if you don&#x27;t I would suggest just leaving it open for a couple days to get the smell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I received it I found that the eyeshadow brushes are way too stuff to really be useful.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize this company manufactured so many different products until after I had ordered impulsively and went on the website cause I was excited.</li>
            <li>They are of good quality and I would recommend them to other ladies.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and are easy to wash.  </li>
            <li>Although these were great the first couple of weeks, all the sudden the handless ( the wood part) start to fall off, and now i am just left with the brush part of all of them.</li>
            <li>Good quality, I gave this product 4 stars because one of my brushes was bent a little bit.</li>
            <li>I wanted some brushes to start doing my eyeshadow blending better and this kit comes with all different kinds of brushes for blending, except for crease blending brush.</li>
            <li>I travel quite a bit and this case is pretty convenient.  </li>
            <li>The eye brushes also aren&#x27;t too big, which are perfect for my small features.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as it was stated.</li>
            <li>Would love to shop in future with them!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had the brushes for over a year; they hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li>but most are larger than i prefer.  </li>
            <li>When you get them the brushes smell weird but besides that they are perfect brushes.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>also the shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li>Although these are not super high-end MAC or Sigma brushes, Bundle Monster did a great job creating soft, non-shedding brushes that really pick up the makeup well.  </li>
            <li>The people who received the gifts loved them, it looked much more expensive.</li>
            <li>but that can be fixed with a good wash other than that</li>
            <li>They are really good brushes, very firm which I like.</li>
            <li>its such an easy fix</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and the handle is really long and nice.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft, and seem very durable.</li>
            <li>They are soft and do exactly the job I need them to do!</li>
            <li>The real benefit in buying this set is that you get lots of different brushes for really cheap.</li>
            <li>and it came really fast...</li>
            <li>but for ~$1/brush + case, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting all that much.</li>
            <li>They work very well</li>
            <li>and so I can&#x27;t really afford the 8$ MAC brushes</li>
            <li>I am very satisified with everything.</li>
            <li>The case looks cheap and doesn&#x27;t fold to a close properly.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to choosing anything with makeup</li>
            <li>These probably won&#x27;t last me very long, but by then I&#x27;ll want to upgrade to better brushes!</li>
            <li>Not only are the brushes soft, but they are very full.</li>
            <li>You can probably fit a few more smaller brushes in here as well.   </li>
            <li>So far, I highly recommend, and will hopefully update after I have washed and used them for the first time.  </li>
            <li>worth it if you need a new case for your brushes, and also need new foundation and powder brushes, but expect to immediately throw a bunch of the brand-new brushes directly into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The case is also compact and decent for travel.</li>
            <li>When I used the brushes they were very soft and they blended very well.</li>
            <li>If you want additonal brushes, I highly recommend E.L.F.</li>
            <li>so well I would almost think they where high end brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes shed a little but are soft and seem to blend ok.  </li>
            <li>It also has this \\&quot;new plastic\\&quot; smell which</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted; a big set of brushes!</li>
            <li>These brushes are soooo soft!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very impresed with the selection and quality.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve just started, I didn&#x27;t want to go out and get a complete set of MAC brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have never used makeup in my life - except for lip balm, lipstick and occasional concealer, which don&#x27;t really require brushes for application.</li>
            <li>Wow they are soooooooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a feather soft to the touch, it is just wonder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 16 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 16 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>The brushes were extremely soft and didn&#x27;t lose their bristles.</li>
            <li>next very helpful judging by the fact</li>
            <li>Brushes are not particarly soft, don&#x27;t seem to hold makeup on brush well.</li>
            <li>am surprised at how it has held up.</li>
            <li>It not only can fit the brushes that came with the case, it can hold other brushes as well.</li>
            <li>They also traveled a very long way (Hawaii to Virginia) and still arrived within a reasonable length of time.  </li>
            <li>The mild plastic smell dissipated in a few days, and she found the brushes to be quite to her liking.  </li>
            <li>I will probably only continue to use my old blush brush and throw everything else away!</li>
            <li>There is only one small defect on the plastic brush for lashes and brows (some prongs sticks together) but it is probably easy to fix.</li>
            <li>I found myself just passing the brushes back and forth on the face, because they feel so soft.</li>
            <li>so it barely fits in my purse</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not great quality</li>
            <li>I noticed that the foundation applicator applies much nicer than other</li>
            <li>at first i was a little nervous about it</li>
            <li>The case it comes in does smell a little funny</li>
            <li>I have my large ELF powder brush, fan brush, a revlon dome brush, and several other brushes.</li>
            <li>but they are all the same stiff brush just with different shaped tips which really is kind of pointless.</li>
            <li>No strange smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like the black case.</li>
            <li>all the brushes were the same thickness, they are all pretty firm, i was thinking it would have a couple fluffier eyeshadow brushes</li>
            <li>There was a slight odor at first to the case, but it went away after a little while and the brushes felt very soft and never smelled.  </li>

            <li> The case is very nice, safe and has a premium appearance</li>
            <li> but it is adorable!</li>
            <li> With regards to the case, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This will be amazing for travel.</li>
            <li> All these brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> It came packaged nicely and each and every brush has a plastic cover around it.</li>
            <li> I havent seen any kind of shedding yet and I have been using them for about a week.</li>
            <li> The case is nice as well.</li>
            <li> if u want nice makeup , it doesn&#x27;t do what it say it do</li>
            <li> I really liked the brushes sent.</li>
            <li> Brushes came in a nice case and I gave them as gifts.  </li>
            <li> the case is nice too.</li>
            <li> so that was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li> The packaging it comes in is nice</li>
            <li> (looks like a croc wallet) and looks like it will travel nicely.  </li>
            <li> the brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush is the foundation brush which feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> they are worth their price and great for beginners.</li>
            <li> The powder and foundation brushes are great, the lip and eyeliner brushes are excellent, if a bit long (but bristles are easy to trim).</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOME GREAT QUALITY BRUSHES FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> They are very full, soft and work perfect for my makeup.</li>
            <li> What I liked about it is that it arrived on time, but it had a strong odor to it.</li>
            <li> While the cheap price may throw you off, they are amazing.</li>
            <li> My favorite is ELF Eyeshadow \\&quot;C\\&quot; brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been gaining more interest in make up</li>
            <li> The larger brushes are perfect.  </li>
            <li> Love all the brushes, I even bought two of them.</li>
            <li> When I reiceved it I was pleased with the varitey of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I am definitely a happy customer and I a very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and I really love the case too.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The fan brush is okay, and the case is okay as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> still use some of the brushes that came with the set but threw away most of them.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap set I would get these, but if you&#x27;re looking to spoil yourself I would keep shopping around!</li>
            <li> Again, I was very impressed by the quality of the brushes and the quantity especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> She has more brushes than she knows what to do with.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it would have been smarter to invest in a better quality set from the beginning.</li>
            <li> On top of everything, the brushes and the case smells.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it in my cart many suggestions came up as to what to buy</li>
            <li> Waisted almost no time at all showing up at my doorstep :)</li>
            <li> i love my brushes  </li>
            <li> Sephora has better brushes</li>
            <li> Love the case and the brushes :)</li>
            <li> I  absolutely love these brushes the met my needs and more</li>
            <li> for such a price, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL LOVE IT LIKE ME AND BE HAPPPY WITH IT.</li>
            <li> The brushes are made out of cheap material that don&#x27;t even let you apply the makeup nicely.</li>
            <li> I am glad I am not gifting these till mid-January, might give the smell a chance to wear</li>
            <li> The case is beautiful with a lot of brushes but they are very soft</li>
            <li> The case is super cheap but the brushes are of good quality.</li>
            <li> That being said, this set a pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is great, and the black case it comes in is also very handy.  </li>
            <li> Overall, still a very good</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I love the quality of the brushes, also the case they came in was very cute.</li>
            <li> They are soft and great to work with.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSHES ARE VERYYYYYY SOFT AND FEEL GREAT WHEN YOU USE THEM.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I loved this product and it was a very affordable.</li>
            <li> So far, I love them!!</li>
            <li> The case makes it really easy to pack everything up.  </li>
            <li> SOME OF THE BRUSHES SHED EASILY ...</li>
            <li> SO I HAD TO SUPER GLUE IT!</li>
            <li> All of my brushes came with sleeves to protect the tops package was great and unharmed the only thing I didnt like was the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped that they would not be this cheap, but I would not recommend these, even at cheap price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> They are soft, good quality, and the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> the brushes are decent but i was kind of disapointed in the variety.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the ferrules have detatched from the handle, but that&#x27;s an easy fix with a lil super glue.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a lot of fun!   </li>
            <li> Also, she was surprised how cheap they were and how many there was for that price!</li>
            <li> When ordering a fairly priced makeup brush set the most important to me was a foundation brush as my lancome one broke in half two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li> She did not find either to be true.  </li>
            <li> so it took me a long time to find brushes that I really liked!</li>
            <li> Finally got some good makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes were okay for the price, although the heads of some of the brushes pop off the handle and are not secured on very well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and picked up product pretty good.</li>
            <li> i mean for 19$ these brushes are great!</li>
            <li> I mostly got this particular product because of the variety of eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and everything was in placed.</li>
            <li> so I used super glue gel to reattach them.  </li>
            <li> super....</li>
            <li> el estuche super bien&lt;br /&gt;la</li>
            <li> brushes look nice enough, good enough for someone like my mom who isn&#x27;t a die-hard brand snob.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase so far, i love the brushes and have not experienced any shedding yet.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, enough said.</li>
            <li> honestly, I like but if you don&#x27;t I would suggest just leaving it open for a couple days to get the smell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received it I found that the eyeshadow brushes are way too stuff to really be useful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this company manufactured so many different products until after I had ordered impulsively and went on the website cause I was excited.</li>
            <li> They are of good quality and I would recommend them to other ladies.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and are easy to wash.  </li>
            <li> Although these were great the first couple of weeks, all the sudden the handless ( the wood part) start to fall off, and now i am just left with the brush part of all of them.</li>
            <li> Good quality, I gave this product 4 stars because one of my brushes was bent a little bit.</li>
            <li> I wanted some brushes to start doing my eyeshadow blending better and this kit comes with all different kinds of brushes for blending, except for crease blending brush.</li>
            <li> I travel quite a bit and this case is pretty convenient.  </li>
            <li> The eye brushes also aren&#x27;t too big, which are perfect for my small features.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as it was stated.</li>
            <li> Would love to shop in future with them!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had the brushes for over a year; they hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li> but most are larger than i prefer.  </li>
            <li> When you get them the brushes smell weird but besides that they are perfect brushes.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> also the shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li> Although these are not super high-end MAC or Sigma brushes, Bundle Monster did a great job creating soft, non-shedding brushes that really pick up the makeup well.  </li>
            <li> The people who received the gifts loved them, it looked much more expensive.</li>
            <li> but that can be fixed with a good wash other than that</li>
            <li> They are really good brushes, very firm which I like.</li>
            <li> its such an easy fix</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and the handle is really long and nice.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft, and seem very durable.</li>
            <li> They are soft and do exactly the job I need them to do!</li>
            <li> The real benefit in buying this set is that you get lots of different brushes for really cheap.</li>
            <li> and it came really fast...</li>
            <li> but for ~$1/brush + case, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting all that much.</li>
            <li> They work very well</li>
            <li> and so I can&#x27;t really afford the 8$ MAC brushes</li>
            <li> I am very satisified with everything.</li>
            <li> The case looks cheap and doesn&#x27;t fold to a close properly.  </li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to choosing anything with makeup</li>
            <li> These probably won&#x27;t last me very long, but by then I&#x27;ll want to upgrade to better brushes!</li>
            <li> Not only are the brushes soft, but they are very full.</li>
            <li> You can probably fit a few more smaller brushes in here as well.   </li>
            <li> So far, I highly recommend, and will hopefully update after I have washed and used them for the first time.  </li>
            <li> worth it if you need a new case for your brushes, and also need new foundation and powder brushes, but expect to immediately throw a bunch of the brand-new brushes directly into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The case is also compact and decent for travel.</li>
            <li> When I used the brushes they were very soft and they blended very well.</li>
            <li> If you want additonal brushes, I highly recommend E.L.F.</li>
            <li> so well I would almost think they where high end brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes shed a little but are soft and seem to blend ok.  </li>
            <li> It also has this \\&quot;new plastic\\&quot; smell which</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted; a big set of brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo soft!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very impresed with the selection and quality.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve just started, I didn&#x27;t want to go out and get a complete set of MAC brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have never used makeup in my life - except for lip balm, lipstick and occasional concealer, which don&#x27;t really require brushes for application.</li>
            <li> Wow they are soooooooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a feather soft to the touch, it is just wonder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were extremely soft and didn&#x27;t lose their bristles.</li>
            <li> next very helpful judging by the fact</li>
            <li> Brushes are not particarly soft, don&#x27;t seem to hold makeup on brush well.</li>
            <li> am surprised at how it has held up.</li>
            <li> It not only can fit the brushes that came with the case, it can hold other brushes as well.</li>
            <li> They also traveled a very long way (Hawaii to Virginia) and still arrived within a reasonable length of time.  </li>
            <li> The mild plastic smell dissipated in a few days, and she found the brushes to be quite to her liking.  </li>
            <li> I will probably only continue to use my old blush brush and throw everything else away!</li>
            <li> There is only one small defect on the plastic brush for lashes and brows (some prongs sticks together) but it is probably easy to fix.</li>
            <li> I found myself just passing the brushes back and forth on the face, because they feel so soft.</li>
            <li> so it barely fits in my purse</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not great quality</li>
            <li> I noticed that the foundation applicator applies much nicer than other</li>
            <li> at first i was a little nervous about it</li>
            <li> The case it comes in does smell a little funny</li>
            <li> I have my large ELF powder brush, fan brush, a revlon dome brush, and several other brushes.</li>
            <li> but they are all the same stiff brush just with different shaped tips which really is kind of pointless.</li>
            <li> No strange smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like the black case.</li>
            <li> all the brushes were the same thickness, they are all pretty firm, i was thinking it would have a couple fluffier eyeshadow brushes</li>
            <li> There was a slight odor at first to the case, but it went away after a little while and the brushes felt very soft and never smelled.  </li>
            <li> The reason you can fit extra brushes is becuase the pockets for the smaller brushes can streatch just a little bit to hold two small burshes or just one smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the smell some of the other reviewers mentioned....</li>
            <li> SUCH A STRONG FAKE PLASTIC GROSS SMELL.  </li>
            <li> only gripe is the ferrules come loose</li>
            <li> they arrived all the brushes were off the wooden parts, had to glue them, I don&#x27;t send stuff back, I make due...</li>
            <li> They do shed a little bit and one of the brushes completely came out of its clasp -</li>
            <li> case is a bit larger than I expected</li>
            <li> I think I won&#x27;t be using this set for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I got the package 3 days earlier than expected</li>
            <li> The only concern with the brushes is the small fan one-it seems a little less full than what I wanted.</li>
            <li> However, one brush in my kit is completely unusable because with a slight tug, all of the bristles fell out!  </li>
            <li> actually ordered this one to replace old eyeshadow brushes, and so I was kind of annoyed that those particular brushes are worthless, so I went out and bought quality brushes at $20</li>
            <li> However, I would&#x27;ve preferred the smaller brushes to be fuller, and less flat.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal since I have a few from other palettes.  </li>
            <li> Although these brushes seemed pricey, but after reading some other reviews I ordered.  </li>
            <li> so I usually bring a smaller brush set with me when I go out, leaving this kit at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I havent found a need to use any other brushes since purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> had them for a very long time a few broke.</li>
            <li> The packaging just smelled like straight plastic and the brushes were mediocre.</li>
            <li> Cosmetic Brush Set Kit w/ Black Faux Crocodile Case -</li>
            <li> This is a typical case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\</li>
            <li> But they are inexpensive and work break for a little while.</li>
            <li> A little glue to hold the brush heads on the handle might fix the problem I had with them staying together.</li>
            <li> Such a cheap, plastic, nasty product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $&lt;br</li>
            <li> they fall apart after a few months.</li>
            <li> So, don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money.</li>
            <li> I shared with her some of the negative comments from other reviews regarding the plastic smell of the case and the roughness of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> the faux crocodile case has a strong chemical smell, it&#x27;s almost sickening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> the brushes are faded out after the first wash of using them what hold the brushes is also falling part very unhappy</li>
            <li> The blusher broke in about a week and the case has a horrible plastic offgassing smell that is still strong after a week.  </li>
            <li> the brushes won&#x27;t even hold my make up.. too soft and I try washing it, but only got worst.</li>
            <li> The heads of the brushes fell off at least 4 of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Sorry just wasted my money..</li>
            <li> These brushes were very hard, did not apply any type of makeup well at all.</li>
            <li> Other than that the brushes themselves are not so bad.</li>
            <li> Such a horrible product.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> I know, you get what you pay for, but these brushes were still a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> it has a really bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> i dont understand why anyone would give bad comments ...</li>
            <li> the one bad thing is it doesnt have a blending brush</li>
            <li> WHICH IS RATHER ANNOYING!</li>

            <li> I just got it in the mail today. Overall, I am very impresed with the selection and quality. I mostly got this particular product because of the variety of eyeshadow brushes. The brushes are super soft, and seem very durable. The bigger brushes come with plastic &#x27;brush guards&#x27;. My favorite brush is the foundation brush which feels amazing on my skin. Not only are the brushes soft, but they are very full. The only concern with the brushes is the small fan one-it seems a little less full than what I wanted. But, it does seem sturdy/durable. With regards to the case, it is amazing. It not only can fit the brushes that came with the case, it can hold other brushes as well. I have my large ELF powder brush, fan brush, a revlon dome brush, and several other brushes. The case even closes with extra brushes in it. This will be amazing for travel. The reason you can fit extra brushes is becuase the pockets for the smaller brushes can streatch just a little bit to hold two small burshes or just one smaller brushes. So far, I highly recommend, and will hopefully update after I have washed and used them for the first time.  The kit has enough for a beginner while also providing room to grow. If you want additonal brushes, I highly recommend E.L.F. While the cheap price may throw you off, they are amazing. My favorite is ELF Eyeshadow \\&quot;C\\&quot; brush.</li>
            <li> When ordering a fairly priced makeup brush set the most important to me was a foundation brush as my lancome one broke in half two weeks ago. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase so far, i love the brushes and have not experienced any shedding yet. I will probably only continue to use my old blush brush and throw everything else away! It does have that gross plasticy smell but I&#x27;m waiting on a brush organizer so i can throw the tacky case away. Didn&#x27;t realize this company manufactured so many different products until after I had ordered impulsively and went on the website cause I was excited. Probably won&#x27;t order from this company again as I question brands that don&#x27;t specialize in their crafts but if I were to see great offer hey maybe I&#x27;ll take a gamble.</li>
            <li> If you want a lot of brushes but dont want to pay a lot of money, then this is going to be the kit for you. I wanted some brushes to start doing my eyeshadow blending better and this kit comes with all different kinds of brushes for blending, except for crease blending brush. It came packaged nicely and each and every brush has a plastic cover around it. When I used the brushes they were very soft and they blended very well. I havent seen any kind of shedding yet and I have been using them for about a week.</li>
            <li> Up until recently, I&#x27;ve only worn eyeliner and mascara on a daily basis.  I&#x27;ve been gaining more interest in make up and I figured getting a set of brushes was a good idea. Since I&#x27;ve just started, I didn&#x27;t want to go out and get a complete set of MAC brushes.  That being said, this set a pretty good for me.  They&#x27;re decent quality for the price. I can test out the different kinds of brushes and learn what each is for.  It&#x27;s been a lot of fun!   They&#x27;re soft and are easy to wash.  However, one brush in my kit is completely unusable because with a slight tug, all of the bristles fell out!  It was one of the eyeshadow brushes, so I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal since I have a few from other palettes.  One of the blush brushes handle just fell off when I was just using it.  That wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal because I just glued it back on.    The case makes it really easy to pack everything up.  I travel quite a bit and this case is pretty convenient.  You can probably fit a few more smaller brushes in here as well.   Overall, you should know that you get what you pay for.  These probably won&#x27;t last me very long, but by then I&#x27;ll want to upgrade to better brushes!</li>
            <li> Although these brushes seemed pricey, but after reading some other reviews I ordered.  The quality is great. I noticed that the foundation applicator applies much nicer than other I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. The case is nice as well. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> the brushes are decent but i was kind of disapointed in the variety. all the brushes were the same thickness, they are all pretty firm, i was thinking it would have a couple fluffier eyeshadow brushes but they are all the same stiff brush just with different shaped tips which really is kind of pointless. i like the case they came in though lol</li>
            <li> The brushes are of good quality.  The larger brushes are perfect.  However, I would&#x27;ve preferred the smaller brushes to be fuller, and less flat.  Overall, still a very good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell some of the other reviewers mentioned....that&#x27;s just the smell of plastic.  It&#x27;s not a big deal and happens when anything plastic like that is enclosed in a mail shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Buy!</li>
            <li> Plz plz plz don&#x27;t buy this if u want nice makeup , it doesn&#x27;t do what it say it do</li>
            <li> at first i was a little nervous about it and it came really fast...my only problem is thatwen you opened it it has a really bad smell to it. so i left it opened and let it air out over night and they smell went away..this is a perfect gift for a makeup addict.</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes, I even bought two of them. One for me and another as a gift. Really good material</li>
            <li> I have never used makeup in my life - except for lip balm, lipstick and occasional concealer, which don&#x27;t really require brushes for application. That being said, I think this makeup brush kit is a great place to start for a beginner. They do shed a little bit and one of the brushes completely came out of its clasp - but for ~$1/brush + case, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting all that much. The eye brushes also aren&#x27;t too big, which are perfect for my small features. The case is also compact and decent for travel. Overall, it&#x27;s a good buy and I would definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re just getting into makeup.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and everything was in placed. You get everything you see in pictures. The brushes are soft and picked up product pretty good. I haven&#x27;t got any shedding since I bought it so that was a plus. The only downside is the smell but you can air out the makeup case and theres no blending crease brush. But still this is the best purchased and I recommend if your in a budget.</li>
            <li> When I reiceved it I was pleased with the varitey of the brushes. They work very well and I plan to use them on my upcoming cruise</li>
            <li> I really liked the brushes sent. They are perfect for travel and arrived in a beautiful case. I would recommend this product to everyone who needs an inexpensive but good brush set. They were a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes a day in advance of the estimated arrival and that by itself is great. I was exicted to get them in the mail today, and must say how chic the case is. The brushes, OMG. Wow they are soooooooooooo soft. It&#x27;s like a feather soft to the touch, it is just wonder. I found myself just passing the brushes back and forth on the face, because they feel so soft. I am definitely a happy customer and I a very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I love the quality of the brushes, also the case they came in was very cute. I am very pleased with my order!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not great quality but they do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old and so I can&#x27;t really afford the 8$ MAC brushes so I settled for this. I&#x27;m really surprised with the quality. They are really good brushes, very firm which I like. They are different shapes and sizes and I really love the case too. It also has this \\&quot;new plastic\\&quot; smell which honestly, I like but if you don&#x27;t I would suggest just leaving it open for a couple days to get the smell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great product. I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit based on the 4-star rating. When I received it I found that the eyeshadow brushes are way too stuff to really be useful. The powder and foundation brushes are great, the lip and eyeliner brushes are excellent, if a bit long (but bristles are easy to trim). The fan brush is okay, and the case is okay as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is a bit larger than I expected (I neglected to measure my purse before ordering the brush set) so it barely fits in my purse so I usually bring a smaller brush set with me when I go out, leaving this kit at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ordered this one to replace old eyeshadow brushes, and so I was kind of annoyed that those particular brushes are worthless, so I went out and bought quality brushes at $20 a pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do not bother with the eyebrow brush/comb, and it is already falling apart just from being in the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it if you need a new case for your brushes, and also need new foundation and powder brushes, but expect to immediately throw a bunch of the brand-new brushes directly into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Update months later -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use some of the brushes that came with the set but threw away most of them. I kept the larger ones since they work well for foundation, bronzer, blush, etc. and kept one of the smaller brushes for lip color but the others left a lot to be desired. Also, the brushes I did keep fell apart; the metal crimp does not hold the handles well so I used super glue gel to reattach them.  I still like the case though!</li>
            <li> Great selection of brushes, but the quality of the brushes is lacking. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap set I would get these, but if you&#x27;re looking to spoil yourself I would keep shopping around!</li>
            <li> I had ordered 4 of these as Christmas presents for others and was so impressed when they arrived that I had to order another set for myself.  Again, I was very impressed by the quality of the brushes and the quantity especially for the price.  They also traveled a very long way (Hawaii to Virginia) and still arrived within a reasonable length of time.  I am very satisified with everything.</li>
            <li> All of my brushes came with sleeves to protect the tops package was great and unharmed the only thing I didnt like was the smell but that can be fixed with a good wash other than that im happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005F11WP6 Bundle Monster 15pc Studio Pro Makeup Make Up Cosmetic Brush Set Kit w/ Black Faux Crocodile Case - For Eye Shadow, Blush, Eyeliner, Etc.]]Awesome product, the price super....I recommend ...!</li>
            <li> I know, you get what you pay for, but these brushes were still a disappointment.  The blusher broke in about a week and the case has a horrible plastic offgassing smell that is still strong after a week.  I&#x27;d hoped that they would not be this cheap, but I would not recommend these, even at cheap price.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and would not recommend it to anyone. The brushes are cheaply made. I do like the case that they came in.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of brushes for that price and I really like the black case. There is only one small defect on the plastic brush for lashes and brows (some prongs sticks together) but it is probably easy to fix.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 year old daughter.  She loves the set.  She has more brushes than she knows what to do with.  I shared with her some of the negative comments from other reviews regarding the plastic smell of the case and the roughness of the brushes.  She did not find either to be true.  The mild plastic smell dissipated in a few days, and she found the brushes to be quite to her liking.  Great value!</li>
            <li> This is a typical case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot;  The real benefit in buying this set is that you get lots of different brushes for really cheap. The brushes shed a little but are soft and seem to blend ok.  The case looks cheap and doesn&#x27;t fold to a close properly.  I think I won&#x27;t be using this set for a long time.  Maybe it would have been smarter to invest in a better quality set from the beginning.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes defected. The paint on the brushes is smudged. On top of everything, the brushes and the case smells. The description for this item doesnt match the product that I received at all.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as it was stated. Great service and got my items on time. Would love to shop in future with them!!!</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to choosing anything with makeup so it took me a long time to find brushes that I really liked! I researched a lot before I decided that I would buy these brushes.  So far, I love them!! They are soft and do exactly the job I need them to do! The packaging is great, and the black case it comes in is also very handy.  It came undamaged and I am very happy with it! Finally got some good makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes were extremely soft and didn&#x27;t lose their bristles. Good quality, I gave this product 4 stars because one of my brushes was bent a little bit. Otherwise I loved this product and it was a very affordable.</li>
            <li> I really liked these make up brushes, good value for the money.  Brushes came in a nice case and I gave them as gifts.  The people who received the gifts loved them, it looked much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Although these were great the first couple of weeks, all the sudden the handless ( the wood part) start to fall off, and now i am just left with the brush part of all of them.</li>
            <li> One of the gifts I got my girlfriend this year for christmas. As soon as I put it in my cart many suggestions came up as to what to buy next very helpful judging by the fact I didn&#x27;t know what the hell to get her this year. Waisted almost no time at all showing up at my doorstep :)</li>
            <li> i love my brushes  had them for a very long time a few broke. they are worth their price and great for beginners.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $&lt;br /&gt;If you want brushes spend the $$$ on good brushes!&lt;br /&gt;When they arrived all the brushes were off the wooden parts, had to glue them, I don&#x27;t send stuff back, I make due...&lt;br /&gt;The bristles all feel like acrylic on your face...&lt;br /&gt;CRAP</li>
            <li> Brushes are not particarly soft, don&#x27;t seem to hold makeup on brush well. No shedding which is a plus. Sephora has better brushes</li>
            <li> My daughter could not be happier with her make up brush set. She was very pleased. They were as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Sorry just wasted my money.. the brushes won&#x27;t even hold my make up.. too soft and I try washing it, but only got worst.</li>
            <li> would give 10 stars if i could,its just perfect ...... i dont understand why anyone would give bad comments ...</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, enough said. very smooth on brush on perfectly</li>
            <li> Love the case and the brushes :)</li>
            <li> I use these brushes alot.  Sometimes the ferrules have detatched from the handle, but that&#x27;s an easy fix with a lil super glue.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with shedding and I&#x27;ve had the brushes for over a year; they hold up pretty well. the eyeshadow brushes work great but most are larger than i prefer.  I love the tinier brushes they work great. the case is nice too. No strange smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the ferrules come loose so consider that, but it doesnt&#x27; bother me bc its such an easy fix</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted; a big set of brushes! They are soft, good quality, and the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> convenient to carry in wallet size, brushes are good quality, nice and practical.  The case is very nice, safe and has a premium appearance</li>
            <li> Great brushes but they fall apart after a few months. But they are inexpensive and work break for a little while.</li>
            <li> All these brushes are amazing. They work well and have the softest touch I have experienced in make up applicators. I havent found a need to use any other brushes since purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Brushes are great they dont fall apart at all and hold the make up nicely. Easy to clean</li>
            <li> When you get them the brushes smell weird but besides that they are perfect brushes. They are soft and great to work with.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. The brushes are so soft and the handle is really long and nice. I would really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The case is beautiful with a lot of brushes but they are very soft therefore they aren&#x27;t good to make up.</li>
            <li> These brushes were very hard, did not apply any type of makeup well at all. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to get this brush set.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift that I gave to someone. What I liked about it is that it arrived on time, but it had a strong odor to it. That was the only downer  to this product.</li>
            <li> I  absolutely love these brushes the met my needs and more they are inexpensive but they apply my makeup so well I would almost think they where high end brushes. If your thinking about getting some quality but low end makeup brushes I would suggest you try these!!!</li>
            <li> I still have these brushes after over two years of usage. have experienced NO SHEDDING. for such a price, it is awesome. i bought these when i started using makeup and did not want anything experience. am surprised at how it has held up. would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE... THE BRUSHES ARE VERYYYYYY SOFT AND FEEL GREAT WHEN YOU USE THEM. i REALLLYYY RECOMMAND THIS YOU WILL LOVE IT LIKE ME AND BE HAPPPY WITH IT.</li>
            <li> my case falling  part the brushes are faded out after the first wash of using them what hold the brushes is also falling part very unhappy</li>
            <li> I OPENED IT AND TWO BRUSHES WERE NOT ATTACHED TO THE HANDLE SO I HAD TO SUPER GLUE IT! SOME OF THE BRUSHES SHED EASILY ... WHICH IS RATHER ANNOYING! I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOME GREAT QUALITY BRUSHES FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these brushes. They are very full, soft and work perfect for my makeup. They are of good quality and I would recommend them to other ladies. There are alot of brushes in this set and there is a brush for every need.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice and great quality. The case is super cheap but the brushes are of good quality.</li>
            <li> Such a horrible product. The brushes are made out of cheap material that don&#x27;t even let you apply the makeup nicely. So, don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money. Such a cheap, plastic, nasty product.</li>
            <li> The packaging just smelled like straight plastic and the brushes were mediocre. The brushes all fell off the stick. You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo soft! i mean for 19$ these brushes are great! The case it comes in does smell a little funny but it is adorable! also the shipping was so fast! the one bad thing is it doesnt have a blending brush so i did have to get a mac 217 brush but its all good(:</li>
            <li> Although these are not super high-end MAC or Sigma brushes, Bundle Monster did a great job creating soft, non-shedding brushes that really pick up the makeup well.  There was a slight odor at first to the case, but it went away after a little while and the brushes felt very soft and never smelled.  Shipping was also great- I got the package 3 days earlier than expected so that was a nice surprise.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like em at all</li>
            <li> Product delivered to me on time. The brushes were okay for the price, although the heads of some of the brushes pop off the handle and are not secured on very well. My biggest concern was the rancid stench coming from the case the brushes came in. Smelled of formaldehyde. Had to throw the case away. Other than that the brushes themselves are not so bad. A little glue to hold the brush heads on the handle might fix the problem I had with them staying together. They should sell these without the case.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend does not have any complaints, would order from them again and would recommend this to my family &amp; friends. Also, she was surprised how cheap they were and how many there was for that price! Thank you again for everything!</li>
            <li> I found these to be good quality brushes for the price. Would definitely recommend to friends, especially as a starter kit.</li>
            <li> undle Monster Cosmetic Brush Set was a birthday gift for my niece. She loved it. It had all the make-up brushes that she needed.</li>
            <li> The brushes were falling apart basically as soon as I got them. They&#x27;re pretty much useless. I attempted to use 5 but I gave up after the 3rd use.</li>
            <li> el estuche super bien&lt;br /&gt;la hebra como decia la descripcion&lt;br /&gt;el estuche muy fuerte y de calidad&lt;br /&gt;super comodo me gustaron mucho</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes as a gift for my mom&#x27;s birthday.  The packaging it comes in is nice (looks like a croc wallet) and looks like it will travel nicely.  However, the smell instantly hit me the minute I opened the box from Amazon.  SUCH A STRONG FAKE PLASTIC GROSS SMELL.  I am glad I am not gifting these till mid-January, might give the smell a chance to wear off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes look nice enough, good enough for someone like my mom who isn&#x27;t a die-hard brand snob.  I think she will be happy with these.</li>
            <li> The heads of the brushes fell off at least 4 of the brushes. They ended up in my trash can within one month of purchase. Sad.</li>
            <li> the faux crocodile case has a strong chemical smell, it&#x27;s almost sickening. the brushes are nice. i think i&#x27;ve used every brush now, they&#x27;re great for the price! why so smelly, though? hahah.</li>
