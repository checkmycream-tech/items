            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how awesome it works with the UV lamp.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product!!</li>
            <li>the best shine ever.</li>
            <li>It was the best!  </li>
            <li>very good results</li>
            <li>The best top coat on the planet!</li>
            <li>So happy with this product</li>
            <li>It works great for me</li>
            <li>and they still look great.  </li>
            <li>and they still look great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is where this wonderful bottle of Top Coat comes into the picture.  </li>
            <li>I have also heard that they have good deals on it at times!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then it also says best results if used with UV light. ??</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>This is the most incredible top coat polish!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It is like magic n a mani or pedi, keeps the polish on for weeks!</li>
            <li>and I love the shine it gives!</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice during application, and the shine, once this top coat dries, is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I bought Rock Top Coat after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li>And the shine it gives your nails is nice too.</li>
            <li>Even if you use a cheapie nail polish color (you know how those chip fast), when you use this as a top coat, you will have glossy and utterly flawless nails!</li>
            <li>I liked the Revlon Colorstay because it came with its own top coat.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this top coat!</li>
            <li>I ordered two more bottles! :-)</li>
            <li>Makes a nice top coat.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best top coat for SHINE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.....</li>
            <li>After two days my nails were chipping at the top.  </li>
            <li>This top coat kept my nails from chipping for a couple days, then it started cracking toward the top of my nails, causing the polish to flake off.</li>
            <li>Top Coat - sit 5 minutes then go under UV lamp for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I finally found a top coat that makes my nails look beautiful AND lasts!</li>
            <li>This top coat was recommended to me years ago by a nail salon</li>
            <li>Which is why I cannot use it any more.</li>
            <li>It lasts for more than a week, even two weeks (assuming you don&#x27;t bite or pick at your nails).  </li>
            <li>and so I now mostly buy and use Avon nail polish.  </li>
            <li>more because of the color selection.  </li>
            <li>You just need one top coat and you are all set.  </li>
            <li>But for those on a budget, try this top coat</li>
            <li>Most top coats promise not to chip</li>

            <li>Most top coats promise not to chip</li>
            <li>I like that about this top coat.</li>
            <li>I shrugged that off and just touched up that nail when I got home and reapplied more of this top coat to the rest of my fingers.</li>
            <li>i painted my nails and put the top coat</li>
            <li>What woman doesn&#x27;t see another woman with a beautiful manicure (be it natural, gel or acrylic) and not want to drop everything and head to the nearest nail salon.  </li>
            <li>love this top coat, as it shines so bright, and looks like the job of a professional!</li>
            <li>just a friendly warning to anyone who loves nail stamping and want to use this top coat</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>this keeps my nails strong and chip free.  </li>
            <li>This top coat dries quickly without UV light.</li>
            <li>I am a shine freak when it comes to manicures, &amp; this product is fantastic for that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this on for about a week, with a cheap 99 cent polish color</li>
            <li>I have used this 3 times now, and am amazed that my nails have remained chip free...</li>
            <li>Good for natural nails.</li>
            <li>The Rock is well worth the cost - and my nails are STILL shiny!</li>
            <li>had used Rock Top Coat in the past and remember it being a good top coat</li>
            <li>I also use Magic Nail nail strengthener and that has really helped too.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a top coat that gives this much shine.</li>
            <li>From glancing at other reviews, you will note that most are satisfied with this top coat.  </li>

            <li>I thought if was a first time fluke, but Rock Top has consistently maintained my manicure.  </li>
            <li>and i waited until my nails were good and dry....</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>With Rock Top Coat, I can say that it last over 5 days and for some women (like me) that is good enough.  </li>

            <li>but this week i&#x27;m going to try using it by combining it with Sally Hansen&#x27;s &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34; crystal clear top coat.</li>
            <li>Sally&#x27;s has a very dumb-person friendly return policy.  </li>
            <li>If you like a high gloss that really and truly lasts and keeps that shine, this is the top coat for you.  </li>
            <li>I could scrape it all right off my nails.</li>
            <li>I have it on right now</li>
            <li>I have it on right now</li>
            <li>I have purchased mine from Sally Beauty Salon, and it is a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Actually, my favorite polish is the $1 tiny bottle &#x27;Sally Girl&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>am planning to purchase a UV lamp, and after doing some research, have heard that the top coat only takes 2-3 minutes to cure when used with a UV</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another time I thought that if I put 2 coats of Rock Top Coat it would last longer but it just made it thicker.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another time I thought that if I put 2 coats of Rock Top Coat it would last longer but it just made it thicker.  </li>
            <li>when i applied this top coat, my design smudged on three different fingers.</li>
            <li>Great shine, last long!</li>
            <li>I have had no problems letting it dry and having great nails, even without a UV lamp or sitting outside in the sun.</li>
            <li>The three stars come from the fact that it does indeed, as promised, dry very quickly!</li>
            <li>top coat dries fairly fast, but I am a perfectionist, so I always wait 30-60 minutes for my second coat of polish to dry before I apply the Rock top coat.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t initially like the thin consistency as a topcoat, but now I use it as a refresher on top of a few-days-old manicure to give great long-lasting shine &amp; hardness.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it dries pretty fast too and works well with all polishes.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my manicure lasted more that FOUR days, and that&#x27;s with being really rough on my nails.  </li>
            <li>If for some reason it lets you down (it won&#x27;t...), you can return it, get your $7 back and just be happy with the nude look on your nails.</li>
            <li>Now all I have to do is slap on two colors of nail polish (I really don&#x27;t think the brand matters) and one coat of Rock Top Coat and I dry them under the UV lamp</li>
            <li>but I would strongly encourage spending at least $50 bucks on a UV lamp because that does harden the top coat to a shiny gloss that won&#x27;t chip.  </li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t find that it dries fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good quality top coat to help my at-home natural nail manicures last at least a week.  </li>
            <li>My nails were still very flexible with this product on.</li>
            <li>I started using this but did not see much of an improvement</li>
            <li>YES, it works very well.</li>
            <li>So one day I ask this girl at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store to recommend a good topcoat that will preserve my manicure for at least 3 days.  </li>
            <li>I also used it this week after my professional manicure, I simply came home and added 1 top coat and used my UV lamp to seal it.  </li>
            <li>I have searched for years and spent too much money looking for a NO CHIP top coat that has high shine.  </li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere, so decided to try their other product &amp;#34;Rock Top Coat.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>i realized that that little baby knock had knocked OFF a good fourth of the polish of my finger!</li>
            <li>The previous time I used the Rock Top Coat, it lasted almost 2 weeks with no chipping (THAT IS NO LIE).  </li>
            <li>The previous time I used the Rock Top Coat, it lasted almost 2 weeks with no chipping (THAT IS NO LIE).  </li>
            <li>She recommended Rock Top only because of what it said on the bottle (last 5x times).  </li>
            <li>I actually had someone ask me if I got my nails done professionally multiple times after using this top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having said that, if the next top coat I try is not as glossy, and doesn&#x27;t keep my manicure like Rock does, I will be back!!</li>
            <li>Before buying Rock top coat, a manicure would only last 24 hours before either chipping or peeling.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>then where I normally get it.</li>
            <li>On day four, the tips of my a couple of my nails (right hand index eye poker finger and my right foul gesturing middle finger) started to show tiny evidence of nail polish wear, but it still wasn&#x27;t peeling or chipping.  </li>
            <li>It has a stronger off-putting odor than usual topcoats &amp; nail polish, but I&#x27;ll gladly tolerate it for the shine.</li>
            <li>Also, it starts turning the colored polish into a dingy, less vibrant shade of its original color.</li>
            <li>I got better results from Sally Hanson&#x27;s hard as acrylic silk wraps.</li>
            <li>If you have a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store near you, buy it from them.  </li>
            <li>For a while my nails were blotchy and so soft that they would peel.  </li>
            <li>I just want to have professional looking nails during the work week.  </li>
            <li>I just want to have professional looking nails during the work week.  </li>
            <li>In the past when I did my own manicures, there were only two nail polishes that had lasting power on MY nails.  </li>
            <li>it does make regular polish last a little longer, but not a week or more.  </li>
            <li>This is not a good top coat if you like to do nail stamping art.</li>
            <li>Crystal Clear dries super fast and is very hard, but it chips.</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s Thursday - on a few tiny chips on my right hand index finger.  </li>
            <li>and I am barely seeing a tiny chip at the edges of my dominant hand and</li>
            <li>but they always chip within the first few days.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it dries fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good quality top coat to help my at-home natural nail manicures last at least a week.  </li>
            <li> My nails were still very flexible with this product on.</li>
            <li> I started using this but did not see much of an improvement</li>
            <li> YES, it works very well.</li>
            <li> So one day I ask this girl at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store to recommend a good topcoat that will preserve my manicure for at least 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I also used it this week after my professional manicure, I simply came home and added 1 top coat and used my UV lamp to seal it.  </li>
            <li> I have searched for years and spent too much money looking for a NO CHIP top coat that has high shine.  </li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere, so decided to try their other product &amp;#34;Rock Top Coat.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> i realized that that little baby knock had knocked OFF a good fourth of the polish of my finger!</li>
            <li> The previous time I used the Rock Top Coat, it lasted almost 2 weeks with no chipping (THAT IS NO LIE).  </li>
            <li> The previous time I used the Rock Top Coat, it lasted almost 2 weeks with no chipping (THAT IS NO LIE).  </li>
            <li> She recommended Rock Top only because of what it said on the bottle (last 5x times).  </li>
            <li> I actually had someone ask me if I got my nails done professionally multiple times after using this top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having said that, if the next top coat I try is not as glossy, and doesn&#x27;t keep my manicure like Rock does, I will be back!!</li>
            <li> Before buying Rock top coat, a manicure would only last 24 hours before either chipping or peeling.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> then where I normally get it.</li>
            <li> On day four, the tips of my a couple of my nails (right hand index eye poker finger and my right foul gesturing middle finger) started to show tiny evidence of nail polish wear, but it still wasn&#x27;t peeling or chipping.  </li>
            <li> It has a stronger off-putting odor than usual topcoats &amp; nail polish, but I&#x27;ll gladly tolerate it for the shine.</li>
            <li> Also, it starts turning the colored polish into a dingy, less vibrant shade of its original color.</li>
            <li> I got better results from Sally Hanson&#x27;s hard as acrylic silk wraps.</li>
            <li> If you have a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store near you, buy it from them.  </li>
            <li> For a while my nails were blotchy and so soft that they would peel.  </li>
            <li> I just want to have professional looking nails during the work week.  </li>
            <li> I just want to have professional looking nails during the work week.  </li>
            <li> In the past when I did my own manicures, there were only two nail polishes that had lasting power on MY nails.  </li>
            <li> it does make regular polish last a little longer, but not a week or more.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good top coat if you like to do nail stamping art.</li>
            <li> Crystal Clear dries super fast and is very hard, but it chips.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s Thursday - on a few tiny chips on my right hand index finger.  </li>
            <li> and I am barely seeing a tiny chip at the edges of my dominant hand and</li>
            <li> but they always chip within the first few days.  </li>
            <li> but they always chip within the first few days.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dull quickly like other topcoats tend to do.</li>
            <li> I live in the midwest, so I don&#x27;t have the year round option to dry it in the sun.</li>
            <li> One of the reason&#x27;s why I could never keep my nails consistantly looking good is because the stupid nail polish would chip/peel after a day or so.  </li>
            <li> However, I am rough on my hands, they are constantly washed and exposed to cleaning chemicals.  </li>
            <li> polish dry- check&lt;</li>
            <li> BUT...it takes FOREVER to dry.</li>
            <li> Used it last night over my polish, and in less than 24 hours my polish is chipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nursing assistant at a busy hospital, and the job is hard on my nails.  </li>
            <li> have absolutely NO complaints about this product, as it has help up to my expectations, as well as exceeded them.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not really saying i dislike the product...i&#x27;m going to continue to use it, in fact,</li>
            <li> The Rock is usually dry to the touch after about 5 minutes, but I usually wait 45 minutes before I touch anything (again, I&#x27;m a perfectionist, so I don&#x27;t want to risk having to do my nails all over again the next day!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the length of time it takes to dry.  </li>
            <li> Top Secrets Base Coat dry- check&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
            <li> It beats ALL other products that I have ever tried ...</li>
            <li> Like other women, I went and bought nail products that promised to harden my nails and make them grow.  </li>
            <li> Just like with other products, it all depends on the person.  </li>
            <li> it usually will last 5 to 7 days.  </li>
            <li> I thought for sure it was a gimmick, just like all those stupid diet pills that lie to your FACE on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but still I don&#x27;t have to worry because it last at least a week if not more.eauty</li>
            <li> Used it as a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I used it as a base and top coat for two weeks, and didn&#x27;t crack or break a nail.</li>
            <li> but when i looked down at my hand</li>
            <li> I just rediscovered this product again after I bought it a yr &amp; a half</li>
            <li> At  times I prefer this than gel nails because it is easier to change the polish, less time, and less money.</li>
            <li> I could care less if they chip on the weekend</li>
            <li> I could care less if they chip on the weekend</li>
            <li> But my issue is this: i painted my nails on Sunday, reapplied another coat on Monday, then on Tuesday when I was getting in my car and buckling up my finger slightly hit the plastic part of the buckle....</li>
            <li> I always mess up my nails using this.</li>
            <li> but still I don&#x27;t have to worry because it last at least a week if not more.</li>
            <li> So, I purchased it and used it with those little $1 &#x27;Sally Girl&#x27; nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> I was one of those woman; however,  I am no longer one due to the fact that I got a nail fungus infection this past winter.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of $11.00.</li>
            <li> The product never fully dried on my nails.</li>
            <li> The directions say that no light is needed.</li>
            <li> They have vibrant and funky colors when I feel like going crazy on my nail</li>
            <li> This little bottle will last for quite a few manicures and you will save tons of money that you spend at the salon on fake nails and a tip to the manicurist.  </li>

            <li> Nails look like little candies on my fingers!  </li>
            <li> Finally on the sixth day I got bored of the polish and wiped it off.  </li>
            <li> - I am HARD on my nails.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t wast your money on Hard as a rock x5.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t even a hard hit....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think i&#x27;m all that hard on my hands.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to at least 7 of my friends and all have submitted their orders for it.  </li>
            <li> My polish is shiny and lasts for at least 10 days...like a gel finish.  </li>
            <li> DONT waste money and time on gel nails, or gel products!!  </li>
            <li> I was shocked when after the third day, my polish had not chipped or peeling.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even worry about being rough on my hands like some woman do because they are afraid of chipping a nail.  </li>

            <li> I mean NOTHING!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find both products together, so BUY THEM HERE!!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter if I used expensive foo-foo department store nail polish or the stuff that promises to stay on your nails till death</li>
            <li> so I bought it at Sally Hansens Beauty Supply Store (sorry Amazon).  </li>
            <li> Supply Store (sorry Amazon).  </li>
            <li> nothing wrong with giving it a try  </li>
            <li> is there something im doing wrong?</li>
            <li> I got so desperate that I started looking for vitamins to make my nails grow.  </li>
            <li> And you know once that darn polish starts peeling, it&#x27;s impossible to just leave the rest alone.  </li>
            <li> I used it in conjunction with the base coat and a UV lamp.  </li>
            <li> REALLY??&lt;br /&gt;Stuff is crap.</li>
            <li> hated looking at my nails because I couldn&#x27;t even put nail polish on it to hide the blotches as the polish would chip off after a day or two.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> You should also by the base coat, and you can by both on this site!!  </li>

            <li> I just rediscovered this product again after I bought it a yr &amp; a half ago &amp; forgot about it (I bought it elsewhere). I didn&#x27;t initially like the thin consistency as a topcoat, but now I use it as a refresher on top of a few-days-old manicure to give great long-lasting shine &amp; hardness. It has a stronger off-putting odor than usual topcoats &amp; nail polish, but I&#x27;ll gladly tolerate it for the shine. I am a shine freak when it comes to manicures, &amp; this product is fantastic for that. Doesn&#x27;t dull quickly like other topcoats tend to do.</li>
            <li> One of the reason&#x27;s why I could never keep my nails consistantly looking good is because the stupid nail polish would chip/peel after a day or so.  It didn&#x27;t matter if I used expensive foo-foo department store nail polish or the stuff that promises to stay on your nails till death does you apart by acetone.  And you know once that darn polish starts peeling, it&#x27;s impossible to just leave the rest alone.  I think we all have a fetish with peeling things and we just can&#x27;t let it be.  My problems also gets compounded by the fact that I have been a nail biter since my embryo days, and the only way I show mercy to my nails is if they are manicured.  So one day I ask this girl at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store to recommend a good topcoat that will preserve my manicure for at least 3 days.  She recommended Rock Top only because of what it said on the bottle (last 5x times).  I thought for sure it was a gimmick, just like all those stupid diet pills that lie to your FACE on the bottle.  Still, I had nothing to lose.  Sally&#x27;s has a very dumb-person friendly return policy.  So, I purchased it and used it with those little $1 &#x27;Sally Girl&#x27; nail polishes.  I also use Magic Nail nail strengthener and that has really helped too.  I was shocked when after the third day, my polish had not chipped or peeling.  I mean NOTHING!  On day four, the tips of my a couple of my nails (right hand index eye poker finger and my right foul gesturing middle finger) started to show tiny evidence of nail polish wear, but it still wasn&#x27;t peeling or chipping.  Finally on the sixth day I got bored of the polish and wiped it off.  I thought if was a first time fluke, but Rock Top has consistently maintained my manicure.  Oh, and it dries pretty fast too and works well with all polishes.  Actually, my favorite polish is the $1 tiny bottle &#x27;Sally Girl&#x27;.  That manicure lasts through dishwashing, putting on too-tight jeans, cat fights, and even gardening.  I highly recommend it.  If you have a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store near you, buy it from them.  It&#x27;s the same price.  If for some reason it lets you down (it won&#x27;t...), you can return it, get your $7 back and just be happy with the nude look on your nails.</li>
            <li> I have searched for years and spent too much money looking for a NO CHIP top coat that has high shine.  I&#x27;ve bought seche, opi, and others and none compare to the shine and hardness of this one \\&quot;Rock\\&quot;.  Even if you use a cheapie nail polish color (you know how those chip fast), when you use this as a top coat, you will have glossy and utterly flawless nails! I&#x27;ve had this on for about a week, with a cheap 99 cent polish color and I am barely seeing a tiny chip at the edges of my dominant hand and the shine is still as glossy as before.  Nails look like little candies on my fingers!  What a keeper!!  Don&#x27;t snooze, buy this one, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> very good results if you take your time. I don&#x27;t find that it dries fast but it works well no chips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good quality top coat to help my at-home natural nail manicures last at least a week.  I got this product last week, did my nails on Friday and now it&#x27;s Thursday - on a few tiny chips on my right hand index finger.  Did I mention I type for a living, 40+ hours a week transcribing, and I do dishes and housework - I am HARD on my nails.  The Rock is well worth the cost - and my nails are STILL shiny!</li>
            <li> Was not as &amp;#34;hard as a rick&amp;#34; as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this top coat! I have not purchased it through Amazon, however I have thought about it, until I noticed that it was a but pricier then where I normally get it. I have purchased mine from Sally Beauty Salon, and it is a very reasonable price. I have also heard that they have good deals on it at times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this top coat, as it shines so bright, and looks like the job of a professional! I actually had someone ask me if I got my nails done professionally multiple times after using this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top coat dries fairly fast, but I am a perfectionist, so I always wait 30-60 minutes for my second coat of polish to dry before I apply the Rock top coat. I live in the midwest, so I don&#x27;t have the year round option to dry it in the sun. I have had no problems letting it dry and having great nails, even without a UV lamp or sitting outside in the sun. The Rock is usually dry to the touch after about 5 minutes, but I usually wait 45 minutes before I touch anything (again, I&#x27;m a perfectionist, so I don&#x27;t want to risk having to do my nails all over again the next day!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am planning to purchase a UV lamp, and after doing some research, have heard that the top coat only takes 2-3 minutes to cure when used with a UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely NO complaints about this product, as it has help up to my expectations, as well as exceeded them. I can&#x27;t wait to see how awesome it works with the UV lamp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading rave reviews.  It&#x27;s ok..... it does make regular polish last a little longer, but not a week or more.  I used it in conjunction with the base coat and a UV lamp.  After two days my nails were chipping at the top.  However, I am rough on my hands, they are constantly washed and exposed to cleaning chemicals.  I use this on my toes and definitely do feel like it makes the polish last longer.</li>
            <li> It works!!!  The consistency is nice during application, and the shine, once this top coat dries, is AMAZING!  My only complaint is the length of time it takes to dry.  Having said that, if the next top coat I try is not as glossy, and doesn&#x27;t keep my manicure like Rock does, I will be back!!</li>
            <li> I have used this 3 times now, and am amazed that my nails have remained chip free... I use a lot of products in my hair which causes my hands to be in water a lot of the time....this keeps my nails strong and chip free.  I have recommended it to at least 7 of my friends and all have submitted their orders for it.  I also used it this week after my professional manicure, I simply came home and added 1 top coat and used my UV lamp to seal it.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This top coat kept my nails from chipping for a couple days, then it started cracking toward the top of my nails, causing the polish to flake off. Also, it starts turning the colored polish into a dingy, less vibrant shade of its original color. I thoroughly regret buying this</li>
            <li> Top Secrets Base Coat dry- check&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish dry- check&lt;br /&gt;Top Secrets Top Coat - sit 5 minutes then go under UV lamp for 5 minutes. Sit for 25 minutes without using hands. Touch something and...AARRGGHHHH! Polish all smudged. REALLY??&lt;br /&gt;Stuff is crap.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product!! You should also by the base coat, and you can by both on this site!!  My polish is shiny and lasts for at least 10 days...like a gel finish.  I do use a nail dryer as well.  DONT waste money and time on gel nails, or gel products!!  THIS WILL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT!!  It&#x27;s hard to find both products together, so BUY THEM HERE!!  You will not be disappointed!  I LOVE these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nursing assistant at a busy hospital, and the job is hard on my nails.  Before buying Rock top coat, a manicure would only last 24 hours before either chipping or peeling.  I read about this item and decided I just had to try it.  It&#x27;s a miracle!  The first time I used it, my manicure lasted more that FOUR days, and that&#x27;s with being really rough on my nails.  The only reason it didn&#x27;t last longer was because I had accidentally spilled some nail polish remover on my hands while doing someone else&#x27;s nails.  I can&#x27;t believe I finally found a top coat that makes my nails look beautiful AND lasts!</li>
            <li> This top coat was recommended to me years ago by a nail salon and I have been using it ever since. It is like magic n a mani or pedi, keeps the polish on for weeks!</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible top coat polish!  If you like a high gloss that really and truly lasts and keeps that shine, this is the top coat for you.  It beats ALL other products that I have ever tried ... absollutely second to none!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat for SHINE. OMG...the best shine ever. I haven&#x27;t used a top coat that gives this much shine. BUT...it takes FOREVER to dry. Which is why I cannot use it any more. I&#x27;ve given up. I always mess up my nails using this.</li>
            <li> Had used European Secrets &amp;#34;No Chip&amp;#34; for years.  It was the best!  Now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere, so decided to try their other product &amp;#34;Rock Top Coat.&amp;#34;  Used it last night over my polish, and in less than 24 hours my polish is chipping.  What a waste of $11.00.</li>
            <li> Luv product! Great shine, last long! Good for natural nails. Been wearing acrylic nails for years. So happy with this product I ordered two more bottles! :-)</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a week. Used it as a base and top coat. After just two days I broke a nail. My nails were still very flexible with this product on. I got better results from Sally Hanson&#x27;s hard as acrylic silk wraps. I used it as a base and top coat for two weeks, and didn&#x27;t crack or break a nail. So don&#x27;t wast your money on Hard as a rock x5.</li>
            <li> I bought Rock Top Coat after reading the good reviews. The product never fully dried on my nails. I could scrape it all right off my nails. The directions say that no light is needed. But then it also says best results if used with UV light. ?? What??</li>
            <li> This top coat dries quickly without UV light. It doesn&#x27;t chip easily. At  times I prefer this than gel nails because it is easier to change the polish, less time, and less money. It lasts for more than a week, even two weeks (assuming you don&#x27;t bite or pick at your nails).  I don&#x27;t have an issue with it. It works great for me and I love the shine it gives!</li>
            <li> What woman doesn&#x27;t see another woman with a beautiful manicure (be it natural, gel or acrylic) and not want to drop everything and head to the nearest nail salon.  I was one of those woman; however,  I am no longer one due to the fact that I got a nail fungus infection this past winter.  For a while my nails were blotchy and so soft that they would peel.  Like other women, I went and bought nail products that promised to harden my nails and make them grow.  Whatever.  Just like with other products, it all depends on the person.  For me, a product might not work but on another person, they may get the results advertised.  I just ended up wasting money on these products as they did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated looking at my nails because I couldn&#x27;t even put nail polish on it to hide the blotches as the polish would chip off after a day or two.  I got so desperate that I started looking for vitamins to make my nails grow.  That is when I came across Reserveage Keratin Booster (see my review on this product).  I started using this but did not see much of an improvement but I think something was happening because now I can use nail polish and my nails are finally starting to grow and the nail fungus seems to have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where this wonderful bottle of Top Coat comes into the picture.  In the past when I did my own manicures, there were only two nail polishes that had lasting power on MY nails.  The two nail polishes are Avon Nailwear Pro and Revlon Colorstay.  I liked the Revlon Colorstay because it came with its own top coat.  When I use Revlon (which has been a while) it usually will last 5 to 7 days.  However, I have a co-worker who sells Avon and so I now mostly buy and use Avon nail polish.  I do like Avon more because of the color selection.  They have vibrant and funky colors when I feel like going crazy on my nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used Rock Top Coat in the past and remember it being a good top coat so I bought it at Sally Hansens Beauty Supply Store (sorry Amazon).  Now all I have to do is slap on two colors of nail polish (I really don&#x27;t think the brand matters) and one coat of Rock Top Coat and I dry them under the UV lamp and I am good to go.  I have it on right now and I did my nails on Sunday and they still look great.  I don&#x27;t even worry about being rough on my hands like some woman do because they are afraid of chipping a nail.  The previous time I used the Rock Top Coat, it lasted almost 2 weeks with no chipping (THAT IS NO LIE).  It started chipping because I knew I had to change colors so I started picking at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another time I thought that if I put 2 coats of Rock Top Coat it would last longer but it just made it thicker.  You just need one top coat and you are all set.  This little bottle will last for quite a few manicures and you will save tons of money that you spend at the salon on fake nails and a tip to the manicurist.  However, there are some people that prefer the convenience of having someone else do their nails (not me) so they don&#x27;t mind paying.  But for those on a budget, try this top coat but I would strongly encourage spending at least $50 bucks on a UV lamp because that does harden the top coat to a shiny gloss that won&#x27;t chip.  Try it and see for yourself.  From glancing at other reviews, you will note that most are satisfied with this top coat.  Most top coats promise not to chip but they always chip within the first few days.  With Rock Top Coat, I can say that it last over 5 days and for some women (like me) that is good enough.  I just want to have professional looking nails during the work week.  I could care less if they chip on the weekend but still I don&#x27;t have to worry because it last at least a week if not more.eauty Supply Store (sorry Amazon).  Now all I have to do is slap on two colors of nail polish (I really don&#x27;t think the brand matters) and one coat of Rock Top Coat and I dry them under the UV lamp and I am good to go.  I have it on right now and I did my nails on Sunday and they still look great.  I don&#x27;t even worry about being rough on my hands like some woman do because they are afraid of chipping a nail.  The previous time I used the Rock Top Coat, it lasted almost 2 weeks with no chipping (THAT IS NO LIE).  It started chipping because I knew I had to change colors so I started picking at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another time I thought that if I put 2 coats of Rock Top Coat it would last longer but it just made it thicker.  You just need one top coat and you are all set.

            <li> YES, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have very mixed feelings about this product. The three stars come from the fact that it does indeed, as promised, dry very quickly! I like that about this top coat. And the shine it gives your nails is nice too. But my issue is this: i painted my nails on Sunday, reapplied another coat on Monday, then on Tuesday when I was getting in my car and buckling up my finger slightly hit the plastic part of the buckle....it wasn&#x27;t even a hard hit....but when i looked down at my hand i realized that that little baby knock had knocked OFF a good fourth of the polish of my finger! What?! With two coats of this stuff, one of which was very recent?? I shrugged that off and just touched up that nail when I got home and reapplied more of this top coat to the rest of my fingers. Then the next day I was in the shower and realized that when i was washing my hair, my fingers were snagging in my locks. So I pull my hands out to see that on two fingers (one on each hand) the polish was literally peeling back! Ugh....I don&#x27;t know....I don&#x27;t even think i&#x27;m all that hard on my hands. And I ALWAYS paint against the edge of the tip too as well as under for extra strength. So I&#x27;m not really saying i dislike the product...i&#x27;m going to continue to use it, in fact, but this week i&#x27;m going to try using it by combining it with Sally Hansen&#x27;s &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34; crystal clear top coat. Crystal Clear dries super fast and is very hard, but it chips. Maybe if I paint this on and then cover it with Rock, things will work out? *shrug* nothing wrong with giving it a try  **And a side note: This is not a good top coat if you like to do nail stamping art. This did not effect my rating of the product because this does not advertise itself for nail stamping. but i decided to try it and i waited until my nails were good and dry....when i applied this top coat, my design smudged on three different fingers. just a friendly warning to anyone who loves nail stamping and want to use this top coat</li>
            <li> i painted my nails and put the top coat and it dries to the touch but dents and the nail polish under never dries. is there something im doing wrong?</li>
            <li> Its a rock alright! There is no doubt! Makes a nice top coat. I did accidentally spill some on my hardwood desk and it chewed through it. YIKES! Don&#x27;t spill it.</li>
            <li> The best top coat on the planet!</li>
