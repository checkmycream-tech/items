            <li>I was able to get this product for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li>I used it in the morning and was able to smoothly apply makeup over it.  </li>
            <li>So i have been using this lotion for a couple of weeks now, and so far it is just great.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly without leaving any residue and the scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li>Have not had that much time that a fair review can be written.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to be able to purchase this on Amazon now.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth, absorbs super easily, leaves my skin feeling clean (not at ALL greasy or sticky!)</li>
            <li>I bruise extremely easy.  </li>
            <li>Love the clean feel of skin after applying this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My husband  bruises easily, so</li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent to it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and not watery.</li>

            <li>This is hands down the best lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best therapeutic lotion that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is a nice large bottle</li>
            <li>which is quite comforting that the ingredients are more pure than most products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how well it works when it is so light.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this lotion to review, but the opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li>Not only is it great for every type of skin...</li>
            <li>Fragrance free (meaning no offensive odors) which is important when you are in an office setting.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and moisture replaced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a free product for a review.</li>
            <li>In response to our comment, they sent us free samples to share with our friends and family.</li>
            <li>A good healing cream that also leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and easily without a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>My friend Erin applied it to her hands, one which had a cut that was not terrible but normally would have stung if most lotions were applied.</li>
            <li>While I prefer a product with a light fragrance,  this is a good option for a basic fragrance free lotion.</li>
            <li>and best of all, it really soothed my dry elbows!</li>
            <li>Overall i think this lotion is a great product, and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this every night before bed and has gotten great results for his dry legs.</li>
            <li>This is great relief for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Mild to almost fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that special</li>
            <li>thought right!</li>
            <li>The lotion soaked right into my skin, no greasy feeling!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion so much.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on cracked hands &amp; feet, does not burn like most lotions</li>
            <li>absorbs nicely, non greasy , no scent &amp; leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This really helps my arms,my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I really like it and hope it will work better on my legs with continued use.</li>
            <li>I work full time in the operating room.</li>
            <li>Can not say enough good about it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Living in the Midwest I&#x27;m in constant need of a good hand cream.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>I was especially impressed with it on my face because it moisturized my dry, sensitive skin at night</li>
            <li>this lotion is very soothing, absorbs quickly and helps my hands feel a lot better since i&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>Great right now with dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>Great for thinning skin due to age.</li>
            <li>The size of this bottle is great, honestly i don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was packaged in a plastic bag inside the box.</li>
            <li>Heals quickly..</li>
            <li>I like that it is fragrance free as well, and the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>One of my co-workers was very interested as she had been hearing about products with macadamia oil.</li>
            <li>have tried many other lotions, but this has been amazing for me....</li>
            <li>It really works, I would bruise so easily on my arms from thinning skin.</li>
            <li>so it is going to last a long time which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Very softening and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right consistency, absorbs well, seems to keep my skin moisturized for most of the day and had no negative effects.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super sensitive to many lotions and scents and this is non-irritating.</li>
            <li>It is good for many different reasons, with me  have very dry skin, and using this lotion my skin is no longer dry, it feels very smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of this product, which I found to be a great everyday moisturizer for my body and face.  </li>
            <li>This is a great lotion without the heavy scents and NO greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and fragrant free</li>
            <li>Worth the price they charge for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also totally fragrance free, which I love.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth buying.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it makes my hands so soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that there are no heavy scents</li>
            <li>, I do not think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is very simple yet effective lotion.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it for my 91 year old Moms legs.</li>
            <li>Doing more than I expected, and still getting better</li>
            <li>Bought it to see if it would help my moms arms, and bought extra bottles for my own use.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find a product with no fragrance that actually works.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, lives up to its title.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have been looking for, my dry hands look so smooth in just a week, I tried it on my heels for the last 2 days not expecting much, but I am impressed.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very shiny at first, but it absorbs quickly and is non greasy and light.  </li>
            <li>I bruise easily due to medication I take and did not find this to be any better than most inexpensive lotions are.</li>
            <li>Very nice lotion that absorbs well and does not have a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, smooths on easily, smells natural (good for any gender,) and instantly makes dry skin feel healthy.  </li>
            <li>it is creamy just right, and odorless, and I like that a lot.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, soaks right in and soothing to skin on contact.</li>
            <li>I still bruise easily, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>This stuff is light and not greasy (which is great!), seems to soften the skin, but I haven&#x27;t used enough to see any major long term effects.</li>
            <li>This has certainly worked for me!  </li>
            <li>I found it to be kind of watery, my skin still stays dry and so does my face.</li>
            <li>The Adamia Therapeutic Lotion is a a good natural product, similar to Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corps.</li>
            <li>I love that it absorbs quickly into my skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>As many other reviewers have commented, it&#x27;s light and non-greasy (even though it contains macadamia nut oil) and absorbs rapidly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Lightly scented, absorbed quickly and made my hands feel instantly softer.  </li>
            <li>It actually heals your skin and makes everything softer and better.  </li>
            <li>I have used it several times and my skin just keeps getting softer and better conditioned.</li>
            <li>Ok only used a couple of times</li>
            <li>Not greasy just soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I will order more, but hopefully in the future I will not received a opened bottle.</li>
            <li>I will most likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>but it’s come pretty close in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and smooth with this product.</li>
            <li>Not my first-</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for a decent lotion that is not watery, not too greasy, absorbs well and quickly to give that immediate relief</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>There is nothing like this on the market that I&#x27;m aware of.</li>
            <li>Good lotion without heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is nice a thick, but it rubs in really easily.</li>
            <li>just wish it was more available all over, And a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price to have such fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I was especially excited to get to try this Adamia Therapeutic Lotion, as we have extremely dry skin especially this time of the year, while we are just coming out of winter and into spring cleaning chemicals.</li>
            <li>Positive qualities: non-greasy &amp; non-fragranced, so</li>
            <li>At first use, my lower legs and forearms felt alive again, revived!!!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my Mom whos skin is DRY and arms looked bruised on top all the time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, so that is a big plus.</li>
            <li>pure macadamia oil  </li>
            <li>It looked like she was being abused with bruises &amp; large band aids.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this product and after I day of use I could start to see the difference and ordered 2 large bottles of this lotion</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion because it works so fast to relieve my dry skin.</li>
            <li>After i put it on while looking at my skin it practically looks like my skin is wet, but when you feel your skin it isn&#x27;t, but your skin feels very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented, definitely not greasy and absorbs quickly leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this Adamia Therapeutic repair lotion.</li>
            <li>it is very soothing lotion.  </li>
            <li>Once it is absorbed into my skin it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>This therapeutic lotion really does work at calming your skin.</li>
            <li>I am so thankful to have found a product that really works to renew my skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very good.for age spots</li>
            <li>Really helps my itchy skin.</li>
            <li>This lotions really works.  </li>
            <li>this has really helped my skin and the age spots I was getting.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s heels much quicker.</li>
            <li>really like this lotion, feela difference in my skin after using it</li>
            <li>Really took the hurt out of the skin on my arms.</li>
            <li>it really helps</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well and absorbs readily into the skin.</li>
            <li>and I appreciated the opportunity to try it.  </li>
            <li>and he says the bruises seem to disappear much faster with this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is even light enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not bruising as much anymore.</li>
            <li>This is really working</li>
            <li>Pump is very convenient.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and I would recommend it to people who want results.</li>
            <li>and this really did the trick.</li>
            <li>I have hand eczema and it has really helped.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, a little pricey</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion so much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as it really works for me.</li>
            <li>First impression was completely turned around.</li>
            <li>It really feels like normal lotion, didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
            <li>But the main relief I find is the soothing sensation from the itch.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s unscented and actually really love the very, very slight scent it has and that this lotion absorbs rapidly into the skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Adamia therapeutic repair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and have already told friends who are ordering it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I think the only thing for me that with my hands being so ripped up in the winter is that if it could heal a little more, that would be ideal, although I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s asking too much given how dry my hands are.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little spendy, and I didn&#x27;t notice any radical changes in my skin, specifically my calloused heels, but with longer use (my sample lasted a week), there may be more noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>This lotion made it go away completely!!</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!</li>
            <li>and I put some of this lotion on it and to helped calm my back.</li>
            <li>So far my arms are feeling much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Arms look better already in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Only been using few days but good so far</li>
            <li>We used this everyday after the bath and her skin is so much better.</li>
            <li>This will become part of my normal routine.</li>
            <li>My mother and I use this, good for thin, elderly skin.</li>
            <li>No hard rubbing involved.</li>
            <li>the lotion made my legs smooth and soft and made my dry skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love being able to use something that does not make my hands feel super greasy like I am unable to grab things and also leaving smudges on papers and other things.</li>
            <li>My skin feels new.</li>
            <li>but i like to try new things, and</li>
            <li>It really does the job with dry skin......will certainly be buying it again!</li>
            <li>Awesome healing cream for aged thin skin!</li>
            <li>On second bottle really didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion has taken care of the dryness and makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels very soft without that oily feeling.</li>
            <li>If it healed my hands completely I would give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I love the quality of this product but the package arrived damaged because there was lack of protection for the bottle:( so the top pump was damaged and spilled inside the box!</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of first use of Adamia, my arms stopped tearing at the slightest touch and the bruising has ceased almost totally.  </li>
            <li>I like it a lot so far!</li>
            <li>I purchased ths product for myself and my 95 year old mother she loves it!</li>
            <li>Tried this product on Abe&#x27;s Market for my significant other&#x27;s cracked hands.</li>
            <li>But, first bottle I bought was open and lost a lot of it in plastic bag.</li>
            <li>but I do like how it makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and cracked in the winter months and I always like to find light and non-greasy lotions--and this definitely is!  </li>
            <li>You get a big bottle of this lotion and you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>My legs and feet are so soft and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>So far so good..pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>One squirt is enough to cover a lot of your skin, a lot of lotions out there are very sticky, but this one is not.</li>
            <li>It did make my old spots go away.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>because of my work, i wash my hands frequently.</li>
            <li>When that happens, I am immediately lightly rub this product on it a few times a day.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>But any skin issues that has ailed me or family &amp; friends so far, this has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>So far arrived safely-too early to rate whether it makes a difference in the causes of the lotion it is supposed to cure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to see any difference.</li>
            <li>My 89 year old Mom says her skin has stopped itching.</li>
            <li>I used this on my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hands quite soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and not so brittle.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin inproved</li>
            <li>The Adamia Repair lotion instantly soaked into my skin and gave it a much needed boost of moisture.</li>
            <li>I love that this lotion is thick, creamy but non-greasy.</li>
            <li>My skin feels less dry and more refreshed.</li>
            <li>Very rich cream, little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Usually we apply a prescription lotion that pretty much feels like your slathering lard onto skin in hopes of absorption, but this time we tried this!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that does a decent job moisturizing them overnight.</li>
            <li>Her skin paper thin and tears very easily.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is definitely not greasy or highly fragranced.  </li>
            <li>It immediately removes that scaly, white, dry skin and you can see the lotion being absorbed in to the skin as you apply it.  </li>
            <li>She used it for no more than 3 days &amp; noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I normally after a days work outside in my yard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a retail worker and the plastic bags dry out my hands as much as my hand washing does.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to pump out of the pump without it being too thick to come out.</li>
            <li>After using this cream for 3 weeks I am seeing major improvement.</li>
            <li>My only issue was when I received it the top was a little loose and lt leaked out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin a little sticky after because it hasn&#x27;t fully absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>I have had a problem with my hands bruising  for years now,  used this for less then a month and have noticed that any bruises I do get are smaller and go away quickly.  </li>
            <li>This lotion  has completely transformed my hands back to how they were 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Has helped my arthritis plagued hands with such breakable skin to be soft and easier to handle things.</li>
            <li>It left my hands soft &amp; not greasy.</li>
            <li>He can barely bump something and he bruises.</li>
            <li>My job entails washing my hands multiple times each day, with additional alcohol based aseptic lotion applied frequently during cases.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well tolerated by folks with sensitive or fragile skin.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product for my 87 year old mother in law.  </li>
            <li>We even contacted the company directly to praise them for a lotion that actually worked.  </li>
            <li>My thin skin is so much better...</li>
            <li>At my age, skin can get dry especially when it is hot outside.</li>
            <li>New York is in the middle of a wicked winter, and my skin is definitely feeling it.</li>
            <li>I actually used this product on the dry skin on my feet and they are now much softer.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this lotion for anyone with dry skin!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for actual repair to be accomplished....</li>
            <li>I tend to have dry and itching skin in the cold weather and have used Adamia recently with great results.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and makes my skin less dry looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have developed very dry skin over the last few years and this lotion works better than all the lotions I have tried previously.</li>
            <li>I usually have to use something with a little more oil in it for my feet.</li>
            <li>Adamia is making a significant difference in my mother&#x27;s skin, her skin is very thin and prone to skin tears , it appears to be working very well.</li>
            <li>It is definitely the lotion to use if you have dry and cracked skin, It works extremely well and very fast.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this is the long list of chemical-sounding ingredients - if it could be formulated with all natural ingredients and no alcohols or acetate</li>
            <li>My skin has gotten so thin due to aging and they tear very easily.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So i have been using this lotion for a couple of weeks now, and so far it is just great.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly without leaving any residue and the scent is refreshing.</li>

            <li> It is a nice large bottle</li>
            <li> which is quite comforting that the ingredients are more pure than most products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well it works when it is so light.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>

            <li> A good healing cream that also leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and easily without a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> My friend Erin applied it to her hands, one which had a cut that was not terrible but normally would have stung if most lotions were applied.</li>
            <li> While I prefer a product with a light fragrance,  this is a good option for a basic fragrance free lotion.</li>
            <li> and best of all, it really soothed my dry elbows!</li>
            <li> Overall i think this lotion is a great product, and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this every night before bed and has gotten great results for his dry legs.</li>
            <li> This is great relief for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Mild to almost fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that special</li>
            <li> thought right!</li>
            <li> The lotion soaked right into my skin, no greasy feeling!</li>

            <li> I really like it and hope it will work better on my legs with continued use.</li>
            <li> I work full time in the operating room.</li>
            <li> Can not say enough good about it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Living in the Midwest I&#x27;m in constant need of a good hand cream.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> I was especially impressed with it on my face because it moisturized my dry, sensitive skin at night</li>
            <li> this lotion is very soothing, absorbs quickly and helps my hands feel a lot better since i&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Great right now with dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Great for thinning skin due to age.</li>
            <li> The size of this bottle is great, honestly i don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was packaged in a plastic bag inside the box.</li>
            <li> Heals quickly..</li>
            <li> I like that it is fragrance free as well, and the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> One of my co-workers was very interested as she had been hearing about products with macadamia oil.</li>
            <li> have tried many other lotions, but this has been amazing for me....</li>
            <li> It really works, I would bruise so easily on my arms from thinning skin.</li>
            <li> so it is going to last a long time which is awesome.</li>
            <li> Very softening and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right consistency, absorbs well, seems to keep my skin moisturized for most of the day and had no negative effects.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive to many lotions and scents and this is non-irritating.</li>
            <li> It is good for many different reasons, with me  have very dry skin, and using this lotion my skin is no longer dry, it feels very smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product, which I found to be a great everyday moisturizer for my body and face.  </li>
            <li> This is a great lotion without the heavy scents and NO greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and fragrant free</li>
            <li> Worth the price they charge for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also totally fragrance free, which I love.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It is well worth buying.</li>
            <li> I love the fact it makes my hands so soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that there are no heavy scents</li>
            <li> , I do not think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is very simple yet effective lotion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it for my 91 year old Moms legs.</li>
            <li> Doing more than I expected, and still getting better</li>
            <li> Bought it to see if it would help my moms arms, and bought extra bottles for my own use.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled to find a product with no fragrance that actually works.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, lives up to its title.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for, my dry hands look so smooth in just a week, I tried it on my heels for the last 2 days not expecting much, but I am impressed.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very shiny at first, but it absorbs quickly and is non greasy and light.  </li>
            <li> I bruise easily due to medication I take and did not find this to be any better than most inexpensive lotions are.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion that absorbs well and does not have a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, smooths on easily, smells natural (good for any gender,) and instantly makes dry skin feel healthy.  </li>
            <li> it is creamy just right, and odorless, and I like that a lot.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, soaks right in and soothing to skin on contact.</li>
            <li> I still bruise easily, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is light and not greasy (which is great!), seems to soften the skin, but I haven&#x27;t used enough to see any major long term effects.</li>
            <li> This has certainly worked for me!  </li>
            <li> I found it to be kind of watery, my skin still stays dry and so does my face.</li>
            <li> The Adamia Therapeutic Lotion is a a good natural product, similar to Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corps.</li>
            <li> I love that it absorbs quickly into my skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> As many other reviewers have commented, it&#x27;s light and non-greasy (even though it contains macadamia nut oil) and absorbs rapidly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Lightly scented, absorbed quickly and made my hands feel instantly softer.  </li>
            <li> It actually heals your skin and makes everything softer and better.  </li>
            <li> I have used it several times and my skin just keeps getting softer and better conditioned.</li>
            <li> Ok only used a couple of times</li>
            <li> Not greasy just soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I will order more, but hopefully in the future I will not received a opened bottle.</li>
            <li> I will most likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> but it’s come pretty close in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and smooth with this product.</li>
            <li> Not my first-</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for a decent lotion that is not watery, not too greasy, absorbs well and quickly to give that immediate relief</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> There is nothing like this on the market that I&#x27;m aware of.</li>
            <li> Good lotion without heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is nice a thick, but it rubs in really easily.</li>
            <li> just wish it was more available all over, And a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price to have such fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I was especially excited to get to try this Adamia Therapeutic Lotion, as we have extremely dry skin especially this time of the year, while we are just coming out of winter and into spring cleaning chemicals.</li>
            <li> Positive qualities: non-greasy &amp; non-fragranced, so</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, so that is a big plus.</li>
            <li> pure macadamia oil  </li>
            <li> It looked like she was being abused with bruises &amp; large band aids.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product and after I day of use I could start to see the difference and ordered 2 large bottles of this lotion</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion because it works so fast to relieve my dry skin.</li>
            <li> After i put it on while looking at my skin it practically looks like my skin is wet, but when you feel your skin it isn&#x27;t, but your skin feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented, definitely not greasy and absorbs quickly leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this Adamia Therapeutic repair lotion.</li>
            <li> it is very soothing lotion.  </li>
            <li> Once it is absorbed into my skin it leaves my skin soft.</li>

            <li> Used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s heels much quicker.</li>

            <li> I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and absorbs readily into the skin.</li>
            <li> and I appreciated the opportunity to try it.  </li>
            <li> and he says the bruises seem to disappear much faster with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is even light enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not bruising as much anymore.</li>
            <li> This is really working</li>
            <li> Pump is very convenient.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and I would recommend it to people who want results.</li>
            <li> and this really did the trick.</li>
            <li> I have hand eczema and it has really helped.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, a little pricey</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion so much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as it really works for me.</li>
            <li> First impression was completely turned around.</li>
            <li> It really feels like normal lotion, didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
            <li> But the main relief I find is the soothing sensation from the itch.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s unscented and actually really love the very, very slight scent it has and that this lotion absorbs rapidly into the skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Adamia therapeutic repair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and have already told friends who are ordering it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think the only thing for me that with my hands being so ripped up in the winter is that if it could heal a little more, that would be ideal, although I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s asking too much given how dry my hands are.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little spendy, and I didn&#x27;t notice any radical changes in my skin, specifically my calloused heels, but with longer use (my sample lasted a week), there may be more noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> This lotion made it go away completely!!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!</li>
            <li> and I put some of this lotion on it and to helped calm my back.</li>
            <li> So far my arms are feeling much smoother.  </li>
            <li> Arms look better already in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Only been using few days but good so far</li>
            <li> We used this everyday after the bath and her skin is so much better.</li>
            <li> This will become part of my normal routine.</li>
            <li> My mother and I use this, good for thin, elderly skin.</li>
            <li> No hard rubbing involved.</li>
            <li> the lotion made my legs smooth and soft and made my dry skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love being able to use something that does not make my hands feel super greasy like I am unable to grab things and also leaving smudges on papers and other things.</li>
            <li> My skin feels new.</li>
            <li> but i like to try new things, and</li>
            <li> It really does the job with dry skin......will certainly be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Awesome healing cream for aged thin skin!</li>
            <li> On second bottle really didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion has taken care of the dryness and makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels very soft without that oily feeling.</li>
            <li> If it healed my hands completely I would give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this product but the package arrived damaged because there was lack of protection for the bottle:( so the top pump was damaged and spilled inside the box!</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of first use of Adamia, my arms stopped tearing at the slightest touch and the bruising has ceased almost totally.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot so far!</li>
            <li> I purchased ths product for myself and my 95 year old mother she loves it!</li>
            <li> Tried this product on Abe&#x27;s Market for my significant other&#x27;s cracked hands.</li>
            <li> But, first bottle I bought was open and lost a lot of it in plastic bag.</li>
            <li> but I do like how it makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and cracked in the winter months and I always like to find light and non-greasy lotions--and this definitely is!  </li>
            <li> You get a big bottle of this lotion and you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> My legs and feet are so soft and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> So far so good..pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> One squirt is enough to cover a lot of your skin, a lot of lotions out there are very sticky, but this one is not.</li>
            <li> It did make my old spots go away.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> because of my work, i wash my hands frequently.</li>
            <li> When that happens, I am immediately lightly rub this product on it a few times a day.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> But any skin issues that has ailed me or family &amp; friends so far, this has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> So far arrived safely-too early to rate whether it makes a difference in the causes of the lotion it is supposed to cure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to see any difference.</li>
            <li> My 89 year old Mom says her skin has stopped itching.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hands quite soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and not so brittle.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin inproved</li>
            <li> The Adamia Repair lotion instantly soaked into my skin and gave it a much needed boost of moisture.</li>
            <li> I love that this lotion is thick, creamy but non-greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin feels less dry and more refreshed.</li>
            <li> Very rich cream, little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Usually we apply a prescription lotion that pretty much feels like your slathering lard onto skin in hopes of absorption, but this time we tried this!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that does a decent job moisturizing them overnight.</li>
            <li> Her skin paper thin and tears very easily.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is definitely not greasy or highly fragranced.  </li>
            <li> It immediately removes that scaly, white, dry skin and you can see the lotion being absorbed in to the skin as you apply it.  </li>
            <li> She used it for no more than 3 days &amp; noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I normally after a days work outside in my yard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a retail worker and the plastic bags dry out my hands as much as my hand washing does.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to pump out of the pump without it being too thick to come out.</li>
            <li> After using this cream for 3 weeks I am seeing major improvement.</li>
            <li> My only issue was when I received it the top was a little loose and lt leaked out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin a little sticky after because it hasn&#x27;t fully absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with my hands bruising  for years now,  used this for less then a month and have noticed that any bruises I do get are smaller and go away quickly.  </li>
            <li> This lotion  has completely transformed my hands back to how they were 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Has helped my arthritis plagued hands with such breakable skin to be soft and easier to handle things.</li>
            <li> It left my hands soft &amp; not greasy.</li>
            <li> He can barely bump something and he bruises.</li>
            <li> My job entails washing my hands multiple times each day, with additional alcohol based aseptic lotion applied frequently during cases.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well tolerated by folks with sensitive or fragile skin.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for my 87 year old mother in law.  </li>
            <li> We even contacted the company directly to praise them for a lotion that actually worked.  </li>
            <li> My thin skin is so much better...</li>
            <li> At my age, skin can get dry especially when it is hot outside.</li>
            <li> New York is in the middle of a wicked winter, and my skin is definitely feeling it.</li>
            <li> I actually used this product on the dry skin on my feet and they are now much softer.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this lotion for anyone with dry skin!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for actual repair to be accomplished....</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry and itching skin in the cold weather and have used Adamia recently with great results.</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have developed very dry skin over the last few years and this lotion works better than all the lotions I have tried previously.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use something with a little more oil in it for my feet.</li>
            <li> Adamia is making a significant difference in my mother&#x27;s skin, her skin is very thin and prone to skin tears , it appears to be working very well.</li>
            <li> It is definitely the lotion to use if you have dry and cracked skin, It works extremely well and very fast.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this is the long list of chemical-sounding ingredients - if it could be formulated with all natural ingredients and no alcohols or acetate</li>
            <li> My skin has gotten so thin due to aging and they tear very easily.</li>
            <li> and I am very picky about my lotion because I hate it if you get a kind that leaves your hands feeling greasy and oily</li>
            <li> It has a light scent to it(at least in my eyes) and it moisturized my hands almost immediately with no dry patches to show without a greasy heavy feeling on my hands.</li>
            <li> I have very chapped, dry hands in winter, and a bit of excema year round.</li>
            <li> I heard about Adamia from a friend - she told me they use it in nursing homes because the elderly have such dry skin, that their skin actually breaks, and that this lotion was used to help them.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous different lotions and creams for my dry and cracking hands.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days, but I like it and have even used it on my face with no issues (I have very sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the appearance of a bad scare on my leg.  </li>
            <li> I constantly struggle with dry, cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> Most lotions are filled with nasty ingredients and leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I also have problem of dry skin that peels and causes red splotches around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> To our surprise by morning the area we put the lotion on was far less irritated and with another day of use</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days, but I like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li> I am in less early 60s, and the skin on my forearms seems to get very thin and bruise easily.</li>
            <li> The skin on my arms felt like parchment paper, very dry &amp; fragile feeling.  </li>
            <li> Have very thin skin that tears and bruises easily.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a RN and wash my hands alot and also wear nonlatex gloves for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Once used, would never go back to any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I had these dry aging patches.</li>
            <li> Chemo meds burned my arms causing the skin to dry up and peel off.</li>
            <li> I think it is helping improve the texture of the dry skin on my hands already.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been using it all over, and my skin is quite dry now.</li>
            <li> I have used every lotion on the market for my and my son&#x27;s dry cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry</li>
            <li> and it has done wonders for my extremely dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I applied it on my arms and legs which are extremely dry and flaky and</li>
            <li> When I used the product around my brow area it took away the dry skin</li>
            <li> Dry skin in the summer and cracked cuticles in the winter are part of family genetics.  </li>
            <li> My hands are always dry &amp; cracked in the winter.  </li>
            <li> When winter hits, my hands turn so dry that they sometimes crack.  </li>
            <li> However, you do need to reapply this often if you have severe dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I prefer urea-containing preparations for significantly dry inflamed skin, but this seems to work for maintenance/prevention.</li>
            <li> Works really well especially for thin skin.</li>
            <li> Since using it I haven&#x27;t had a single tear.</li>
            <li> this single lotion is a cure all</li>
            <li> I have very thin skin (I&#x27;m 68 years old) and this product and working very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it frequently in the past week</li>
            <li> When I got a small sample of the Adamia Therapeutic Repair Lotion my mom took it and put it on her face and said ohhhhhh soft.  </li>
            <li> I work outside in the extreme weather, so my hands get dried and cracked a lot, and this is instant relief.</li>
            <li> Is changing to rough dry texture of my arms.</li>
            <li> I had an accident last July, and had tried everything to help the scare appear less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I definitely have less bruising.</li>
            <li> I am very dry and nothing was working.</li>
            <li> my skin is VERY dry...</li>
            <li> I use it on my very dry hands and cracked finger tips for immediate relief and it works well.</li>
            <li> I have severely dried feet and have tried numerous ointments, lotions and oils .</li>
            <li> I like it, not oily, and not much of an odor.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin year round and especially dry heels and feet due to a low thyroid</li>
            <li> They have told their other patients about Adamia too.  </li>
            <li> Am telling &amp; sharing with other friends who have thinning &amp; damaged skin about Adamia.</li>
            <li> No more white flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> I played with a puppy the other day &amp; my arms &amp; hands were scratched up from puppy teeth (one spot was bleeding), after about 30 minutes my arms were welted &amp; burning, so I remembered I had this lotion, &amp; IMMEDIATELY the pain was gone.</li>
            <li> Will recommend to other people at my center!</li>
            <li> Like any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> Being active in sports, sometimes my skin get chaffed and irritated.</li>
            <li> My wife is an active borrower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent less on this bottle than she has on bandaids in a month.</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry and my hands get  little cracks and start  hurting.</li>
            <li> My only complaint.</li>
            <li> It even helped with the dark discoloration in her skin from bumps and bruising.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how thin it was and the lack of fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My skin on my hands is dry and cracked, and not enjoyable to touch.</li>
            <li> Being an active age group endurance athlete, training outdoors in hot and cold weather conditions.  </li>
            <li> I received this lotion less than 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> No itching as your skin is drying from the sun and healing time is cut in half.</li>
            <li> When I do get a blood bruise it is gone in half the time.</li>
            <li> I always have a rough spot on my right index finger that is always so bad in the winter.</li>
            <li> However it seems like the lid wasn&#x27;t screwed on tight and the lotion came out of the bottle in transit.</li>
            <li> hubby’s hands also take a bit of a beating on his long days at work and our recent move from Texas to Wisconsin which is like 90 degree weather to 40 degrees caused cracking and a weird chapping on our hands and around the cuticle areas on our fingers.</li>
            <li> I have a little friend that is trying not t to.</li>
            <li> I do wish it felt a little thicker but it does seem to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Not much better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> When I opened the box this product had leaked out a little.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps dry skin and when my skin gets angry from the sun</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this lotion a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, greasy, or oily at all.  </li>
            <li> Recommended to a few friends.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Not greasy no strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> My fingertips have dried and cracked to the point of bleeding every winter for the past twenty years, until I was introduced to Adamia.</li>
            <li> The texture of the lotion is watered down rather than creamy and thick.</li>
            <li> Just a little too expensive for daily use.</li>
            <li> Noticed no improvement in dry, thin skin.</li>
            <li> Not helping yet , still bruises at least little bump</li>
            <li> I usually have separate products for hands, feet, face and body but tried this on everything</li>
            <li> This is no more moist than any over the counter lotion.  </li>
            <li> My thin skin no longer feels thin and frail, and if I do get bumped, there are few to none red blotches.</li>
            <li> but I do wish they offered a small purse size option to carry with you or travel .</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solution that isn&#x27;t a thick, heavy cream.</li>
            <li> Not sure it does what they say is what it will do.</li>
            <li> old mother who suffers from very thin, dry skin.</li>
            <li> but it was so hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> It was opened and I had a hard time getting the pump to work.</li>
            <li> Too thin, not rich consistency.</li>
            <li> not thrilled with it yet.</li>
            <li> It in fact did not burn, irritate or hurt in the least bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next test, my Sethster’s eczema.</li>
            <li> The texture is creamy but not overly thick.  </li>
            <li> Was thrilled to receive this product to try as my skin suffers horribly in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this lotion if you need serious repair, have pain, irritation or have someone in your life with hurting skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She had bad eczema on the inside of her elbows, the back of her knees and bottom.</li>
            <li> This is my second winter of using this lotion, and not having cracked, painful fingers.</li>
            <li> During the winter months my hands are rough, crack and are very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so thin from chemo that anytime I bump into something</li>
            <li> thin as water.  </li>
            <li> I gave samples to my friends for their husbands diabetic sores &amp; thin skin.....</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband&#x27;s thin skin on his arms.  </li>
            <li> We applied a small amount of lotion to my kiddos affected areas…his eczema can at times get so bad</li>
            <li> no more ugly</li>
            <li> She would barely bump something &amp; her skin would tear &amp; bruise horribly.</li>
            <li> ; unfortunately, I had a severe allergy reaction and cannot use it.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a dialysis  patient and my skin is very thin.</li>
            <li> but I decided to keep the lotion as I was so desperate to try lotion that provides relief.</li>
            <li> The scent is very, very faint</li>
            <li> I had a painful and itchy spot on my jaw line.</li>
            <li> When I received this order, I was disappointed in the condition of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I had very painful cracked hands and it provided them with relief.</li>
            <li> Often I have found that so-called unscented products can have a nasty smell, but this one is truly unscented - it has no fragrance at all, which I appreciate since there is nothing to clash with my perfume.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I received this product for 100% free for my unbiased review and my review is solely my own.  I really like this Adamia Therapeutic repair lotion. The lotion is a  blend of promega -7  pure macadamia oil  it is very soothing lotion.  The  lotion is really good for moisturizing the skin. It&#x27;s really good if you have chafe skin. I had used some for that purpose and it literally healed it a lot faster than the regular Vitamin D ointment, so for me it is a winner. You get a giant bottle as well. Worth the price they charge for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product  for 100% free for my unbiased review and my review is solely my own.</li>
            <li> A great product!  Being active in sports, sometimes my skin get chaffed and irritated. This lotion has a soothing effect and promotes faster healing.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this lotion a few days ago. I have very chapped, dry hands in winter, and a bit of excema year round. This stuff is light and not greasy (which is great!), seems to soften the skin, but I haven&#x27;t used enough to see any major long term effects. It is also totally fragrance free, which I love.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion that absorbs well and does not have a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love how this lotion has no fragrance. The texture of the lotion is watered down rather than creamy and thick. It does leave my skin a little sticky after because it hasn&#x27;t fully absorbed into my skin. Once it is absorbed into my skin it leaves my skin soft. My back was aching one day and I put some of this lotion on it and to helped calm my back. This therapeutic lotion really does work at calming your skin. I love this lotion so much.  Also it helps moisturize my skin. You get a big bottle of this lotion and you don&#x27;t need that much. I was able to get this product for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> I usually have separate products for hands, feet, face and body but tried this on everything and it worked!  I was especially impressed with it on my face because it moisturized my dry, sensitive skin at night and I woke up without a greasy sheen.  I used it in the morning and was able to smoothly apply makeup over it.  We have had temperatures of well below zero this week and I have been using it on every part of my body.  It works better than products that are twice the price and doesn&#x27;t leave a scent so I can use whatever perfume or body spray I like and it doesn&#x27;t interfere.</li>
            <li> This therapeutic lotion is just as described. It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling great. There is no fragrance and skin feels moisturized. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a really good nourishing lotion. Great for thinning skin due to age. Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it just wish it was more available all over, And a little cheaper.  But I definitely am glad I bought it thank you .</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry and itching skin in the cold weather and have used Adamia recently with great results. The lotion goes on so smoothly and absorbs nicely into your skin. I just ordered two 16 ounce bottles and will give one to my mother.</li>
            <li> I bruise extremely easy.  This product has been magic in removing the bruises.  I have shared the info with home health care nurses that visit me weekly.  They have told their other patients about Adamia too.  One of the best internet purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Being on blood thinning medication, I have &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; on my arms where I bump into things.  After using this the are disappearing more quickly, thank you!!</li>
            <li> Adamia is making a significant difference in my mother&#x27;s skin, her skin is very thin and prone to skin tears , it appears to be working very well.</li>
            <li> Love it. Absorbs quickly and makes my skin less dry looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best lotion I have ever used! It has a light scent to it(at least in my eyes) and it moisturized my hands almost immediately with no dry patches to show without a greasy heavy feeling on my hands. I love being able to use something that does not make my hands feel super greasy like I am unable to grab things and also leaving smudges on papers and other things. All of these over the counter products claiming they make your skin feel great and staying moisturized have a habit of lying and over charging for a product they claim does well. This product lives up to the hype and I love how it is used for diabetics and it is so nice to have a lotion that understands the skin issues diabetics have. I may have to give some to my mom to use as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Opinions expressed are 100% solely my own.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I got if for my husband and mother in law. They have seen a great improvement in their skin. Now I have been using it. I highly recommend Adamia therapeutic repair. My legs and feet are so soft and not greasy at all. I need more!!😍</li>
            <li> Awesome healing cream for aged thin skin!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it!  It really does the job with dry skin......will certainly be buying it again!</li>
            <li> So far so good..pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Has helped the appearance of&lt;br /&gt;my arms.</li>
            <li> So far my arms are feeling much smoother.  I had these dry aging patches.</li>
            <li> This lotion did not repair spots on my wife&#x27;s hands.  We could not see a difference.</li>
            <li> Ok lotion but, a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this awesome lotion to try for my dry Winter skin.  I am so thankful to have found a product that really works to renew my skin.  It absorbs quickly, smooths on easily, smells natural (good for any gender,) and instantly makes dry skin feel healthy.  It stays healthy feeling too.  Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, greasy, or oily at all.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So i have been using this lotion for a couple of weeks now, and so far it is just great. The lotion has a very nice scent to it, some people might think it is a bit pricy for a lotion but it is definitely worth it. The size of this bottle is great, honestly i don&#x27;t know how long it will last but it seems like it will last forever. It is good for many different reasons, with me  have very dry skin, and using this lotion my skin is no longer dry, it feels very smooth and nice. I have been using this lotion nonstop. One squirt is enough to cover a lot of your skin, a lot of lotions out there are very sticky, but this one is not. After i put it on while looking at my skin it practically looks like my skin is wet, but when you feel your skin it isn&#x27;t, but your skin feels very smooth. Overall i think this lotion is a great product, and definitely worth the price. I totally recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells good and soothes the skin. Great right now with dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she likes it.</li>
            <li> Chemo meds burned my arms causing the skin to dry up and peel off. I applied Adamia Therapeutic Repair lotion to the affected area 5 to 6 times a day, I was very impressed with the results. I plan on ordering my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this product in order to provide a review, and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  As many other reviewers have commented, it&#x27;s light and non-greasy (even though it contains macadamia nut oil) and absorbs rapidly into the skin.  Often I have found that so-called unscented products can have a nasty smell, but this one is truly unscented - it has no fragrance at all, which I appreciate since there is nothing to clash with my perfume.  I have only been using it a few days, but I like it and have even used it on my face with no issues (I have very sensitive skin).  I think it is helping improve the texture of the dry skin on my hands already.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this is the long list of chemical-sounding ingredients - if it could be formulated with all natural ingredients and no alcohols or acetate I would add a star.</li>
            <li> My hands look great. It did make my old spots go away. However, I&#x27;ve been using it all over, and my skin is quite dry now.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented, absorbed quickly and made my hands feel instantly softer.  I had very painful cracked hands and it provided them with relief.</li>
            <li> I went skiing in Tahoe with my kids, and by the time we left all of us had the driest, chapped skins imaginable. I used Vasoline on my son&#x27;s face but it gave him a rash, and was too oily. I tried Eucarin cream but it was so hard to rub in. I heard about Adamia from a friend - she told me they use it in nursing homes because the elderly have such dry skin, that their skin actually breaks, and that this lotion was used to help them. Thought I would give it a try. It is nice a thick, but it rubs in really easily. I like that it is fragrance free as well, and the bottle is pretty. Wound definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have a skin disorder called lichen planus.  My skin itches in spots all the time, and it&#x27;s just my skin, no lesions or whelps.  I use a steroid cream for spot treatment.  This lotion has helped my skin 100%.  It has helped with the &amp;#34;crepe paper&amp;#34; look to my hands. But the main relief I find is the soothing sensation from the itch.  It is well worth buying.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! This lotion  has completely transformed my hands back to how they were 10 years ago. I love the fact it makes my hands so soft without being greasy.  Using with dermmend, which is also a great product.</li>
            <li> Wow. I received this lotion less than 2 weeks ago. Of course I had my doubts but this lotion does everything it says. My skin is so thin from chemo that anytime I bump into something my skin tears and bruises all over my arms. This lotion has healed the skin tears and no more ugly bruises.&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this lotion so much I have a little friend that is trying not t to.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product, which I found to be a great everyday moisturizer for my body and face.  It&#x27;s the right consistency, absorbs well, seems to keep my skin moisturized for most of the day and had no negative effects.  It&#x27;s a little spendy, and I didn&#x27;t notice any radical changes in my skin, specifically my calloused heels, but with longer use (my sample lasted a week), there may be more noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> Very good.for age spots</li>
            <li> this lotion is great.  because of my work, i wash my hands frequently. my skin is very dry and my hands get  little cracks and start  hurting. this lotion is very soothing, absorbs quickly and helps my hands feel a lot better since i&#x27;ve been using it. definitely a quality product.</li>
            <li> Works very well on cracked hands &amp; feet, does not burn like most lotions</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 82 yr. old mother who suffers from very thin, dry skin. She loves it!  She says her skin feels better and looks better, too!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. Really helps my itchy skin. Just a little too expensive for daily use.</li>
            <li> Can not tell any difference yet</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion!!!!  Have very thin skin that tears and bruises easily.  This has been a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This lotion is truly an amazing moisturizer.  I constantly struggle with dry, cracked skin.  Most lotions are filled with nasty ingredients and leave a greasy feel.  Not Adamia.  There are no parabens or petroleum and it leaves my skin feeling silky instead of greasy.  That&#x27;s why I love it!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin. Have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used every lotion on the market for my and my son&#x27;s dry cracked skin.  This stuff is a miracle.  After just one use you can feel a noticeable difference.  It actually heals your skin and makes everything softer and better.  I have never felt so strongly about a lotion before - you have to try it!</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this product in order to provide a review, and I&#x27;m happy that I did. My skin is very dry and cracked in the winter months and I always like to find light and non-greasy lotions--and this definitely is!  I really like that it&#x27;s unscented and actually really love the very, very slight scent it has and that this lotion absorbs rapidly into the skin. I have only been using it a few days, but I like it a lot so far. I think the only thing for me that with my hands being so ripped up in the winter is that if it could heal a little more, that would be ideal, although I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s asking too much given how dry my hands are.  If it healed my hands completely I would give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! I have developed very dry skin over the last few years and this lotion works better than all the lotions I have tried previously. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works when it is so light.  I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle.</li>
            <li> Is changing to rough dry texture of my arms. Hoping countinued use provides additional improvment.</li>
            <li> Love the clean feel of skin after applying this lotion.  Great for worn hands from winter and being a nurse!</li>
            <li> I have severely dried feet and have tried numerous ointments, lotions and oils . When I trid the Adamia kroon I immediately felt relief and could feel my skin softening . I have used it several times and my skin just keeps getting softer and better conditioned. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This lotions really works.  I have very thin skin (I&#x27;m 68 years old) and this product and working very well.  I normally after a days work outside in my yard some in with marks all over my arms and hands, but since using this product I haven&#x27;t had as many boo boos.  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to my friends and they&#x27;re all raving about it also.</li>
            <li> I use it 2 times a day my hands do look a lot  better ,would buy it again..</li>
            <li> I was especially excited to get to try this Adamia Therapeutic Lotion, as we have extremely dry skin especially this time of the year, while we are just coming out of winter and into spring cleaning chemicals. This is a great lotion without the heavy scents and NO greasy feeling. My husband uses this every night before bed and has gotten great results for his dry legs. We use this on our entire bodies, face hands and even feet. It is definitely the lotion to use if you have dry and cracked skin, It works extremely well and very fast. Love the fact that there are no heavy scents and  it works GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my review purposes, and my honest 100% unbiased thoughts and opinions based on my experience using this product. I am disclosing this in accordance to the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s 16CFR, Part 255 Guide Concerning the Use of Endorsement and Testimonials in Advertising.</li>
            <li> Really love this. Great for dry skin, a little pricey</li>
            <li> this has really helped my skin and the age spots I was getting.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion.  My skin is dry and I&#x27;m forever putting lotion on my hands and forearms.  This lotion has taken care of the dryness and makes my skin very soft.  I like it alot.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this product but the package arrived damaged because there was lack of protection for the bottle:( so the top pump was damaged and spilled inside the box! Packaging issue...sad for the product!</li>
            <li> I am exceptionally pleased with this product. Am telling &amp; sharing with other friends who have thinning &amp; damaged skin about Adamia. Where has this product been all my life. Love it.</li>
            <li> Have only used this lotion for 2 days and see skin improvement already.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Ok only used a couple of times</li>
            <li> I love it. I don&#x27;t know if it is a coincidence or not, since I have been using it , I have had no skin tears or and markings .</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best thing I have found...</li>
            <li> Great lotion I love it</li>
            <li> Lotion is wonderful. However it seems like the lid wasn&#x27;t screwed on tight and the lotion came out of the bottle in transit. Although it was in a separate bag and didn&#x27;t get all over the shipping container.  But great lotion.</li>
            <li> Since I have had a few days to use this lotion it has really helped my sun damaged skin.  It needs to be packaged better with protection for the pump as it was broken and leaked into the plastic bag!</li>
            <li> My mother and I use this, good for thin, elderly skin.</li>
            <li> thin as water.  could tell no difference after using it.</li>
            <li> Nice feel, wasn&#x27;t greasy, like it very much</li>
            <li> Great lotion but pump would not work........had to return......</li>
            <li> GREAT lotion; unfortunately, I had a severe allergy reaction and cannot use it.  Used it for about 2 weeks before reaction started.....was the best lotion for MY skin I ever used.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work. Used the whole bottle. No different in my skin. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> My wife likes  it and says the lotion has softened and repaired her skin as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not helping yet , still bruises at least little bump</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, is great if you have distressed skin. Heals and soothes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that special, I do not think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this and it works miracles. My skin feels new.</li>
            <li> Arms look better already in a few weeks.  Am on blood thinner and that means you are forever hitting something and getting bruised.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of first use of Adamia, my arms stopped tearing at the slightest touch and the bruising has ceased almost totally.  At first use, my lower legs and forearms felt alive again, revived!!!  Very impressed and thankful!!</li>
            <li> Good lotion but it didn&#x27;t do what it promised.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this product. It helps my skin in so many ways. Heals and moisturizes as well as making skin look more youthful. I highly recommend it and have already told friends who are ordering it.</li>
            <li> Good to use on the face too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion. I&#x27;m super sensitive to many lotions and scents and this is non-irritating. At my age, skin can get dry especially when it is hot outside. Perfect non greasy lotion that absorbs and soothes.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has become my favorite body lotion!!!! If I could I would give it 10 stars :)</li>
            <li> I love it . It has repaired my skin to where I bump it my skin does not tear . I use it all over my body</li>
            <li> I have very thin skin.  Adamia therapeutic repair lotion has worked so well that when my cat scratched me it did not cut my skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great. Not had it but about a week. I like it a lot so far!</li>
            <li> This is very simple yet effective lotion. I do wish it felt a little thicker but it does seem to do the trick. It has no smell and is not greasy which is quite comforting that the ingredients are more pure than most products.I had never heard of macademia oil but i like to try new things, and its simple enough I would definitely put it on my kids.</li>
            <li> This lotion is definitely not greasy or highly fragranced.  I&#x27;ve been applying it frequently in the past week and it has done wonders for my extremely dry hands.  It absorbs very quickly.  I am impressed with Adamia and will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this lotion to review, but the opinions are 100% mine. I love that this lotion is thick, creamy but non-greasy. The scent is very, very faint so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume. I thought the lotion worked well, except for my feet. I usually have to use something with a little more oil in it for my feet. Overall, I would use this product regularly and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> absorbs nicely, non greasy , no scent &amp; leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any remarkable results yet. Still hoping in time will be better.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and fragrant free</li>
            <li> Love it not greasy helps with tearing of skin on my arms</li>
            <li> My husband  bruises easily, so I thought I&#x27;d try it and it works great!</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my Mom and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t use it much but it sure does feel nice and makes my hands better. My only issue was when I received it the top was a little loose and lt leaked out of the bottle. Luckily it was packaged in a plastic bag inside the box.</li>
            <li> This is no more moist than any over the counter lotion.  In fact it was a wast of money.</li>
            <li> Amazing...Hope I never have to be without it!!</li>
            <li> I do love this cream! it was a great purchase! it is creamy just right, and odorless, and I like that a lot. My experience with Amazon was EXCELLENT! delivered in no time with great packaging. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel wonderful</li>
            <li> When I got a small sample of the Adamia Therapeutic Repair Lotion my mom took it and put it on her face and said ohhhhhh soft.  I applied it on my arms and legs which are extremely dry and flaky and the lotion made my legs smooth and soft and made my dry skin hydrated. No more white flaky skin.  I also have problem of dry skin that peels and causes red splotches around my eyebrows. When I used the product around my brow area it took away the dry skin and I did not end up with red blotches.  I like this product and I like how it feels and the results that it gives.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion!! I have tried numerous different lotions and creams for my dry and cracking hands. I always have a rough spot on my right index finger that is always so bad in the winter. This lotion made it go away completely!! It&#x27;s unscented, definitely not greasy and absorbs quickly leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth. A couple of days after trying a sample of this lotion I went on amazon and ordered the big bottle. Definitely worth the price to have such fantastic results. Wish I knew about this product sooner!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is creamy, absorbable, and unscented.  It feels so good on my skin.  During the winter months my hands are rough, crack and are very uncomfortable.  I have used this lotion for about 2 weeks with great results.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful. Absolutely love it for my 91 year old Moms legs. They look so much better since she&#x27;s been using Adamia Repair lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. In fact I&#x27;m ordering more and giving to friends. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for actual repair to be accomplished....but I have noticed quite an improvement. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Very rich cream, little goes a long way.  I am very pleased with the appearance of a bad scare on my leg.  I had an accident last July, and had tried everything to help the scare appear less noticeable.  After using this cream for 3 weeks I am seeing major improvement.</li>
            <li> Lived this lotion. Skin feels very soft without that oily feeling.</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best lotion ever! My thin skin no longer feels thin and frail, and if I do get bumped, there are few to none red blotches. A great product,  excellent customer service, and fast shipping add up to superior 5 star product!</li>
            <li> The best cream for my mom!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Being an active age group endurance athlete, training outdoors in hot and cold weather conditions.  Dry skin in the summer and cracked cuticles in the winter are part of family genetics.  Adamia Lotion rejuvenates cracked and scaly conditions the next morning (if evening applicaition).  Thanks for this excellent product.  My wife is an active borrower. I need to get her a bottle!</li>
            <li> This product is the best moisturizing cream I have ever used. I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Not much better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I am in less early 60s, and the skin on my forearms seems to get very thin and bruise easily. When that happens, I am immediately lightly rub this product on it a few times a day. I noticed from doing this it&#x27;s heels much quicker.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion. Recommended to a few friends.</li>
            <li> Too thin, not rich consistency. Noticed no improvement in dry, thin skin.</li>
            <li> Doing more than I expected, and still getting better</li>
            <li> Wow. This feels amazing. When I opened the box this product had leaked out a little. I don&#x27;t think the lid was screwed on tightly enough. This didn&#x27;t leave a great first impression of the product. However as I cleaned up the top of the bottle I rubbed the leaked lotion into my legs. First impression was completely turned around. I love how this makes my skin feel. Not greasy just soft and smooth. It has a very mild scent to it. Not at all overpowering yet somehow it&#x27;s a very appealing smell. I slathered it on my feet and then covered with a pair of socks. It left my dried cracked feet looking and feeling much improved.  Sample received for review purposes.</li>
            <li> really like this lotion, feela difference in my skin after using it</li>
            <li> Excellent. Really took the hurt out of the skin on my arms. Really glad I found this</li>
            <li> It really works, I would bruise so easily on my arms from thinning skin. Use it daily.</li>
            <li> Repair.....oh, I don&#x27;t think so</li>
            <li> My skin feels less dry and more refreshed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom. She would barely bump something &amp; her skin would tear &amp; bruise horribly. She used it for no more than 3 days &amp; noticed a HUGE difference. Her arms look great &amp; she&#x27;s not so embarrassed. It looked like she was being abused with bruises &amp; large band aids. I&#x27;ve spent less on this bottle than she has on bandaids in a month. My daughter has excema, I read where it helped someone&#x27;s son, so I tried it for her &amp; within 2 days.....gone! I played with a puppy the other day &amp; my arms &amp; hands were scratched up from puppy teeth (one spot was bleeding), after about 30 minutes my arms were welted &amp; burning, so I remembered I had this lotion, &amp; IMMEDIATELY the pain was gone. By the next day I couldn&#x27;t even tell the scratches were even there. I gave samples to my friends for their husbands diabetic sores &amp; thin skin.....2 days later they each bought a bottle. LOVE THIS STUFF! I&#x27;m going to buy a bottle for me to use instead of oil of Olay. My niece is coming to get a sample from me to try it on her psoriasis, I&#x27;ll update if it works for that. But any skin issues that has ailed me or family &amp; friends so far, this has been a lifesaver. I don&#x27;t always give reviews, but when it can help someone, I will. Please keep selling this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer for your skin. Especially if you have extra dry skin. But doesn&#x27;t feel greasey. I will be reordering for sure.</li>
            <li> Bought it to see if it would help my moms arms, and bought extra bottles for my own use.  We love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent your skin feels great</li>
            <li> I broke out in a rash on my chest where I already had a problem</li>
            <li> Great product , but I do wish they offered a small purse size option to carry with you or travel .</li>
            <li> Have not had that much time that a fair review can be written. I do like the OZ .naturals that came with it. Unfortunately left it at a rental house so will have to order another bottle</li>
            <li> Love this lotion not greasy, really works great.  Highly recommend it.  Alittle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion.  It works amazingly on not only diabetic skin but, psorasis skin and sunburn skin also!  Using on sunburn skin is amazing!  No itching as your skin is drying from the sun and healing time is cut in half. I must say that I have my entire family using this product and we all love it!!!! Not only is it great for every type of skin...it is a great lotion for shaving your legs</li>
            <li> It really works! Saw a difference in about a week!</li>
            <li> A good healing cream that also leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My thin skin is so much better... The repair cream is amazing!</li>
            <li> wonderful. Softest hands ever</li>
            <li> I like this lotion and I do think my skin looks better. It is not greasy and does not stain clothing. I also appreciate the fact that it does not have a lot of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought the Adamia Therapeutic Lotion for thinning skin. Since using it I haven&#x27;t had a single tear. I still bruise easily, but I can live with that. So thankful to have found something that helps my &amp;#34;old lady skin.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works really well especially for thin skin. Meds that I take cause bruises on my arms. Been using lotion and bruises are fading away.</li>
            <li> On second bottle really didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> When I received this order, I was disappointed in the condition of the bottle.  It was opened and I had a hard time getting the pump to work. However, when I used the lotion, it was wonderful!  It is well worth the price.  I will order more, but hopefully in the future I will not received a opened bottle. Not even sure I received a full bottle.</li>
            <li> I definitely have less bruising. When I do get a blood bruise it is gone in half the time. Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any difference</li>
            <li> I purchased ths product for myself and my 95 year old mother she loves it!</li>
            <li> Works great , I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Has made a big difference on my arms.</li>
            <li> Got it for my daughter that is going thru chemo.&lt;br /&gt; She loves it, has been very good for her skin.</li>
            <li> I like it, not oily, and not much of an odor.</li>
            <li> Loved it made my skin look great!</li>
            <li> This really helps my arms,my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I have seen no results with this product. I found it to be kind of watery, my skin still stays dry and so does my face. I had to purchase a more hydrating lotion to moisture my skin. I had to give it away in order to avoid the return hassles.</li>
            <li> I saw this on facebook and it is by far the best lotion I have ever used on my arms and legs. I am very dry and nothing was working. My arms have never been in this good a shape. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps dry skin and when my skin gets angry from the sun it really helps</li>
            <li> absolutely wonderful.  I was amazed at the results form this lotion.</li>
            <li> Has helped my arthritis plagued hands with such breakable skin to be soft and easier to handle things.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion and  It does repair the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. My skin has gotten so thin due to aging and they tear very easily. Ive been using this lotion daily for a week and can already see the difference. I will definitely order this again when I need it.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with my hands bruising  for years now,  used this for less then a month and have noticed that any bruises I do get are smaller and go away quickly.  Love this.</li>
            <li> Tried this product on Abe&#x27;s Market for my significant other&#x27;s cracked hands. This has done an amazing job!!!! Purchased a bottle on Amazon and when it came in I let a guy at work who is a volunteer firefighter try it. He loved it since it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel and worked after 2 uses. I have 3 others now hooked on this product! A NICU nurse, a firefighter and a baskeball official/school administrator. They all Wash their hands A LOT.</li>
            <li> not thrilled with it yet.</li>
            <li> It really feels like normal lotion, didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the therapeutic repair lotion with macadamia nut oil.  I had a painful and itchy spot on my jaw line. I put this lotion on and almost instant relief from the itching and pain.</li>
            <li> Was thrilled to receive this product to try as my skin suffers horribly in the winter.  I have kept it at the office this week and used it often.  It absorbs quickly and easily without a greasy residue.  Fragrance free (meaning no offensive odors) which is important when you are in an office setting.  One of my co-workers was very interested as she had been hearing about products with macadamia oil.</li>
            <li> The Adamia Therapeutic Lotion is a a good natural product, similar to Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corps. It moisturizes well and absorbs readily into the skin. While I prefer a product with a light fragrance,  this is a good option for a basic fragrance free lotion.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this lotion to review and I appreciated the opportunity to try it.  I was surprised at how thin it was and the lack of fragrance.  But it does a great job--absorbs relatively quickly and has a nice feel afterwards.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solution that isn&#x27;t a thick, heavy cream.</li>
            <li> Very good product,not at all greasy,works well on my skin.</li>
            <li> It helped me somewhat, but not 100%.</li>
            <li> My skin never felt so satiny smooth!  And almost NO scent at all!! I love it!</li>
            <li> No improvement on my scars and bruising.</li>
            <li> So far arrived safely-too early to rate whether it makes a difference in the causes of the lotion it is supposed to cure.</li>
            <li> My hands are always dry &amp; cracked in the winter.  I used Adamia Therapeutic Repair lotion one time &amp; loved the results.  I also tried it on my legs &amp; feet.  All I can say is WOW!!</li>
            <li> When winter hits, my hands turn so dry that they sometimes crack.  This lotion truly helped heal my hands.  It left my hands soft &amp; not greasy.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion because it works so fast to relieve my dry skin. I work outside in the extreme weather, so my hands get dried and cracked a lot, and this is instant relief. I love that it absorbs quickly into my skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and lasts a long time.  This is great relief for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Only been using few days but good so far</li>
            <li> Love it...soothing, healing, non-greasy .</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when you apply it. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, so that is a big plus. It makes my skin smooth and moisture replaced.</li>
            <li> Have only used for about 2 weeks, don&#x27;t see a lot of difference yet, have confidence it will work!</li>
            <li> Does not repair skin like it said.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have very thin skin and it bruises and tears easily. I have applied the lotion twice a day and it has helped the healing and the scared are disappearing! I use it on my face and even my wrinkles are looking better!!! I have recommended this lotion to several people and I will defiantly buying another bottle! It has done more than I expected!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Vicki</li>
            <li> I really like it and hope it will work better on my legs with continued use.</li>
            <li> I think it is a miracle cream, it has helped my skin heal when bruised and tightened up my skin... Love it. Will buy more..</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic. ..my skin is VERY dry...have tried many other lotions, but this has been amazing for me....I purchased two bottles,and sooo glad I did,because I apply it sometimes twice a day....&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my husband. He can barely bump something and he bruises. This lotion was recommended for his problem. He has been using it for awhile now and he says the bruises seem to disappear much faster with this lotion.  My husband uses it every day. We also got some for his sister who has the same problem. She said it does the job. She said she definitely recommends this lotion for the brusing problems they both have going on with them.</li>
            <li> Very good lotion for the elderly</li>
            <li> This is the best repair lotion I have ever tried!  I have a skin condition that I have had for 3/12 years and have seen seven doctors about it.  None have had any answers for me.  I got a sample of this product and after I day of use I could start to see the difference and ordered 2 large bottles of this lotion and so glad I did.  I highly recommend this product as it really works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an anesthesiologist. I work full time in the operating room. My job entails washing my hands multiple times each day, with additional alcohol based aseptic lotion applied frequently during cases. My fingertips have dried and cracked to the point of bleeding every winter for the past twenty years, until I was introduced to Adamia. This is my second winter of using this lotion, and not having cracked, painful fingers. This is the best product I have found for a therapeutic skin repairing lotion, and I have tried &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Is doing a GREAT job on my husband&#x27;s hand!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It goes on smoothly without leaving any residue and the scent is refreshing. It is even light enough to use on my face. I will most likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome lotion and is amazing for cracked hands and feet. It is a nice large bottle so it is going to last a long time which is awesome. I use lotion multiple times a day and I am very picky about my lotion because I hate it if you get a kind that leaves your hands feeling greasy and oily and I don&#x27;t have that issue with this lotion at all. It is easy to pump out of the pump without it being too thick to come out. It applies nicely leaving my hands feeling moisturized and smooth. It heals the cracks in my hands nicely and I love how smooth they have become after use. It has helped repair and heal the cracks on my feet as well which is amazing. I received this product to share my honest thoughts and opinions about it.</li>
            <li> My friend Erin applied it to her hands, one which had a cut that was not terrible but normally would have stung if most lotions were applied. It in fact did not burn, irritate or hurt in the least bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next test, my Sethster’s eczema. I thought maybe it would be beneficial to that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought right! We applied a small amount of lotion to my kiddos affected areas…his eczema can at times get so bad he says his skin literally hurts. Usually we apply a prescription lotion that pretty much feels like your slathering lard onto skin in hopes of absorption, but this time we tried this! To our surprise by morning the area we put the lotion on was far less irritated and with another day of use it was practically gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll admit before using this lotion the only thing I associated macadamia with was cookies. My eyes have been opened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may not be elderly yet but we were able to find many uses for this lotion. From cracked feet to sunburn the lotion never failing to soothe! I’m not sayint this single lotion is a cure all but it’s come pretty close in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby’s hands also take a bit of a beating on his long days at work and our recent move from Texas to Wisconsin which is like 90 degree weather to 40 degrees caused cracking and a weird chapping on our hands and around the cuticle areas on our fingers. Both my hubby and I have had a good deal of success with the repair lotion! I do recommend this lotion if you need serious repair, have pain, irritation or have someone in your life with hurting skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
            <li> Love it! But, first bottle I bought was open and lost a lot of it in plastic bag. My only complaint. Paid for it and lost a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I am a dialysis  patient and my skin is very thin. The lotion soaked right into my skin, no greasy feeling! Felt very refreshing.  Will recommend to other people at my center!</li>
            <li> Love this body lotion.  Not greasy no strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love it...Heals quickly..</li>
            <li> It said it was non greasy but this lotion has a greasy/ oily film.  It&#x27;s too early to see any difference.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and smooth with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making a difference in the scaring on my hands and arms .  Also it&#x27;s making my skin softer</li>
            <li> I think this product works well and I like it but think it is overpriced.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m not bruising as much anymore. My skin looks &amp; feels much better. My 89 year old Mom says her skin has stopped itching. I fully intend to only use this lotion on both of us. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Its good lotion just not as good as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This is really working</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband&#x27;s thin skin on his arms.  He doesn&#x27;t remember to use it as often as he should but it is very nice lotion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Mom whos skin is DRY and arms looked bruised on top all the time. LOVE IT -LOVE IT!!! Can not say enough good about it!&lt;br /&gt;BUT-Recently I gave my self a skin peel on my face. Not my first-BUT I put the ADAMIA on my skin-WONDERFUL stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Great Lotion.  LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> Good lotion without heavy fragrance. On a bit pricy side but if you are looking for a decent lotion that is not watery, not too greasy, absorbs well and quickly to give that immediate relief I recommend this lotion. However, you do need to reapply this often if you have severe dry skin.  It does not smell at all and that&#x27;s&#x27; very important for me.  The texture is creamy but not overly thick.  I use it on my very dry hands and cracked finger tips for immediate relief and it works well. I used it on my kids legs and torso at night and it seems to help overnight.  It immediately removes that scaly, white, dry skin and you can see the lotion being absorbed in to the skin as you apply it.  Pump is very convenient. I have one on my kitchen counter and on on my kids bathroom.  I would purchase this product again. Watch out for packaging though,mine came with lotion all inside the box but I decided to keep the lotion as I was so desperate to try lotion that provides relief.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 4 year old. She had bad eczema on the inside of her elbows, the back of her knees and bottom. We used this everyday after the bath and her skin is so much better. I also use it on my own skin and love it. This is an amazing product. So happy I found it! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very softening and easy to apply. No hard rubbing involved.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Bought it for my mom and aunt.  Feels so good on hands.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and no odor</li>
            <li> I actually used this product on the dry skin on my feet and they are now much softer. It is easy to apply and not watery. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Truly no smell. I love that. Absorbs quickly and helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for, my dry hands look so smooth in just a week, I tried it on my heels for the last 2 days not expecting much, but I am impressed. I am thrilled to find a product with no fragrance that actually works. It is reasonably priced and I would recommend it to people who want results. So glad I tried this Lotion!</li>
            <li> I like how non greasy but yet moisturizer my hands felt. Living in the Midwest I&#x27;m in constant need of a good hand cream. There is no scent. This will become part of my normal routine.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin year round and especially dry heels and feet due to a low thyroid and this really did the trick. It&#x27;s not terribly greasy on my hands and it&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that does a decent job moisturizing them overnight.</li>
            <li> Positive qualities: non-greasy &amp; non-fragranced, so it&#x27;s well tolerated by folks with sensitive or fragile skin.  I prefer urea-containing preparations for significantly dry inflamed skin, but this seems to work for maintenance/prevention.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, especially for my hands. It makes my skin very shiny at first, but it absorbs quickly and is non greasy and light.  It leaves my hands quite soft.</li>
            <li> I have hand eczema and it has really helped.  I&#x27;m a RN and wash my hands alot and also wear nonlatex gloves for long periods of time. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion.Very satisfied</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not sure it does what they say is what it will do. Will not buy another Bottle!</li>
            <li> This is great lotion. Helps with thinning and blue spots. My dad loves it</li>
            <li> Like any other lotion.  I bruise easily due to medication I take and did not find this to be any better than most inexpensive lotions are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it on my legs too, as well as my arms and can see an improvement. Both seem to be smoother and definitely softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> I am 72 &amp; on a blood thinner.  The skin on my arms felt like parchment paper, very dry &amp; fragile feeling.  I used Adamia &amp; noticed a difference within 5 days.  I used it 2 times a day for a week and now put it on once day.  My skin feels soft and not so brittle.  This has certainly worked for me!  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin inproved but I do like how it makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li> I loved it when I use this bottle u bet I&#x27;ll order another one</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t prevent bruising,, however helps heal a lot faster. Am satisfied</li>
            <li> The product is great and it came very quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for my 87 year old mother in law.  Her skin paper thin and tears very easily.  within 2 weeks of using Adamia Therapeutic Lotion, her skin texture had improved, she claimed that her skin felt better and no longer hurt to the touch as it had before. It even helped with the dark discoloration in her skin from bumps and bruising. We even contacted the company directly to praise them for a lotion that actually worked.  In response to our comment, they sent us free samples to share with our friends and family.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure, I received a sample in return for a review.  I not only tried this product on my hands, but I also tried it on my face.  This is a great lotion.  It&#x27;s non greasy and absorbs well.  It feels good once it&#x27;s on and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  I&#x27;m a retail worker and the plastic bags dry out my hands as much as my hand washing does.  Very good product and I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion will order more as needed</li>
            <li> I am so excited to be able to purchase this on Amazon now. This is hands down the best therapeutic lotion that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I was REALLY impressed with this lotion! It goes on very smooth, absorbs super easily, leaves my skin feeling clean (not at ALL greasy or sticky!) and best of all, it really soothed my dry elbows! I HIGHLY recommend this lotion for anyone with dry skin!</li>
            <li> New York is in the middle of a wicked winter, and my skin is definitely feeling it. We have endured almost 30 days in a row of temperatures below freezing, with no relief in sight. My skin on my hands is dry and cracked, and not enjoyable to touch. The Adamia Repair lotion instantly soaked into my skin and gave it a much needed boost of moisture. It is a luxury that I did not realize my skin needed and deserved. I feel using this lotion now is preventing me from any future discomfort, as the cracks in my finger tips are starting to go away. I definitely recommended using Adamia, and I will likely use it throughout the year, not just during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Best of the best - works like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used. Non-greasy, soaks right in and soothing to skin on contact. Superior healing product. Love Adamia Repair Lotion. Once used, would never go back to any other lotion. There is nothing like this on the market that I&#x27;m aware of. Mild to almost fragrance free. Well worth the price, lives up to its title. Highly recommend.</li>
