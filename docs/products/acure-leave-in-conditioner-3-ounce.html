            <li>It alleviates tangles and feels great if used alone as your hair product.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>They were out of stock so happy to locate on Amazon.com</li>

            <li>My hair look, feels, and smells great.</li>
            <li>this product has greatly improved the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>its lightweight &amp; leaves my hair bouncy, glossy &amp; makes my scalp feel great.</li>
            <li>I love acure!!</li>
            <li>: It smells very nice, does not leave sticky or greasy textures, almost like water.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>(Their lotions are wonderful and I really love that I can trust their ingredients</li>
            <li>So for great results, and extremely healthy, no toxins hair care, this is the best product on the market at a fair price.</li>
            <li>and they donate to a good cause.)  </li>
            <li>this smells good but didn&#x27;t work as well as argon oil</li>
            <li>This product is good for getting tangles out, and that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for thinner or finer hair?</li>
            <li>This is an awesome light weight leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li>this seems to have good ingredients.</li>
            <li>I suffer from a lot of static electricity in winter and this is the BEST product I found for keeping the static under control.  </li>
            <li>And this one was listed as very safe end on EWG&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li>has an interesting ginger smell that I wasn&#x27;t expecting but its quite nice!</li>
            <li>It started moisturizing my hair as I sprayed it on, but as it worked it&#x27;s way in, my hair went nuts and started curling up at the ends and tangling more!</li>
            <li>I love this spray/leave in conditioner!</li>
            <li>:) I would recommend it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with them, which is concerning to me because the bottle of this product that I received smells like a very strong citronella candle or bug spray.</li>
            <li>It smells great and goes on light.</li>
            <li>The product ingredients look amazing..</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is lemony and nice, and the packaging/spray nozzle works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the product doesn&#x27;t work well for my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it when I get out of the shower if my hair is really knotty from teasing and it works great!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>As I can&#x27;t really use conditioner or hairspray, this works perfectly as both.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll buy a beauty product and it does way more harm than good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent leave in product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has an extremely strong lavender (lavender is good), sort of grassy and chamomile scent that can be smelt from the hallway of my home.</li>
            <li>SIMPLY NATURAL - SIMPLY AWESOME</li>
            <li>The Acure shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in-conditioner are pleasantly fragrant,and leave hair clean, without weight or guminess.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that (since it has gone gray underneath the hair color ,ha-ha) has become even finer, sort of wispy ,lacking body and shine.</li>
            <li>(I spray my hair every morning, after showering) and I haven&#x27;t been able to stop touching my own hair - it honestly feels THAT MUCH better.</li>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful on my hair and I love that it is natural.  </li>
            <li>(Alima Pure) too!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very light spray.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much better now</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I purchase this leave in conditioner to travel with and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It was not any better than if I had not used the product.  </li>
            <li>Acure&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner did a much better job on my hair than their leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff -</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon at such a great price - saved me time and gas!</li>
            <li>My husband can&#x27;t stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome .. Just bought my second bottle..</li>
            <li>To me it smells more like lemon/ginger</li>
            <li>I love this product line.</li>
            <li>Again, I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair for a couple years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I had much better results from the Acure shampoo, without conditioner - volume and shine.</li>
            <li>have been using Acure Organics Shampoo and Conditioner (in the shower) and just love the results!&lt;br</li>
            <li>using Acure Organic face creams and oils which are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love that they are Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an okay product .</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is probably the smell which is great .</li>
            <li>Background: I was looking for a non-toxic safe product.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing as well.</li>
            <li>Making it softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>This has a most pleasing scent and makes hair manageable after washing and styling is easier too.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love the benefits, which is why I don&#x27;t mind overusing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i never thought i could have lovely hair until i started using this protuct.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner......</li>
            <li>It smells so nice and fresh and if you read all of the ingredients, you quickly realize how good this stuff is for your hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing for long, straight,  static winter ridden hair!!  </li>
            <li>Pretty good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great leave in conditioner and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Great price on a natural product.</li>
            <li>It is light and refreshing -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not much of a detangler however, the ingredients are awesome!</li>
            <li>Good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Smells good and is gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, a fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>She originally found this at our favorite health food store.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to my daily hair routine and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>and I use this after we wash their hair for easy and painless brushing.</li>
            <li>No joke, no exaggeration, the mist from one pump of this stuff carries strong notes of cedar-wood, citronella, lavender, geranium, it smells like the brand Herbal Armor bug spray.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but got used to it.</li>
            <li>It smells too strong</li>
            <li>First, it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Only just received a few days ago, smells awesome and seems to do a great job, will need to update after using more</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product makes my hair fuller.</li>
            <li>We both have fine hair-she has baby fine hair, I have fine wavy hair, but quite a bit of hair, and it works just fine for both of us.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is fine.</li>
            <li>Granted I do have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>All the products are super affordable, organic and do what they say!</li>
            <li>Both seem equally soothing and with great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>cruelty free</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this (it smells like rose water).</li>
            <li>Light, lemony scent.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it alot and use it after every shower on damp hair.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that my hair looks so good that I wash it every other day instead of daily.</li>
            <li>Live it, great smell, and IMO works very well.</li>
            <li>This also has a strong lemongrass smell, which I happen to love, but my cat not so much.</li>
            <li>Pretty much fantastic, I will not run out of this product!</li>
            <li>First, I normally love Acure products.</li>
            <li>Spray some, use another scrunching spray, and it looks fresh!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair and needed a conditioner that would provide weightless moisture</li>
            <li>Tames the frizziness of my dry, damaged hair, making it more manageable!!</li>
            <li>I was so looking forward to it and now its just sitting on my shelf full waiting me to muster up the ability to throw 10 bucks in the trash.</li>
            <li>Did not leave my hair looking or feeling in better condition, didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and the cost isn&#x27;t much of a deterrent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad though.</li>
            <li>This product works quickly in untangling my hair after I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It is a very good detangler, I&#x27;m not sure how we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>The first time I used this leave-in conditioner, I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s pretty cheap in my opinion</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for de-tangling, and leaves my hair shiny and not-weighed down at all.</li>
            <li>Gets tangles out, smells great, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine and very oily hair, which means that I HAVE to wash it every day or else it&#x27;s plastered to my head and my scalp is very itchy.</li>
            <li>I just spray some on the last 12 inches or so of my hair, a bit more on my wide-tooth comb, and my hair combs out easily</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and straight .</li>
            <li>This has a very watery consistency and the spray bottle works fine</li>
            <li>I ordered Acure Organics Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner and received Pure Mint Conditioner in the bright blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>An amazing product that I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Just not seeing any difference with either product that makes me think it&#x27;s worth buying again.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell it almost smells like a cleaning product..</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients, and my wife loves the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>And he was right</li>
            <li>I already use the shampoo and conditioner with great results and thought adding this product to my routine would help my dry, frizzy curly hair out a little more.  </li>
            <li>When my hair dries, it is so incredibly soft, and I notice that when I use this spray my usually limp and fine hair has a lot more volume and bounce which is nothing short of remarkable.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong lemongrass smell at first, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive son, and it seems to fade away anyway.  </li>
            <li>another smell good product, and it gives my hair a little fullness</li>
            <li>No real complaints, just not seeing any amazing changes in my hair either.</li>
            <li>think this product actually made me get more split ends because it made my hair gummy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting for this my whole life!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty watery.</li>
            <li>Reduces static in winter and my hair definitely feels softer when I use it.</li>
            <li>I had to double shampoo to get the smell out of my hair because it was so potent</li>
            <li>my hair texture has totally changed for the better.  </li>
            <li>I also am able to use the oil sparingly on my facial skin.</li>
            <li>I based my purchase on the existing reviews, but I will be more dubious of reviews in the future.</li>
            <li>They look the same even after using it for more than a month .</li>
            <li>I differently will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li>However i see absolutely no change in my hair texture or any kind of anti frizz property in this product.</li>
            <li>It is a hot August morning</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re more of a conservative user, then you could probably make it last 90 days.</li>
            <li>And the added plus is it makes my hair soft smooth with no fuzzy ends sticking up.  </li>
            <li>tried Aveda&#x27;s leave in conditioner, which I like just fine, but I didn&#x27;t notice any major difference with it.  </li>
            <li>It gives a great shine and manageability especially before drying wet hair.</li>
            <li>I had really high expectations for this product as I have had success with this line before</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>Acure&#x27;s leave-in is clean to the touch, has a uniquely herbal smell, and it preps my hair nicely for the next round of abuse</li>
            <li>There are very few products out there that have good ingredients and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;pleasant, mild, natural scent&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This makes my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>Strong ginger smell, the root not the cookies, which I personally like but maybe not for everyone.</li>
            <li>I use this less as a leave-in conditioner and more as a way to wet my hair before styling but the conditioning is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>(my four year old thinks it is her perfume) and leaves our hair soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product but would suggest it for short-meduim length, thin-average thickness hair types.</li>
            <li>I still really like this product and recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the smell.  </li>
            <li>it conditions hair because I&#x27;m still in the process of giving mine some much needed told after years of abuse.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it..,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very thankful that I discovered for myself the wonders of Argan oil--</li>
            <li>The oil is messier and less easy to spread, but is extremely effective in treating dry hair.</li>
            <li>(I have very fine/thin hair)</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it after my showers and my hair really soaks it up as it helps to repair it.</li>
            <li>I have changed to organic products for my hair, and both me and my hair are much happier.  </li>
            <li>my hair cause it frizzes it up so much) and gently scrunched it with a tshirt.  </li>
            <li>i have very dense wavy hair that is frankly a b*^ch to maintain.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it works really good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why when all the other products smell so light and fresh and</li>
            <li>Very light, doesn&#x27;t really weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>Some leave-ins are nothing more than scented water/alcohol in efficiency, while other products leave hair feeling dirtier than before and in need of additional shampooing.</li>
            <li>I may buy it again, because I LOVE all other Acure products, but I&#x27;m not too keen on this one.</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine, straight hair that is prone to tangling.  </li>
            <li>I have long fine hair that is color-treated</li>
            <li>A lot of the other all natural products I have tried lately don&#x27;t smell to great!</li>
            <li>The combination of all the other ingredients was too strong .</li>
            <li>Leaves the ends feeling stiff and gunky (for lack of a better word) rather than</li>
            <li>After I wash my hair, I spray this all over, focusing mostly on the ends but also getting the crown and scalp to help tame flyaways.</li>
            <li>This is my new \\&quot;cannot live</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado and battle frizz because of the dryness.  </li>
            <li>: It didn&#x27;t do much on my thick Asian hair, except made it smell good.</li>
            <li>I normally use lots of conditioners on the ends, and I don&#x27;t rinse it completely out.  </li>
            <li>We are really careful to choose only skincare products with mostly organic and non-chemical natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and this has a nice natural scent to it.</li>
            <li>I wanted the leave in conditioner as seen in the photo, instead I got regular conditioner in a bright blue bottle!! :/</li>
            <li>and I used even less, after using Acure&#x27;s leave-in conditioner, since it seemed to give me a little more texture, right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>and normally I would come home to major frizz.  </li>
            <li>I knew of Acure Organics from SpiritBeautyLounge.com (all organic and natural beauty products)</li>
            <li>Makes the hair soft and shiny, never greasy.  </li>
            <li>soft a</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>I think it might add health to my hair but honestly not quite sure.  </li>
            <li>I found it at my local Whole Foods market.</li>
            <li>After just one use my hair appeared fuller (really, even my Husband of 20 years who probably (bless his heart ) wouldn&#x27;t notice if I got a tattoo on my upper lip</li>
            <li>As my Mother (who would be 96 years old if she were still here ) used to say &amp;#34;the proof is in the pudding&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Their Moroccan shampoo and conditioner made my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I used this when I itsy went natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is SO soft all day.</li>
            <li>----this leave in leaves my hair soft and shiny - have color treated/curly hair.</li>
            <li>No heavy residue.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of furniture polish, but it isn&#x27;t gross just a very lemony scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff also makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>If I have trouble getting rid of snarls, I just apply a bit more, but I normally only need three or four spritzes.</li>
            <li>I use this instead of a regular conditioner and make sure not to spray it on my scalp-it would make my hair too heavy if I did.</li>
            <li>I thought this would help tame my hair and leave it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if it works well or not because I can&#x27;t get over the potent smell, all the other reviews stated it smells like rosewater or some divine scent, all my other products from this line</li>
            <li>I had a difficult time at first finding more of this product</li>
            <li>My skin had been dry and flakey (I live in the high desert)</li>
            <li>Left my hair greasy with what I felt was a normal application.  </li>
            <li>long hair feels soft and full and my scalp does not itch like it did from residue from other chemical shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Really helps to smooth my dry straight hair without leaving it heavy and weighed down.</li>
            <li>Both of my kids have fine thick hair</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t over-spray, if you have fine hair this will not weigh your hair down!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this product is a little too heavy for my liking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably still use this on wet hair to help with detangling until it&#x27;s gone since it was very pricey</li>
            <li>I just recently switched to all natural shampoo, conditioner, soap, laundry detergent, toothpaste and cleaner.</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky hair (maybe 4C and a bit curlier and softer at the back of my head and on both sides), no dyes or anything.</li>
            <li>Thick, curly, or coarse tresses -- whether chemically processed or natural -- will enjoy this hair cocktail...</li>
            <li>ball(come on, it&#x27;s to my waist, if it wasn&#x27;t slightly tangled I&#x27;d be a real life disney princess), and is sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>I moved to the desert several years ago and the dry climate and heat and really taken a toll on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American, and have kinky 4C natural hair.</li>
            <li>Not great for conditioning but certainly helps with detangling hair after shower, especially long fine hair.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend spraying near the roots, especially with fine hair, but I have no problems with greasy hair or weighing down with just a few sprays.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try, I&#x27;m not sure how it will work for the finer-hair textured gals, out there, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I have very long/mildly thick/wavy hair and the effects are less noticible for my hair type.</li>
            <li>The product left my hair really sticky and weighed down.</li>
            <li>If I had to choose between the two products, i.e., the leave-in conditioner or the Argan oil, I would opt for the Argan oil; however, this product is easy to use, especially as I have very thick, longish hair, and the mist will ensure that none of my tresses are neglected.  </li>
            <li>Most conventional hair products make me sick due to the chemicals in them and most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair products do not work.</li>

            <li> Top notes of lemongrass that mellow out into a wonderful herbal fragrance - perfect.</li>
            <li> It alleviates tangles and feels great if used alone as your hair product.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  </li>
            <li> They were out of stock so happy to locate on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> This stuff is great at setting my mineral make-up</li>
            <li> smell great</li>

            <li> It smells great</li>
            <li> My hair look, feels, and smells great.</li>
            <li> this product has greatly improved the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> its lightweight &amp; leaves my hair bouncy, glossy &amp; makes my scalp feel great.</li>
            <li> I love acure!!</li>
            <li> : It smells very nice, does not leave sticky or greasy textures, almost like water.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> (Their lotions are wonderful and I really love that I can trust their ingredients</li>
            <li> So for great results, and extremely healthy, no toxins hair care, this is the best product on the market at a fair price.</li>
            <li> and they donate to a good cause.)  </li>
            <li> this smells good but didn&#x27;t work as well as argon oil</li>
            <li> This product is good for getting tangles out, and that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Maybe good for thinner or finer hair?</li>
            <li> This is an awesome light weight leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> this seems to have good ingredients.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a lot of static electricity in winter and this is the BEST product I found for keeping the static under control.  </li>
            <li> And this one was listed as very safe end on EWG&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li> has an interesting ginger smell that I wasn&#x27;t expecting but its quite nice!</li>
            <li> It started moisturizing my hair as I sprayed it on, but as it worked it&#x27;s way in, my hair went nuts and started curling up at the ends and tangling more!</li>
            <li> I love this spray/leave in conditioner!</li>
            <li> :) I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with them, which is concerning to me because the bottle of this product that I received smells like a very strong citronella candle or bug spray.</li>
            <li> It smells great and goes on light.</li>
            <li> The product ingredients look amazing..</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is lemony and nice, and the packaging/spray nozzle works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the product doesn&#x27;t work well for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it when I get out of the shower if my hair is really knotty from teasing and it works great!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> As I can&#x27;t really use conditioner or hairspray, this works perfectly as both.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll buy a beauty product and it does way more harm than good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent leave in product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It has an extremely strong lavender (lavender is good), sort of grassy and chamomile scent that can be smelt from the hallway of my home.</li>
            <li> SIMPLY NATURAL - SIMPLY AWESOME</li>
            <li> The Acure shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in-conditioner are pleasantly fragrant,and leave hair clean, without weight or guminess.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that (since it has gone gray underneath the hair color ,ha-ha) has become even finer, sort of wispy ,lacking body and shine.</li>
            <li> (I spray my hair every morning, after showering) and I haven&#x27;t been able to stop touching my own hair - it honestly feels THAT MUCH better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful on my hair and I love that it is natural.  </li>
            <li> (Alima Pure) too!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very light spray.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much better now</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this leave in conditioner to travel with and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> It was not any better than if I had not used the product.  </li>
            <li> Acure&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner did a much better job on my hair than their leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff -</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon at such a great price - saved me time and gas!</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome .. Just bought my second bottle..</li>
            <li> To me it smells more like lemon/ginger</li>
            <li> I love this product line.</li>
            <li> Again, I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair for a couple years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I had much better results from the Acure shampoo, without conditioner - volume and shine.</li>
            <li> have been using Acure Organics Shampoo and Conditioner (in the shower) and just love the results!&lt;br</li>
            <li> using Acure Organic face creams and oils which are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Love that they are Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an okay product .</li>
            <li> The only good thing about it is probably the smell which is great .</li>
            <li> Background: I was looking for a non-toxic safe product.</li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing as well.</li>
            <li> Making it softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> This has a most pleasing scent and makes hair manageable after washing and styling is easier too.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I love the benefits, which is why I don&#x27;t mind overusing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i never thought i could have lovely hair until i started using this protuct.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner......</li>
            <li> It smells so nice and fresh and if you read all of the ingredients, you quickly realize how good this stuff is for your hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing for long, straight,  static winter ridden hair!!  </li>
            <li> Pretty good conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Great price on a natural product.</li>
            <li> It is light and refreshing -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much of a detangler however, the ingredients are awesome!</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells good and is gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, a fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> She originally found this at our favorite health food store.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great addition to my daily hair routine and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> and I use this after we wash their hair for easy and painless brushing.</li>
            <li> No joke, no exaggeration, the mist from one pump of this stuff carries strong notes of cedar-wood, citronella, lavender, geranium, it smells like the brand Herbal Armor bug spray.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but got used to it.</li>
            <li> It smells too strong</li>
            <li> First, it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Only just received a few days ago, smells awesome and seems to do a great job, will need to update after using more</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product makes my hair fuller.</li>
            <li> We both have fine hair-she has baby fine hair, I have fine wavy hair, but quite a bit of hair, and it works just fine for both of us.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is fine.</li>
            <li> Granted I do have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> All the products are super affordable, organic and do what they say!</li>
            <li> Both seem equally soothing and with great fragrance.  </li>
            <li> cruelty free</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this (it smells like rose water).</li>
            <li> Light, lemony scent.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it alot and use it after every shower on damp hair.</li>
            <li> The best thing is that my hair looks so good that I wash it every other day instead of daily.</li>
            <li> Live it, great smell, and IMO works very well.</li>
            <li> This also has a strong lemongrass smell, which I happen to love, but my cat not so much.</li>
            <li> Pretty much fantastic, I will not run out of this product!</li>
            <li> First, I normally love Acure products.</li>
            <li> Spray some, use another scrunching spray, and it looks fresh!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair and needed a conditioner that would provide weightless moisture</li>
            <li> Tames the frizziness of my dry, damaged hair, making it more manageable!!</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to it and now its just sitting on my shelf full waiting me to muster up the ability to throw 10 bucks in the trash.</li>
            <li> Did not leave my hair looking or feeling in better condition, didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and the cost isn&#x27;t much of a deterrent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad though.</li>
            <li> This product works quickly in untangling my hair after I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> It is a very good detangler, I&#x27;m not sure how we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> The first time I used this leave-in conditioner, I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s pretty cheap in my opinion</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for de-tangling, and leaves my hair shiny and not-weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> Gets tangles out, smells great, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine and very oily hair, which means that I HAVE to wash it every day or else it&#x27;s plastered to my head and my scalp is very itchy.</li>
            <li> I just spray some on the last 12 inches or so of my hair, a bit more on my wide-tooth comb, and my hair combs out easily</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and straight .</li>
            <li> This has a very watery consistency and the spray bottle works fine</li>
            <li> I ordered Acure Organics Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner and received Pure Mint Conditioner in the bright blue bottle.  </li>
            <li> An amazing product that I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Just not seeing any difference with either product that makes me think it&#x27;s worth buying again.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell it almost smells like a cleaning product..</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients, and my wife loves the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> And he was right</li>
            <li> I already use the shampoo and conditioner with great results and thought adding this product to my routine would help my dry, frizzy curly hair out a little more.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dries, it is so incredibly soft, and I notice that when I use this spray my usually limp and fine hair has a lot more volume and bounce which is nothing short of remarkable.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong lemongrass smell at first, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive son, and it seems to fade away anyway.  </li>
            <li> another smell good product, and it gives my hair a little fullness</li>
            <li> No real complaints, just not seeing any amazing changes in my hair either.</li>
            <li> think this product actually made me get more split ends because it made my hair gummy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this my whole life!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty watery.</li>
            <li> Reduces static in winter and my hair definitely feels softer when I use it.</li>
            <li> I had to double shampoo to get the smell out of my hair because it was so potent</li>
            <li> my hair texture has totally changed for the better.  </li>
            <li> I also am able to use the oil sparingly on my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I based my purchase on the existing reviews, but I will be more dubious of reviews in the future.</li>
            <li> They look the same even after using it for more than a month .</li>
            <li> I differently will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li> However i see absolutely no change in my hair texture or any kind of anti frizz property in this product.</li>
            <li> It is a hot August morning</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re more of a conservative user, then you could probably make it last 90 days.</li>
            <li> And the added plus is it makes my hair soft smooth with no fuzzy ends sticking up.  </li>
            <li> tried Aveda&#x27;s leave in conditioner, which I like just fine, but I didn&#x27;t notice any major difference with it.  </li>
            <li> It gives a great shine and manageability especially before drying wet hair.</li>
            <li> I had really high expectations for this product as I have had success with this line before</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> Acure&#x27;s leave-in is clean to the touch, has a uniquely herbal smell, and it preps my hair nicely for the next round of abuse</li>
            <li> There are very few products out there that have good ingredients and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;pleasant, mild, natural scent&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This makes my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li> Strong ginger smell, the root not the cookies, which I personally like but maybe not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I use this less as a leave-in conditioner and more as a way to wet my hair before styling but the conditioning is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> (my four year old thinks it is her perfume) and leaves our hair soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but would suggest it for short-meduim length, thin-average thickness hair types.</li>
            <li> I still really like this product and recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the smell.  </li>
            <li> it conditions hair because I&#x27;m still in the process of giving mine some much needed told after years of abuse.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it..,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very thankful that I discovered for myself the wonders of Argan oil--</li>
            <li> The oil is messier and less easy to spread, but is extremely effective in treating dry hair.</li>
            <li> (I have very fine/thin hair)</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it after my showers and my hair really soaks it up as it helps to repair it.</li>
            <li> I have changed to organic products for my hair, and both me and my hair are much happier.  </li>
            <li> my hair cause it frizzes it up so much) and gently scrunched it with a tshirt.  </li>
            <li> i have very dense wavy hair that is frankly a b*^ch to maintain.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it works really good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why when all the other products smell so light and fresh and</li>
            <li> Very light, doesn&#x27;t really weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Some leave-ins are nothing more than scented water/alcohol in efficiency, while other products leave hair feeling dirtier than before and in need of additional shampooing.</li>
            <li> I may buy it again, because I LOVE all other Acure products, but I&#x27;m not too keen on this one.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine, straight hair that is prone to tangling.  </li>
            <li> I have long fine hair that is color-treated</li>
            <li> A lot of the other all natural products I have tried lately don&#x27;t smell to great!</li>
            <li> The combination of all the other ingredients was too strong .</li>
            <li> Leaves the ends feeling stiff and gunky (for lack of a better word) rather than</li>
            <li> After I wash my hair, I spray this all over, focusing mostly on the ends but also getting the crown and scalp to help tame flyaways.</li>
            <li> This is my new \\&quot;cannot live</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado and battle frizz because of the dryness.  </li>
            <li> : It didn&#x27;t do much on my thick Asian hair, except made it smell good.</li>
            <li> I normally use lots of conditioners on the ends, and I don&#x27;t rinse it completely out.  </li>
            <li> We are really careful to choose only skincare products with mostly organic and non-chemical natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this has a nice natural scent to it.</li>
            <li> I wanted the leave in conditioner as seen in the photo, instead I got regular conditioner in a bright blue bottle!! :/</li>
            <li> and I used even less, after using Acure&#x27;s leave-in conditioner, since it seemed to give me a little more texture, right off the bat.  </li>
            <li> and normally I would come home to major frizz.  </li>
            <li> I knew of Acure Organics from SpiritBeautyLounge.com (all organic and natural beauty products)</li>
            <li> Makes the hair soft and shiny, never greasy.  </li>
            <li> soft a</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> I think it might add health to my hair but honestly not quite sure.  </li>
            <li> I found it at my local Whole Foods market.</li>
            <li> After just one use my hair appeared fuller (really, even my Husband of 20 years who probably (bless his heart ) wouldn&#x27;t notice if I got a tattoo on my upper lip</li>
            <li> As my Mother (who would be 96 years old if she were still here ) used to say &amp;#34;the proof is in the pudding&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Their Moroccan shampoo and conditioner made my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I used this when I itsy went natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is SO soft all day.</li>
            <li> ----this leave in leaves my hair soft and shiny - have color treated/curly hair.</li>
            <li> No heavy residue.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of furniture polish, but it isn&#x27;t gross just a very lemony scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff also makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> If I have trouble getting rid of snarls, I just apply a bit more, but I normally only need three or four spritzes.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of a regular conditioner and make sure not to spray it on my scalp-it would make my hair too heavy if I did.</li>
            <li> I thought this would help tame my hair and leave it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it works well or not because I can&#x27;t get over the potent smell, all the other reviews stated it smells like rosewater or some divine scent, all my other products from this line</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time at first finding more of this product</li>
            <li> My skin had been dry and flakey (I live in the high desert)</li>
            <li> Left my hair greasy with what I felt was a normal application.  </li>
            <li> long hair feels soft and full and my scalp does not itch like it did from residue from other chemical shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Really helps to smooth my dry straight hair without leaving it heavy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Both of my kids have fine thick hair</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t over-spray, if you have fine hair this will not weigh your hair down!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product is a little too heavy for my liking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably still use this on wet hair to help with detangling until it&#x27;s gone since it was very pricey</li>
            <li> I just recently switched to all natural shampoo, conditioner, soap, laundry detergent, toothpaste and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair (maybe 4C and a bit curlier and softer at the back of my head and on both sides), no dyes or anything.</li>
            <li> Thick, curly, or coarse tresses -- whether chemically processed or natural -- will enjoy this hair cocktail...</li>
            <li> ball(come on, it&#x27;s to my waist, if it wasn&#x27;t slightly tangled I&#x27;d be a real life disney princess), and is sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> I moved to the desert several years ago and the dry climate and heat and really taken a toll on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American, and have kinky 4C natural hair.</li>
            <li> Not great for conditioning but certainly helps with detangling hair after shower, especially long fine hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend spraying near the roots, especially with fine hair, but I have no problems with greasy hair or weighing down with just a few sprays.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try, I&#x27;m not sure how it will work for the finer-hair textured gals, out there, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I have very long/mildly thick/wavy hair and the effects are less noticible for my hair type.</li>
            <li> The product left my hair really sticky and weighed down.</li>
            <li> If I had to choose between the two products, i.e., the leave-in conditioner or the Argan oil, I would opt for the Argan oil; however, this product is easy to use, especially as I have very thick, longish hair, and the mist will ensure that none of my tresses are neglected.  </li>
            <li> Most conventional hair products make me sick due to the chemicals in them and most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair products do not work.</li>
            <li> , $10-11, at least it is at Whole Foods and Central Market, which seems to be the only Brick-and-Mortar stores in my neighborhood that carry Acure products.</li>
            <li> would certainly recommend this for naturally curly, yet thin, hair.</li>
            <li> I spray it in and use it as a detangler for when I comb my long hair.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair moisturized, and I can actually get a brush through it when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I have always had long hair and consider myself well-versed in hair care products.  </li>
            <li> This is not a product for anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long wavy hair .  </li>
            <li> Also, because I have a thick &amp;#34;Jew-Fro&amp;#34; is doesn&#x27;t do much justice for my hair.</li>
            <li> (brown is my natural color and the color is also brown) and because I am between highlighting it&#x27;s just a little dry.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful for this product, but even after multiple attempts, I found it left my hair sticky, weighed down, matted and straw</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also just dry from being long -</li>
            <li> I have a long beard, but pool water makes it dry and breaks.  </li>
            <li> Works well on my long hair in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li> I spray this on before blowing drying my hair or even when I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are as listed and the leave in does wonders for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> That means a lot of shampooing and a lot of opportunities for my hair to dry out.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the Acure Argan oil, and my formerly dry hair is now silky looking.  </li>
            <li> But if your hair is dry or damaged it probably won&#x27;t work .</li>
            <li> (I no longer towel dry</li>
            <li> So if you have thin straight hair and an affinity for bug spray, then this is definitely the product for you.</li>
            <li> (my natural color is dark, usually colored dark red) and I am STILL growing out the damage from the blonde.  </li>
            <li> With this product, I saturated all of my hair after only drying it half way and let it air dry the remainder.</li>
            <li> Helps with a little extra conditioning that I need for my dry hair</li>
            <li> Instead I found it to leave my hair very dry looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I went blonde</li>
            <li> I spray and scrunch this into my towel dried hair after showering, and then hit my roots with a very low heat blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read carefully as I was looking for a richer cream leave-in.</li>
            <li> I feel absolutely NO difference in my hair when I use this.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my sopping wet hair</li>
            <li> My thick hair has gone through almost every concoction homemade, store-bought, or \\&quot;professional salon\\&quot; formulated.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use this on my hair dry also to freshen up my waves and cut down the frizz.</li>
            <li> I also use other Acure products:  the shampoo and conditioner with argan oil, and facial moisturizers for day and for night, and also plain argan oil for my skin and hair during winter.</li>
            <li> Just not rich enough for my coarse thick hair.</li>
            <li> Some other products I have used seem to make my hair greasy</li>
            <li> They look nothing like the each other.</li>
            <li> The other product I was using, Neutragina Tripple Moisterizer was rated a zero because it had chemicals banned in the EU and Japan.  </li>
            <li> My hair was glossier, felt a little thicker, and didn&#x27;t feel at all dry.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I am VERY heavy handed when it comes it applying this stuff, so it only lasts me about a month.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and am wanting it to grow a few inches longer yet.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair that I was having trouble keeping moisturized.</li>
            <li> And, I haven&#x27;t used this in the dead of winter when it&#x27;s very dry, so &#x27;results may vary&#x27; at that time of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is waist length, so a lot longer than the average person.</li>
            <li> If you focus on the roots, I can see how this would weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> But you can give it a try if you have oily scalp and need something to refresh it and don&#x27;t want to weigh it down .</li>
            <li> , I see that this product is now $5 less as opposed to what I paid.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use additional styling creams/pomades, except maybe a little finishing serum.</li>
            <li> Although, If I do, which is hard to do in my case of moisture needing hair, a little dry shampoo does the trick!</li>
            <li> It leaves my curls together yet does not weight my hair down!</li>
            <li> I really like the Acure shampoo, but the conditioner was a disappointment - it didn&#x27;t add volume or shine.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot feel the difference from the harsh water we have in our home.</li>
            <li> Have recommended to a few of my friends in the neighborhood</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few days now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful for frizz and texture when applied to my hair dried.</li>
            <li> have thin shoulder length hair, will go back to infusium.</li>
            <li> It smells like bug spray (heavy on the citronella).</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s firm and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> so my hair basically dried on the walk</li>
            <li> trying it for a few weeks now and undecided.</li>
            <li> the morning my hair is significantly less tangled than the usual</li>
            <li> They are half the price and at least I get results.  </li>
            <li> It was not more manageable.</li>
            <li> Leave-in conditioners usually annoy me for being ineffective and/or expensive, but necessary in my hair maintenance routine.</li>
            <li> I usually have planned (e.g. blowdrying, flatironing, ponytail, twisting, rolling, etc.).</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for some daily moisture resolution, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  Program glitch resolved and the return process went through like a breeze (as usual).</li>
            <li> But to my delight, my hair is crazy soft and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> i was expecting a bit heavier product that would control frizz and somewhat repair dull damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I have  used Wen and that at least provides a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally dirty blond hair that will lighten to white gold in the summer.</li>
            <li> There is a definite unpleasant smell, but it goes away as my hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed some serious moisture plus something to protect my ends.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend even took notice, and we all know how hard it is for them to notice things like hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several days and have to say I am extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> No more tangles!!</li>
            <li> No more weird, questionable chemicals in my leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It also gave my hair this weird texture.</li>
            <li> However, when I decided to try this over my usual &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; leave-in sprary, I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> You have the wrong photo on your product page.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a product review before, but I am so unhappy with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend Acure products just disappointed with receiving the wrong product from this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HATED this stuff.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product myself and on my daughter. It alleviates tangles and feels great if used alone as your hair product.</li>
            <li> I like it that&#x27;s all, do recommend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic hair product and this is it. I have fine hair and this product makes my hair fuller. The best thing is that my hair looks so good that I wash it every other day instead of daily.</li>
            <li> Only just received a few days ago, smells awesome and seems to do a great job, will need to update after using more</li>
            <li> I have used the sephora product for a while which is almost 3x more expensive. This product has a different smell to it but not offensive. My hair feels so much better now and I cannot feel the difference from the harsh water we have in our home. Have recommended to a few of my friends in the neighborhood</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!!!</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and am wanting it to grow a few inches longer yet.  A few years ago, I went blonde (my natural color is dark, usually colored dark red) and I am STILL growing out the damage from the blonde.  It&#x27;s also just dry from being long - I needed some serious moisture plus something to protect my ends.  I don&#x27;t use shampoo (I weaned off about 6 months ago, I only use a tiny bit of baking soda in a travel-size bottle of water to rinse my hair every day or so, to control oil.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Aveda&#x27;s leave in conditioner, which I like just fine, but I didn&#x27;t notice any major difference with it.  I knew of Acure Organics from SpiritBeautyLounge.com (all organic and natural beauty products) - I&#x27;ve used Acure Organics lotions before, so decided to give their conditioner a try.  (Their lotions are wonderful and I really love that I can trust their ingredients and they donate to a good cause.)  The first time I used this leave-in conditioner, I noticed a huge difference.  My hair was glossier, felt a little thicker, and didn&#x27;t feel at all dry.  The only hair product I ever use is a dab of Bb Texture (by Bumble &amp; Bumble) and I used even less, after using Acure&#x27;s leave-in conditioner, since it seemed to give me a little more texture, right off the bat.  This is my new \\&quot;cannot live without\\&quot; hair product.  It&#x27;s been a few days now (I spray my hair every morning, after showering) and I haven&#x27;t been able to stop touching my own hair - it honestly feels THAT MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Makes the hair soft and shiny, never greasy.  And it smells divine.  Have already repurchased the item.  I never want to be without it.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is lemony and nice, and the packaging/spray nozzle works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the product doesn&#x27;t work well for my hair. Leaves the ends feeling stiff and gunky (for lack of a better word) rather than soft a manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably still use this on wet hair to help with detangling until it&#x27;s gone since it was very pricey and I don&#x27;t want to just throw it away, but I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  My hair is so soft after using it.  I apply while hair is damp.</li>
            <li> i was expecting a bit heavier product that would control frizz and somewhat repair dull damaged hair.  this smells good but didn&#x27;t work as well as argon oil</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair and needed a conditioner that would provide weightless moisture and oh is this the perfect product! First, it smells AMAZING. Top notes of lemongrass that mellow out into a wonderful herbal fragrance - perfect. Second, it WORKS. After I wash my hair, I spray this all over, focusing mostly on the ends but also getting the crown and scalp to help tame flyaways. When my hair dries, it is so incredibly soft, and I notice that when I use this spray my usually limp and fine hair has a lot more volume and bounce which is nothing short of remarkable. As long as you don&#x27;t over-spray, if you have fine hair this will not weigh your hair down! Pretty much fantastic, I will not run out of this product!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  I think it might add health to my hair but honestly not quite sure.  I&#x27;ve been using it as well as 10 Miracle Leave In.  Both seem equally soothing and with great fragrance.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really helps to smooth my dry straight hair without leaving it heavy and weighed down. I found it at my local Whole Foods market. They were out of stock so happy to locate on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so shiny and smells amazinggg</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft! has an interesting ginger smell that I wasn&#x27;t expecting but its quite nice!</li>
            <li> cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;glosses hair w/out stiffness&lt;br /&gt;pleasant, mild, natural scent&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this for naturally curly, yet thin, hair.</li>
            <li> I just recently switched to all natural shampoo, conditioner, soap, laundry detergent, toothpaste and cleaner. I purchase this leave in conditioner to travel with and I absolutely love it.  It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This should be call hair food...because it feeds your hair what it needs most....moisture and life!  it helps keep hair in wonderful shape.  I color my hair alot and this helps repair it.  Also helps with frizzy hair too! :D</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for my hair. I have long fine hair that is color-treated (brown is my natural color and the color is also brown) and because I am between highlighting it&#x27;s just a little dry. I have  used Wen and that at least provides a noticeable difference. With this product, I saturated all of my hair after only drying it half way and let it air dry the remainder. It was not any better than if I had not used the product.  It was not softer. It was not shinier. It was not more manageable. And as someone else already pointed out, it does not detangle. I had washed my hair minutes prior with ACURE argan oil shampoo. Just not seeing any difference with either product that makes me think it&#x27;s worth buying again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but would suggest it for short-meduim length, thin-average thickness hair types. I have very long/mildly thick/wavy hair and the effects are less noticible for my hair type. It&#x27;s a great addition to my daily hair routine and smells lovely. It&#x27;s helpful for frizz and texture when applied to my hair dried. I still really like this product and recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Dear Acure, please don&#x27;t change the ingredients! I&#x27;m quite the hair product collector, especially when it comes to leave-in conditioners, but I have been using this after every wash for the last couple months. My thick hair has gone through almost every concoction homemade, store-bought, or \\&quot;professional salon\\&quot; formulated. Leave-in conditioners usually annoy me for being ineffective and/or expensive, but necessary in my hair maintenance routine. With that said, I looooove this leave-in!! Some leave-ins are nothing more than scented water/alcohol in efficiency, while other products leave hair feeling dirtier than before and in need of additional shampooing. Acure&#x27;s leave-in is clean to the touch, has a uniquely herbal smell, and it preps my hair nicely for the next round of abuse I usually have planned (e.g. blowdrying, flatironing, ponytail, twisting, rolling, etc.). I don&#x27;t even have to use additional styling creams/pomades, except maybe a little finishing serum. Thick, curly, or coarse tresses -- whether chemically processed or natural -- will enjoy this hair cocktail... I know mine do!</li>
            <li> This product is good for getting tangles out, and that&#x27;s about it.  I really dislike the smell.  It reminds me of a homemade bug spray, or furniture polish.  Even though I don&#x27;t care for the smell, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair feel any softer, or look any smoother.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that (since it has gone gray underneath the hair color ,ha-ha) has become even finer, sort of wispy ,lacking body and shine. After just one use my hair appeared fuller (really, even my Husband of 20 years who probably (bless his heart ) wouldn&#x27;t notice if I got a tattoo on my upper lip said &amp;#34;wow, your hair looks wonderful&amp;#34; ! And he was right, it WAS shiny and (the only way I can describe it) fuller looking, as if I had thicker hair ! I read the ingredients and frankly, don&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;miracle &amp;#34; ingredients in this stuff but I do know it changed the look and feel of my hair and that&#x27;s all I care about. As my Mother (who would be 96 years old if she were still here ) used to say &amp;#34;the proof is in the pudding&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good product. Helps detangle hair, but not moisturizing enough. Have to spray a lot each time to feel the difference. Not great for conditioning but certainly helps with detangling hair after shower, especially long fine hair. Too pricey for a 4 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for some daily moisture resolution, I was wrong. I have natural kinky hair (maybe 4C and a bit curlier and softer at the back of my head and on both sides), no dyes or anything. This product did not work for me. It started moisturizing my hair as I sprayed it on, but as it worked it&#x27;s way in, my hair went nuts and started curling up at the ends and tangling more! It also gave my hair this weird texture. My hair was washed before, so nothing was in it after washing it since I waited patiently for this product to arrive. I do not care for the scent either. It has an extremely strong lavender (lavender is good), sort of grassy and chamomile scent that can be smelt from the hallway of my home. The combination of all the other ingredients was too strong . Acure&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner did a much better job on my hair than their leave in conditioner. Their Moroccan shampoo and conditioner made my hair soft and manageable.  I will not purchase this leave in conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, who has longish hair, b/c he never seemed to use the conditioner in the shower.  I vetted it on the EWG database (I don&#x27;t remember the score, but it was sufficient for me) and bought it based on the reviews.  It does have a strong lemongrass smell at first, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive son, and it seems to fade away anyway.  No more tangles!!</li>
            <li> It is a very good detangler, I&#x27;m not sure how we&#x27;ll it conditions hair because I&#x27;m still in the process of giving mine some much needed told after years of abuse. It smells great and goes on light.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful for this product, but even after multiple attempts, I found it left my hair sticky, weighed down, matted and straw like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally dirty blond hair that will lighten to white gold in the summer. It is mid back lengthy and prone to split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product actually made me get more split ends because it made my hair gummy.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! On my 2nd bottle!!! Tames the frizziness of my dry, damaged hair, making it more manageable!! I just concentrate it on the ends after getting out of the shower, being careful not to get too much near the scalp. Although, If I do, which is hard to do in my case of moisture needing hair, a little dry shampoo does the trick! This stuff is great at setting my mineral make-up (Alima Pure) too!!!!</li>
            <li> Both of my kids have fine thick hair and I use this after we wash their hair for easy and painless brushing.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine, straight hair that is prone to tangling.  I normally use lots of conditioners on the ends, and I don&#x27;t rinse it completely out.  With this product, I don&#x27;t need  conditioner at all!  I just spray some on the last 12 inches or so of my hair, a bit more on my wide-tooth comb, and my hair combs out easily, there&#x27;s no drizzle, and my hair stays silky all day.  If I have trouble getting rid of snarls, I just apply a bit more, but I normally only need three or four spritzes. There is a definite unpleasant smell, but it goes away as my hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I don&#x27;t ever use a blow drier, so you may still need to use regular conditioner if you do.  And, I haven&#x27;t used this in the dead of winter when it&#x27;s very dry, so &#x27;results may vary&#x27; at that time of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent leave in product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this leave-in-conditioner for a couple years.  We are really careful to choose only skincare products with mostly organic and non-chemical natural ingredients. There are very few products out there that have good ingredients and this is one of them. She originally found this at our favorite health food store.  She would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I used this when I itsy went natural. Live it, great smell, and IMO works very well.</li>
            <li> The best leave in conditioner I have ever used! My hair is SO soft all day. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I thought this would help tame my hair and leave it silky smooth. Instead I found it to leave my hair very dry looking and feeling. Maybe it is because I get permanent hair color treatments?</li>
            <li> I HATED this stuff. Made my hair feel like straw. Threw it away after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> This is the best for my curly hair! I&#x27;ve been waiting for this my whole life! It leaves my curls together yet does not weight my hair down!</li>
            <li> Left my hair greasy with what I felt was a normal application.  A lighter application helped reduce the greasy feel, but did not control the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin shoulder length hair, will go back to infusium.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - I use the conditioner for dry hair ----this leave in leaves my hair soft and shiny - have color treated/curly hair. Sells out at the stores I buy it from - relieved I found it on Amazon at such a great price - saved me time and gas!</li>
            <li> I use it when I get out of the shower if my hair is really knotty from teasing and it works great! But I don&#x27;t notice my hair any softer. It&#x27;s also pretty watery. I may buy it again, because I LOVE all other Acure products, but I&#x27;m not too keen on this one.</li>
            <li> I use this leave-in when I get out of the shower. I spray it in and use it as a detangler for when I comb my long hair. The smell is nice, not too overpowering. Reduces static in winter and my hair definitely feels softer when I use it.</li>
            <li> This product has been a saving grace for my hair. I have very long hair that I was having trouble keeping moisturized. This product keeps my hair moisturized, and I can actually get a brush through it when my hair is wet. An amazing product that I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I spray this on before blowing drying my hair or even when I let it air dry. No heavy residue. Helps with a little extra conditioning that I need for my dry hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like a conditioner to me, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair easier to comb, which is what I expect from a conditioner. Strong ginger smell, the root not the cookies, which I personally like but maybe not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Rated only 3 stars because it has a smell that did not appeal to me. However, since it has argan oil and I am a fan of argan oli, I would still use it.</li>
            <li> Just not rich enough for my coarse thick hair. Maybe good for thinner or finer hair?</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this (it smells like rose water). I have very fine hair and this product is a little too heavy for my liking. I use this instead of a regular conditioner and make sure not to spray it on my scalp-it would make my hair too heavy if I did.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful on my hair and I love that it is natural.  Most conventional hair products make me sick due to the chemicals in them and most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair products do not work.</li>
            <li> Helps with damaged hair</li>
            <li> I love acure!! All the products are super affordable, organic and do what they say! I would give this 5 stars but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell it almost smells like a cleaning product.. But when it try&#x27;s you can&#x27;t smell a thing</li>
            <li> Great price on a natural product. The ingredients are as listed and the leave in does wonders for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I already use the shampoo and conditioner with great results and thought adding this product to my routine would help my dry, frizzy curly hair out a little more.  I can&#x27;t tell you if it works well or not because I can&#x27;t get over the potent smell, all the other reviews stated it smells like rosewater or some divine scent, all my other products from this line smell great and I am very pleased with them, which is concerning to me because the bottle of this product that I received smells like a very strong citronella candle or bug spray. No joke, no exaggeration, the mist from one pump of this stuff carries strong notes of cedar-wood, citronella, lavender, geranium, it smells like the brand Herbal Armor bug spray. Others have made the same comment on it when I asked them to smell it, in fact all my sisters were in town and I had them each smell it without telling them what it was and they all said the same thing bug spray, not kidding! I had to double shampoo to get the smell out of my hair because it was so potent it was actually giving me a headache. I don&#x27;t understand why when all the other products smell so light and fresh and no one made this compliant about this product makes me wonder what the heck did I get?  Did someone pour something else into the bottle before selling to to me? I was so looking forward to it and now its just sitting on my shelf full waiting me to muster up the ability to throw 10 bucks in the trash.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients, and my wife loves the way it smells.  I use this less as a leave-in conditioner and more as a way to wet my hair before styling but the conditioning is a nice bonus.  I will definitely buy it again (already have in fact).</li>
            <li> I have bleached, damaged hair, and this stuff works great! No more weird, questionable chemicals in my leave-in conditioner. I can spray this stuff into the ends of my hair, and inhale it without worry. This stuff is great for de-tangling, and leaves my hair shiny and not-weighed down at all. Perfect product!</li>
            <li> This is a great leave in conditioner. I have thick hair and it works really good. Smells great also!</li>
            <li> I have very fine and very oily hair, which means that I HAVE to wash it every day or else it&#x27;s plastered to my head and my scalp is very itchy. That means a lot of shampooing and a lot of opportunities for my hair to dry out. Which it used to, all the time, until I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just some backstory: My hair is waist length, so a lot longer than the average person. I also shower at night, so my hair is always a bit damp when I go to bed. I spray and scrunch this into my towel dried hair after showering, and then hit my roots with a very low heat blow dryer. I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for about a week now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how my hair has responding to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about 3-5 sprays, depending on my hair, focusing on the ends. If you focus on the roots, I can see how this would weigh down your hair. This also has a strong lemongrass smell, which I happen to love, but my cat not so much. He used to knead my hair on my pillow, but avoids it when I have my conditioner in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning my hair is significantly less tangled than the usual frizz ball(come on, it&#x27;s to my waist, if it wasn&#x27;t slightly tangled I&#x27;d be a real life disney princess), and is sooooooo soft. My husband can&#x27;t stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and it&#x27;s VEGAN!!! Which is a big deal to me, even if it isn&#x27;t for you. Argan oil seems to be all the rage in the beauty world and methinks there&#x27;s something to it!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it makes my hair feel softer though it does not get rid of the frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome .. Just bought my second bottle.. The whole family uses it..,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very thankful that I discovered for myself the wonders of Argan oil--my hair texture has totally changed for the better.  I use this product along with the Acure Argan oil, and my formerly dry hair is now silky looking.  If I had to choose between the two products, i.e., the leave-in conditioner or the Argan oil, I would opt for the Argan oil; however, this product is easy to use, especially as I have very thick, longish hair, and the mist will ensure that none of my tresses are neglected.  The oil is messier and less easy to spread, but is extremely effective in treating dry hair. I also am able to use the oil sparingly on my facial skin.</li>
            <li> This product works quickly in untangling my hair after I get out of the shower.  It is light and refreshing - I don&#x27;t mind the scent at all although I know others think it smells like cleaning fluid or foot spray.  To me it smells more like lemon/ginger and it doesn&#x27;t bother me to put it in my hair.  Some other products I have used seem to make my hair greasy (I have very fine/thin hair) but this one does not so that is one of the reasons I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of furniture polish, but it isn&#x27;t gross just a very lemony scent. I don&#x27;t think it helped make my hair any softer but it did help with tangles.</li>
            <li> I love this product line. Smells good and is gentle on my hair. I will purchase this again, along with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this spray/leave in conditioner! It smells so nice and fresh and if you read all of the ingredients, you quickly realize how good this stuff is for your hair. Again, I love the smell. A lot of the other all natural products I have tried lately don&#x27;t smell to great! This stuff also makes my hair really soft. :) I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> First, I normally love Acure products. I have used their facial products for years.However, when I decided to try this over my usual &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; leave-in sprary, I was highly disappointed. It smells like bug spray (heavy on the citronella). Also, because I have a thick &amp;#34;Jew-Fro&amp;#34; is doesn&#x27;t do much justice for my hair. So if you have thin straight hair and an affinity for bug spray, then this is definitely the product for you. Otherwise, I would just stick to their facial skin care line.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair for a couple years now and love it.  It smells great (my four year old thinks it is her perfume) and leaves our hair soft and tangle free.  We both have fine hair-she has baby fine hair, I have fine wavy hair, but quite a bit of hair, and it works just fine for both of us.  I would not recommend spraying near the roots, especially with fine hair, but I have no problems with greasy hair or weighing down with just a few sprays.  Sometimes I use this on my hair dry also to freshen up my waves and cut down the frizz.</li>
            <li> Light, lemony scent. Doesnt leave an olily feeling on the hair. I enjoy it alot and use it after every shower on damp hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful leave in conditioner. It gives a great shine and manageability especially before drying wet hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the Acure shampoo, but the conditioner was a disappointment - it didn&#x27;t add volume or shine.  I had much better results from the Acure shampoo, without conditioner - volume and shine.</li>
            <li> Pretty good conditioner. The smell is strong but got used to it. But it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works wonders! Recommend!</li>
            <li> You have the wrong photo on your product page. The photo is of the leave in conditioner NOT the regular conditioner you use in the shower. They look nothing like the each other. I wanted the leave in conditioner as seen in the photo, instead I got regular conditioner in a bright blue bottle!! :/</li>
            <li> another smell good product, and it gives my hair a little fullness</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine. I didn&#x27;t read carefully as I was looking for a richer cream leave-in. This is a very light spray. It&#x27;s not bad though.</li>
            <li> I ordered Acure Organics Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner and received Pure Mint Conditioner in the bright blue bottle.  I am attempting to return it but there appears to be a glitch in the return program.  Will keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Acure Organics Shampoo and Conditioner (in the shower) and just love the results!&lt;br /&gt;My long hair feels soft and full and my scalp does not itch like it did from residue from other chemical shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also using Acure Organic face creams and oils which are fantastic!  My skin had been dry and flakey (I live in the high desert) but now it&#x27;s firm and hydrated.  Love that they are Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend Acure products just disappointed with receiving the wrong product from this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Program glitch resolved and the return process went through like a breeze (as usual).</li>
            <li> I had really high expectations for this product as I have had success with this line before but I was greatly disappointed. The product left my hair really sticky and weighed down. Granted I do have fine hair but this product did not increase shine or manageability. Skip it!</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it on days I don&#x27;t wash my hair (it&#x27;s curly, can&#x27;t wash it all the time). Spray some, use another scrunching spray, and it looks fresh! Will definitely use/buy this again. Very light, doesn&#x27;t really weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, a fresh smell.  Did not leave my hair looking or feeling in better condition, didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> I have always had long hair and consider myself well-versed in hair care products.  I moved to the desert several years ago and the dry climate and heat and really taken a toll on my hair.  I read the reviews for this product--which professed wonderful results, so I bought it.  I&#x27;ve used it for several days and have to say I am extremely disappointed.  I feel absolutely NO difference in my hair when I use this.  None.  Additionally, it smells like a foot cream and not something for one&#x27;s hair.  If the product worked, I wouldn&#x27;t have minded the smell.  It&#x27;s not a smell where you would say, &amp;#34;Mmmm...that smells nice.&amp;#34;  It doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve never written a product review before, but I am so unhappy with it.  I based my purchase on the existing reviews, but I will be more dubious of reviews in the future. Not only that, I see that this product is now $5 less as opposed to what I paid.  I&#x27;m going to stick with over-the-counter and products from Sally Beauty.  They are half the price and at least I get results.  This is not a product for anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my son. I was expecting a smoother turnout since it has argan oil. It smells too strong so my son won&#x27;t let me spray it in his hair. It&#x27;s not much of a detangler however, the ingredients are awesome! I use it after my showers and my hair really soaks it up as it helps to repair it.</li>
            <li> I have a long beard, but pool water makes it dry and breaks.  If enough breaks in one place, then you have to trim it back short again to even it all off again.  This product with the shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner works.  Best of all GoodGuide.com rates this product a 10 for health.  The other product I was using, Neutragina Tripple Moisterizer was rated a zero because it had chemicals banned in the EU and Japan.  So for great results, and extremely healthy, no toxins hair care, this is the best product on the market at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I have changed to organic products for my hair, and both me and my hair are much happier.  I also use other Acure products:  the shampoo and conditioner with argan oil, and facial moisturizers for day and for night, and also plain argan oil for my skin and hair during winter.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair super soft.  A little goes a long way and this has a nice natural scent to it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an okay product . My hair is fine and straight . This has a very watery consistency and the spray bottle works fine but I don&#x27;t see any effect of it on the hair . They look the same even after using it for more than a month . The only good thing about it is probably the smell which is great . But if your hair is dry or damaged it probably won&#x27;t work . But you can give it a try if you have oily scalp and need something to refresh it and don&#x27;t want to weigh it down .</li>
            <li> Background: I was looking for a non-toxic safe product. And this one was listed as very safe end on EWG&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It smells very nice, does not leave sticky or greasy textures, almost like water.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It didn&#x27;t do much on my thick Asian hair, except made it smell good.</li>
            <li> As I can&#x27;t really use conditioner or hairspray, this works perfectly as both.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome light weight leave-in treatment. I use it daily and it helps detangle my hair. The scent is refreshing as well.</li>
            <li> Works well on my long hair in a dry climate. I would note that its grassy scent is stronger than I would like, so I mix it with another leave-in that I use: sexyhairorganic.</li>
            <li> It has done wonder&#x27;s for my hair. I like the smell of it and the ingredient&#x27;s work well with my hair. Making it softer and more manageable. I differently will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time at first finding more of this product but voila! of course it is at Amazon.  This has a most pleasing scent and makes hair manageable after washing and styling is easier too.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The product ingredients look amazing..all organic , wonderful , non chemical list. However i see absolutely no change in my hair texture or any kind of anti frizz property in this product. Absolute waste of money .</li>
            <li> I just bought this product, though not through Amazon.  But, I came here to see what others had to say about it and thought I would chime in.  I have fairly long wavy hair .  I live in Colorado and battle frizz because of the dryness.  I sprayed it on my sopping wet hair (I no longer towel dry my hair cause it frizzes it up so much) and gently scrunched it with a tshirt.  Then I went for a walk.  It is a hot August morning so my hair basically dried on the walk and normally I would come home to major frizz.  But to my delight, my hair is crazy soft and not frizzy.  I am so excited!!!!!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how the texture of my hair improves over weeks of use.  Yippee!!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll up my rating later... trying it for a few weeks now and undecided. No real complaints, just not seeing any amazing changes in my hair either. Hoping it is working! Does not seem to be drying my hair out, so that&#x27;s good! Sometimes I&#x27;ll buy a beauty product and it does way more harm than good. I like that this seems to have good ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 7-8 months now, and my hair LOVES IT! I&#x27;m African American, and have kinky 4C natural hair. I love the smell, and the cost isn&#x27;t much of a deterrent. Granted, I am VERY heavy handed when it comes it applying this stuff, so it only lasts me about a month. If you&#x27;re more of a conservative user, then you could probably make it last 90 days. That being said, it&#x27;s pretty cheap in my opinion and I love the benefits, which is why I don&#x27;t mind overusing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about the same cost everywhere, $10-11, at least it is at Whole Foods and Central Market, which seems to be the only Brick-and-Mortar stores in my neighborhood that carry Acure products. It&#x27;s ALWAYS out of stock, though! I suppose this shows that a lot of people know how awesome it is. Give it a try, I&#x27;m not sure how it will work for the finer-hair textured gals, out there, but it&#x27;s worth a shot. My hair look, feels, and smells great. My boyfriend even took notice, and we all know how hard it is for them to notice things like hair! Give it a try.</li>
            <li> SIMPLY NATURAL - SIMPLY AWESOME</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. The Acure shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in-conditioner are pleasantly fragrant,and leave hair clean, without weight or guminess.I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i have very dense wavy hair that is frankly a b*^ch to maintain. this product has greatly improved the condition of my hair. its lightweight &amp; leaves my hair bouncy, glossy &amp; makes my scalp feel great. i never thought i could have lovely hair until i started using this protuct.</li>
            <li> Gets tangles out, smells great, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  I would definitely purchase this product again.  Can be used in conjunction with regular conditioner.  I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing for long, straight,  static winter ridden hair!!  I suffer from a lot of static electricity in winter and this is the BEST product I found for keeping the static under control.  And the added plus is it makes my hair soft smooth with no fuzzy ends sticking up.  I LOVE this conditioner......</li>
