            <li>I must be really delicious.</li>
            <li>They were very happy to use a safer product.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product!!!</li>
            <li>and so this was great!!!!</li>
            <li>This is awesome stuff, it feels like armor and doesnt burn like deet when u get it on u.</li>
            <li>Great idea when you are trying to keep up with who got what and where!  </li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great for my toddler.</li>
            <li>This product is great because you can see if you have missed any areas when applying it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>We love the brand and both my children did not get one bite!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome, glad it has 2 in one..perfect for camp and it works,,</li>
            <li>My mother purchased this for my sisters and I a good deal when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>but you need to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes while you are rubbing it in!</li>
            <li>This product smells nice, gives my skin added moisture, lasts all day after and protects me 99% from skeeters.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and with SPF30.  </li>
            <li>I never got burned once -- a very effective sunblock with a nice fruity scent and a clean feel.</li>
            <li>Ok I liked this stuff and it kept the bugs off both of my kids and myself as well.</li>
            <li>Mosquitoes love me, and tend to bite me no matter what I wear.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen and bug protection are great for golfing in the coastal regions of the south where the sun is bright and the mosquitoes are big.  </li>
            <li>goal is to provide a thorough review to assist others with their purchase, as there are many choices on Amazon</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So I will not be able to take it or will have to repackage it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>Love how you can see it to rub it in</li>
            <li>kids love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I am able to see if I missed any spots.</li>
            <li>Great product (would normally get 5 stars),</li>
            <li>Good for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>It is certainly effective against mosquitoes and gnats and seems to be a good sunscreen at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I think the sunblock worked fine but the bug repellant did not work at all.  </li>
            <li>The sunblock part works great, and we never had a problem with the blue staining or not fading.</li>
            <li>works awesome for repelling bugs and without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Plus, this smells atrociously sweet.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work fine, nice that it is bug spray AND sun protection; however, the vanishing blue color is not vanishing on the hands of whoever puts it on the child.</li>
            <li>We love it since we live in Louisiana and doesn&#x27;t have the issues of DEET</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if direct contact is safe) but our skin was a bit tinged all day and never went away.</li>
            <li>Most products tend to increase the mosquitos&#x27; interest or just barely deter them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light blue tint, but my daughter is fair and the blue shows.</li>
            <li>Works fine as a bug guard but it turns hands and any light colored clothing that touches he lotion blue.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have very much of it).  </li>
            <li>This lotion is OK, but sometimes it gums up on my skin and leaves blue globs.  </li>
            <li>My kids love the blue colored sunscreen..</li>
            <li>and I personally rely on reviews when making most of my purchases.  </li>
            <li>product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I returned from my trip absolutely covered in bug bites.  </li>
            <li>We used it in Nigeria and it was really effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ended up trying the Avon Bug guard Gentle Breeze which has not been guarding my daughter from Mosquitos and bugs as promised.</li>
            <li>We burn and this really helped us not too.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the magic of skin so soft with all its moisturizing and bug repelling with an added sunscreen and the blue</li>
            <li>Blue bottle scent is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t have the typical banana/coconut sunblock scent.  </li>
            <li>My daughter thinks it is so cool that it goes on blue and then disappears</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended</li>
            <li>Overall I prefer to use Avon&#x27;s regular SSS Bug Guard Sunscreen Lotion which works as effectively as this product but without the blue color.</li>
            <li>If you are visiting any mosquito infested areas, I highly recommend the skin so soft products.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product to actually deter mosquitos from biting me.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t rub off on clothes (i was super careful during application, so</li>
            <li>It does not go on clear.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the old type of Skin So Soft that was a lotion that also repelled mosquitos.  </li>
            <li>but turns palms blue until you wash them very well.</li>
            <li>only downsides is that it really stings if it sweat into your eyes and you really have to rub to get the blue to go away.</li>
            <li>I was applying it several times a day but the area was very buggy</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the white cream in the white bottle--same product without color.</li>
            <li>We bought this because she has such sensitive skin and is always getting bit up by Mosquitos.</li>

            <li> bug repellent part of things was less effective, but under normal circumstances (not being surrounded by black flies, mosquitos and sand flies), I would expect it to work fine.</li>
            <li> when it arrived I found that it was larger than expected 4 Fluid ounces.  </li>
            <li> and it is a great insect repellent, too.  </li>
            <li> The only con (which is very minimal) is the blue-ish hand I have after applying the product.</li>
            <li> but thought it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> The insect repellent worked fine for my sisters, but not so much for me.</li>
            <li> This one stops them completely for at least a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> but this product has a childish blue tint that does not disappear as it claims.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a blue color on the end of your fingers, but disappears after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I would buy again if white is not available.</li>
            <li> We spent every day in the Caribbean in the water.  </li>
            <li> The bug repellent works though, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> The blue dye is gross and unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Smells so much better than regular repellent too.</li>
            <li> My only small complaint is that it&#x27;s blue</li>
            <li> I bought this just before my trip to Belize a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasted the four of us about two weeks (remember everyday in the sea).</li>
            <li> , we use it in Florida for the &amp;#34;No Seeums&amp;#34; that are so bad certain times of the year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent sunblock and insect repellent, but I couldn&#x27;t get the blue off my hands for hours with repeated washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all and what&#x27;s worse</li>
            <li> False advertising.</li>
            <li> Unless I am desperate I will not use it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> wonder why it is blue</li>
            <li> The blue dye is gross and unnecessary. It irritated my son&#x27;s face, but seemed to work on his arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to mosquito bites.  This product smells nice, gives my skin added moisture, lasts all day after and protects me 99% from skeeters.</li>
            <li> This lotion is OK, but sometimes it gums up on my skin and leaves blue globs.  The bug repellent works though, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I detest the blue color of the cream. It takes a while to blend in and leaves a residue. I highly recommend the white cream in the white bottle--same product without color.</li>
            <li> My mother purchased this for my sisters and I a good deal when I was a teenager. The sunblock part works great, and we never had a problem with the blue staining or not fading. The insect repellent worked fine for my sisters, but not so much for me. Mosquitoes love me, and tend to bite me no matter what I wear. I must be really delicious.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen and bug protection are great for golfing in the coastal regions of the south where the sun is bright and the mosquitoes are big.  Blue bottle scent is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t have the typical banana/coconut sunblock scent.  Great product (would normally get 5 stars), but this product has a childish blue tint that does not disappear as it claims.  It stains your hands and any clothing it contacts (this part of the product would get 0 stars).  Recommend trying the white bottle product, same protection, but no blue dye.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the magic of skin so soft with all its moisturizing and bug repelling with an added sunscreen and the blue does help with application, but then you&#x27;re all blue for the rest of the day. it didn&#x27;t rub off on clothes (i was super careful during application, so i don&#x27;t know if direct contact is safe) but our skin was a bit tinged all day and never went away.</li>
            <li> I bought this just before my trip to Belize a few weeks ago.  The sun was fierce and the bugs were everywhere.  I used this every day on my head, face, and neck -- even in my hair (I don&#x27;t have very much of it).  I never got burned once -- a very effective sunblock with a nice fruity scent and a clean feel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bug repellent part of things was less effective, but under normal circumstances (not being surrounded by black flies, mosquitos and sand flies), I would expect it to work fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all and what&#x27;s worse it gave me a rash</li>
            <li> I was looking for the old type of Skin So Soft that was a lotion that also repelled mosquitos.  This lotion was blue and made my skin blue.  Unless I am desperate I will not use it.  JCU</li>
            <li> I also used this for a trip to belize.  I think the sunblock worked fine but the bug repellant did not work at all.  I returned from my trip absolutely covered in bug bites.  Plus, this smells atrociously sweet.  And it did not close properly.  I had to wrap it in ziploc bags and it would still manage to spill everywhere. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> good product but thought it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> We love it since we live in Louisiana and doesn&#x27;t have the issues of DEET so that is why we purchased it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but turns palms blue until you wash them very well.</li>
            <li> If you are visiting any mosquito infested areas, I highly recommend the skin so soft products.  Keep those bugs AWAY!  My kids love the blue colored sunscreen..it looks like war paint, but if you rub it in, it disappears.</li>
            <li> I keep this Avon Sss kids Spf#30 bug guard/sunscreen on hand. It has no DEET &amp; works well.  I have used it for years. Recently I was at a bbq with toddlers &amp; offered it to parents to protect the kids from bugs &amp; sun.  They were very happy to use a safer product.  I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Unless you want your hands to look like you squished a Smurf, don&#x27;t bother with this product.  It&#x27;s a decent sunblock and insect repellent, but I couldn&#x27;t get the blue off my hands for hours with repeated washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal is to provide a thorough review to assist others with their purchase, as there are many choices on Amazon and I personally rely on reviews when making most of my purchases.  If my review was helpful to you, please choose “yes” below.  Otherwise, choose “no” and please leave a constructive comment and I will take your thoughts and/or suggestions into consideration for future reviews.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Will buy again from seller.</li>
            <li> Ok I liked this stuff and it kept the bugs off both of my kids and myself as well. None of us were sun burnt at all. My only small complaint is that it&#x27;s blue and it turns your skin blue after you apply it. That seemed to last a couple hours after application. The next day I didnt notice any blue tint, but that will keep me from buying again. In fact I used spray on sunblock and separate bug spay last week so we didn&#x27;t all turn blue! Keep in mind that it&#x27;s only temporary until it absorbs into the skin</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine, nice that it is bug spray AND sun protection; however, the vanishing blue color is not vanishing on the hands of whoever puts it on the child. Had to scrub hands with brush to get all the blue out. Took almost a month to get to me, even though it said 7-10 days. Probably would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> only one step, use to use the sunscreen then bug spray. Mia likes the color blue and see it fade away. Seems to be working for her.</li>
            <li> We used it in Nigeria and it was really effective.&lt;br /&gt;I can only recommend it. I ended up trying the Avon Bug guard Gentle Breeze which has not been guarding my daughter from Mosquitos and bugs as promised.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for my toddler. sunscreen, bug repellent and it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only downsides is that it really stings if it sweat into your eyes and you really have to rub to get the blue to go away. we have the regular white colored lotion as well and I prefer to use that one just bc of the staining</li>
            <li> This product is great because you can see if you have missed any areas when applying it and it is a great insect repellent, too.  However, it stains everything blue, including your hands and it is very difficult to wash off without a lot of soap.  Also based on my personal experience, in the heat the oil separates from the lotion and leaks from the bottle when packed in a suitcase.  Solution to this is to wrap it in plastic when packed and you have to shake the bottle well before use.  Overall I prefer to use Avon&#x27;s regular SSS Bug Guard Sunscreen Lotion which works as effectively as this product but without the blue color.</li>
            <li> This is the first product to actually deter mosquitos from biting me.  Most products tend to increase the mosquitos&#x27; interest or just barely deter them.  This one stops them completely for at least a couple of hours.  The only con (which is very minimal) is the blue-ish hand I have after applying the product.</li>
            <li> People who complain about the smurf color need to realize it&#x27;s a kids product... It didn&#x27;t stick to my hands at all when I applied it to my baby and it&#x27;s working great. Smells so much better than regular repellent too. Love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! We love the brand and both my children did not get one bite!! I was applying it several times a day but the area was very buggy and so this was great!!!!</li>
            <li> It does not go on clear. There is a blue tint. It&#x27;s a light blue tint, but my daughter is fair and the blue shows. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works fine as a bug guard but it turns hands and any light colored clothing that touches he lotion blue. My hands are still blue 3 hours after applying to my three kids.</li>
            <li> I like this because I can put it where I want it. Especially around my ears and face. You can&#x27;t do that with a spray.</li>
            <li> It does leave a blue color on the end of your fingers, but disappears after a few minutes. I would buy again if white is not available.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking at 3.2 oz (what was in the specs) I could carry it on a plane but when it arrived I found that it was larger than expected 4 Fluid ounces.  So I will not be able to take it or will have to repackage it.  False advertising.</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff, it feels like armor and doesnt burn like deet when u get it on u. Highly reccomended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, we use it in Florida for the &amp;#34;No Seeums&amp;#34; that are so bad certain times of the year.</li>
            <li> We burn and this really helped us not too.  We spent every day in the Caribbean in the water.  I&#x27;d definitely purchase this again.  Good for the whole family.  The bottle lasted the four of us about two weeks (remember everyday in the sea).</li>
            <li> Love how you can see it to rub it in but you need to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes while you are rubbing it in!</li>
            <li> Great idea when you are trying to keep up with who got what and where!  Disappearing color lets you see where you put it.  Nice smell and with SPF30.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the forerunners of this product for almost ten years,  It is certainly effective against mosquitoes and gnats and seems to be a good sunscreen at the same time.  It is getting a bit pricey however.</li>
            <li> kids love it. I love it. will but again</li>
            <li> works awesome for repelling bugs and without harsh chemicals. Does not break out my skin or my kids or grand-kids skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter thinks it is so cool that it goes on blue and then disappears and I am able to see if I missed any spots. We bought this because she has such sensitive skin and is always getting bit up by Mosquitos. It&#x27;s awesome, glad it has 2 in one..perfect for camp and it works,,</li>
