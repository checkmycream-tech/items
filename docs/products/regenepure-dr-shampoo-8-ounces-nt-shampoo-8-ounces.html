            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy that I had to spend the money for the product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this shampoo is very effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>It smells good and my hair feels great after using it.  </li>
            <li>Does not work that good for me</li>
            <li>I think the shampoo and the condition smell good.</li>
            <li>It is so good</li>
            <li>recommend it as a good shampoo for adults, will buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to use a ton of product to get good results.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and felt that since I colored my hair, this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li>good purchase and good product</li>
            <li>Really enjoying this Regenpure  combo!</li>
            <li>Extremely Satisfied!  Bubba</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>LOVE this!</li>
            <li>It has real good clean smell and leaves your hair looking very clean</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a toss-up for me, honestly.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any results, though it felt nice on my scalp.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product if you want a healthy scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even smell spectacular.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for fine hair.</li>
            <li>It was a well-done site and showed what made for an effective shampoo for one of man&#x27;s many concerns.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the conditioner, and although it&#x27;s really watery, it was great at getting any tangles out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good SLS free shampoo that is safe to use on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>This is one of the many shampoos recommended for hair loss.  </li>
            <li>For me, taking some vitamin B seemed to help more than any shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have probably used this for 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>And note that you do not need to wash your hair every day and sometime a good rinse would do if it is not dirty.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and kind of reminds me of bubble gum.</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthy and I don&#x27;t have dandruff any longer--less scalp itching.  </li>
            <li>The Lipogaine does seem to make my hair look better than the Regenepure (which was predicted by Chris from Hair Loss From Steroids).</li>
            <li>The front hairline also appeared to be more dense.</li>
            <li>I still have plenty of hair on the top of the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have use the product for years and I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I prefer the smell of the DR more than the smell of the NT though.</li>
            <li>but as I have found and read many times over since trying this, there is no miracle shampoo on the market today.  </li>
            <li>After that My hair started flaking&lt;br /&gt;First 2 months were ok.</li>
            <li>My hair feels strong and healthy after about 4 months of use.</li>
            <li>I love the way it suds up, and psychologically, I feel this is great for my hair.</li>
            <li>Before I could easily find 1-3 every time I ran my hands through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I like that the scent is not too strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been baby fine</li>
            <li>was being cheap.  </li>
            <li>I use the light about three times a week.</li>
            <li>because it is SLS free and was surprised to find how good it is.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li>Originally I was losing maybe over 60 hairs in the shower</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s fair to say my hair in general grows a lot faster.</li>
            <li>First 2 months were ok.</li>
            <li>Amazing results so far, have used since mid-June 2014!</li>
            <li>Then you use the shampoo, which has a very pleasant smell and seems to work like ordinary shampoo.</li>
            <li>As well the area between my crown and the hairline seemed to be really thinning out prior to regenepure when I was under bright lights, now that area has been thickening up a lot better since using this product.</li>
            <li>I wish it were sold in stores at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>With the DR alone, some days my hair was a bit more dry than I liked.</li>
            <li>I love Nizoral and would love for it to be back on the market.</li>
            <li>I am a woman whose hair is thinning quit a bit on top, and this product has caused a LOT of new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>No bad effects and seemed good at first, but stopped seeing results in long run.  </li>
            <li>I experienced a few tangles, but that was months ago.</li>
            <li>If I saw any results it would be worth it, but I don&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>Is it worth buying this instead of rogaine?</li>
            <li>its worth a shot for starters.</li>
            <li>But so far, these are the most moisturizing shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried that are marketed for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I will not waste any more money on this product.</li>
            <li>your hair will regain its more natural look.</li>
            <li>Its worth a try</li>
            <li>For people use to normal shampoo, it might seem that your hair is not that clean and you will use more than the normal amount.  </li>
            <li>I am sure  this is a good product, but I guess the anti fungal ingredients really make it strong for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Neither contain the typical industrial sulfates that all shampoos use which is good.</li>
            <li>I received this product relatively quickly and saw results equally as fast.</li>
            <li>Even with the use of these two products I would still have a fair amount of head hair in my tub/shower drain every morning, which I understand is typical.</li>
            <li>As a side note I also purchased a laser light for my scalp at the same time, so I don&#x27;t know if  the light has helped or not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing my best to keep my hair healthy and make it last into the second half of my life.  </li>
            <li>The NT will give you a nice cool down though.</li>
            <li>and you lose some hair at first</li>
            <li>I am definitely ordering more</li>
            <li>The price is better when the 2 different shampoos are purchased together as a kit like this.</li>
            <li>I only use the DR treatment on my scalp, then the NT on all of my hair because it lathers more than the DR.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try something else that makes the same claims but smells better.</li>
            <li>I am 66 and not losing hair that I am aware of, but I am thinning.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>The product labeled \\&quot;DR - Hair &amp; Scalp Treatment\\&quot; is applied first.</li>
            <li>My hair looks thicker, is definitely softer, and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Yeah I would most definitely say so.</li>
            <li>I actually have more hair growth than I did when I started using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>But the best part is that my hair feels thicker and I&#x27;ve noticed new growth in the thin spots at my temples.  </li>
            <li>Using both, not at the same time, but different days has left my hair with the same great results as before, but feeling more full and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t take photos before/after, I did receive one comment from a female friend that said my hair appeared more black, thinking that I had some kind of hair transplant or something along those lines.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t worry and my hair is soft and clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Both are probably equally effective in blocking DHT on the scalp, so if that&#x27;s your only concern, it doesn&#x27;t matter which you use as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>The first three months of using the two Regene Pure products I did not notice any hair reduction in my drain.</li>
            <li>I can not recommend this for regrowing hair, though it might; it just takes so long to tell (many momths)and</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m a Norwood 2A pretty much.</li>
            <li>The NT is a much thinner product that will explode into a rich lather with little more than a dime sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair became so dry that I had fly away hair which is not normal for me.  </li>
            <li>Its not that your hair sheds excessively more but your hair does dry out</li>
            <li>pure dr.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is I&#x27;m still buying the regene pure.</li>
            <li>a little costly but worth the product if you are okay with some results.</li>
            <li>But, I am not going to conclude so fast as it takes time for the products to work.</li>
            <li>My husband is still using it an has not determined if it&#x27;s really working or not.</li>
            <li>In addition, it&#x27;s very calming to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair has stopped shedding so much.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
            <li>Also, 10 min of &amp;#34;Waiting&amp;#34; in the shower is just too much.</li>
            <li>I really saw no difference in my hair</li>
            <li>(it really works well for the flakiness, as I have had none since I started using it).</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve also heard that it doesn&#x27;t sud up very well.  </li>
            <li>The treatment doesn&#x27;t lather much, but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to shed as much hair everywhere.</li>
            <li>That I can&#x27;t really tell you but</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lather.</li>
            <li>As my wife sees me all the time, she can&#x27;t really notice either but did note that it seemed my hair loss had stopped in the meantime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you or someone at Regenepure can advise, it would be much</li>
            <li>I really like the use of both the shampoos.</li>
            <li>I switched from Nioxin because I saw promising reviews.  </li>
            <li>RegenePure is a hair growth shampoo that really works.  </li>
            <li>(sometimes the Treatment runs in my eyes while I wash the rest of my body) but it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to go bald</li>
            <li>Also as there is no fragrance, it does not leave your hair smelling clean and (personally) unwashed odor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been researching how to have healthy pretty hair and it includes not washing everyday.</li>
            <li>I myself can&#x27;t really see the difference, but for sure know that the dandruff is no longer a problem and hair loss is much less as I do check often while shampooing.  </li>
            <li>I mean I generally still have very nice hair</li>
            <li>I feel like I have some new growth at the front of my hairline, but I really don&#x27;t know if it was from this product or the vitamins I started taking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably purchase one more set, then go back to using a regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re losing your hair.  </li>
            <li>At this point, I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>However, my most recent DR+NT combo bottles received today (Feb. 2013) both have a new white lid design that may or may not leak when traveling.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s more natural then other Chemically made.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, too early to tell if it works.</li>
            <li>this was a great shampoo but too expensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product is worth the price and continued use to keep the hair you have and possibly increase growth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in hair loss (literal fistfuls every time I shampoo), but it sure dried my hair out like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li>I do wish these weren&#x27;t so expensive, but since they have good quality ingredients in them, I am willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li>By the way, I&#x27;m an Asian male, 42 years old, and still have some hair on my head - albeit thinning on top with age, I guess.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I&#x27;m an Asian male, 42 years old, and still have some hair on my head - albeit thinning on top with age, I guess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using these 2 items for a couple of weeks, but I really notice a positive difference.  </li>
            <li>I have super long hair</li>
            <li>Have not seen any new growth yet</li>
            <li>I say it works best for people just starting to lose their hair to help slow down that process.</li>
            <li>that note, it may be important to point out that I spend a lot of time traveling the world, going from the Central Midwest USA (65% here) to the Middle East (25% here)</li>
            <li>If you use the DR alone it will look super dry and feel a bit irritated.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, It makes my hair and scalp feel healthy and I have no dandruff at all, but the same can be said of other products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on my second bottle of the dr and still using the first nt bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty long adjustment period though for your scalp, one that will have you question whether its worth buying something that initially dries out your hair but after 6 months my scalp adapted.</li>
            <li>I googled \\&quot;best hair loss shampoo for men\\&quot; and clicked on this site: [...]  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to Nioxin, losing less hair than before, and not needing to use huge amounts of conditioner just to detangle my curls!</li>
            <li>Now, I do have long, naturally curly hair that tends to be dry to begin with, and this just exacerbated the problem, however, people with short, straight hair may not have trouble with the incredible knots both of these products left in my hair.</li>
            <li>Specifically on Regenepure, the hair gets volume and with the hair shedding &amp; flat hair due to Revita, I am still able to look okay at least on weekends when I use Regenepure.</li>
            <li>and and it get&#x27;s very sudsy on the second go.</li>
            <li>Of course the big question everyone wants to know is does this product reduce my hair loss.</li>
            <li>It makes your scalp tingle and your hair soft as silk, as far as hair growth, nothing in 10 months.</li>
            <li>I am a woman - early 60&#x27;s with thinnbing hair.  </li>
            <li>I do this routine at least 3-4 times per week or more, depending on what climate I&#x27;m in, work out routines that week, etc.  </li>
            <li>It may be too early to tell, but I think it has stopped my hair loss and may be restoring it.</li>
            <li>I advise taking it at night before you go to bed rather than a early morning shower for the day since over night</li>
            <li>Just as their website says, these shampoos really are different than others on the market.</li>
            <li>The product has slowed visible hair shedding considerably.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is on the higher end cost wise vs other products but when combined with other OTC and prescription products you will definitely notice a slowing down of hair loss.</li>
            <li>I do use Avalon Organics Thickening Conditioner after using this product because otherwise my hair feels a little too squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>The DR is a thick product that does not lather much at all however, you know its there from the cool sensation of the menthol and spearmint.</li>
            <li>Well I suffered from little to moderate dandruff and Regenpure most definitely eradicated my dandruff.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with Caboki (Caboki.com) powder right now as the Caboki covers the bare scalp, but am gradually needing less Caboki as new hair continues to come in.  </li>
            <li>Use DR one day, massage and leave in for 5 minutes, then next day use NR like normal shampoo, then repeat.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is the system makes my showers take longer than I would normally allow.  </li>
            <li>but it could just be my hair,its very fine and thin and</li>
            <li>This product, after one month has me sprouting new short hairs everywhere on my head.  </li>
            <li>Had been having major problems with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had major problems with the NT bottle leaking &gt;</li>
            <li>I seriously doubt that the product actually prevents hair loss, but I&#x27;m satisfied that it makes my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li>wondering how much longer will I have my hair ( also less anxiety and OCD about it all due to the aid of meditation and higher self esteem always helps!)</li>
            <li>I currently use Fekkai Au Naturel conditioner, but that was only because I had that leftover from before and it really makes my hair feel softer starting from the moment I start lathering it on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 21 year old male and have been going through the process of a receding hairline since I was 16.</li>
            <li>so far last me somewhere</li>
            <li>I say that is a nice slow down.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending extra when I can actually see new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>i use a little bit of the dr and wash it out right away and then reapply a tiny amount of the dr</li>
            <li>Anyone familiar with Nioxin knows what I mean.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would give 5 stars to both for helping stop my dandruff issue and slowing hair loss, although several other factors such as diet, travel, etc. could have also contributed to the positive results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;ve lasted me this long.  </li>
            <li>Revita made my hair flat and crispy in the first few applications.</li>
            <li>I purchase this product in the hopes it will help me stop the hair loss but it did all the contrary, I lost so much hair in 15 days of use that I cried like a little girl.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think this shampoo is very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li> It smells good and my hair feels great after using it.  </li>
            <li> Does not work that good for me</li>
            <li> I think the shampoo and the condition smell good.</li>
            <li> It is so good</li>
            <li> recommend it as a good shampoo for adults, will buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to use a ton of product to get good results.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and felt that since I colored my hair, this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> good purchase and good product</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this Regenpure  combo!</li>
            <li> Extremely Satisfied!  Bubba</li>
            <li> but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!</li>
            <li> It has real good clean smell and leaves your hair looking very clean</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a toss-up for me, honestly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results, though it felt nice on my scalp.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product if you want a healthy scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even smell spectacular.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for fine hair.</li>
            <li> It was a well-done site and showed what made for an effective shampoo for one of man&#x27;s many concerns.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the conditioner, and although it&#x27;s really watery, it was great at getting any tangles out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good SLS free shampoo that is safe to use on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the many shampoos recommended for hair loss.  </li>
            <li> For me, taking some vitamin B seemed to help more than any shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have probably used this for 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> And note that you do not need to wash your hair every day and sometime a good rinse would do if it is not dirty.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and kind of reminds me of bubble gum.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthy and I don&#x27;t have dandruff any longer--less scalp itching.  </li>
            <li> The Lipogaine does seem to make my hair look better than the Regenepure (which was predicted by Chris from Hair Loss From Steroids).</li>
            <li> The front hairline also appeared to be more dense.</li>
            <li> I still have plenty of hair on the top of the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have use the product for years and I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I prefer the smell of the DR more than the smell of the NT though.</li>
            <li> but as I have found and read many times over since trying this, there is no miracle shampoo on the market today.  </li>
            <li> After that My hair started flaking&lt;br /&gt;First 2 months were ok.</li>
            <li> My hair feels strong and healthy after about 4 months of use.</li>
            <li> I love the way it suds up, and psychologically, I feel this is great for my hair.</li>
            <li> Before I could easily find 1-3 every time I ran my hands through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I like that the scent is not too strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been baby fine</li>
            <li> was being cheap.  </li>
            <li> I use the light about three times a week.</li>
            <li> because it is SLS free and was surprised to find how good it is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> Originally I was losing maybe over 60 hairs in the shower</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s fair to say my hair in general grows a lot faster.</li>
            <li> First 2 months were ok.</li>
            <li> Amazing results so far, have used since mid-June 2014!</li>
            <li> Then you use the shampoo, which has a very pleasant smell and seems to work like ordinary shampoo.</li>
            <li> As well the area between my crown and the hairline seemed to be really thinning out prior to regenepure when I was under bright lights, now that area has been thickening up a lot better since using this product.</li>
            <li> I wish it were sold in stores at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> With the DR alone, some days my hair was a bit more dry than I liked.</li>
            <li> I love Nizoral and would love for it to be back on the market.</li>
            <li> I am a woman whose hair is thinning quit a bit on top, and this product has caused a LOT of new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> No bad effects and seemed good at first, but stopped seeing results in long run.  </li>
            <li> I experienced a few tangles, but that was months ago.</li>
            <li> If I saw any results it would be worth it, but I don&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Is it worth buying this instead of rogaine?</li>
            <li> its worth a shot for starters.</li>
            <li> But so far, these are the most moisturizing shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried that are marketed for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I will not waste any more money on this product.</li>
            <li> your hair will regain its more natural look.</li>
            <li> Its worth a try</li>
            <li> For people use to normal shampoo, it might seem that your hair is not that clean and you will use more than the normal amount.  </li>
            <li> I am sure  this is a good product, but I guess the anti fungal ingredients really make it strong for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Neither contain the typical industrial sulfates that all shampoos use which is good.</li>
            <li> I received this product relatively quickly and saw results equally as fast.</li>
            <li> Even with the use of these two products I would still have a fair amount of head hair in my tub/shower drain every morning, which I understand is typical.</li>
            <li> As a side note I also purchased a laser light for my scalp at the same time, so I don&#x27;t know if  the light has helped or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing my best to keep my hair healthy and make it last into the second half of my life.  </li>
            <li> The NT will give you a nice cool down though.</li>
            <li> and you lose some hair at first</li>
            <li> I am definitely ordering more</li>
            <li> The price is better when the 2 different shampoos are purchased together as a kit like this.</li>
            <li> I only use the DR treatment on my scalp, then the NT on all of my hair because it lathers more than the DR.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try something else that makes the same claims but smells better.</li>
            <li> I am 66 and not losing hair that I am aware of, but I am thinning.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> The product labeled \\&quot;DR - Hair &amp; Scalp Treatment\\&quot; is applied first.</li>
            <li> My hair looks thicker, is definitely softer, and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Yeah I would most definitely say so.</li>
            <li> I actually have more hair growth than I did when I started using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> But the best part is that my hair feels thicker and I&#x27;ve noticed new growth in the thin spots at my temples.  </li>
            <li> Using both, not at the same time, but different days has left my hair with the same great results as before, but feeling more full and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t take photos before/after, I did receive one comment from a female friend that said my hair appeared more black, thinking that I had some kind of hair transplant or something along those lines.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t worry and my hair is soft and clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Both are probably equally effective in blocking DHT on the scalp, so if that&#x27;s your only concern, it doesn&#x27;t matter which you use as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> The first three months of using the two Regene Pure products I did not notice any hair reduction in my drain.</li>
            <li> I can not recommend this for regrowing hair, though it might; it just takes so long to tell (many momths)and</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a Norwood 2A pretty much.</li>
            <li> The NT is a much thinner product that will explode into a rich lather with little more than a dime sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair became so dry that I had fly away hair which is not normal for me.  </li>
            <li> Its not that your hair sheds excessively more but your hair does dry out</li>
            <li> pure dr.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is I&#x27;m still buying the regene pure.</li>
            <li> a little costly but worth the product if you are okay with some results.</li>
            <li> But, I am not going to conclude so fast as it takes time for the products to work.</li>
            <li> My husband is still using it an has not determined if it&#x27;s really working or not.</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s very calming to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair has stopped shedding so much.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
            <li> Also, 10 min of &amp;#34;Waiting&amp;#34; in the shower is just too much.</li>
            <li> I really saw no difference in my hair</li>
            <li> (it really works well for the flakiness, as I have had none since I started using it).</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve also heard that it doesn&#x27;t sud up very well.  </li>
            <li> The treatment doesn&#x27;t lather much, but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to shed as much hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> That I can&#x27;t really tell you but</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really lather.</li>
            <li> As my wife sees me all the time, she can&#x27;t really notice either but did note that it seemed my hair loss had stopped in the meantime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you or someone at Regenepure can advise, it would be much</li>
            <li> I really like the use of both the shampoos.</li>
            <li> I switched from Nioxin because I saw promising reviews.  </li>
            <li> RegenePure is a hair growth shampoo that really works.  </li>
            <li> (sometimes the Treatment runs in my eyes while I wash the rest of my body) but it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to go bald</li>
            <li> Also as there is no fragrance, it does not leave your hair smelling clean and (personally) unwashed odor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been researching how to have healthy pretty hair and it includes not washing everyday.</li>
            <li> I myself can&#x27;t really see the difference, but for sure know that the dandruff is no longer a problem and hair loss is much less as I do check often while shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I mean I generally still have very nice hair</li>
            <li> I feel like I have some new growth at the front of my hairline, but I really don&#x27;t know if it was from this product or the vitamins I started taking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably purchase one more set, then go back to using a regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re losing your hair.  </li>
            <li> At this point, I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> However, my most recent DR+NT combo bottles received today (Feb. 2013) both have a new white lid design that may or may not leak when traveling.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s more natural then other Chemically made.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, too early to tell if it works.</li>
            <li> this was a great shampoo but too expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product is worth the price and continued use to keep the hair you have and possibly increase growth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in hair loss (literal fistfuls every time I shampoo), but it sure dried my hair out like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li> I do wish these weren&#x27;t so expensive, but since they have good quality ingredients in them, I am willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;m an Asian male, 42 years old, and still have some hair on my head - albeit thinning on top with age, I guess.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;m an Asian male, 42 years old, and still have some hair on my head - albeit thinning on top with age, I guess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these 2 items for a couple of weeks, but I really notice a positive difference.  </li>
            <li> I have super long hair</li>
            <li> Have not seen any new growth yet</li>
            <li> I say it works best for people just starting to lose their hair to help slow down that process.</li>
            <li> that note, it may be important to point out that I spend a lot of time traveling the world, going from the Central Midwest USA (65% here) to the Middle East (25% here)</li>
            <li> If you use the DR alone it will look super dry and feel a bit irritated.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, It makes my hair and scalp feel healthy and I have no dandruff at all, but the same can be said of other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my second bottle of the dr and still using the first nt bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty long adjustment period though for your scalp, one that will have you question whether its worth buying something that initially dries out your hair but after 6 months my scalp adapted.</li>
            <li> I googled \\&quot;best hair loss shampoo for men\\&quot; and clicked on this site: [...]  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to Nioxin, losing less hair than before, and not needing to use huge amounts of conditioner just to detangle my curls!</li>
            <li> Now, I do have long, naturally curly hair that tends to be dry to begin with, and this just exacerbated the problem, however, people with short, straight hair may not have trouble with the incredible knots both of these products left in my hair.</li>
            <li> Specifically on Regenepure, the hair gets volume and with the hair shedding &amp; flat hair due to Revita, I am still able to look okay at least on weekends when I use Regenepure.</li>
            <li> and and it get&#x27;s very sudsy on the second go.</li>
            <li> Of course the big question everyone wants to know is does this product reduce my hair loss.</li>
            <li> It makes your scalp tingle and your hair soft as silk, as far as hair growth, nothing in 10 months.</li>
            <li> I am a woman - early 60&#x27;s with thinnbing hair.  </li>
            <li> I do this routine at least 3-4 times per week or more, depending on what climate I&#x27;m in, work out routines that week, etc.  </li>
            <li> It may be too early to tell, but I think it has stopped my hair loss and may be restoring it.</li>
            <li> I advise taking it at night before you go to bed rather than a early morning shower for the day since over night</li>
            <li> Just as their website says, these shampoos really are different than others on the market.</li>
            <li> The product has slowed visible hair shedding considerably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 yrs old.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is on the higher end cost wise vs other products but when combined with other OTC and prescription products you will definitely notice a slowing down of hair loss.</li>
            <li> I do use Avalon Organics Thickening Conditioner after using this product because otherwise my hair feels a little too squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The DR is a thick product that does not lather much at all however, you know its there from the cool sensation of the menthol and spearmint.</li>
            <li> Well I suffered from little to moderate dandruff and Regenpure most definitely eradicated my dandruff.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Caboki (Caboki.com) powder right now as the Caboki covers the bare scalp, but am gradually needing less Caboki as new hair continues to come in.  </li>
            <li> Use DR one day, massage and leave in for 5 minutes, then next day use NR like normal shampoo, then repeat.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the system makes my showers take longer than I would normally allow.  </li>
            <li> but it could just be my hair,its very fine and thin and</li>
            <li> This product, after one month has me sprouting new short hairs everywhere on my head.  </li>
            <li> Had been having major problems with my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had major problems with the NT bottle leaking &gt;</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt that the product actually prevents hair loss, but I&#x27;m satisfied that it makes my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> wondering how much longer will I have my hair ( also less anxiety and OCD about it all due to the aid of meditation and higher self esteem always helps!)</li>
            <li> I currently use Fekkai Au Naturel conditioner, but that was only because I had that leftover from before and it really makes my hair feel softer starting from the moment I start lathering it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old male and have been going through the process of a receding hairline since I was 16.</li>
            <li> so far last me somewhere</li>
            <li> I say that is a nice slow down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending extra when I can actually see new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> i use a little bit of the dr and wash it out right away and then reapply a tiny amount of the dr</li>
            <li> Anyone familiar with Nioxin knows what I mean.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would give 5 stars to both for helping stop my dandruff issue and slowing hair loss, although several other factors such as diet, travel, etc. could have also contributed to the positive results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;ve lasted me this long.  </li>
            <li> Revita made my hair flat and crispy in the first few applications.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product in the hopes it will help me stop the hair loss but it did all the contrary, I lost so much hair in 15 days of use that I cried like a little girl.</li>
            <li> , I like it way better than any other shampoo I have ever tired from the stores.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is pretty harsh, your hair will be very, very dry.  </li>
            <li> It does dry my hair out a little but, overall, I&#x27;d say my hair is much healthier after using this product.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much this helps yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m losing  a lot less hair because I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less hair in my brush after the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> If you are far down track toward losing your hair then don&#x27;t expect anything out of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m paying 3 times a year so far, $135 dollars annually, so less than $12 a month getting both products.</li>
            <li> The product made my hair so dry that it was almost impossible to get a comb through it, which caused more hair to fall out!</li>
            <li> But at least he&#x27;s not losing hair as fast as he was</li>
            <li> The NT is a polysorbate and it will get your hair cleaner than you ever knew it could be so you may want to use a conditioner after this one if you have long hair or you wont get a comb through it.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy the product again, but first I&#x27;m going to try something less expensive from the drugstore to see if there&#x27;s really any difference.</li>
            <li> I only use the DR about 3 times a week while using the NT on all the other days.</li>
            <li> the Dr for danduff and itchy scalp and the other one for regular use</li>
            <li> My  only wish is that they would make a styling product because I won&#x27;t use any other brands on my hair now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have also recently started following the DR+NT routine with a conditioner because somehow felt that my hair was a little dry.  </li>
            <li> It does make your hair sooo dry</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this because of how dry my hair got.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have hair loss or dandruff and bought the product because it helps stimulate the scalp and gives a fuller look when you blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old male who has been using  Propecia and Rogaine for at least 6 years.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can see/note so far is that it&#x27;s less obvious which is NT and DR</li>
            <li> For the expense I paid ($50 for small bottles), I am completely unsatisfied.  </li>
            <li> I think using this has definitely slowed down hair loss for me.</li>
            <li> As for new hair growth or less falling hair, I&#x27;m not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> left my hair a little oily</li>
            <li> I used it for two months and have finally switched to something else as I couldn&#x27;t take the limp hair any longer.</li>
            <li> Now, I only lose a few strands in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no side-effects whatsoever from either (not that I expected to from 1%</li>
            <li> did not really help with my dandruff problem or my hair shedding.</li>
            <li> your hair won&#x27;t look dead as when you initially use it</li>
            <li> blue bottle is super watery and the green bottle is very thick and reminds me too much of Pert Plus both in smell and consistency--Both bottles smell artificial, but are not unbearable.</li>
            <li> By the way, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You will immediately feel the DR working and the addition of ketacozole help over other products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other shampoo or conditioner with it.  </li>
            <li> Also, I wash my hair every other day.  </li>
            <li> every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use both the treatment and the shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> So the DR version every other day and the NT and your other choices 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t comment about hair loss prevention... other than straw like hair</li>
            <li> The one thing that is difficult about this system is that you put the Treatment on first and let it \\&quot;set\\&quot; in place for five minutes.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll still look a little dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;m giving the DR+NT combo 4 stars because of the \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot; feeling (and hence the need for a follow-on conditioner) and the annoying leaky bottle cap design (former blue and silver caps) that wasted much of the NT only (perhaps due to NT being less viscous than DR).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;m giving the DR+NT combo 4 stars because of the \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot; feeling (and hence the need for a follow-on conditioner) and the annoying leaky bottle cap design (former blue and silver caps) that wasted much of the NT only (perhaps due to NT being less viscous than DR).  </li>
            <li> I wish these were a little more moisturizing, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> Lastly when your hair isn&#x27;t wet it seems like hardly any of my hair falls out when I touch my hair.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it tends to be harder to comb through after using product.</li>
            <li> First the system leaves my hair feeling like straw, tangled, feeling heavy on my head and extremely difficult to brush out.</li>
            <li> If you feel that it&#x27;s expensive you&#x27;re probably using too much.</li>
            <li> suggest supplementing the NT version with another non-SLS shampoo to keep your cost down (like Avalon Organics).  </li>
            <li> But has it slowed down the amount of the hair falling out?</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s about down to 30....</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair feeling dry and seriously took away any body, leaving my hair limp and flat.</li>
            <li> I see an improvement and it&#x27;s been less than two months.</li>
            <li> but I do seems to notice less hair in my brush.  </li>
            <li> and I have less loss each day.  </li>
            <li> And with less shedding I&#x27;ve been less focused on my hair loss since I&#x27;m finding less strands in my hands .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been less preoccupied with standing in front of the bathroom mirror</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> would like to add that you use so little to get results that the price is actually less than I was paying for salon products.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m on a tight budget, so</li>
            <li> I still have a little dandruff when my hair starts to get oily</li>
            <li> $45 for the set is a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> This one also has a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; which smells a little like bubble gum.  </li>
            <li> As with others, this is a little drying.</li>
            <li> I have used just the DR in the past, but when reordering thought I would try the other one as well.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> That shows some results, but you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it daily--hence why I bought this Regenpure stuff, waste of money.</li>
            <li> ran a few bottles of the dr</li>
            <li> As noted, not that harsh of a shampoo and believe it will do as prescribed.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I regret all the money I wasted buying this hair loss product that does not do anything in your favor</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Also I avoid using it on night outs in the city like Fridays and Saturdays since I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My hair is fuller and \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; in the sense that I don&#x27;t feel like a heavy conditioning product was used.  </li>
            <li> The down side is that the bottles are so small.  </li>
            <li> Hoping that this brings in stronger hair as this is what is expected; if they don&#x27;t come then it will mean that I have lost whatever I had after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can also tell that it has helped slow down my hair from thinning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it ever helped with hair growth.</li>
            <li> It is no magic</li>
            <li> Not sure if there&#x27;s a Regenepure recommendation for conditioner?  </li>
            <li> After using for one month, no more dandruff .</li>
            <li> i am not sure but it has postive effect on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;although</li>
            <li> it is been a couple of months, it seems that my scalp turns unlikely red</li>
            <li> I am giving 4 stars for Regenepure as the efficacy of the product will be known over prolonged use for at least 2-3 months as recommended by the manufacturer and others.</li>
            <li> There are no sulfates or sls which negatively damage your hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The website showed that it was a complaint they acknowledged but gave no explanation.  </li>
            <li> I know that may create a silly mental image...</li>
            <li> To say I&#x27;m disappointed would be a complete understatement.</li>
            <li> It is ridiculously overpriced...</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than buying the DR and NT separately, but it is still pricy.</li>
            <li> By this point your hair is so stiff, straw like, and tangled that getting it fully rinsed is impossible, much less attempting to comb through</li>
            <li> Looking for a miracle to get back to my 20&#x27;s hair and wish I didn&#x27;t use all of those bad hair products</li>
            <li> Looking for a miracle to get back to my 20&#x27;s hair and wish I didn&#x27;t use all of those bad hair products</li>
            <li> the packaging is not good for travel.  </li>
            <li> I tried numerous products but was disappointed with the results.  </li>
            <li> The combo of the three helps make my thin hair look thicker than when I stop using them.</li>
            <li> This shampoo stopped the falling and has thickened my hair and allowed me to cover the thin spots.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and a hair loss problem a while ago.</li>
            <li> It did not cause me to lose hair, but it did thin my hair diameter perhaps because of the Salicylic Acid it contains.  </li>
            <li> Sloppy quality control.</li>
            <li> My hair was dull and lifeless and was shedding like crazy, so I had to do something.  </li>
            <li> It does not have common allergens, sulfites, bad preservatives, SLS, methlyparabens, or carcinogens in it.</li>
            <li> It is expensive to even try.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this combo.  </li>
            <li> I do you warn you that in beginning this product will make your hair look a lot worse!</li>
            <li> This is just REALLY expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I ordered but they exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, at $22.50 a bottle, this is a very expensive product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat menthol and not too bad.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was having terrible dandruff.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> a little costly but worth the product if you are okay with some results. And it&#x27;s more natural then other Chemically made.</li>
            <li> I am giving 4 stars for Regenepure as the efficacy of the product will be known over prolonged use for at least 2-3 months as recommended by the manufacturer and others. I am using this shampoo and conditioner in conjunction with Revita. Revita made my hair flat and crispy in the first few applications. Also, I had a lot of shedding for 2 weeks. Hoping that this brings in stronger hair as this is what is expected; if they don&#x27;t come then it will mean that I have lost whatever I had after using the shampoo. But, I am not going to conclude so fast as it takes time for the products to work. I am in the 3rd week now and will update regularly. So this is my regime - 5 Days a Week Revita Shampoo &amp; Conditioner and 2 days I use Regenepure Shampoo and Conditioner. Specifically on Regenepure, the hair gets volume and with the hair shedding &amp; flat hair due to Revita, I am still able to look okay at least on weekends when I use Regenepure. I am in the 3rd week now and will update regularly.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is on the higher end cost wise vs other products but when combined with other OTC and prescription products you will definitely notice a slowing down of hair loss. You will immediately feel the DR working and the addition of ketacozole help over other products. There are no sulfates or sls which negatively damage your hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is worth the price and continued use to keep the hair you have and possibly increase growth.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works.</li>
            <li> I love the way it suds up, and psychologically, I feel this is great for my hair. But I&#x27;m not feeling the results after 1 year of usage.</li>
            <li> Yes, I feel like it works after awhile. It does make your hair sooo dry and you lose some hair at first but I think it somewhat works after that. I love Nizoral and would love for it to be back on the market. I had to stop using this because of how dry my hair got.</li>
            <li> Does not work that good for me</li>
            <li> I think the shampoo and the condition smell good. I really liked the conditioner, and although it&#x27;s really watery, it was great at getting any tangles out. It did leave my hair feeling dry and seriously took away any body, leaving my hair limp and flat. I used it for two months and have finally switched to something else as I couldn&#x27;t take the limp hair any longer. I&#x27;m not sure if it ever helped with hair growth. I feel like I have some new growth at the front of my hairline, but I really don&#x27;t know if it was from this product or the vitamins I started taking.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling like straw, I don&#x27;t feel like it did anything it advertised in terms of helping with thinning hair and improving hair texture or feel.</li>
            <li> I used this Regenpure kit for the last 4 months after a friend&#x27;s recommendation and I have to say, it works. I am definitely ordering more</li>
            <li> My husband is still using it an has not determined if it&#x27;s really working or not. But at least he&#x27;s not losing hair as fast as he was</li>
            <li> I see an improvement and it&#x27;s been less than two months. It has real good clean smell and leaves your hair looking very clean</li>
            <li> Great alternative to shampoo</li>
            <li> I used this for a week to 10 day but it caused my hair to falls during every use. I had to stop it.&lt;br /&gt;Wasted money on it. Think before you buy it. It is expensive to even try.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this Regenpure  combo!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because of it&#x27;s excellent ingredients and because it is SLS free and was surprised to find how good it is.  It is so good, I like it way better than any other shampoo I have ever tired from the stores.  It smells good and my hair feels great after using it.  I can also tell that it has helped slow down my hair from thinning.  In addition, it&#x27;s very calming to the scalp.  The price is better when the 2 different shampoos are purchased together as a kit like this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was having terrible dandruff.  My hair was dull and lifeless and was shedding like crazy, so I had to do something.  I&#x27;ve been using the RegenePure system for almost two months and I definitely see an improvement.  I still have a little dandruff when my hair starts to get oily but it&#x27;s not too bad.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair has stopped shedding so much.  Before RegenePure, I was getting handfulls of hair whenever I&#x27;d wash it.  Now, I only lose a few strands in the shower.  It&#x27;s amazing!  It does dry my hair out a little but, overall, I&#x27;d say my hair is much healthier after using this product.  The down side is that the bottles are so small.  I have super long hair and I&#x27;m on a tight budget, so $45 for the set is a little pricey.  I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;ve lasted me this long.  I only use the DR treatment on my scalp, then the NT on all of my hair because it lathers more than the DR.  I don&#x27;t use any other shampoo or conditioner with it.  Also, I wash my hair every other day.  I&#x27;ll probably purchase one more set, then go back to using a regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for over 5 months now and have seen ZERO hair growth. It is ridiculously overpriced... If I saw any results it would be worth it, but I don&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s not. On the plus side, It makes my hair and scalp feel healthy and I have no dandruff at all, but the same can be said of other products 1/3 the price and they actually smell good.&lt;br /&gt;The blue bottle is super watery and the green bottle is very thick and reminds me too much of Pert Plus both in smell and consistency--Both bottles smell artificial, but are not unbearable. I won&#x27;t buy again unless it was being given away--I&#x27;ll try something else that makes the same claims but smells better. I&#x27;d definitely recommend Nizoral Shampoo. That shows some results, but you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it daily--hence why I bought this Regenpure stuff, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in hair loss (literal fistfuls every time I shampoo), but it sure dried my hair out like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before. Now, I do have long, naturally curly hair that tends to be dry to begin with, and this just exacerbated the problem, however, people with short, straight hair may not have trouble with the incredible knots both of these products left in my hair. I&#x27;ve gone back to Nioxin, losing less hair than before, and not needing to use huge amounts of conditioner just to detangle my curls!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really do much.  No bad effects and seemed good at first, but stopped seeing results in long run.  Also, 10 min of &amp;#34;Waiting&amp;#34; in the shower is just too much.</li>
            <li> I really saw no difference in my hair but it could just be my hair,its very fine and thin and this shampoo did nothing for me, but that is just me,it may be wonderful for others.</li>
            <li> I alternate between the DR and NT daily. The DR has a menthol/Vick&#x27;s smell that washes out. I don&#x27;t know if this shampoo regrows hair but it is used by me for the 1% ketoconazole for seborrheic dermatitis in my mustache and eyebrows (it really works well for the flakiness, as I have had none since I started using it). It realy burns the eyeballs if you look for the soap bar. with the DR on. It does not have common allergens, sulfites, bad preservatives, SLS, methlyparabens, or carcinogens in it. I can not recommend this for regrowing hair, though it might; it just takes so long to tell (many momths)and it will likely just be peach-fuzz and just keep you hoping and using it. I did not buy it for that. I am 66 and not losing hair that I am aware of, but I am thinning. I will update as needed. This is a 2 pack so it is a total of 16 ounces for $45 at this time, about $2.82 an ounce. It is less expensive than buying the DR and NT separately, but it is still pricy. The NT does not have any Ketoconizole so it gives me a break from it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it as a good shampoo for adults, will buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> This is one of the many shampoos recommended for hair loss.  They all seem to be based to some degree upon tea tree oil and peppermint.  This one also has a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; which smells a little like bubble gum.  For me, taking some vitamin B seemed to help more than any shampoo.  As with others, this is a little drying.</li>
            <li> working well, doing what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.  ran a few bottles of the dr before i ordered the nt to go with it.  was being cheap.  1 bottle of nt could easily last through 3 bottles of dr.  i use it every day and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  i&#x27;ve heard arguments for and against every day use.  i&#x27;ve also heard that it doesn&#x27;t sud up very well.  i use a little bit of the dr and wash it out right away and then reapply a tiny amount of the dr and and it get&#x27;s very sudsy on the second go.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for fine hair. I don&#x27;t have hair loss or dandruff and bought the product because it helps stimulate the scalp and gives a fuller look when you blow dry your hair. I wish it were sold in stores at a more reasonable price. The only issue I had is that the slit in the cap on the revitalizing shampoo was sealed. To use it, I have to remove the entire cap. Sloppy quality control. By the way, a little goes a long way. There&#x27;s no need to use a ton of product to get good results. I use both the treatment and the shampoo every other day. The treatment doesn&#x27;t lather much, but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me. You&#x27;re supposed to use it to stimulate the scalp, which it seems to do. Then you use the shampoo, which has a very pleasant smell and seems to work like ordinary shampoo. I will probably buy the product again, but first I&#x27;m going to try something less expensive from the drugstore to see if there&#x27;s really any difference. I seriously doubt that the product actually prevents hair loss, but I&#x27;m satisfied that it makes my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> Of course the big question everyone wants to know is does this product reduce my hair loss. I have probably used this for 6 months or more. I think using this has definitely slowed down hair loss for me. I don&#x27;t seem to shed as much hair everywhere. the NT part is like a conditioner or something and sometime my hair feels greasy at the end of the day. I have noticed an increase of pimples in the hairline and around my head area. Is it worth buying this instead of rogaine? That I can&#x27;t really tell you but its worth a shot for starters.</li>
            <li> As noted, not that harsh of a shampoo and believe it will do as prescribed.  For people use to normal shampoo, it might seem that your hair is not that clean and you will use more than the normal amount.  Also as there is no fragrance, it does not leave your hair smelling clean and (personally) unwashed odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest supplementing the NT version with another non-SLS shampoo to keep your cost down (like Avalon Organics).  And for myself Nioxon shampoo once a week to for a cleaner feeling shampoo.  So the DR version every other day and the NT and your other choices 3 times a week.  And note that you do not need to wash your hair every day and sometime a good rinse would do if it is not dirty.</li>
            <li> left my hair a little oily</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, too early to tell if it works.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Perfect Transaction !!!</li>
            <li> It has been 6 months since I have started using this product. It is no magic</li>
            <li> Waste of money I regret all the money I wasted buying this hair loss product that does not do anything in your favor</li>
            <li> I use the both of these with Rivita Cor conditioner. The combo of the three helps make my thin hair look thicker than when I stop using them. The scent is light and kind of reminds me of bubble gum. But I like that the scent is not too strong and overpowering. I wish these were a little more moisturizing, but it&#x27;s not too bad. After I condition then my hair is great. But so far, these are the most moisturizing shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried that are marketed for thinning hair. I do wish these weren&#x27;t so expensive, but since they have good quality ingredients in them, I am willing to pay for it. I only use the DR about 3 times a week while using the NT on all the other days.</li>
            <li> I am a 50 yr old man with minimal thinning of my hairline. I wanted to try this product after some research. I purchased the DR/NT combination. Its too soon to tell if the DR has any effect on hair loss yet, but I know that it contains the only clinically proven ingredient that stops DHT formation topically. The NT is a polysorbate and it will get your hair cleaner than you ever knew it could be so you may want to use a conditioner after this one if you have long hair or you wont get a comb through it. Neither contain the typical industrial sulfates that all shampoos use which is good. I use it everyday and I have had no problem with drying or redness of my scalp. The DR is a thick product that does not lather much at all however, you know its there from the cool sensation of the menthol and spearmint. Leave it on for the duration of your shower. The NT is a much thinner product that will explode into a rich lather with little more than a dime sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. I will post a follow up if I notice any improvements to my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Starting on my fourth bottle of shampoo.  My hair is not falling out nor growing.  I will not waste any more money on this product.</li>
            <li> The Dr is a bit drying, but the NT helps with that.  I use the Dr one day and the NT the next. and then skip a day.  My hair feels healthy and I don&#x27;t have dandruff any longer--less scalp itching.  As for new hair growth or less falling hair, I&#x27;m not sure yet.  However, I am planning on buying both products again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I&#x27;ve recently been trying Lipogaine&#x27;s Big 3 Shampoo instead and I probably prefer that. But it&#x27;s a toss-up for me, honestly. I&#x27;ve had no side-effects whatsoever from either (not that I expected to from 1% ketoconazole applied topically). The Lipogaine does seem to make my hair look better than the Regenepure (which was predicted by Chris from Hair Loss From Steroids). Both are probably equally effective in blocking DHT on the scalp, so if that&#x27;s your only concern, it doesn&#x27;t matter which you use as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results, though it felt nice on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is great for your scalp and hair. It makes your scalp tingle and your hair soft as silk, as far as hair growth, nothing in 10 months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this shampoo is very effective.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I ever used my hair is healthier then it has ever been. A month ago my hair was brittle and falling but since I have been using this product my hair is back to life again</li>
            <li> I received this product relatively quickly and saw results equally as fast. I emailed the company to give them kudos on a great product and compliment them in detail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited six months before deciding to write a review of these two products. Although these were the most expensive hair care products I have ever purchased I felt I should take a chance and see if they worked as advertised. I am a 60 year old male who has been using  Propecia and Rogaine for at least 6 years. Even with the use of these two products I would still have a fair amount of head hair in my tub/shower drain every morning, which I understand is typical. The first three months of using the two Regene Pure products I did not notice any hair reduction in my drain. I did immediately notice that my hair felt thicker. It was around the fifth month I noticed my hair was fuller, thicker and it wasn&#x27;t just my imagination. The bald spot in the back was smaller and the hair was definitely looking thicker. It became easier to comb over the bald spot. The front hairline also appeared to be more dense. I still have plenty of hair on the top of the scalp. My hair length ranged from 2-5 inches in length. Daily I use about a quarter size of the regene pure dr. It doesn&#x27;t lather much. I use a dime size of the nt treatment. This provides plenty of lathering. I&#x27;m now on my second bottle of the dr and still using the first nt bottle. I&#x27;m going to order my second bottle today. There is no longer any noticeable head hair in my drain. Although my hair is relatively short I don&#x27;t know how this product would work with longer hair. When I first started using it I experienced a few tangles, but that was months ago. As a side note I also purchased a laser light for my scalp at the same time, so I don&#x27;t know if  the light has helped or not. I use the light about three times a week. Bottom line is I&#x27;m still buying the regene pure.</li>
            <li> I am a woman - early 60&#x27;s with thinnbing hair.  Not sure how much this helps yet but I do seems to notice less hair in my brush.  Will continue using it - I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair is thicker and fuller</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 weeks and can tell a difference in how my hair feels thicker and I have less loss each day.  Only complaint is that it tends to be harder to comb through after using product.</li>
            <li> Had been having major problems with my hair.  Diagnosed as having traction alopecia.  Dermatologist had done all he could.  This shampoo stopped the falling and has thickened my hair and allowed me to cover the thin spots.  I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re losing your hair.  Only con is it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I cringe thinking about using these products. The product labeled \\&quot;DR - Hair &amp; Scalp Treatment\\&quot; is applied first. It doesn&#x27;t really lather. It&#x27;s somewhat menthol and not too bad.  However, in the rinse you can feel that you hair has been turned to straw. The \\&quot;NT Nourishing Treatment\\&quot; is applied second and lathers quite a bit. By this point your hair is so stiff, straw like, and tangled that getting it fully rinsed is impossible, much less attempting to comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t understand the labeling. Call it pre-shampoo treatment and shampoo. There is nothing nourishing about either product. And provide a conditioner\detangler to undo the damage done by the two shampoo steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment about hair loss prevention... other than straw like hair is bound to look fuller than silky shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using both the Regenepure DR and NT combo for just over a year.  Prior to that, I had dandruff issues and hair loss when shampooing.  Over the course of the year after starting Regenepure, my dandruff issues have disappeared and my hair loss seems under control.  Although I didn&#x27;t take photos before/after, I did receive one comment from a female friend that said my hair appeared more black, thinking that I had some kind of hair transplant or something along those lines.  I myself can&#x27;t really see the difference, but for sure know that the dandruff is no longer a problem and hair loss is much less as I do check often while shampooing.  As my wife sees me all the time, she can&#x27;t really notice either but did note that it seemed my hair loss had stopped in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also recently started following the DR+NT routine with a conditioner because somehow felt that my hair was a little dry.  I currently use Fekkai Au Naturel conditioner, but that was only because I had that leftover from before and it really makes my hair feel softer starting from the moment I start lathering it on.  Note: I do this routine at least 3-4 times per week or more, depending on what climate I&#x27;m in, work out routines that week, etc.  Not sure if there&#x27;s a Regenepure recommendation for conditioner?  If you or someone at Regenepure can advise, it would be much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On that note, it may be important to point out that I spend a lot of time traveling the world, going from the Central Midwest USA (65% here) to the Middle East (25% here) Europe and Southeast Asia (10% here).  I always travel with DR+NT.  Note: I had major problems with the NT bottle leaking &gt; the packaging is not good for travel.  However, my most recent DR+NT combo bottles received today (Feb. 2013) both have a new white lid design that may or may not leak when traveling.  The only negative I can see/note so far is that it&#x27;s less obvious which is NT and DR (no cap color difference between the two) and therefore I have to read the front sticker on the bottle to know which is which.  Never-the-less, I invested in some travel bottles some time ago to avoid the leaking issue altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using Regenepure DR+NT during 2013 until I learn of a \\&quot;newer, better\\&quot; solution to assist my aging, thinning scalp.  By the way, I&#x27;m an Asian male, 42 years old, and still have some hair on my head - albeit thinning on top with age, I guess.  Looking for a miracle to get back to my 20&#x27;s hair and wish I didn&#x27;t use all of those bad hair products back then!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;m giving the DR+NT combo 4 stars because of the \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot; feeling (and hence the need for a follow-on conditioner) and the annoying leaky bottle cap design (former blue and silver caps) that wasted much of the NT only (perhaps due to NT being less viscous than DR).  Otherwise, I would give 5 stars to both for helping stop my dandruff issue and slowing hair loss, although several other factors such as diet, travel, etc. could have also contributed to the positive results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.een the two) and therefore I have to read the front sticker on the bottle to know which is which.

            <li> I have color treated thinning hair.  I am 54, and was using Nioxin system 3 shampoo only with Rogaine.  Worked forever until Proctor &amp; Gamble changed the product.  Anyone familiar with Nioxin knows what I mean.  I tried numerous products but was disappointed with the results.  This product, after one month has me sprouting new short hairs everywhere on my head.  My hair looks thicker, is definitely softer, and more manageable.  I use the DR &amp; NT on one day, and then the NT by itself the next day.  I do use a leave in conditioner too.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this combo.  Give it a try.  Extremely Satisfied!  Bubba</li>
            <li> I really like the use of both the shampoos. I have used just the DR in the past, but when reordering thought I would try the other one as well. Using both, not at the same time, but different days has left my hair with the same great results as before, but feeling more full and moisturized. With the DR alone, some days my hair was a bit more dry than I liked. This has helped my itching as well. 100% would tell others to try it out.</li>
            <li> I bought the RegenePure system after reading about it thinking maybe this was the solution to my dandruff problem without a sulfate shampoo.  To say I&#x27;m disappointed would be a complete understatement. I have been using the system every day for the last 2 weeks hoping I would see some results. First the system leaves my hair feeling like straw, tangled, feeling heavy on my head and extremely difficult to brush out. I was sticking it out though hoping my dandruff would improve,  Well here it is two weeks later and I am seeing zero change. There is no way I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> After using for one month, no more dandruff .</li>
            <li> I am a woman whose hair is thinning quit a bit on top, and this product has caused a LOT of new hair growth.  I use it in combination with Caboki (Caboki.com) powder right now as the Caboki covers the bare scalp, but am gradually needing less Caboki as new hair continues to come in.  Use DR one day, massage and leave in for 5 minutes, then next day use NR like normal shampoo, then repeat.  Amazing results so far, have used since mid-June 2014!</li>
            <li> Woks Wonderfully on my scalp and hair. I have use the product for years and I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li> did not really help with my dandruff problem or my hair shedding. maybe it will work for you, but i do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Only thing that has ever worked for me. I&#x27;ve not had dandruff since. It may be too early to tell, but I think it has stopped my hair loss and may be restoring it.</li>
            <li> The product made my hair so dry that it was almost impossible to get a comb through it, which caused more hair to fall out!</li>
            <li> So I started using this last April (10 months now). I&#x27;m a 21 year old male and have been going through the process of a receding hairline since I was 16. I mean I generally still have very nice hair and but I am receding and as of now my widow&#x27;s peak is dying out so I&#x27;m a Norwood 2A pretty much. No bald spot in the crown? Now does this product work to stopping hair loss? Of course not, it&#x27;s a shampoo not propecia. But has it slowed down the amount of the hair falling out? Yeah I would most definitely say so. Originally I was losing maybe over 60 hairs in the shower now it&#x27;s about down to 30.... I say that is a nice slow down. Also prior to Regenpure I was losing hair all over my scalp. Now it&#x27;s just my receding hairline. As well the area between my crown and the hairline seemed to be really thinning out prior to regenepure when I was under bright lights, now that area has been thickening up a lot better since using this product. Also it&#x27;s fair to say my hair in general grows a lot faster. Lastly when your hair isn&#x27;t wet it seems like hardly any of my hair falls out when I touch my hair. Before I could easily find 1-3 every time I ran my hands through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I do you warn you that in beginning this product will make your hair look a lot worse! Its not that your hair sheds excessively more but your hair does dry out and it takes sometime for your scalp to adjust to it. If you use the DR alone it will look super dry and feel a bit irritated. The NT will give you a nice cool down though. After the adjustment period (which I say it is about a 6 month period in all honesty) your hair won&#x27;t look dead as when you initially use it but it&#x27;ll still look a little dry. I advise taking it at night before you go to bed rather than a early morning shower for the day since over night your hair will regain its more natural look. Also I avoid using it on night outs in the city like Fridays and Saturdays since I don&#x27;t use it everyday. Some people will complain about the price. Well it&#x27;s affordable. I use Regenepure 2-4 times a week and the bottles so far last me somewhere 4-5 months. I&#x27;m paying 3 times a year so far, $135 dollars annually, so less than $12 a month getting both products. The days I don&#x27;t use it I use either baby shampoo or this big bottle of Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you were wondering about Dandruff... Well I suffered from little to moderate dandruff and Regenpure most definitely eradicated my dandruff. Something that Head and shoulders never did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it&#x27;s a good product if you want a healthy scalp and hair. If you are far down track toward losing your hair then don&#x27;t expect anything out of this product. I say it works best for people just starting to lose their hair to help slow down that process. It&#x27;s a pretty long adjustment period though for your scalp, one that will have you question whether its worth buying something that initially dries out your hair but after 6 months my scalp adapted. Price is affordable. I do not take it in combination with finasteride or minoxidil though. I myself just take Biotin and Nettle Root supplements. So after 10 months I&#x27;m doing alright. And with less shedding I&#x27;ve been less focused on my hair loss since I&#x27;m finding less strands in my hands . I&#x27;ve been less preoccupied with standing in front of the bathroom mirror wondering how much longer will I have my hair ( also less anxiety and OCD about it all due to the aid of meditation and higher self esteem always helps!)</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Ever since I started using it I no longer&lt;br /&gt;see any hair in the shower drain. Have not seen any new growth yet&lt;br /&gt;but appears to be preserving the hair I have left.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and felt that since I colored my hair, this would be a good choice. WRONG!  My hair became so dry that I had fly away hair which is not normal for me.  It was as if I had no moisture at all and it became frizzy. I saw that others had the same experience and even went onto the product website to find out why I might be experiencing this with the product. The website showed that it was a complaint they acknowledged but gave no explanation.  I wasn&#x27;t happy that I had to spend the money for the product and now I have two bottles of product I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and a hair loss problem a while ago. I purchase this product in the hopes it will help me stop the hair loss but it did all the contrary, I lost so much hair in 15 days of use that I cried like a little girl. I am sure  this is a good product, but I guess the anti fungal ingredients really make it strong for thin hair. Watch out!</li>
            <li> this was a great shampoo but too expensive.</li>
            <li> Just as their website says, these shampoos really are different than others on the market. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good SLS free shampoo that is safe to use on my color treated hair. I put it through a lot with coloring, blow drying and straightening. These shampoos give my hair life back. I prefer the smell of the DR more than the smell of the NT though. Also remember to use continue to use conditioner if you like it! Would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Did it work. My husband&#x27;s hair did not feel any thicker.</li>
            <li> Tried it for 4 months, I took close up pictures of my front hairline day 1 and after 4 months.  It did not cause me to lose hair, but it did thin my hair diameter perhaps because of the Salicylic Acid it contains.  I have taken the last 2 months off from the shampoo and retook the pictures and the diameter of my hair seems to have returned.  The shampoo is pretty harsh, your hair will be very, very dry.  Its worth a try but as I have found and read many times over since trying this, there is no miracle shampoo on the market today.  If you find it let me know.</li>
            <li> I do not have hair loss issues but I love this stuff! It cleans without stripping and I can go an extra 2 days without washing my hair. I have been researching how to have healthy pretty hair and it includes not washing everyday. This was a big jump for me as I have always washed my hair daily. These products make it so I don&#x27;t worry and my hair is soft and clean without drying it out. LOVE this!</li>
            <li> First 2 months were ok. After that My hair started flaking&lt;br /&gt;First 2 months were ok. After that My hair started flaking. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the shampoo or not.</li>
            <li> I googled \\&quot;best hair loss shampoo for men\\&quot; and clicked on this site: [...]  It was a well-done site and showed what made for an effective shampoo for one of man&#x27;s many concerns.  I&#x27;ve only been using these 2 items for a couple of weeks, but I really notice a positive difference.  My hair is fuller and \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; in the sense that I don&#x27;t feel like a heavy conditioning product was used.  I must state that I&#x27;m not balding in the traditional sense, but as I approach 50, I&#x27;ve noticed the size of my strands has thinned.  I&#x27;m doing my best to keep my hair healthy and make it last into the second half of my life.  At this point, I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> it did&#x27;t do any thing for me</li>
            <li> its been the only one that has worked</li>
            <li> I switched from Nioxin because I saw promising reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now, and my hair is falling out faster than ever.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  For the expense I paid ($50 for small bottles), I am completely unsatisfied.  Do not believe the marketing, this product does not do as promised.</li>
            <li> i am not sure but it has postive effect on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;although it is been a couple of months, it seems that my scalp turns unlikely red</li>
            <li> Wow! Something that does what it claims.  I actually have more hair growth than I did when I started using this shampoo.  I saw visible results after three months of use.  I had been using Nioxin which I later learned is a volumizing shampoo...not a hair growth shampoo.  RegenePure is a hair growth shampoo that really works.  My wife has also seen improved hair growth.  The one thing that is difficult about this system is that you put the Treatment on first and let it \\&quot;set\\&quot; in place for five minutes.  Then you rinse the Treatment out and wash your hair with the Cleanser.  Seems a bit backward (sometimes the Treatment runs in my eyes while I wash the rest of my body) but it works really well.  The only downside is the system makes my showers take longer than I would normally allow.  Sometimes I just turn off the water for a couple of minutes and stand in the shower while the treatment does its \\&quot;thing.\\&quot;  I know that may create a silly mental image...so let me apologize for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, at $22.50 a bottle, this is a very expensive product.  I have to say though, I don&#x27;t mind spending extra when I can actually see new hair growth.  I really don&#x27;t want to go bald so any delay in the process (except surgery) is welcomed with open arms.  Needless to say, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> good purchase and good product</li>
            <li> I still see the same amount of hair loss. It doesn&#x27;t even smell spectacular. This is just REALLY expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> The product has slowed visible hair shedding considerably. My hair feels strong and healthy after about 4 months of use. The scent is light and pleasant. I do use Avalon Organics Thickening Conditioner after using this product because otherwise my hair feels a little too squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoos&lt;br /&gt;Use the Dr for danduff and itchy scalp and the other one for regular use</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about these products.  I was a bit skeptical when I ordered but they exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;m 63 yrs old.  My hair has always been baby fine but over the years it has become thinner especially  at my temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m losing  a lot less hair because I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less hair in my brush after the first 2 weeks and my hair is shinier than it&#x27;s been in years.  But the best part is that my hair feels thicker and I&#x27;ve noticed new growth in the thin spots at my temples.  My  only wish is that they would make a styling product because I won&#x27;t use any other brands on my hair now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that you use so little to get results that the price is actually less than I was paying for salon products.  If you feel that it&#x27;s expensive you&#x27;re probably using too much.</li>
