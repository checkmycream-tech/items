            <li>Once you figure out how to best use the flosser, it&lt;br /&gt;isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This is food that non-WaterPik users leave in their mouth EVERY night when they go to sleep - providing an incredible smorgasbord for mouth borne bacteria !!!  </li>
            <li>Your mouth feels awesome and you want to do it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I know now, from reading today the excellent manual that comes with the Waterpik Model WP-900, that my Model WP-60W had a defective reservoir valve and the warranty would have covered replacing it.</li>

            <li>This one does a great job it just doesn&#x27;t have a lot of options</li>
            <li>The WaterPik flosser has been a great addition to our dental hygene process.  </li>
            <li>It is not a substitute for flossing, but a great addition.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I use it twice a day and we find it very effective</li>
            <li>Very effective.  </li>
            <li>It works very effectively.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for bathroom sink top.</li>
            <li>All this is combined with the fact that many dentists recommend these devices as the best way to prevent and correct a number of oral hygiene</li>
            <li>It is the best thing since the toothbrush, better even than floss.  </li>
            <li>The best system for healthy teeth.</li>
            <li>This is the best waterpik I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;ve bought many over the years.  </li>

            <li>this is very easy to use and my son uses it!</li>
            <li>it makes you feel sparkling bright after using it.</li>
            <li>This product makes me feel good about my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>Have to wiggle the two parts together to get a good seal</li>
            <li>I imagine the company would have made good on it</li>
            <li>Fair priced through Amazon.</li>
            <li>kind of soon review however for now is great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to any one who needs a good water pik.</li>
            <li>The adjustable pressure flow is good.</li>
            <li>Good item.</li>
            <li>and we always get good dental checkup reports.</li>
            <li>This Water Pik system is superior in every way.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, it&#x27;s a good way to know from any room in the house that your kids are using the WaterPik . .</li>
            <li>Not as good quality as the one that I bought years ago.</li>
            <li>that somehow Waterpik had changed the design of their machine and messed up a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the wonders of Amazon</li>
            <li>I surveyed the prices and felt this was a good price for a quality product.</li>
            <li>it is so helpful and fair priced for every body to keep oral health, and save lots of dentist fee.</li>
            <li>This is a good product</li>
            <li>It was just as described and is of good quality.</li>
            <li>The water pressure is not as good as poast models.</li>
            <li>Works really good and hope to get allot of use out of it.</li>
            <li>From the time it was purchased, it has provided exceptional service.</li>
            <li>so it fits better on my counter and most of all it&lt;br /&gt;does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>Works great and better price than in-store.</li>
            <li>It is attractive and helps maintain healthy gums.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased .</li>
            <li>This one is rounded on the sides - cute and, granted, it works great -</li>
            <li>I LOVE my WP-600 and have already gotten three or four years of great service out of it.  </li>
            <li>Dentist said my gums were very healthy.</li>
            <li>WaterPik works great and flushes most of the food from pockets in gum.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Water Pik.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this item at a great price and it was delivered pronto.</li>
            <li>I think that explains why WaterPik has cut so many corners making this thing--no competition!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Until I find a better alternative, I guess I will keep replacing them rather than risk losing teeth!</li>
            <li>I have been using for so many years is now being called a Water Flosser!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Sure, its 89 decibals, vibrates like a banshee and squirts all over the bathroom (until you become expert), but let&#x27;s not quibble!  </li>
            <li>This is an easy to use and great tool for dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>based on price, it was a great bargain and works fine.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, in fact great, getting the smallest food particles from your teeth.</li>
            <li>Very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nozzles don&#x27;t fit great.  </li>
            <li>Amazing how effective this spouting water cleans between the teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hope this is really as effective as flossing...</li>
            <li>I have always liked the WaterPik.  </li>
            <li>Nice, neat ritual for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have the kind of teeth where I literally don&#x27;t dare be  without this product.  </li>
            <li>The WaterPik cleans my teeth and gums effectively.  </li>
            <li>This one is not as handy to turn on, handle or adjust.</li>
            <li>She is thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>After some adjustment I can honestly say I like the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t seem to have that kind of luck -</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had a lid.  </li>
            <li>and Amazon had a good price on it, for sure.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the excellent service.</li>
            <li>and I found that to be nice.</li>
            <li>Use warm water.</li>
            <li>There are replacement hose kits sold for this model, so that is a help for a handy person.</li>
            <li>and I use it in my apt at three in the morning.</li>
            <li>I was told that since I add Listerine I need to rinse the machine withy warm water after I use it.</li>
            <li>Is Waterpik really the best way to go?</li>
            <li>It is effective.</li>
            <li>The water Pik was very good and is an excellent tool to preventing  tooth decay  and other mouth problems.</li>
            <li>The original is still working great after 10 plus years.  </li>
            <li>WaterPik has always been an excellent product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>operates perfect helps clean teeth efficiently and clean tongue satisfactory .</li>
            <li>Waterpik, the easy way to good breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This waterpik gets the job done and so very easy to use.</li>
            <li>To ensure a successful insertion of the repair hose kit coupler, the original hose should be flexible with no indications of cracking or splitting when flexed.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The unit works fine and has a good range of pressure controls.  </li>
            <li>waterpik delivered in good time and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Always waterpik before bedtime and keep your own teeth in your head for many years.</li>
            <li>Mine comes with two tips so my wife can share the unit as well making it even more cost effective.</li>
            <li>It does a nice, refreshing job of cleaning the teeth and gums.    </li>
            <li>So far mine is perfect.   </li>
            <li>A WaterPik is in no way a substitue for brushing and flossing, but it is the perfect adjunct for complete oral health care.</li>
            <li>Found this on Amazon and it&#x27;s a perfect replacement for my old one.  </li>
            <li>If you buy a Waterpik product, best to use a brick &amp; mortar retailer near your home that you can return the product to for warranty replacement.</li>
            <li>use it when we need to with great success.</li>
            <li>This one is just perfect as the spray volume is easily adjustable and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love my Waterpik!</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my WaterPik!  </li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it!</li>
            <li>This device will really flush out the stuff from between your teeth, and scrub your tounge in a most pleasant way!</li>
            <li>Not as good as the original one I bought but does the job.  </li>
            <li>It is able to help keep your teeth clean!!</li>
            <li>I think it also more powerful and does a great job.</li>
            <li>It works great, and the price is very reasonable, compared to the product of Sonnicare.  </li>
            <li>Love love love love love it!</li>
            <li>Ours broke after a couple of years of very light use.  </li>
            <li>Effective at a lower pressure, easy to assemble and disassemble and easier to use.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s overdesigned --- who needs to know how many milliliters of water you&#x27;re using?  </li>
            <li>Many of the inconveniences of the \\&quot;Personal\\&quot; model have been eliminated in the Ultra:  </li>
            <li>The regular &amp; tongue cleaning tip are excellent.  </li>
            <li>It should be more repairable.  </li>
            <li>so it collects dust on top</li>
            <li>I tend to agree that the hose should be more flexible and should be another 6\\&quot; longer.</li>
            <li>Even more than my toothbrush, I rely on my WaterPik</li>
            <li>The tongue cleaner worked OK</li>
            <li>I have been using a WaterPik for many years.  </li>
            <li>I wish I bought this thing many years ago, would have saved a lot of dentist bills.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my WaterPik.</li>
            <li>See the tub up on top where the water goes?</li>
            <li>The latest one leaks water</li>
            <li>Curved syringes did okay, but I felt that it didn&#x27;t quite get everything out of there.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for a system I had had for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>It has also helped me to have healthy gums.</li>
            <li>It lifted my cap off. :-)</li>
            <li>We have been using waterpiks for many years.</li>
            <li>and it was ok</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Works great, really flushes out all the food that flossing and brushing misses.</li>
            <li>This unit replaces one that wore out after many years.</li>
            <li>Always leaves water on counter top</li>
            <li>am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>the results were outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t needed more than routine cleaning in 15 years.</li>
            <li>Love Waterpik</li>
            <li>I wish the design was more like the WP-100 though.</li>
            <li>Anyway, all that said, it&#x27;s probably the best unit out there if you&#x27;re looking for a powerful unit that will really remove the food particles from between your teeth.</li>
            <li>So if you have someone sleeping close by it can surely wake them.  </li>
            <li>Product works as advertised and am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Have used  waterpik for more years that I care to admit.</li>
            <li>Great to find a replacement online at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>this is an excellent replacement for the one that I had for years and finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>Have been using WaterPik for more than 10 years since scare requiring visit to periodentist.  </li>
            <li>Cleans nicely, love it</li>
            <li>The person for whom I purchased this item seems to be satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>enou7gh to leave on the counter top.</li>
            <li>I love my waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Waterpik products for 25 years and have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s remarkable the amount of food particles removed by the Waterpik, even after first thoroughly brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and price.</li>
            <li>I like most everything about it except for the water canister.</li>
            <li>I had an Interplak system and was never quite satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>can I be sure that the head is well seated?&lt;br /&gt;Head</li>
            <li>This unit dribbles water from hand piece(wand) and water runs out of the rubber fitting of the reserve tank.</li>
            <li>I spend more time cleaning up water than cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love my two hoses. . .  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the WaterPik WP-600</li>

            <li>Better than flossing.  </li>
            <li>Keeps those gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bulky, it tips, and I love it.</li>
            <li>For many months my wife has had problems of things sticking between two of her teeth.  </li>
            <li>We love this thing.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it &amp; glad he did those many years ago.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more efficient and quieter than the one I replaced.  </li>
            <li>Wish it were more convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>When I get home I will have to find a more reliable replacement.</li>
            <li>A towel underneath dampens most of the ruckus.</li>
            <li>and I love it better than flossing.</li>
            <li>so when it breaks I will most deffinately upgrade.</li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>Sincerely  Rosette</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for one which had been used for many years.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>So glad I switched to Oral Breeze.</li>
            <li>We have been pleased with the improvement in the health of our gums since using this product.  </li>
            <li>In between my dentist visits, I like to keep my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>The WaterPik flosser helps to keep my gums and teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>Just love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Much better than flossing if you have crowns.</li>
            <li>Buy it you will love it.  </li>
            <li>and it works real good to get those back teeth that dental floss sometimes won&#x27;t get to.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>The basin for the water is the right amount of water for one good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Those relatively small problems make this product a very good value and does a great job at cleaning the gums and teeth..</li>
            <li>It works very well, is easy to use and is attractive and efficent.  </li>
            <li>I have had water pik&#x27;s before and everyone I&#x27;ve had has been pretty good including this one.</li>
            <li>My old Waterpik is now working beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The good news: the Pikheads were willing to replace it with a phone call.</li>
            <li>Works great, new like said, recommend seller</li>
            <li>This new model is lighter, but still pumps great</li>
            <li>I bought it to keep my implants clean and realized I should have had gotten one years ago!</li>
            <li>can clean industrial parts quite well!  </li>
            <li>For the low cost of the unit assuming it lasts 2 years, it is a great deal to keep your teeth and gum healthy to avoid much more costly bills from the dentists, even if you have dental insurance.</li>
            <li>-what knowing that there are better models available.</li>
            <li>The WP-100 is better looking, if you care about those kind of things (we do), and it&#x27;s much quieter, as well as a bit heavier, so it feels better built, and probably adds to the quieter design.</li>
            <li>I find that it does a good job of cleaning between my teeth, but I then tend to forget to floss, which is probably not a good idea, and using this and flossing is the best idea.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so good to really get all those pockets in the gums cleaned out again.</li>
            <li>waterpik is very functional, good pressure and irrigates under crowns well.</li>
            <li>The WP-60 has proven very satisfactory - easy to use; easy to clean; very effective.  </li>
            <li>I have to constantly clean it to make sure mildew or mold does not form.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, lean over sink, let the water pour out of your mouth instead of splash on the mirror.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The slider switch on the handle which controls the speed/strength can easily be moved inadvertently during use.</li>
            <li>If WaterPik had a great product, charged $150 or more, would consumers come back...</li>
            <li>It is compact, easy to use and stows away under the sink easily.  </li>
            <li>wire and hose tangle easy.  </li>
            <li>A refreshing way to clean between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat it for getting your mouth clean, and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>It takes some practice to use it without spraying the bathroom, but when you get used to it, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and I am amazed at how it removes excess food from my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gets the job done that I expect.</li>
            <li>easily . . .  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of creative ways you can use a water jet to clean things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are a lot of creative ways you can use a water jet to clean things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Waterpik is working as intended and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>have found it easy to use and it seems to do its job.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and fulfills all expectations.</li>
            <li>It easily fits beneath the shelf below the vanity mirror when the cover is in the storage position.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>(I found a customer review that explained how easy that is to do).</li>
            <li>It easily beats the WaterPik.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill with water and remove water.</li>
            <li>At the lowest setting the stream is strong...</li>
            <li>- still runs strong, doesn&#x27;t leak,</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend it to anyone&#x27;s dental care.</li>
            <li>At full power, the WaterPik is quite vigorous, and I&#x27;d guess that anyone with any gum issues would not be able to tolerate it.</li>
            <li>I liked it better when it was on the main body</li>
            <li>Compact, easy to use, does the job  quickly and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik for several decades now, and while the effectiveness of the product -- excellent for oral irrigation and toughening the gums -- has been consistent, the design and quality of the product have faltered.  </li>
            <li>I like it fine</li>
            <li>Product works fine</li>
            <li>The product is light weight, easy to use and does a thorough job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>I bought a WaterPik in about 1963, and it ran fine till about 2001, when the pump wore out.  </li>
            <li>but it attaches fine to the WP60.</li>
            <li>Mid-power works just fine for me, so that&#x27;s what I use.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems the motor is fine...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Oral Breeze Shower Breeze for about a week and a half now and am very impressed.</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate, and it is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The product was received quickly and I am satisfied with my purchasing experience.</li>
            <li>It works really well, and now that I have it, I&#x27;m glad that I never have to use and/or buy string floss anymore!</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t know was there is a huge difference in irrigators (dental water jets).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheap dental insurance</li>
            <li>Whenever you open the case, they fly out, and I have to retrieve them from the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It is always amazing how much food gets embeded between the teeth that the toothbrush even an electric toothbrush does not remove.</li>
            <li>All units cannot be repaired and have no replaceable parts reasonably available.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>Works fantastic.</li>
            <li>WP-600 has several great features . . .  </li>
            <li>so cheaply made I must replace or repair it every 3 years.  </li>
            <li>It gave great service, but finally its motor quit.</li>
            <li>I try light solugion of bleach and waterr.</li>
            <li>it easy to clean- and store away-</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I can be rather crafty when I want to be, so</li>
            <li>The stream is more powerful</li>
            <li>Paid $35 for a months use of a crummy, cheap device.  </li>
            <li>My guess is that they, like a lot of manufacturers have skimped on quality and went for cheap.  </li>
            <li>This time I went to the WaterPik site and found their most economical model</li>
            <li>The water pick replaced my old one and it is just as good as the one that I used for almost 20 years.  </li>
            <li>There is no doubt the WaterPik is far more effective than its predecessor.</li>
            <li>I LIKE IT SO FAR, SEEMS TO BE DOING A GOOD JOB.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great, is compact and is the top quality I expected from WaterPik.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the new one I just got from Amazon.</li>
            <li>We actually use it with a special tip for nasal rinsing and it works great</li>
            <li>With twice-daily use I don&#x27;t expect it live more than a couple more years, which frankly is a great bargain if I can avoid an oral surgeon or more fillings due to receding gums.    </li>
            <li>This unit did a fantastic job of keeping the extraction site nice and clean and free of infection, not to mention allowing me to eat normally after my oral surgery, not just ice cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love this product very much.</li>
            <li>The best, AAA+++  Don&#x27;t buy the small portable unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever owned, it is quite addictive,and I love it...  </li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the reviews since they are not wrong.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, my gums bled quite a bit, but they don&#x27;t any more.</li>
            <li>I would have like a lid on the top like the first water pik</li>
            <li>The item was in its original package and arrived with no visible damage.  </li>
            <li>My gums are in very good shape thanks to daily use.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my old waterpik (which lasted many many years)</li>
            <li>Just wipe it off or use a scrub brush rinsed under the faucet to keep the nooks and crannys clean.</li>
            <li>When I got brace, my orthodontist recommended one of these machine to keep my teeth and gum clean.</li>
            <li>GETS MY TEETH AND GUMS CLEAN AND DISLODGES FOOD PARTICLES.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the quality of this water pik/ flosser and its not as loud as my former one.</li>
            <li>Your mouth feels really clean.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel really clean after all this effort.</li>
            <li>you will see all kinds of food particles pouring out of what you thought was a sparkly clean mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve usedthe water jet to clean the nooks and crannies in my humidifier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the WaterPik to clean crevices on all kinds of devices.  </li>
            <li>the water jet to clean the nooks and crannies in my humidifier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the WaterPik to clean crevices on all kinds of devices.  </li>
            <li>I floss every day but don&#x27;t seem to feel totally clean.  </li>
            <li>My order was filled and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice strong jet -- I use the strongest setting as my gums remain strong with regular waterpik use.  </li>
            <li>The adjustment is better on this one than the older models as it is more nuanced and you can dial up a very soft spray or one that will really hurt your gums if they&#x27;re not in good shape.</li>
            <li>I just got a replacement, so hopefully this one works right!  </li>
            <li>this has a lot of power, enough to clean really good between teeth.</li>
            <li>We have two children in braces and really needed a better way to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li>My husband liked this pick so much that when the first one wore out I had to find a replacement for him.</li>
            <li>The second was that I had never had a home cleaning that was so good.  </li>
            <li>I use warm water for the resevoir since it can bring discomfort to my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is only about $35-40 more than this model, and it is light years more value for the money.</li>
            <li>It is only about $35-40 more than this model, and it is light years more value for the money.</li>
            <li>My dentist also tells me that I&#x27;ve good oral hygiene after using the waterpik in addition to regular brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li>Nice update to the old.</li>
            <li>It really keeps the gums healthy and cured my gingivitis.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many WaterPik&#x27;s - they are very functional in cleaning debris from between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>it shouldn&#x27;t-but after 10 years of using it, hey, not bad.  </li>
            <li>Reason being, it is too easy to move to a higher pressure while \\&quot;water picking\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have had a WaterPik like this for many yearsthat worked fine until it developed a leak.  </li>
            <li>It leave my mouth feel fresh and clean after brushing the teeth as well.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not complaining because the WaterPik lasted well over the 2 year warranty and keeps my gums and teeth fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>The Ultra has a much smaller footprint, the jet is positioned better, and it has a top to cover the reservoir when not in use.  </li>
            <li>The tank empties quick so plan on a refill.</li>
            <li>The amount of food that these devices remove AFTER you&#x27;ve already brushed, flossed, and rinsed, is nothing short of amazing !!!</li>
            <li>I was extremely lucky that it did not cause a fire.  </li>
            <li>Helps tremendously with gums.</li>
            <li>the older you get, the more you need to pay attention to oral health.</li>
            <li>I began using the Waterpik many years ago and highly recommended it to anyone who would listen.  </li>
            <li>When gripping the nozzle I found myself accidentally disconnecting it because my fingers were too high.  </li>
            <li>Really helps keep my teeth clean!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve had and the dentist reported that my gums are much better than since my last visit and the hygenist was happy too.</li>
            <li>I get good numbers on the gum measurements at each exam, so this issue has just been a \\&quot;keep an eye on it\\&quot; thing for a long time.</li>
            <li>Keeps breath nice and clean with daily use.  </li>
            <li>The quality is great, Amazon beats all prices hands down.</li>
            <li>Love this product, can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>I love my new waterpik</li>
            <li>It is very noisy and you easily spray water all over using it.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the same item (brand, device) I have owned for 4-5 years, it sure seems to be a &amp;#34;light-weight&amp;#34; version!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This model is pretty, to boot!</li>
            <li>Only wish that they had included more than !</li>
            <li>Great enginering, design and craftmanship; works great every day; but I had to throw away a travel size \\&quot;Waterpick\\&quot; after 18 months, because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Any more forceful setting than the lowest setting is too strong, i.e., probably has the potential to damage gingiva.  </li>
            <li>Dentists have recommended digitally (finger) rubbing my gums as a remedy, but I&#x27;ve never been able to stick with it--too easy to invoke the gag reflex.</li>
            <li>not as strong as I expected even at highest setting, runs quiet, pretty effective, gets  way more stuff out from between teeth than regular floss, quite happy with product.</li>
            <li>Buy it if you are interested in keeping your teeth and gums clean or if someone you know has recommended it.  </li>
            <li>We have been using this type of waterpic for years, It&#x27;s amazing what a regular toothbruch will miss</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a Waterpik water flosser since 2006, and I am hugely grateful to Waterpik for how much it has improved the health of my gums.</li>
            <li>(I learned setting it on a towell helps to immobilize it, and quiet it a bit, which is good because I&#x27;ll also have a towell ready in case</li>
            <li>But, it is definately worth wiping up some water for how well it cleans.</li>
            <li>Okay it&#x27;s not quite that loud.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once, and love it so far.  </li>
            <li>Has more pressure then old one</li>
            <li>This water flosser has so far worked well and is more powerful and effective than the hand-held.</li>
            <li>It makes my whole mouth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>( I squirted myself in the face a couple of times) but is worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>I lost my extra tips years ago &amp; the storage inside the lid on the ultra seems like it&#x27;ll be a nice feature.      </li>
            <li>but it is well worth it for the</li>
            <li>The recommended replacement interval for these Jet Tips is 6 months, but I don&#x27;t replace them if they are still working--the point at which the Jet Tip needs to be replaced is when water dribbles through it instead of in a strong, steady stream, or it won&#x27;t stay seated in place in the Waterpik handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>B0095IMNI0 WP-900]], which offers a top-of-the-line Waterpik water flosser plus the outstanding Waterpik Sonic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money and convenient to store when not in use.</li>
            <li>Worth every nickel.</li>
            <li>I have had a WaterPik for many years and my old one wore out.</li>
            <li>After has been fixed, everything was ok again.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I know, they&#x27;ve been around for years and set the standard and made it popular</li>
            <li>I liked the clear water holder better than the blue color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked using the WaterPik flosser especially for my gums.  </li>
            <li>To be very honest, I only post negative experiences with products since it is my belief that when one purchases a product good quality should be a given.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, I&#x27;m certain (as is my dentist) that it has prevented significant gum disease that otherwise would have occurred.  </li>
            <li>He loves it and says the pressure is great and this really works well compared to other water pik&#x27;s</li>
            <li>No so good for travel due to the size, but because the tank makes it self enclosed it keeps things together.</li>
            <li>yeah right)?  </li>
            <li>friend bought me this model as a replacement, and right away I noticed a couple of things I didn&#x27;t like:  </li>
            <li>He was right.</li>
            <li>and I used it right away...</li>
            <li>never worked right</li>
            <li>A new user will need to start at a lower setting, which is easy to do right on the handle.</li>
            <li>makes it much easier to clean and store.</li>
            <li>Quick, quiet and more powerful at a lower setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy to use and has really helped reduce the number of infections I used to have.  </li>
            <li>Really, there is nothing you can buy on the market for $40 that pumps from 5 psi to 80 psi, cool.  </li>
            <li>The minor design improvements are good ones and all the old tried and true features remain.  </li>
            <li>Smooth new machine.</li>
            <li>Teledyne, the new owner of the brand, said no replacement parts were available.  </li>
            <li>that is until it happened again to the new one I bought, fortunately I caught that one before it burnt up.  </li>
            <li>Even though it is about 50% more in cost, it is worth it to me (despite the blue reservoir, which doesn&#x27;t match any of my countertop accessories).</li>
            <li>Not as easy to attach tip as old one and have to remove tip to invert reservoir when not using the system.</li>
            <li>This one ran okay till a few weeks ago, when it lost its ability to provide pulses of water at more than one setting.  </li>
            <li>Not that such bleeding is a good thing, but its importance will be clear in a moment.</li>
            <li>This one works just fine; don&#x27;t like the speed handle as well as the old one.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a lot more money to buy new tips and a new hose/wand and why not just go all out and buy another, newer model Waterpik</li>
            <li>but after a really good brushing, watching those impacted little food particles floating into the sink with the water spray keeps me using it......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tricky to make a good seal when installing the water container after filling it.</li>
            <li>Because I liked the original I expected to like the new one.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought off of Amazon, the supplier said contact the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I had it assembled and ready to go, as per the instructions, it leaked everywhere!  </li>
            <li>First of all, instead of two \\&quot;picks,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The first one worked for two years.</li>
            <li>It is a cheesy contraption at best in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It has always done exactly what the literature and instructions said it would.  </li>
            <li>This is the third WaterPik I have purchased and love this one.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item 4 years ago and used it consistently for 1 year.</li>
            <li>and it would be more practical to have 2 regular tips in there.  </li>
            <li>Probably to make more money but to buy 1 replacement regular tip is pricey, about $11.  </li>
            <li>I think scrubbing the tongue with a regular toothbrush with toothpaste gets better results.</li>
            <li>my mouth was sore at the higher pressure levels.</li>
            <li>Be aware if you are a foreigner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gladly buy a better brand if one existed, but to my knowledge, WaterPik are the only ones making such a machine.</li>
            <li>The product functions works exactly as product description.</li>
            <li>I bought my first WaterPik ages ago, maybe for college?  </li>
            <li>I can only speculate that the designer and/or manufacturer intended it for a species with more durable gingiva than mine.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Water Pik in about 1970 at the recommendation of my dentist at that time.  </li>
            <li>In more recent years they have not allowed us to get hose parts and repair this ourselves.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the last generation.</li>
            <li>With regular use expect stronger gums and healthy dental check-ups.  </li>
            <li>Better than leaving the head of the wand stored outside the machine.</li>
            <li>Plastic hose came off handle first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product and works as I expected,  I love this one because you can use the different setting on it to manage the amount of water that comes out.  </li>
            <li>Work better than the last model I had.  </li>
            <li>My mouth felt cleaner and healthier again after the first use.  </li>
            <li>When I went to use it the first time it leaked and no water would come through the hose at all.  </li>
            <li>Not too big, not too small..... perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>I think a waterpik is necessary to keep teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>The last one lasted many years (ten or more, I no longer remember when we bought it)</li>
            <li>After going through three portable units from Waterpic in two years, two of the units I repaired multiple times, I decided to go with the plug-in unit, which for some foolish reason I though might be more durable.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first WaterPik in the mid-sixties.  </li>
            <li>The most recent one lasted about two years before the plastic tube broke.  </li>
            <li>Rinse handle in hot water after use to keep sanitary.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this product again!</li>
            <li>That first one was a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not difficult to do</li>
            <li>All in all, I think it&#x27;s doing its job and pretty well at that.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>This time, I got what I wanted on first try from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid user of Water-pik dental sprayers.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted and could not find anywhere else</li>
            <li>During my semi-annual dental cleaning and exams, I sometimes had the same minor gum bleeding that I experienced upon first use of the WaterPik.</li>
            <li>so many different models.  </li>
            <li>I can use my WaterPik in about a quarter of the time it takes me to use regular floss, and it does a more thorough job.  </li>
            <li>My first WaterPik lasted about 10 years.</li>
            <li>I always had trouble flossing and this product seemed to be a good solution.  </li>
            <li>I mix peroxide with the water and it wastes a fair amount of the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit flimsy, is far too large and isn&#x27;t that easy to remove and reset.</li>
            <li>You have to purchase the Sinupulse Elite Replacement Sinus Irrigator Tip to use with it, but this is much more cost effective than purchasing more expensive models and just getting one use!  </li>
            <li>Please revert back to \\&quot;the good old days\\&quot; when you made a decent product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, once or twice a week focusing on gum line, caps or any other type of dental apparatus works so well the dentist commends me at every visit on my amazing dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>This product, although poorly constructed, did a good job while it lasted!</li>
            <li>(Perhaps it helps if you point out, as I did, that if the problem of the hose detaching is common enough to warrant a topic on their customer support page, perhaps they might engineer a more effective solution!)  </li>
            <li>I bought this brand because I was very well satisfied and comfortable using the my previous unit.</li>
            <li>I got braces as an adult, and wore them for two plus years; Water-pik made my mouth feel somewhat clean during that time.</li>
            <li>Finally, the cord is stored wound around the bottom of the unit, and has no clip or anything to keep it in place, so once wound and ready to replace in its storage place, one must have one hand around the top and bottom - to keep everything inside from opening and flying apart, and one hand on the wound cord, to keep it from unwinding and dangling after you as you take it to its storage place.    </li>
            <li>So overall, it&#x27;s a good product that doesn&#x27;t have any competitor to equal the value.</li>
            <li>Kind of important because the strongest degree is quite harsh &amp; feels as if it could drill a hole in soft tissue!  </li>
            <li>I know the outlet is good since I can ( and DO ) regularly plug in a vacuum sweeper that draws around 10 Amps.</li>
            <li>Apparently a \\&quot;handle replacement kit\\&quot; is available from the manufacturer, and I have inquired how I might order one.  </li>
            <li>you don;t mind using for other things, the WaterPik actually works great in a number of cleaning situation.  </li>
            <li>Doing so results in the mixture bubbling up, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;However, with my older unit, I had no problem lining up the rubber grommet on the bottom of the tub with the grommet on top of the pump mechanism, even though that tub was white opaque plastic.</li>
            <li>My first impression after using this thing reminded me of being given enemas as a child --- sure you felt cleansed when it&#x27;s over but is it worth the mess.</li>
            <li>The hose appears to be affixed more securely to the handle, but I am still using my first unit, as I devised a simple but effective solution while Waterpik was making their move: just by wrapping a length of Scotch plastic tape around the detached hose, you increase the circumference of the hose enough to make a snug fit with the little white plastic collar tucked in the handle where the hose attaches.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with my new WaterPik, but the old one had a less cumbersome swivel on the hand flosser.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive gums and often times when I floss or brush my gums bleed.</li>
            <li>This 70 model is quiet and sends out quite a strong jet of water.</li>
            <li>Certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li>The wand handle must be positioned \\&quot;just so.\\&quot; and there is no cover for the large tank.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t send in the warranty because I trusted the WaterPik name and certainly the Ultra couldn&#x27;t be problematic.</li>
            <li>This is our 3rd Waterpik, first one, decades old, works better.</li>
            <li>I have been using WaterPik for many years, I&#x27;ve just purchased a new replacement at age 80 and a dentist recently asked me if I had just had my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>All they asked was the serial number and sent me a brand new one right away.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used my new WaterPik very much--no more than 50 times--and the last time I tried to detach the jet tip from the hose, it broke off at the end.  </li>
            <li>As I am high maintenance when it comes to my dental work, this product is exactly what I have needed.</li>
            <li>I believe wearing out after five years is fair, given the hard water in my area.</li>
            <li>For the same price, you will get two years from a device which, no matter how hard you brush, will kick surprising amounts of crud from between your teeth, can be filled with mouthwash to kill halitosis sources from between your teeth, virtually stops gum bleeding (me) with use 3x a week, and (bonus)</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m done, I know I&#x27;ve done everything possible to keep my teeth happy and firmly connected to the rest of me.</li>
            <li>dentist informed me he used Waterpik and his gums really responded.........</li>
            <li>The real difficulty is that there&#x27;s no way to repair these units.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of the rubber tipped ortho pik since water trickled through it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the pump is working but is very noisey.</li>
            <li>The stream of water it puts out is very powerfull and \\&quot;Piks\\&quot; up where brushing and flossing leave off.</li>
            <li>No one else wants to make them.</li>
            <li>Its price is reasonable for its class.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked on my Pik, despite its flaws, because it really finishes up a teeth cleaning job.  </li>
            <li>On the whole, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li>unit is much quieter</li>
            <li>Thanks Water Pik</li>
            <li>It is VERY noisy.  </li>
            <li>and it is very helpful to me.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say eough about how much this product has changed my life.</li>
            <li>It does what it is designed for very well.</li>
            <li>I am fed up with these cheaply built plastic gizmos that are flooding the market and don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I bought this WaterPik for my sister who really uses it all of the time</li>
            <li>I bought it to use with the Waterpik Gentle Sinus Rinse attachment.</li>
            <li>Powerful jetting action for getting to those problem areas.</li>
            <li>tried to open the handle to replace the cheap plastic tube that goes from the pump to the handle.  </li>
            <li>Once open, I found, as I expected, the cheap plastic tube had cracked, thereby leaking most of the water into my hand when I used it.  </li>
            <li>There seems not to be much of a choice in the marketplace just now.</li>
            <li>Really does the job.</li>
            <li>The unit accomplished its purpose of cleaning between teeth.   </li>
            <li>After being without one for awhile and complaining about how much we missed it, we thought we&#x27;d buy one again.  </li>
            <li>The waterpik works very well at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>it has too much pressure</li>
            <li>However, I am very pissed that I am REQUIRED to justify any purchase that I make.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It has not happened since, however I am very cautious about as it is my opinion that the switch has an issue.    </li>
            <li>The thing I found rather ironic</li>
            <li>It really helps with sinus washes/  </li>
            <li>It more than expected meets my needs.  </li>
            <li>Pollen season is on us and our water pik is really helping.,</li>
            <li>The Water Flosser is much easier to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very noisy product.</li>
            <li>thank you for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This cleans between teeth very well.</li>
            <li>This waterpik really helps.  </li>
            <li>and I really needed a waterpik.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave one to my nephew for his birthday and he really needed one because he has braces.</li>
            <li>It works really well cleaning under my bridge.</li>
            <li>I really like it that they never change much.</li>
            <li>They are very helpful.</li>
            <li>Makes fast work of the job.  </li>
            <li>Very noisy.</li>
            <li>It makes both of our lives much easier.</li>
            <li>The blue bowl that sits on top of the unit holds all the water I need for one complete use.</li>
            <li>Whenever you feel sensitivity of any kind between teeth or especially on gum line, just keep irrigating it daily with a capful of mouthwash or hydrogen peroxide added to the water.</li>
            <li>I own TWO of these units, which are model WP-65W, essentially the very same unit as the 60W.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried three different models and this seems to be the most reliable and durable so far.  </li>
            <li>It actually works better than the old one ever did.</li>
            <li>This unit is much smaller than the old style and convieniently slts on the vanity, Pressure is adjustible and I love the way it makes my move feel.</li>
            <li>I had some bleeding the first couple times I used it, but now that&#x27;s stopped and I even think the most troublesome pocket may be holding less debris.  </li>
            <li>High capacity reservoir, variable pressure settings, temporary pressure shut off on the hand-held  wand, extremely easy to clean, simple &amp; straight-forward almost fool-proof operation, etc.  </li>
            <li>The first was how loud it was!  </li>
            <li>There is nothing better for cleaning around crowns, braces and other dental work.  </li>
            <li>The other models are so much better than this one.</li>
            <li>(1-31-2013)  Like so many others, I will proclaim that oral irrigation is extremely beneficial to your health, blasting out rotting food particles, plaque and bacteria from places your toothbrush, floss and rinse can&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a grat product to deep clean your gum.</li>
            <li>I recently had my wisdom teeth out, and had issues keeping the sockets clean of debris.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only way my mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li>The older models are much louder.  </li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t feel clean enough.  </li>
            <li>Good strong flush between teeth and under gums from outside and from behind gums every night before bed.</li>
            <li>A very handy supplement to regular flossing, gets into the gum pockets but I am not sure it does the whole job between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why Waterpik expected the hose to stay on the handle in the first place; it looks like it must have been secured with spit -- or prayers -- as there is no tape or gromit of any kind to secure it.  </li>
            <li>My only displeasure is that after about 5 or 6 years the vinyl plastic hose will split and it&#x27;s not really cost effective, or easy to replace the hose, essentially forcing the purchase of a new unit, but hey, nothing lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an engineer, but I think a few little snap-in devices or hinged clips would make me much more enthusiastic about using it.</li>
            <li>It is a little larger (takes up more space) than other models but has good storage and the tank covers everything.</li>
            <li>and I used it for more than 5 years with no trouble but a single disruption in the hose.  </li>
            <li>It just kind of wobbles up there with a small gasket around the hole in the bottom where the water is fed into the motor.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was surprised for two reasons.  </li>
            <li>so I set it about halfway on two because full open can cause my gums to bleed.  </li>
            <li>My first Waterpik, purchased in the early 1970s for sensitive gums on the recommendation of my dentist, lasted far longer than my more recent purchases.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, I thought the motor had come loose and that the unit was beginning to full apart.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first one from the oral surgeon who recommended I use it for general oral hygiene and specifically because I had large gum pockets around some of my molars.</li>
            <li>INCREDIBLE improvement......a little  messy with the water,</li>
            <li>then I would have had to buy a whole new unit rather than just a hose.  </li>
            <li>This one is not as elaborate as the one I previously had</li>
            <li>If not, your machine has a lifetime of at most a year, and probably less.</li>
            <li>The older WaterPiks used to scoot across our granite countertop.</li>
            <li>I have had an older version of this WaterPic for about 20 years and it worked till 1/1/11.</li>
            <li>I am especially dependant on Water Pik for a good cleaning of the few dental food pockets that I have.  </li>
            <li>All of the negative issues already posted, such as the motor seizing, have been experienced by me.</li>
            <li>I did not exchange this one because it was a cheaper model than my older one</li>
            <li>I personally would rather pay more up front for a well-made product that will last 10 to 20 years (like they used to) than buy something that is</li>
            <li>I have found that the second level is more than enough.</li>
            <li>But.... It was very short lived, as the tubing leading to the pic began leaking--then quickly lost all function.  </li>
            <li>although I wish now I had spent the extra $20 to get the deluxe model.</li>
            <li>Set-up was simple and quick.  </li>
            <li>Well, it still makes a loud racket, tries to skate around the counter top, and leaks water through the hand held device, but it no longer pumps water through.  </li>
            <li>The filled reservoir fits loosely onto the top, so that sometimes you don&#x27;t have it properly in place, and you have to \\&quot;fiddle\\&quot; with it to get it properly seated or</li>
            <li>The amount of water that squirted through the normal tip at low pressure was more than necessary</li>
            <li>The only problem is the water tank does not fit on easily, but or else it is fine.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone who doesn&#x27;t have one</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if having problem with bleeding gums.</li>
            <li>The reason being, that while it looks pretty in the short term, clear plastic SCRATCHES where the white is easily cleaned of lime deposits without visible scratching and will maintain its appearance for the life of the unit.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the clever storage for the tubing on my new one.</li>
            <li>I love it, but each one I&#x27;ve owned had to be replaced because the little tubing ends up breaking and seemingly can&#x27;t be repaired.</li>
            <li>Hoping that as it is used more it may work a little smoother.</li>
            <li>The other problem is the power stream adjustment is on the pic so it can easily be moved.</li>
            <li>Brush your teeth and floss using your usual routine and rinse with your favorite mouthwash - get your teeth as clean as you possibly can ., . .  </li>
            <li>Kind of hard to snap on and off.  </li>
            <li>Also, I get a stronger cleaning stream due to the house&#x27;s strong water pressure.</li>
            <li>Much more thorough than flossing, includes a tongue cleaner, much stronger motor, really gets out hard to get food like carrots and lettuce.</li>
            <li>Lastly,it is somewhat louder than I expected, and might disturb a light sleeper.</li>
            <li>The weakest degree is much stronger than my old device.  </li>
            <li>It is not perfect, but I have a number of Panasonic products, at home, which I am happy with...</li>
            <li>When I carefully tried to pull the hose off the nipple on the pump, the cheap, brittle plastic nipple broke with NO hope of repair or replacement or work-around.</li>
            <li>I got two personal size Water Piks vice the family size which would be stretched more.</li>
            <li>They should click firmly at each level to be more user-friendly.    </li>
            <li>I am using it everyday and am enjoying it</li>
            <li>Okay, it can be a bit messy.  </li>
            <li>Using it everyday will keep your teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that all waterpiks make a bit of noise, but its normal.</li>
            <li>No, that is normal for the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my WP-60W for almost two years, ever since I started getting sore gums periodically, but rarely used it regularly.  </li>
            <li>One again like so many electromechanical devices in recent years, the quality of manufacture and long term durability continue to decrease as the replacement cost increases.</li>
            <li>This is number 4 or more of Water Piks; they last a long time, and do the job (still have my teeth).  </li>
            <li>Once I have flossed, dumped the Listerine/water mix and filled the tub with fresh rinse water, it&#x27;s a simple matter to re-set the tub on the pump because the new tub is transparent plastic, the water is clear (not bubbly) and I can look down and see exactly how to line up the grommets.</li>
            <li>One doesn&#x27;t need a large volume of water for each use and the water should be replaced each time, so why have such a large water container?</li>
            <li>right now they are doing the opposite.  </li>
            <li>while I&#x27;m at it, it&#x27;s only hard-earned money, right?</li>
            <li>That way I feel confident that those natural antibacterials are getting into the tight spots.  </li>
            <li>The dental hygienist twice a year and the low tech floss string daily will do fine.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the company changed a good thing into pure junk.  </li>
            <li>As a tooth/gum cleaner, it works great, if a little messy (water everywhere).  </li>
            <li>A little noisy (compared to earlier model) but is highly effective in removing plaque</li>
            <li>Expect to buy a new one every year for reasons listed here.</li>
            <li>This purchase is for use aboard our new motorhome.  </li>
            <li>This new WaterPik had rubber feet that prevents this.</li>
            <li>And I like the new design and</li>
            <li>Anyway, I can&#x27;t live without it -</li>
            <li>Does the new unit work?  </li>
            <li>but I can live with  that.</li>
            <li>I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CANNOT use this while having a conversation, or wearing a new shirt.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I have to &amp;#34;hunt and seek&amp;#34; to get the grommets on the new unit to connect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that I have to keep getting new units as they start to leak after a while.</li>
            <li>Had to get a new one</li>
            <li>Every 3 years or so, I wear one out and have to buy a new one, which is why I bought this one.  </li>
            <li>I had braces in my early 20&#x27;s and not could imagine not using a waterpik 4x a day just to feel decent.  </li>
            <li>We should have spent the extra money and  repeated the better style.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase the newer model since no sinus irrigator adapter is available for it from either WaterPik or 3rd party suppliers such as Sinupulse.</li>
            <li>The next model up was available locally, but could not find this model which saved me over $10.</li>
            <li>Once I get the blasted thing to work, it does a wonderful job of getting debris left after flossing, but it&#x27;s still a pain in the you-know</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that over time I&#x27;ll learn how to line them up with no problem, but for now it takes me several tries.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very handy, and great way to keep the nasty out of your mouth</li>
            <li>Remember that you can force water under the gum if you have soft gums and the force is set high.  </li>
            <li>I needed a replacement for my very old waterpik and found this on online.</li>
            <li>This is easier to clean and dry than other models and the larger tank allows more water for each use and a complete cleaning.</li>
            <li>even my 2 Telebrands Pocket Hoses work great in the face of over 2,000 really bad reviews right here on Amazon &amp;  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud, too loud!  </li>
            <li>Another design flaw that shouldn&#x27;t exist on such a mature product: the irrigation tips really need a gnurled grip so you can turn them in your mouth easily when they get wet while in use.  </li>
            <li>Another design flaw that shouldn&#x27;t exist on such a mature product: the irrigation tips really need a gnurled grip so you can turn them in your mouth easily when they get wet while in use.  </li>
            <li>It is light-weight, and it operates more powerfully and quietly than the previous versions I&#x27;ve had of this same model.</li>
            <li>My first WaterPik was purchased in the 1970s and lasted almost 30 years before the pump finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The tube that extends from the unit to the mouthpiece is cheap and way too short (hardly 3 feet) and it&#x27;s so strongly coiled it ends up hardly being able to reach 2 feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did use the Waterpik at about an inch away from the extraction sites and used the lowest setting possible to avoid dislodging clots for the first week.</li>
            <li>I wore the first one out, so had to get another one as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li>If you buy it, just be aware that you are buying a Chinese made product.</li>
            <li>Just like my old one!</li>
            <li>The pressure is to low, the other models have more pressure.</li>
            <li>Works better than past</li>
            <li>Since I had purchased my first two Waterpiks locally, and I had not gone online to research Waterpik when I did so</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was me that somehow left it on in the outage,</li>
            <li>Not sure how safe using this product is.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unbearable and you only have it on for a couple of minutes, but, just be aware of the issue.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>This is first one from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Others were at local stores, who did not always have model in stock.</li>
            <li>The first one was an earlier model I got from my dentist</li>
            <li>i chose itbecause the other one brokeit works better than a regular toothbrush i have used water pic for years</li>
            <li>Wow, can I tell you how improved my gums and mouth felt for about 2 months!  </li>
            <li>It is LOUD!  </li>
            <li>The first replacement lasted 3 weeks, the second hose lasted 1 week.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a similar system made by a different mfr, after that one developed an irreparable leak following many years of use.    </li>
            <li>Again, one wonders how Waterpik stays in business effecting such elaborate solutions to such simple (but critical) design flaws; it&#x27;s like an auto manufacturer giving you a whole new car because they had installed faulty lug nuts on one of your wheels.  </li>
            <li>Again, one wonders how Waterpik stays in business effecting such elaborate solutions to such simple (but critical) design flaws; it&#x27;s like an auto manufacturer giving you a whole new car because they had installed faulty lug nuts on one of your wheels.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m comparing the new one to old 25 yr one</li>
            <li>Seems to work about as well, but not if you try to use the old nozzles on the new product.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find new on/off controls</li>
            <li>&quot; This was my first time to try any such item and it worked well to clear up my sinuses.</li>
            <li>motor is very loud and sounds like an old rusty boat motor and shakes itself around my counter.</li>
            <li>To use this pik, you need to be face down into the bowl of the sink with the water drooling out of the side of your mouth and onto your hand and back along the hose to the sink top.  </li>
            <li>It works fine but is a little noisy.</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with it with only 2 minor caveats .</li>
            <li>My wants are simple and they didn&#x27;t try to make the new one sing and dance.</li>
            <li>I contacted Waterpik at their website, explained the problem -- and one week later they sent a whole new unit.  </li>
            <li>After a short period of time the force of water was cut in half, and I have not been able to correct this problem.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate and has all the necessary tips to deep clean past the gumline.</li>
            <li>They get noisy after a few years, but worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Blue top keeps toppling over and making a mess on the countertop.</li>
            <li>First, don&#x27;t take seriously those pictures of a guy standing straight up over the sink with a smile on his face.  </li>
            <li>Love it, hardly can skip waterpiking my teeth at night -</li>
            <li>I like the clear water reservoir and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>And that slinky-like hose takes real talent to get back to the way it was.  </li>
            <li>But what really annoys me is the design of the current product.  </li>
            <li>Our old WaterPic wore out and we replaced it with a cordless rechargeable flosser.</li>
            <li>We went back to the real WaterPic</li>
            <li>It is quieter and seems to work smooter that the old one and still has all the water preasue I need.</li>
            <li>but motor is extremely loud.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if there is much quality control or testing of the individual machines.  </li>
            <li>Busy people do not always have the time to pack the product up for returning.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this unit to replace a 12 year old WaterPic. &lt;</li>
            <li>WOW..</li>
            <li>But it got old and leaky and so I put it away, pack rat that we are.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a 25 year old model.  </li>
            <li>problem is the need to make frequent solutions.</li>
            <li>Not that I was too surprised.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended I purchase the WaterPik as I have the early stages of gum disease.  </li>
            <li>I bought to replace our old one.  </li>
            <li>The old one wore out.</li>
            <li>It is possible that they redesigned it recently, or that the more expensive models are better built.  </li>
            <li>Again, yet another fault in what should by now be a mature product...</li>
            <li>Again, yet another fault in what should by now be a mature product...</li>
            <li>My old 6&#x27;s and now 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s,space between gum and teeth...</li>
            <li>If the top is the least bit off the hole, the water runs through and spills out on the bottom.</li>
            <li>and I decided to try and fix the old one</li>
            <li>I think I will rebuild my old one.</li>
            <li>Wore one out completely, and bought this replacement.</li>
            <li>The piping developed a leak in one</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re complete fans of the waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I am returning it and will continue to use my old one.  </li>
            <li>they are filled with out of the box failures, day one failures, failures after just a few days,  </li>
            <li>These devices remove so much food from between teeth and under gums - food that you thought you removed with regular brushing.  </li>
            <li>so using this at 10:00 pm or later, is really noisy to my family.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier; it does everything I wanted it to do; really like the big water reservoir!</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t last very long&lt;</li>
            <li>The two grommets just seemed naturally to connect.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are like a young person&#x27;s and I thank WaterPik for that.  </li>
            <li>It works well so far and dosn&#x27;t take up alot of space.</li>
            <li>Even with its noise and size, the 60W is far easier to use.  </li>
            <li>This was a replacement for a 8 year old unit.</li>
            <li>I bought this WaterPik WP-60W Water Flosser on line to replace my old WaterPik WP-60W water flosser which just died.</li>
            <li>The most common problem I encounter using this waterpik has to do with no water flow when the machine is not set on a level surface.  </li>
            <li>I had to go to bed bath &amp;beyond to get the real deal that would actually work.</li>
            <li>Despite negative reviews, I decided to give the waterpik a try, after an acquaintance insisted it was the better buy, and reliable.  </li>
            <li>works really well, much lighter and less noisy then older models.</li>
            <li>COMPLETELY INOPERATIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my old one blew the pump apart when the plastic got old (about 2.5 years) and it was a bear to get apart.</li>
            <li>So, how many times do we just suffer the idiosyncrasies, get used to the thing and hope it will last a few years??</li>
            <li>I had it for a full day -- just long enough to throw out my sales receipt, of course -- before the hose popped off the handle, shooting water all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>and it was difficult to handle and it needed to be refilled over and over for one good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>, quiet (no more pump to wake up the rest of the house!), efficient (doesn&#x27;t require counter top space or electricity), made in America and is very well-reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item is efficient and exactly the right size for a small family.</li>
            <li>My overall oral health has improved significantly since purchasing one of these and combined with regular dentist visits, daily brushing, flossing and Breath RX Anti-Bacterial Mouth Rinse, my gums are on their way to a complete recovery.</li>
            <li>This is my second of the same model, the original having lasted for ten years.  </li>
            <li>I decided to figure out a way to replace the original hose with off-brand hose and splice it onto the original hose below the wand with tube connectors and save myself a bundle by not having to pay Waterpik for a new hose/wand replacement kit and replacement tips, so I pulled the base unit apart to get to where the original hose connects directly to the pump inside</li>
            <li>not like it used to.&lt;br /&gt;Motor runs loud and the entire unit is considerably lighter than the older one</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and easy to store away without taking up a lot of space.recommend it to anyone who has dirty teeth.lol</li>
            <li>This is my first review of any product, and I don&#x27;t know where to start with this one.my first mistake was not reading the product reviews before purchase, I relied on previous waterpik units that I purchased over the years and never had any issues with the product but this unit not only stop working after three weeks</li>
            <li>I have used the WaterPik on a few occasions to clean a clogged Keurig Coffee Maker that was not pumping.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that bothers me is that the part of the water tube closest to the machine still raps away at the machine when it is being used at a particular angle; maybe they&#x27;ll have some tube extension that projects the tube away from the machine while in use would help.</li>
            <li>This older type of waterPik has the larger container and stronger pulse with compared to the newer type of Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Just bought the fourth one; first one lasted longer than later ones.</li>
            <li>WaterPik has long been a trusted name in care of teeth and gums, My dentist also suggested it&#x27;s use for my wife who has Parkinson&#x27;s and has trouble maintaining a healthy mouth.</li>
            <li>The main problem being the hoses crack after a short while.</li>
            <li>mid to high settings.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product - especially with the nasal irrigator attachment (purchased separately through a doctor&#x27;s office).</li>
            <li>It is still a good product, but it becomes increasingly inconvenient with each new iteration, and I think the market is ripe for the competition.      </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the water basin is blue since we have hard water and the clear plastic one would look rusty after a period of time.</li>
            <li>This particular water pik is powerful enough but I prefer the one I had previous to this where you can select the speed of the water from the pik.  </li>
            <li>And lastly, the only way you can close the Waterpik is by removing the pick every time; the top will not fit over the bottom otherwise.    </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>This product is very cheaply made in that it fails to return a reasonable value.  </li>
            <li>This is the only model that has a large enough water reservoir to get the job done without having to refill it.</li>
            <li>Charged power brushes take care if surfaces well, but not in between, however with two settings - we can get hard to reach areas easily.</li>
            <li>The most recent failure mode is the \\&quot;on-off\\&quot;  switch stopped working on my old wp-60w</li>
            <li>Yes, you need to begin with hot water; Yes, you need to make sure the tank is surely seated on the base; and Yes, you need to keep the pik in your mouth with your mouth closed and over the sink.  </li>
            <li>The little monster is loud, but hey, it has to create a lot of pressure from a teeny tiny motor, and I&#x27;m sure the short lifespan of 2-4 years is what keeps the price so low.  </li>
            <li>I put this into use new only 8 months ago.  </li>
            <li>I only use filtered water in it and it sill looks like new after a year os use.</li>
            <li>the rounded surfaces of the reservoir dry easier and protects the whole unit from dust when stored.</li>
            <li>Because this cleans so well, I now floss only twice a day (meaning I buy 2/3 less dental floss) and yet still have clean teeth and gums.    </li>
            <li>I bought another professional model for my son around the same time and it works well without a problem so far.</li>
            <li>handle is too thick to easily revolve the tip when using in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A big problem with Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet was that it has a smaller tank, so you have to stop and refill 3-4 times before you complete!!!.</li>
            <li>I have some pockets along my gum line that flossing and my Sonicare (which I love) just don&#x27;t clean well enough, making for some nasty breath and potential greater problems, but the Water Pik takes no prisoners.  </li>
            <li>So apparently, my previous personal dental hygiene--which included brushing, flossing, and irrigating six times per day (once after each meal)--wasn&#x27;t sufficient to keep my gumline free of irritants and to properly stimulate my gums.</li>
            <li>This little machine is useful.  </li>
            <li>I use this machine with a special nasal tip for allergy/sinus rinses and although it works well, the unit is not as heavy duty as the last WaterPik I owned.  </li>
            <li>Clearly this brand manufactures only trash</li>
            <li>It has become quite apparent to me that the plastics they are using to manufacture the hose has a chemical defect as it should last far longer than my 2.5 years and his 11 months.  </li>
            <li>To keep things as sanitary as possible, rinse the reservoir and run clear water through the machine if you&#x27;ve used mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>The only important item missing from this product is the sub-gingival tip, which apparently can only be purchased in sets of two.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the settings only produce a loud noise and no water.</li>
            <li>They only needed to be replaced when the hose developed a leak.</li>
            <li>How could there be such a difference in my old one &amp; the new?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And it Works very well and does not leak, and the motor sounds as expected.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s loud and the company stated that because it was purchase from a third party (amazon) they would not honor the warranty.</li>
            <li>This is a definite up grade form the old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same old WaterPik</li>
            <li>i bought this fom you and now 6 weeks or so later it doesnt pump water, i wish i had kept my old one instead to buying this one.  </li>
            <li>( You could tape it to your favorite position, or simply learn not to touch it while in use)A better design in my opinion would be to put the control on the base unit instead of the handle.</li>
            <li>I was afraid i would never get another that good.</li>
            <li>This is fine for me as I have limited space and did not want one so harsh.</li>
            <li>My current one, several years old, has finally burst the water feeder coil, and has a lot of miles on it, so I dropped in to get a new</li>
            <li>When my one unit burnt up I kept the opaque white reservoir and threw away the new blue one.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was that this version is quieter than previous WaterPiks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not perfect but it works better than the last one I had (that one held up much longer than I thought possible).</li>
            <li>The problem is that it is extremely hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, WATERPIK is responsible for the specifications on these products.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this latest failure occurred with the on-off switch failing in the on mode, so it really didn&#x27;t die, but it made using the water pik a bit inconvenient.</li>
            <li>and I had to fill it at least twice to get the amount of irrigation needed to get everything clean.</li>
            <li>B000ODV872 QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator w/ 36\\&quot; hose]], but it doesn&#x27;t allow you to use mouthwash, which is important if you&#x27;ve got serious gum problems.    </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by its performance, it was quiet and jet had enough force</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for what appeared to be the same model only about 5+ years old.  </li>
            <li>(For you old enough, remember when a box of Corn Flakes was actually affordable?)</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my old one which eventually wore out after several years of daily use.</li>
            <li>Yesterday, my newest WP-60 tube and handle finally broke down exactly like its predecessors.  </li>
            <li>When I first got the WP-600 (like way back on day one), I might have laid the wand down and noticed that water starts draining from it....  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as described maybe a little noisy</li>
            <li>WaterPik is the only brand that I have previously owned that I would be willing to buy again.  </li>
            <li>First, the resevoir does not fit over the unit with the irrigator tool in place after use.</li>
            <li>And while we are on the subject, they recently went to a clear blue reservoir on the Classic WaterPik.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this as a replacement of my previous unit which had become very noisy and produced an irregular stream.  </li>
            <li>This thing is definitely louder than your average bathroom accessory but no worse than the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I tried the higher setting as a test and can&#x27;t reproduce the bleeding gum problem that the WaterPik appears to have cured in a few weeks of regular use.    </li>
            <li>just ordered the ShowerBreeze w/ 6&#x27; hose by Oral Breeze which is inexpensive, convenient (you use it in the shower so no more mess to clean up!)</li>
            <li>And no more mess to clean up!</li>
            <li>The new one works very well, and I have only one complaint.</li>
            <li>Certain mouthwashes, or too concentrated a mouthwash solution, can destroy it.  </li>
            <li>I was not able to find this particular water pik in stores near me.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fits the counter perfectly.</li>
            <li> , I think it is the best of the products offered.  </li>

            <li> They provide excellent results.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> anyway so this was the perfect  solution for me.  </li>
            <li> The highest setting had excellent pressure.</li>
            <li> So I would still recommend buying, just keep wand in your mouth at all times until machine itself it turned off! :D</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  </li>

            <li> 1 being best</li>
            <li> Our dentist and is always impressed with the condition of our teeth.  </li>
            <li> Once you figure out how to best use the flosser, it&lt;br /&gt;isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This is food that non-WaterPik users leave in their mouth EVERY night when they go to sleep - providing an incredible smorgasbord for mouth borne bacteria !!!  </li>
            <li> Your mouth feels awesome and you want to do it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I know now, from reading today the excellent manual that comes with the Waterpik Model WP-900, that my Model WP-60W had a defective reservoir valve and the warranty would have covered replacing it.</li>
            <li> I used it with Dr. Grossan sinus irrigator, works great!!!!!</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I would happily recommend it to anyone.</li>

            <li> Now I&#x27;m set for another 20 years, LOL.</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>

            <li> We both use Listerine because my dentist recommended it (4 parts water to 1 part Listerine), and it removes food particles as well as makes the mouth taste great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Would make a great gift for anyone</li>
            <li> Great price.  </li>
            <li> and it still works great.</li>

            <li> Does a great job of flossing below the gum line.</li>
            <li> Great...</li>

            <li> great shoots like a lasor getting all the food between your teeth and gums wish had my headphones to jam</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li> This one does a great job it just doesn&#x27;t have a lot of options</li>
            <li> The WaterPik flosser has been a great addition to our dental hygene process.  </li>
            <li> It is not a substitute for flossing, but a great addition.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I use it twice a day and we find it very effective</li>
            <li> Very effective.  </li>
            <li> It works very effectively.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for bathroom sink top.</li>
            <li> All this is combined with the fact that many dentists recommend these devices as the best way to prevent and correct a number of oral hygiene</li>
            <li> It is the best thing since the toothbrush, better even than floss.  </li>
            <li> The best system for healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the best waterpik I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;ve bought many over the years.  </li>
            <li> i receive the items within 10 dys . satisfied with the shipment, received in very good condition.</li>
            <li> this is very easy to use and my son uses it!</li>
            <li> it makes you feel sparkling bright after using it.</li>
            <li> This product makes me feel good about my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Have to wiggle the two parts together to get a good seal</li>
            <li> I imagine the company would have made good on it</li>
            <li> Fair priced through Amazon.</li>
            <li> kind of soon review however for now is great.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to any one who needs a good water pik.</li>
            <li> The adjustable pressure flow is good.</li>
            <li> Good item.</li>
            <li> and we always get good dental checkup reports.</li>
            <li> This Water Pik system is superior in every way.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, it&#x27;s a good way to know from any room in the house that your kids are using the WaterPik . .</li>
            <li> Not as good quality as the one that I bought years ago.</li>
            <li> that somehow Waterpik had changed the design of their machine and messed up a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the wonders of Amazon</li>
            <li> I surveyed the prices and felt this was a good price for a quality product.</li>
            <li> it is so helpful and fair priced for every body to keep oral health, and save lots of dentist fee.</li>
            <li> This is a good product</li>
            <li> It was just as described and is of good quality.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is not as good as poast models.</li>
            <li> Works really good and hope to get allot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> From the time it was purchased, it has provided exceptional service.</li>
            <li> so it fits better on my counter and most of all it&lt;br /&gt;does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> Works great and better price than in-store.</li>
            <li> It is attractive and helps maintain healthy gums.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased .</li>
            <li> This one is rounded on the sides - cute and, granted, it works great -</li>
            <li> I LOVE my WP-600 and have already gotten three or four years of great service out of it.  </li>
            <li> Dentist said my gums were very healthy.</li>
            <li> WaterPik works great and flushes most of the food from pockets in gum.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Water Pik.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this item at a great price and it was delivered pronto.</li>
            <li> I think that explains why WaterPik has cut so many corners making this thing--no competition!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Until I find a better alternative, I guess I will keep replacing them rather than risk losing teeth!</li>
            <li> I have been using for so many years is now being called a Water Flosser!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Sure, its 89 decibals, vibrates like a banshee and squirts all over the bathroom (until you become expert), but let&#x27;s not quibble!  </li>
            <li> This is an easy to use and great tool for dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> based on price, it was a great bargain and works fine.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, in fact great, getting the smallest food particles from your teeth.</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nozzles don&#x27;t fit great.  </li>
            <li> Amazing how effective this spouting water cleans between the teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hope this is really as effective as flossing...</li>
            <li> I have always liked the WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> Nice, neat ritual for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have the kind of teeth where I literally don&#x27;t dare be  without this product.  </li>
            <li> The WaterPik cleans my teeth and gums effectively.  </li>
            <li> This one is not as handy to turn on, handle or adjust.</li>
            <li> She is thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> After some adjustment I can honestly say I like the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t seem to have that kind of luck -</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it had a lid.  </li>
            <li> and Amazon had a good price on it, for sure.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the excellent service.</li>
            <li> and I found that to be nice.</li>
            <li> Use warm water.</li>
            <li> There are replacement hose kits sold for this model, so that is a help for a handy person.</li>
            <li> and I use it in my apt at three in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was told that since I add Listerine I need to rinse the machine withy warm water after I use it.</li>
            <li> Is Waterpik really the best way to go?</li>
            <li> It is effective.</li>
            <li> The water Pik was very good and is an excellent tool to preventing  tooth decay  and other mouth problems.</li>
            <li> The original is still working great after 10 plus years.  </li>
            <li> WaterPik has always been an excellent product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> operates perfect helps clean teeth efficiently and clean tongue satisfactory .</li>
            <li> Waterpik, the easy way to good breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This waterpik gets the job done and so very easy to use.</li>
            <li> To ensure a successful insertion of the repair hose kit coupler, the original hose should be flexible with no indications of cracking or splitting when flexed.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The unit works fine and has a good range of pressure controls.  </li>
            <li> waterpik delivered in good time and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Always waterpik before bedtime and keep your own teeth in your head for many years.</li>
            <li> Mine comes with two tips so my wife can share the unit as well making it even more cost effective.</li>
            <li> It does a nice, refreshing job of cleaning the teeth and gums.    </li>
            <li> So far mine is perfect.   </li>
            <li> A WaterPik is in no way a substitue for brushing and flossing, but it is the perfect adjunct for complete oral health care.</li>
            <li> Found this on Amazon and it&#x27;s a perfect replacement for my old one.  </li>
            <li> If you buy a Waterpik product, best to use a brick &amp; mortar retailer near your home that you can return the product to for warranty replacement.</li>
            <li> use it when we need to with great success.</li>
            <li> This one is just perfect as the spray volume is easily adjustable and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love my Waterpik!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my WaterPik!  </li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it!</li>
            <li> This device will really flush out the stuff from between your teeth, and scrub your tounge in a most pleasant way!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original one I bought but does the job.  </li>
            <li> It is able to help keep your teeth clean!!</li>
            <li> I think it also more powerful and does a great job.</li>
            <li> It works great, and the price is very reasonable, compared to the product of Sonnicare.  </li>
            <li> Love love love love love it!</li>
            <li> Ours broke after a couple of years of very light use.  </li>
            <li> Effective at a lower pressure, easy to assemble and disassemble and easier to use.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s overdesigned --- who needs to know how many milliliters of water you&#x27;re using?  </li>
            <li> Many of the inconveniences of the \\&quot;Personal\\&quot; model have been eliminated in the Ultra:  </li>
            <li> The regular &amp; tongue cleaning tip are excellent.  </li>
            <li> It should be more repairable.  </li>
            <li> so it collects dust on top</li>
            <li> I tend to agree that the hose should be more flexible and should be another 6\\&quot; longer.</li>
            <li> Even more than my toothbrush, I rely on my WaterPik</li>
            <li> The tongue cleaner worked OK</li>
            <li> I have been using a WaterPik for many years.  </li>
            <li> I wish I bought this thing many years ago, would have saved a lot of dentist bills.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my WaterPik.</li>
            <li> See the tub up on top where the water goes?</li>
            <li> The latest one leaks water</li>
            <li> Curved syringes did okay, but I felt that it didn&#x27;t quite get everything out of there.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a system I had had for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> It has also helped me to have healthy gums.</li>
            <li> It lifted my cap off. :-)</li>
            <li> We have been using waterpiks for many years.</li>
            <li> and it was ok</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Works great, really flushes out all the food that flossing and brushing misses.</li>
            <li> This unit replaces one that wore out after many years.</li>
            <li> Always leaves water on counter top</li>
            <li> am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> the results were outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t needed more than routine cleaning in 15 years.</li>
            <li> Love Waterpik</li>
            <li> I wish the design was more like the WP-100 though.</li>
            <li> Anyway, all that said, it&#x27;s probably the best unit out there if you&#x27;re looking for a powerful unit that will really remove the food particles from between your teeth.</li>
            <li> So if you have someone sleeping close by it can surely wake them.  </li>
            <li> Product works as advertised and am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Have used  waterpik for more years that I care to admit.</li>
            <li> Great to find a replacement online at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> this is an excellent replacement for the one that I had for years and finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> Have been using WaterPik for more than 10 years since scare requiring visit to periodentist.  </li>
            <li> Cleans nicely, love it</li>
            <li> The person for whom I purchased this item seems to be satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> enou7gh to leave on the counter top.</li>
            <li> I love my waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Waterpik products for 25 years and have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remarkable the amount of food particles removed by the Waterpik, even after first thoroughly brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and price.</li>
            <li> I like most everything about it except for the water canister.</li>
            <li> I had an Interplak system and was never quite satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> can I be sure that the head is well seated?&lt;br /&gt;Head</li>
            <li> This unit dribbles water from hand piece(wand) and water runs out of the rubber fitting of the reserve tank.</li>
            <li> I spend more time cleaning up water than cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love my two hoses. . .  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love the WaterPik WP-600</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love the WaterPik WP-600</li>
            <li> We have used WaterPik products for many years and have never had any complaints about any of them.</li>
            <li> As described and more</li>
            <li> Spend a bit more and get the WP-900.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> (See my review of the WP-900 here on Amazon for more information: http://amzn.to/172qNDN).</li>
            <li> Glad to have it... will order more , when in need.</li>
            <li> to try them one more time.</li>
            <li> Oxyjet is your better bet.</li>
            <li> Better than flossing.  </li>
            <li> Keeps those gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bulky, it tips, and I love it.</li>
            <li> For many months my wife has had problems of things sticking between two of her teeth.  </li>
            <li> We love this thing.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it &amp; glad he did those many years ago.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more efficient and quieter than the one I replaced.  </li>
            <li> Wish it were more convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> When I get home I will have to find a more reliable replacement.</li>
            <li> A towel underneath dampens most of the ruckus.</li>
            <li> and I love it better than flossing.</li>
            <li> so when it breaks I will most deffinately upgrade.</li>
            <li> I love it,</li>
            <li> Sincerely  Rosette</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one which had been used for many years.  </li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> So glad I switched to Oral Breeze.</li>
            <li> We have been pleased with the improvement in the health of our gums since using this product.  </li>
            <li> In between my dentist visits, I like to keep my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> The WaterPik flosser helps to keep my gums and teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> Just love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than flossing if you have crowns.</li>
            <li> Buy it you will love it.  </li>
            <li> and it works real good to get those back teeth that dental floss sometimes won&#x27;t get to.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> The basin for the water is the right amount of water for one good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Those relatively small problems make this product a very good value and does a great job at cleaning the gums and teeth..</li>
            <li> It works very well, is easy to use and is attractive and efficent.  </li>
            <li> I have had water pik&#x27;s before and everyone I&#x27;ve had has been pretty good including this one.</li>
            <li> My old Waterpik is now working beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The good news: the Pikheads were willing to replace it with a phone call.</li>
            <li> Works great, new like said, recommend seller</li>
            <li> This new model is lighter, but still pumps great</li>
            <li> I bought it to keep my implants clean and realized I should have had gotten one years ago!</li>
            <li> can clean industrial parts quite well!  </li>
            <li> For the low cost of the unit assuming it lasts 2 years, it is a great deal to keep your teeth and gum healthy to avoid much more costly bills from the dentists, even if you have dental insurance.</li>
            <li> -what knowing that there are better models available.</li>
            <li> The WP-100 is better looking, if you care about those kind of things (we do), and it&#x27;s much quieter, as well as a bit heavier, so it feels better built, and probably adds to the quieter design.</li>
            <li> I find that it does a good job of cleaning between my teeth, but I then tend to forget to floss, which is probably not a good idea, and using this and flossing is the best idea.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so good to really get all those pockets in the gums cleaned out again.</li>
            <li> waterpik is very functional, good pressure and irrigates under crowns well.</li>
            <li> The WP-60 has proven very satisfactory - easy to use; easy to clean; very effective.  </li>
            <li> I have to constantly clean it to make sure mildew or mold does not form.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, lean over sink, let the water pour out of your mouth instead of splash on the mirror.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The slider switch on the handle which controls the speed/strength can easily be moved inadvertently during use.</li>
            <li> If WaterPik had a great product, charged $150 or more, would consumers come back...</li>
            <li> It is compact, easy to use and stows away under the sink easily.  </li>
            <li> wire and hose tangle easy.  </li>
            <li> A refreshing way to clean between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for getting your mouth clean, and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to use it without spraying the bathroom, but when you get used to it, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and I am amazed at how it removes excess food from my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and gets the job done that I expect.</li>
            <li> easily . . .  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of creative ways you can use a water jet to clean things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are a lot of creative ways you can use a water jet to clean things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is working as intended and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> have found it easy to use and it seems to do its job.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and fulfills all expectations.</li>
            <li> It easily fits beneath the shelf below the vanity mirror when the cover is in the storage position.  </li>
            <li> easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> (I found a customer review that explained how easy that is to do).</li>
            <li> It easily beats the WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill with water and remove water.</li>
            <li> At the lowest setting the stream is strong...</li>
            <li> - still runs strong, doesn&#x27;t leak,</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend it to anyone&#x27;s dental care.</li>
            <li> At full power, the WaterPik is quite vigorous, and I&#x27;d guess that anyone with any gum issues would not be able to tolerate it.</li>
            <li> I liked it better when it was on the main body</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to use, does the job  quickly and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik for several decades now, and while the effectiveness of the product -- excellent for oral irrigation and toughening the gums -- has been consistent, the design and quality of the product have faltered.  </li>
            <li> I like it fine</li>
            <li> Product works fine</li>
            <li> The product is light weight, easy to use and does a thorough job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought a WaterPik in about 1963, and it ran fine till about 2001, when the pump wore out.  </li>
            <li> but it attaches fine to the WP60.</li>
            <li> Mid-power works just fine for me, so that&#x27;s what I use.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems the motor is fine...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Oral Breeze Shower Breeze for about a week and a half now and am very impressed.</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate, and it is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> The product was received quickly and I am satisfied with my purchasing experience.</li>
            <li> It works really well, and now that I have it, I&#x27;m glad that I never have to use and/or buy string floss anymore!</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t know was there is a huge difference in irrigators (dental water jets).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheap dental insurance</li>
            <li> Whenever you open the case, they fly out, and I have to retrieve them from the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It is always amazing how much food gets embeded between the teeth that the toothbrush even an electric toothbrush does not remove.</li>
            <li> All units cannot be repaired and have no replaceable parts reasonably available.  </li>
            <li> it is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> Works fantastic.</li>
            <li> WP-600 has several great features . . .  </li>
            <li> so cheaply made I must replace or repair it every 3 years.  </li>
            <li> It gave great service, but finally its motor quit.</li>
            <li> I try light solugion of bleach and waterr.</li>
            <li> it easy to clean- and store away-</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I can be rather crafty when I want to be, so</li>
            <li> The stream is more powerful</li>
            <li> Paid $35 for a months use of a crummy, cheap device.  </li>
            <li> My guess is that they, like a lot of manufacturers have skimped on quality and went for cheap.  </li>
            <li> This time I went to the WaterPik site and found their most economical model</li>
            <li> The water pick replaced my old one and it is just as good as the one that I used for almost 20 years.  </li>
            <li> There is no doubt the WaterPik is far more effective than its predecessor.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT SO FAR, SEEMS TO BE DOING A GOOD JOB.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great, is compact and is the top quality I expected from WaterPik.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the new one I just got from Amazon.</li>
            <li> We actually use it with a special tip for nasal rinsing and it works great</li>
            <li> With twice-daily use I don&#x27;t expect it live more than a couple more years, which frankly is a great bargain if I can avoid an oral surgeon or more fillings due to receding gums.    </li>
            <li> This unit did a fantastic job of keeping the extraction site nice and clean and free of infection, not to mention allowing me to eat normally after my oral surgery, not just ice cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I love this product very much.</li>
            <li> The best, AAA+++  Don&#x27;t buy the small portable unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever owned, it is quite addictive,and I love it...  </li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the reviews since they are not wrong.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, my gums bled quite a bit, but they don&#x27;t any more.</li>
            <li> I would have like a lid on the top like the first water pik</li>
            <li> The item was in its original package and arrived with no visible damage.  </li>
            <li> My gums are in very good shape thanks to daily use.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old waterpik (which lasted many many years)</li>
            <li> Just wipe it off or use a scrub brush rinsed under the faucet to keep the nooks and crannys clean.</li>
            <li> When I got brace, my orthodontist recommended one of these machine to keep my teeth and gum clean.</li>
            <li> GETS MY TEETH AND GUMS CLEAN AND DISLODGES FOOD PARTICLES.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality of this water pik/ flosser and its not as loud as my former one.</li>
            <li> Your mouth feels really clean.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel really clean after all this effort.</li>
            <li> you will see all kinds of food particles pouring out of what you thought was a sparkly clean mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve usedthe water jet to clean the nooks and crannies in my humidifier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the WaterPik to clean crevices on all kinds of devices.  </li>
            <li> the water jet to clean the nooks and crannies in my humidifier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the WaterPik to clean crevices on all kinds of devices.  </li>
            <li> I floss every day but don&#x27;t seem to feel totally clean.  </li>
            <li> My order was filled and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice strong jet -- I use the strongest setting as my gums remain strong with regular waterpik use.  </li>
            <li> The adjustment is better on this one than the older models as it is more nuanced and you can dial up a very soft spray or one that will really hurt your gums if they&#x27;re not in good shape.</li>
            <li> I just got a replacement, so hopefully this one works right!  </li>
            <li> this has a lot of power, enough to clean really good between teeth.</li>
            <li> We have two children in braces and really needed a better way to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband liked this pick so much that when the first one wore out I had to find a replacement for him.</li>
            <li> The second was that I had never had a home cleaning that was so good.  </li>
            <li> I use warm water for the resevoir since it can bring discomfort to my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is only about $35-40 more than this model, and it is light years more value for the money.</li>
            <li> It is only about $35-40 more than this model, and it is light years more value for the money.</li>
            <li> My dentist also tells me that I&#x27;ve good oral hygiene after using the waterpik in addition to regular brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li> Nice update to the old.</li>
            <li> It really keeps the gums healthy and cured my gingivitis.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many WaterPik&#x27;s - they are very functional in cleaning debris from between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> it shouldn&#x27;t-but after 10 years of using it, hey, not bad.  </li>
            <li> Reason being, it is too easy to move to a higher pressure while \\&quot;water picking\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have had a WaterPik like this for many yearsthat worked fine until it developed a leak.  </li>
            <li> It leave my mouth feel fresh and clean after brushing the teeth as well.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not complaining because the WaterPik lasted well over the 2 year warranty and keeps my gums and teeth fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> The Ultra has a much smaller footprint, the jet is positioned better, and it has a top to cover the reservoir when not in use.  </li>
            <li> The tank empties quick so plan on a refill.</li>
            <li> The amount of food that these devices remove AFTER you&#x27;ve already brushed, flossed, and rinsed, is nothing short of amazing !!!</li>
            <li> I was extremely lucky that it did not cause a fire.  </li>
            <li> Helps tremendously with gums.</li>
            <li> the older you get, the more you need to pay attention to oral health.</li>
            <li> I began using the Waterpik many years ago and highly recommended it to anyone who would listen.  </li>
            <li> When gripping the nozzle I found myself accidentally disconnecting it because my fingers were too high.  </li>
            <li> Really helps keep my teeth clean!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve had and the dentist reported that my gums are much better than since my last visit and the hygenist was happy too.</li>
            <li> I get good numbers on the gum measurements at each exam, so this issue has just been a \\&quot;keep an eye on it\\&quot; thing for a long time.</li>
            <li> Keeps breath nice and clean with daily use.  </li>
            <li> The quality is great, Amazon beats all prices hands down.</li>
            <li> Love this product, can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> I love my new waterpik</li>
            <li> It is very noisy and you easily spray water all over using it.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the same item (brand, device) I have owned for 4-5 years, it sure seems to be a &amp;#34;light-weight&amp;#34; version!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This model is pretty, to boot!</li>
            <li> Only wish that they had included more than !</li>
            <li> Great enginering, design and craftmanship; works great every day; but I had to throw away a travel size \\&quot;Waterpick\\&quot; after 18 months, because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Any more forceful setting than the lowest setting is too strong, i.e., probably has the potential to damage gingiva.  </li>
            <li> Dentists have recommended digitally (finger) rubbing my gums as a remedy, but I&#x27;ve never been able to stick with it--too easy to invoke the gag reflex.</li>
            <li> not as strong as I expected even at highest setting, runs quiet, pretty effective, gets  way more stuff out from between teeth than regular floss, quite happy with product.</li>
            <li> Buy it if you are interested in keeping your teeth and gums clean or if someone you know has recommended it.  </li>
            <li> We have been using this type of waterpic for years, It&#x27;s amazing what a regular toothbruch will miss</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a Waterpik water flosser since 2006, and I am hugely grateful to Waterpik for how much it has improved the health of my gums.</li>
            <li> (I learned setting it on a towell helps to immobilize it, and quiet it a bit, which is good because I&#x27;ll also have a towell ready in case</li>
            <li> But, it is definately worth wiping up some water for how well it cleans.</li>
            <li> Okay it&#x27;s not quite that loud.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once, and love it so far.  </li>
            <li> Has more pressure then old one</li>
            <li> This water flosser has so far worked well and is more powerful and effective than the hand-held.</li>
            <li> It makes my whole mouth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> ( I squirted myself in the face a couple of times) but is worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I lost my extra tips years ago &amp; the storage inside the lid on the ultra seems like it&#x27;ll be a nice feature.      </li>
            <li> but it is well worth it for the</li>
            <li> The recommended replacement interval for these Jet Tips is 6 months, but I don&#x27;t replace them if they are still working--the point at which the Jet Tip needs to be replaced is when water dribbles through it instead of in a strong, steady stream, or it won&#x27;t stay seated in place in the Waterpik handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have had a WaterPik for many years and my old one wore out.</li>
            <li> After has been fixed, everything was ok again.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I know, they&#x27;ve been around for years and set the standard and made it popular</li>
            <li> I liked the clear water holder better than the blue color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked using the WaterPik flosser especially for my gums.  </li>
            <li> To be very honest, I only post negative experiences with products since it is my belief that when one purchases a product good quality should be a given.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, I&#x27;m certain (as is my dentist) that it has prevented significant gum disease that otherwise would have occurred.  </li>
            <li> He loves it and says the pressure is great and this really works well compared to other water pik&#x27;s</li>
            <li> No so good for travel due to the size, but because the tank makes it self enclosed it keeps things together.</li>
            <li> yeah right)?  </li>
            <li> friend bought me this model as a replacement, and right away I noticed a couple of things I didn&#x27;t like:  </li>
            <li> He was right.</li>
            <li> and I used it right away...</li>
            <li> never worked right</li>
            <li> A new user will need to start at a lower setting, which is easy to do right on the handle.</li>
            <li> makes it much easier to clean and store.</li>
            <li> Quick, quiet and more powerful at a lower setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to use and has really helped reduce the number of infections I used to have.  </li>
            <li> Really, there is nothing you can buy on the market for $40 that pumps from 5 psi to 80 psi, cool.  </li>
            <li> The minor design improvements are good ones and all the old tried and true features remain.  </li>
            <li> Smooth new machine.</li>
            <li> Teledyne, the new owner of the brand, said no replacement parts were available.  </li>
            <li> that is until it happened again to the new one I bought, fortunately I caught that one before it burnt up.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is about 50% more in cost, it is worth it to me (despite the blue reservoir, which doesn&#x27;t match any of my countertop accessories).</li>
            <li> Not as easy to attach tip as old one and have to remove tip to invert reservoir when not using the system.</li>
            <li> This one ran okay till a few weeks ago, when it lost its ability to provide pulses of water at more than one setting.  </li>
            <li> Not that such bleeding is a good thing, but its importance will be clear in a moment.</li>
            <li> This one works just fine; don&#x27;t like the speed handle as well as the old one.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a lot more money to buy new tips and a new hose/wand and why not just go all out and buy another, newer model Waterpik</li>
            <li> but after a really good brushing, watching those impacted little food particles floating into the sink with the water spray keeps me using it......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to make a good seal when installing the water container after filling it.</li>
            <li> Because I liked the original I expected to like the new one.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought off of Amazon, the supplier said contact the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I had it assembled and ready to go, as per the instructions, it leaked everywhere!  </li>
            <li> First of all, instead of two \\&quot;picks,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The first one worked for two years.</li>
            <li> It is a cheesy contraption at best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It has always done exactly what the literature and instructions said it would.  </li>
            <li> This is the third WaterPik I have purchased and love this one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item 4 years ago and used it consistently for 1 year.</li>
            <li> and it would be more practical to have 2 regular tips in there.  </li>
            <li> Probably to make more money but to buy 1 replacement regular tip is pricey, about $11.  </li>
            <li> I think scrubbing the tongue with a regular toothbrush with toothpaste gets better results.</li>
            <li> my mouth was sore at the higher pressure levels.</li>
            <li> Be aware if you are a foreigner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gladly buy a better brand if one existed, but to my knowledge, WaterPik are the only ones making such a machine.</li>
            <li> The product functions works exactly as product description.</li>
            <li> I bought my first WaterPik ages ago, maybe for college?  </li>
            <li> I can only speculate that the designer and/or manufacturer intended it for a species with more durable gingiva than mine.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Water Pik in about 1970 at the recommendation of my dentist at that time.  </li>
            <li> In more recent years they have not allowed us to get hose parts and repair this ourselves.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the last generation.</li>
            <li> With regular use expect stronger gums and healthy dental check-ups.  </li>
            <li> Better than leaving the head of the wand stored outside the machine.</li>
            <li> Plastic hose came off handle first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product and works as I expected,  I love this one because you can use the different setting on it to manage the amount of water that comes out.  </li>
            <li> Work better than the last model I had.  </li>
            <li> My mouth felt cleaner and healthier again after the first use.  </li>
            <li> When I went to use it the first time it leaked and no water would come through the hose at all.  </li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small..... perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> I think a waterpik is necessary to keep teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> The last one lasted many years (ten or more, I no longer remember when we bought it)</li>
            <li> After going through three portable units from Waterpic in two years, two of the units I repaired multiple times, I decided to go with the plug-in unit, which for some foolish reason I though might be more durable.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my first WaterPik in the mid-sixties.  </li>
            <li> The most recent one lasted about two years before the plastic tube broke.  </li>
            <li> Rinse handle in hot water after use to keep sanitary.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> That first one was a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not difficult to do</li>
            <li> All in all, I think it&#x27;s doing its job and pretty well at that.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> This time, I got what I wanted on first try from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid user of Water-pik dental sprayers.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted and could not find anywhere else</li>
            <li> During my semi-annual dental cleaning and exams, I sometimes had the same minor gum bleeding that I experienced upon first use of the WaterPik.</li>
            <li> so many different models.  </li>
            <li> I can use my WaterPik in about a quarter of the time it takes me to use regular floss, and it does a more thorough job.  </li>
            <li> My first WaterPik lasted about 10 years.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble flossing and this product seemed to be a good solution.  </li>
            <li> I mix peroxide with the water and it wastes a fair amount of the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit flimsy, is far too large and isn&#x27;t that easy to remove and reset.</li>
            <li> You have to purchase the Sinupulse Elite Replacement Sinus Irrigator Tip to use with it, but this is much more cost effective than purchasing more expensive models and just getting one use!  </li>
            <li> Please revert back to \\&quot;the good old days\\&quot; when you made a decent product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, once or twice a week focusing on gum line, caps or any other type of dental apparatus works so well the dentist commends me at every visit on my amazing dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> This product, although poorly constructed, did a good job while it lasted!</li>
            <li> (Perhaps it helps if you point out, as I did, that if the problem of the hose detaching is common enough to warrant a topic on their customer support page, perhaps they might engineer a more effective solution!)  </li>
            <li> I bought this brand because I was very well satisfied and comfortable using the my previous unit.</li>
            <li> I got braces as an adult, and wore them for two plus years; Water-pik made my mouth feel somewhat clean during that time.</li>
            <li> Finally, the cord is stored wound around the bottom of the unit, and has no clip or anything to keep it in place, so once wound and ready to replace in its storage place, one must have one hand around the top and bottom - to keep everything inside from opening and flying apart, and one hand on the wound cord, to keep it from unwinding and dangling after you as you take it to its storage place.    </li>
            <li> So overall, it&#x27;s a good product that doesn&#x27;t have any competitor to equal the value.</li>
            <li> Kind of important because the strongest degree is quite harsh &amp; feels as if it could drill a hole in soft tissue!  </li>
            <li> I know the outlet is good since I can ( and DO ) regularly plug in a vacuum sweeper that draws around 10 Amps.</li>
            <li> Apparently a \\&quot;handle replacement kit\\&quot; is available from the manufacturer, and I have inquired how I might order one.  </li>
            <li> you don;t mind using for other things, the WaterPik actually works great in a number of cleaning situation.  </li>
            <li> Doing so results in the mixture bubbling up, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;However, with my older unit, I had no problem lining up the rubber grommet on the bottom of the tub with the grommet on top of the pump mechanism, even though that tub was white opaque plastic.</li>
            <li> My first impression after using this thing reminded me of being given enemas as a child --- sure you felt cleansed when it&#x27;s over but is it worth the mess.</li>
            <li> The hose appears to be affixed more securely to the handle, but I am still using my first unit, as I devised a simple but effective solution while Waterpik was making their move: just by wrapping a length of Scotch plastic tape around the detached hose, you increase the circumference of the hose enough to make a snug fit with the little white plastic collar tucked in the handle where the hose attaches.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with my new WaterPik, but the old one had a less cumbersome swivel on the hand flosser.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive gums and often times when I floss or brush my gums bleed.</li>
            <li> This 70 model is quiet and sends out quite a strong jet of water.</li>
            <li> Certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li> The wand handle must be positioned \\&quot;just so.\\&quot; and there is no cover for the large tank.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t send in the warranty because I trusted the WaterPik name and certainly the Ultra couldn&#x27;t be problematic.</li>
            <li> This is our 3rd Waterpik, first one, decades old, works better.</li>
            <li> I have been using WaterPik for many years, I&#x27;ve just purchased a new replacement at age 80 and a dentist recently asked me if I had just had my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> All they asked was the serial number and sent me a brand new one right away.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used my new WaterPik very much--no more than 50 times--and the last time I tried to detach the jet tip from the hose, it broke off at the end.  </li>
            <li> As I am high maintenance when it comes to my dental work, this product is exactly what I have needed.</li>
            <li> I believe wearing out after five years is fair, given the hard water in my area.</li>
            <li> For the same price, you will get two years from a device which, no matter how hard you brush, will kick surprising amounts of crud from between your teeth, can be filled with mouthwash to kill halitosis sources from between your teeth, virtually stops gum bleeding (me) with use 3x a week, and (bonus)</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m done, I know I&#x27;ve done everything possible to keep my teeth happy and firmly connected to the rest of me.</li>
            <li> dentist informed me he used Waterpik and his gums really responded.........</li>
            <li> The real difficulty is that there&#x27;s no way to repair these units.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of the rubber tipped ortho pik since water trickled through it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the pump is working but is very noisey.</li>
            <li> The stream of water it puts out is very powerfull and \\&quot;Piks\\&quot; up where brushing and flossing leave off.</li>
            <li> No one else wants to make them.</li>
            <li> Its price is reasonable for its class.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked on my Pik, despite its flaws, because it really finishes up a teeth cleaning job.  </li>
            <li> On the whole, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> unit is much quieter</li>
            <li> Thanks Water Pik</li>
            <li> It is VERY noisy.  </li>
            <li> and it is very helpful to me.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say eough about how much this product has changed my life.</li>
            <li> It does what it is designed for very well.</li>
            <li> I am fed up with these cheaply built plastic gizmos that are flooding the market and don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I bought this WaterPik for my sister who really uses it all of the time</li>
            <li> I bought it to use with the Waterpik Gentle Sinus Rinse attachment.</li>
            <li> Powerful jetting action for getting to those problem areas.</li>
            <li> tried to open the handle to replace the cheap plastic tube that goes from the pump to the handle.  </li>
            <li> Once open, I found, as I expected, the cheap plastic tube had cracked, thereby leaking most of the water into my hand when I used it.  </li>
            <li> There seems not to be much of a choice in the marketplace just now.</li>
            <li> Really does the job.</li>
            <li> The unit accomplished its purpose of cleaning between teeth.   </li>
            <li> After being without one for awhile and complaining about how much we missed it, we thought we&#x27;d buy one again.  </li>
            <li> The waterpik works very well at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> it has too much pressure</li>
            <li> However, I am very pissed that I am REQUIRED to justify any purchase that I make.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It has not happened since, however I am very cautious about as it is my opinion that the switch has an issue.    </li>
            <li> The thing I found rather ironic</li>
            <li> It really helps with sinus washes/  </li>
            <li> It more than expected meets my needs.  </li>
            <li> Pollen season is on us and our water pik is really helping.,</li>
            <li> The Water Flosser is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very noisy product.</li>
            <li> thank you for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This cleans between teeth very well.</li>
            <li> This waterpik really helps.  </li>
            <li> and I really needed a waterpik.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave one to my nephew for his birthday and he really needed one because he has braces.</li>
            <li> It works really well cleaning under my bridge.</li>
            <li> I really like it that they never change much.</li>
            <li> They are very helpful.</li>
            <li> Makes fast work of the job.  </li>
            <li> Very noisy.</li>
            <li> It makes both of our lives much easier.</li>
            <li> The blue bowl that sits on top of the unit holds all the water I need for one complete use.</li>
            <li> Whenever you feel sensitivity of any kind between teeth or especially on gum line, just keep irrigating it daily with a capful of mouthwash or hydrogen peroxide added to the water.</li>
            <li> I own TWO of these units, which are model WP-65W, essentially the very same unit as the 60W.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three different models and this seems to be the most reliable and durable so far.  </li>
            <li> It actually works better than the old one ever did.</li>
            <li> This unit is much smaller than the old style and convieniently slts on the vanity, Pressure is adjustible and I love the way it makes my move feel.</li>
            <li> I had some bleeding the first couple times I used it, but now that&#x27;s stopped and I even think the most troublesome pocket may be holding less debris.  </li>
            <li> High capacity reservoir, variable pressure settings, temporary pressure shut off on the hand-held  wand, extremely easy to clean, simple &amp; straight-forward almost fool-proof operation, etc.  </li>
            <li> The first was how loud it was!  </li>
            <li> There is nothing better for cleaning around crowns, braces and other dental work.  </li>
            <li> The other models are so much better than this one.</li>
            <li> (1-31-2013)  Like so many others, I will proclaim that oral irrigation is extremely beneficial to your health, blasting out rotting food particles, plaque and bacteria from places your toothbrush, floss and rinse can&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a grat product to deep clean your gum.</li>
            <li> I recently had my wisdom teeth out, and had issues keeping the sockets clean of debris.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only way my mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li> The older models are much louder.  </li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t feel clean enough.  </li>
            <li> Good strong flush between teeth and under gums from outside and from behind gums every night before bed.</li>
            <li> A very handy supplement to regular flossing, gets into the gum pockets but I am not sure it does the whole job between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Waterpik expected the hose to stay on the handle in the first place; it looks like it must have been secured with spit -- or prayers -- as there is no tape or gromit of any kind to secure it.  </li>
            <li> My only displeasure is that after about 5 or 6 years the vinyl plastic hose will split and it&#x27;s not really cost effective, or easy to replace the hose, essentially forcing the purchase of a new unit, but hey, nothing lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an engineer, but I think a few little snap-in devices or hinged clips would make me much more enthusiastic about using it.</li>
            <li> It is a little larger (takes up more space) than other models but has good storage and the tank covers everything.</li>
            <li> and I used it for more than 5 years with no trouble but a single disruption in the hose.  </li>
            <li> It just kind of wobbles up there with a small gasket around the hole in the bottom where the water is fed into the motor.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was surprised for two reasons.  </li>
            <li> so I set it about halfway on two because full open can cause my gums to bleed.  </li>
            <li> My first Waterpik, purchased in the early 1970s for sensitive gums on the recommendation of my dentist, lasted far longer than my more recent purchases.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, I thought the motor had come loose and that the unit was beginning to full apart.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first one from the oral surgeon who recommended I use it for general oral hygiene and specifically because I had large gum pockets around some of my molars.</li>
            <li> INCREDIBLE improvement......a little  messy with the water,</li>
            <li> then I would have had to buy a whole new unit rather than just a hose.  </li>
            <li> This one is not as elaborate as the one I previously had</li>
            <li> If not, your machine has a lifetime of at most a year, and probably less.</li>
            <li> The older WaterPiks used to scoot across our granite countertop.</li>
            <li> I have had an older version of this WaterPic for about 20 years and it worked till 1/1/11.</li>
            <li> I am especially dependant on Water Pik for a good cleaning of the few dental food pockets that I have.  </li>
            <li> All of the negative issues already posted, such as the motor seizing, have been experienced by me.</li>
            <li> I did not exchange this one because it was a cheaper model than my older one</li>
            <li> I personally would rather pay more up front for a well-made product that will last 10 to 20 years (like they used to) than buy something that is</li>
            <li> I have found that the second level is more than enough.</li>
            <li> But.... It was very short lived, as the tubing leading to the pic began leaking--then quickly lost all function.  </li>
            <li> although I wish now I had spent the extra $20 to get the deluxe model.</li>
            <li> Set-up was simple and quick.  </li>
            <li> Well, it still makes a loud racket, tries to skate around the counter top, and leaks water through the hand held device, but it no longer pumps water through.  </li>
            <li> The filled reservoir fits loosely onto the top, so that sometimes you don&#x27;t have it properly in place, and you have to \\&quot;fiddle\\&quot; with it to get it properly seated or</li>
            <li> The amount of water that squirted through the normal tip at low pressure was more than necessary</li>
            <li> The only problem is the water tank does not fit on easily, but or else it is fine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone who doesn&#x27;t have one</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if having problem with bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> The reason being, that while it looks pretty in the short term, clear plastic SCRATCHES where the white is easily cleaned of lime deposits without visible scratching and will maintain its appearance for the life of the unit.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the clever storage for the tubing on my new one.</li>
            <li> I love it, but each one I&#x27;ve owned had to be replaced because the little tubing ends up breaking and seemingly can&#x27;t be repaired.</li>
            <li> Hoping that as it is used more it may work a little smoother.</li>
            <li> The other problem is the power stream adjustment is on the pic so it can easily be moved.</li>
            <li> Brush your teeth and floss using your usual routine and rinse with your favorite mouthwash - get your teeth as clean as you possibly can ., . .  </li>
            <li> Kind of hard to snap on and off.  </li>
            <li> Also, I get a stronger cleaning stream due to the house&#x27;s strong water pressure.</li>
            <li> Much more thorough than flossing, includes a tongue cleaner, much stronger motor, really gets out hard to get food like carrots and lettuce.</li>
            <li> Lastly,it is somewhat louder than I expected, and might disturb a light sleeper.</li>
            <li> The weakest degree is much stronger than my old device.  </li>
            <li> It is not perfect, but I have a number of Panasonic products, at home, which I am happy with...</li>
            <li> When I carefully tried to pull the hose off the nipple on the pump, the cheap, brittle plastic nipple broke with NO hope of repair or replacement or work-around.</li>
            <li> I got two personal size Water Piks vice the family size which would be stretched more.</li>
            <li> They should click firmly at each level to be more user-friendly.    </li>
            <li> I am using it everyday and am enjoying it</li>
            <li> Okay, it can be a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> Using it everyday will keep your teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that all waterpiks make a bit of noise, but its normal.</li>
            <li> No, that is normal for the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my WP-60W for almost two years, ever since I started getting sore gums periodically, but rarely used it regularly.  </li>
            <li> One again like so many electromechanical devices in recent years, the quality of manufacture and long term durability continue to decrease as the replacement cost increases.</li>
            <li> This is number 4 or more of Water Piks; they last a long time, and do the job (still have my teeth).  </li>
            <li> Once I have flossed, dumped the Listerine/water mix and filled the tub with fresh rinse water, it&#x27;s a simple matter to re-set the tub on the pump because the new tub is transparent plastic, the water is clear (not bubbly) and I can look down and see exactly how to line up the grommets.</li>
            <li> One doesn&#x27;t need a large volume of water for each use and the water should be replaced each time, so why have such a large water container?</li>
            <li> right now they are doing the opposite.  </li>
            <li> while I&#x27;m at it, it&#x27;s only hard-earned money, right?</li>
            <li> That way I feel confident that those natural antibacterials are getting into the tight spots.  </li>
            <li> The dental hygienist twice a year and the low tech floss string daily will do fine.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the company changed a good thing into pure junk.  </li>
            <li> As a tooth/gum cleaner, it works great, if a little messy (water everywhere).  </li>
            <li> A little noisy (compared to earlier model) but is highly effective in removing plaque</li>
            <li> Expect to buy a new one every year for reasons listed here.</li>
            <li> This purchase is for use aboard our new motorhome.  </li>
            <li> This new WaterPik had rubber feet that prevents this.</li>
            <li> And I like the new design and</li>
            <li> Anyway, I can&#x27;t live without it -</li>
            <li> Does the new unit work?  </li>
            <li> but I can live with  that.</li>
            <li> I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CANNOT use this while having a conversation, or wearing a new shirt.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I have to &amp;#34;hunt and seek&amp;#34; to get the grommets on the new unit to connect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that I have to keep getting new units as they start to leak after a while.</li>
            <li> Had to get a new one</li>
            <li> Every 3 years or so, I wear one out and have to buy a new one, which is why I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> I had braces in my early 20&#x27;s and not could imagine not using a waterpik 4x a day just to feel decent.  </li>
            <li> We should have spent the extra money and  repeated the better style.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase the newer model since no sinus irrigator adapter is available for it from either WaterPik or 3rd party suppliers such as Sinupulse.</li>
            <li> The next model up was available locally, but could not find this model which saved me over $10.</li>
            <li> Once I get the blasted thing to work, it does a wonderful job of getting debris left after flossing, but it&#x27;s still a pain in the you-know</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that over time I&#x27;ll learn how to line them up with no problem, but for now it takes me several tries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very handy, and great way to keep the nasty out of your mouth</li>
            <li> Remember that you can force water under the gum if you have soft gums and the force is set high.  </li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my very old waterpik and found this on online.</li>
            <li> This is easier to clean and dry than other models and the larger tank allows more water for each use and a complete cleaning.</li>
            <li> even my 2 Telebrands Pocket Hoses work great in the face of over 2,000 really bad reviews right here on Amazon &amp;  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud, too loud!  </li>
            <li> Another design flaw that shouldn&#x27;t exist on such a mature product: the irrigation tips really need a gnurled grip so you can turn them in your mouth easily when they get wet while in use.  </li>
            <li> Another design flaw that shouldn&#x27;t exist on such a mature product: the irrigation tips really need a gnurled grip so you can turn them in your mouth easily when they get wet while in use.  </li>
            <li> It is light-weight, and it operates more powerfully and quietly than the previous versions I&#x27;ve had of this same model.</li>
            <li> My first WaterPik was purchased in the 1970s and lasted almost 30 years before the pump finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The tube that extends from the unit to the mouthpiece is cheap and way too short (hardly 3 feet) and it&#x27;s so strongly coiled it ends up hardly being able to reach 2 feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did use the Waterpik at about an inch away from the extraction sites and used the lowest setting possible to avoid dislodging clots for the first week.</li>
            <li> I wore the first one out, so had to get another one as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li> If you buy it, just be aware that you are buying a Chinese made product.</li>
            <li> Just like my old one!</li>
            <li> The pressure is to low, the other models have more pressure.</li>
            <li> Works better than past</li>
            <li> Since I had purchased my first two Waterpiks locally, and I had not gone online to research Waterpik when I did so</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was me that somehow left it on in the outage,</li>
            <li> Not sure how safe using this product is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unbearable and you only have it on for a couple of minutes, but, just be aware of the issue.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li> This is first one from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Others were at local stores, who did not always have model in stock.</li>
            <li> The first one was an earlier model I got from my dentist</li>
            <li> i chose itbecause the other one brokeit works better than a regular toothbrush i have used water pic for years</li>
            <li> Wow, can I tell you how improved my gums and mouth felt for about 2 months!  </li>
            <li> It is LOUD!  </li>
            <li> The first replacement lasted 3 weeks, the second hose lasted 1 week.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a similar system made by a different mfr, after that one developed an irreparable leak following many years of use.    </li>
            <li> Again, one wonders how Waterpik stays in business effecting such elaborate solutions to such simple (but critical) design flaws; it&#x27;s like an auto manufacturer giving you a whole new car because they had installed faulty lug nuts on one of your wheels.  </li>
            <li> Again, one wonders how Waterpik stays in business effecting such elaborate solutions to such simple (but critical) design flaws; it&#x27;s like an auto manufacturer giving you a whole new car because they had installed faulty lug nuts on one of your wheels.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m comparing the new one to old 25 yr one</li>
            <li> Seems to work about as well, but not if you try to use the old nozzles on the new product.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find new on/off controls</li>
            <li> &quot; This was my first time to try any such item and it worked well to clear up my sinuses.</li>
            <li> motor is very loud and sounds like an old rusty boat motor and shakes itself around my counter.</li>
            <li> To use this pik, you need to be face down into the bowl of the sink with the water drooling out of the side of your mouth and onto your hand and back along the hose to the sink top.  </li>
            <li> It works fine but is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with it with only 2 minor caveats .</li>
            <li> My wants are simple and they didn&#x27;t try to make the new one sing and dance.</li>
            <li> I contacted Waterpik at their website, explained the problem -- and one week later they sent a whole new unit.  </li>
            <li> After a short period of time the force of water was cut in half, and I have not been able to correct this problem.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and has all the necessary tips to deep clean past the gumline.</li>
            <li> They get noisy after a few years, but worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Blue top keeps toppling over and making a mess on the countertop.</li>
            <li> First, don&#x27;t take seriously those pictures of a guy standing straight up over the sink with a smile on his face.  </li>
            <li> Love it, hardly can skip waterpiking my teeth at night -</li>
            <li> I like the clear water reservoir and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> And that slinky-like hose takes real talent to get back to the way it was.  </li>
            <li> But what really annoys me is the design of the current product.  </li>
            <li> Our old WaterPic wore out and we replaced it with a cordless rechargeable flosser.</li>
            <li> We went back to the real WaterPic</li>
            <li> It is quieter and seems to work smooter that the old one and still has all the water preasue I need.</li>
            <li> but motor is extremely loud.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if there is much quality control or testing of the individual machines.  </li>
            <li> Busy people do not always have the time to pack the product up for returning.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to replace a 12 year old WaterPic. &lt;</li>
            <li> WOW..</li>
            <li> But it got old and leaky and so I put it away, pack rat that we are.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 25 year old model.  </li>
            <li> problem is the need to make frequent solutions.</li>
            <li> Not that I was too surprised.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I purchase the WaterPik as I have the early stages of gum disease.  </li>
            <li> I bought to replace our old one.  </li>
            <li> The old one wore out.</li>
            <li> It is possible that they redesigned it recently, or that the more expensive models are better built.  </li>
            <li> Again, yet another fault in what should by now be a mature product...</li>
            <li> Again, yet another fault in what should by now be a mature product...</li>
            <li> My old 6&#x27;s and now 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s,space between gum and teeth...</li>
            <li> If the top is the least bit off the hole, the water runs through and spills out on the bottom.</li>
            <li> and I decided to try and fix the old one</li>
            <li> I think I will rebuild my old one.</li>
            <li> Wore one out completely, and bought this replacement.</li>
            <li> The piping developed a leak in one</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re complete fans of the waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I am returning it and will continue to use my old one.  </li>
            <li> they are filled with out of the box failures, day one failures, failures after just a few days,  </li>
            <li> These devices remove so much food from between teeth and under gums - food that you thought you removed with regular brushing.  </li>
            <li> so using this at 10:00 pm or later, is really noisy to my family.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier; it does everything I wanted it to do; really like the big water reservoir!</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t last very long&lt;</li>
            <li> The two grommets just seemed naturally to connect.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are like a young person&#x27;s and I thank WaterPik for that.  </li>
            <li> It works well so far and dosn&#x27;t take up alot of space.</li>
            <li> Even with its noise and size, the 60W is far easier to use.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a 8 year old unit.</li>
            <li> I bought this WaterPik WP-60W Water Flosser on line to replace my old WaterPik WP-60W water flosser which just died.</li>
            <li> The most common problem I encounter using this waterpik has to do with no water flow when the machine is not set on a level surface.  </li>
            <li> I had to go to bed bath &amp;beyond to get the real deal that would actually work.</li>
            <li> Despite negative reviews, I decided to give the waterpik a try, after an acquaintance insisted it was the better buy, and reliable.  </li>
            <li> works really well, much lighter and less noisy then older models.</li>
            <li> COMPLETELY INOPERATIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my old one blew the pump apart when the plastic got old (about 2.5 years) and it was a bear to get apart.</li>
            <li> So, how many times do we just suffer the idiosyncrasies, get used to the thing and hope it will last a few years??</li>
            <li> I had it for a full day -- just long enough to throw out my sales receipt, of course -- before the hose popped off the handle, shooting water all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> and it was difficult to handle and it needed to be refilled over and over for one good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> , quiet (no more pump to wake up the rest of the house!), efficient (doesn&#x27;t require counter top space or electricity), made in America and is very well-reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is efficient and exactly the right size for a small family.</li>
            <li> My overall oral health has improved significantly since purchasing one of these and combined with regular dentist visits, daily brushing, flossing and Breath RX Anti-Bacterial Mouth Rinse, my gums are on their way to a complete recovery.</li>
            <li> This is my second of the same model, the original having lasted for ten years.  </li>
            <li> I decided to figure out a way to replace the original hose with off-brand hose and splice it onto the original hose below the wand with tube connectors and save myself a bundle by not having to pay Waterpik for a new hose/wand replacement kit and replacement tips, so I pulled the base unit apart to get to where the original hose connects directly to the pump inside</li>
            <li> not like it used to.&lt;br /&gt;Motor runs loud and the entire unit is considerably lighter than the older one</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and easy to store away without taking up a lot of space.recommend it to anyone who has dirty teeth.lol</li>
            <li> This is my first review of any product, and I don&#x27;t know where to start with this one.my first mistake was not reading the product reviews before purchase, I relied on previous waterpik units that I purchased over the years and never had any issues with the product but this unit not only stop working after three weeks</li>
            <li> I have used the WaterPik on a few occasions to clean a clogged Keurig Coffee Maker that was not pumping.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me is that the part of the water tube closest to the machine still raps away at the machine when it is being used at a particular angle; maybe they&#x27;ll have some tube extension that projects the tube away from the machine while in use would help.</li>
            <li> This older type of waterPik has the larger container and stronger pulse with compared to the newer type of Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Just bought the fourth one; first one lasted longer than later ones.</li>
            <li> WaterPik has long been a trusted name in care of teeth and gums, My dentist also suggested it&#x27;s use for my wife who has Parkinson&#x27;s and has trouble maintaining a healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> The main problem being the hoses crack after a short while.</li>
            <li> mid to high settings.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product - especially with the nasal irrigator attachment (purchased separately through a doctor&#x27;s office).</li>
            <li> It is still a good product, but it becomes increasingly inconvenient with each new iteration, and I think the market is ripe for the competition.      </li>
            <li> I love the fact that the water basin is blue since we have hard water and the clear plastic one would look rusty after a period of time.</li>
            <li> This particular water pik is powerful enough but I prefer the one I had previous to this where you can select the speed of the water from the pik.  </li>
            <li> And lastly, the only way you can close the Waterpik is by removing the pick every time; the top will not fit over the bottom otherwise.    </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This product is very cheaply made in that it fails to return a reasonable value.  </li>
            <li> This is the only model that has a large enough water reservoir to get the job done without having to refill it.</li>
            <li> Charged power brushes take care if surfaces well, but not in between, however with two settings - we can get hard to reach areas easily.</li>
            <li> The most recent failure mode is the \\&quot;on-off\\&quot;  switch stopped working on my old wp-60w</li>
            <li> Yes, you need to begin with hot water; Yes, you need to make sure the tank is surely seated on the base; and Yes, you need to keep the pik in your mouth with your mouth closed and over the sink.  </li>
            <li> The little monster is loud, but hey, it has to create a lot of pressure from a teeny tiny motor, and I&#x27;m sure the short lifespan of 2-4 years is what keeps the price so low.  </li>
            <li> I put this into use new only 8 months ago.  </li>
            <li> I only use filtered water in it and it sill looks like new after a year os use.</li>
            <li> the rounded surfaces of the reservoir dry easier and protects the whole unit from dust when stored.</li>
            <li> Because this cleans so well, I now floss only twice a day (meaning I buy 2/3 less dental floss) and yet still have clean teeth and gums.    </li>
            <li> I bought another professional model for my son around the same time and it works well without a problem so far.</li>
            <li> handle is too thick to easily revolve the tip when using in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A big problem with Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet was that it has a smaller tank, so you have to stop and refill 3-4 times before you complete!!!.</li>
            <li> I have some pockets along my gum line that flossing and my Sonicare (which I love) just don&#x27;t clean well enough, making for some nasty breath and potential greater problems, but the Water Pik takes no prisoners.  </li>
            <li> So apparently, my previous personal dental hygiene--which included brushing, flossing, and irrigating six times per day (once after each meal)--wasn&#x27;t sufficient to keep my gumline free of irritants and to properly stimulate my gums.</li>
            <li> This little machine is useful.  </li>
            <li> I use this machine with a special nasal tip for allergy/sinus rinses and although it works well, the unit is not as heavy duty as the last WaterPik I owned.  </li>
            <li> Clearly this brand manufactures only trash</li>
            <li> It has become quite apparent to me that the plastics they are using to manufacture the hose has a chemical defect as it should last far longer than my 2.5 years and his 11 months.  </li>
            <li> To keep things as sanitary as possible, rinse the reservoir and run clear water through the machine if you&#x27;ve used mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> The only important item missing from this product is the sub-gingival tip, which apparently can only be purchased in sets of two.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the settings only produce a loud noise and no water.</li>
            <li> They only needed to be replaced when the hose developed a leak.</li>
            <li> How could there be such a difference in my old one &amp; the new?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And it Works very well and does not leak, and the motor sounds as expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s loud and the company stated that because it was purchase from a third party (amazon) they would not honor the warranty.</li>
            <li> This is a definite up grade form the old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same old WaterPik</li>
            <li> i bought this fom you and now 6 weeks or so later it doesnt pump water, i wish i had kept my old one instead to buying this one.  </li>
            <li> ( You could tape it to your favorite position, or simply learn not to touch it while in use)A better design in my opinion would be to put the control on the base unit instead of the handle.</li>
            <li> I was afraid i would never get another that good.</li>
            <li> This is fine for me as I have limited space and did not want one so harsh.</li>
            <li> My current one, several years old, has finally burst the water feeder coil, and has a lot of miles on it, so I dropped in to get a new</li>
            <li> When my one unit burnt up I kept the opaque white reservoir and threw away the new blue one.  </li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was that this version is quieter than previous WaterPiks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not perfect but it works better than the last one I had (that one held up much longer than I thought possible).</li>
            <li> The problem is that it is extremely hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, WATERPIK is responsible for the specifications on these products.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, this latest failure occurred with the on-off switch failing in the on mode, so it really didn&#x27;t die, but it made using the water pik a bit inconvenient.</li>
            <li> and I had to fill it at least twice to get the amount of irrigation needed to get everything clean.</li>
            <li> B000ODV872 QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator w/ 36\\&quot; hose]], but it doesn&#x27;t allow you to use mouthwash, which is important if you&#x27;ve got serious gum problems.    </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by its performance, it was quiet and jet had enough force</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for what appeared to be the same model only about 5+ years old.  </li>
            <li> (For you old enough, remember when a box of Corn Flakes was actually affordable?)</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my old one which eventually wore out after several years of daily use.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, my newest WP-60 tube and handle finally broke down exactly like its predecessors.  </li>
            <li> When I first got the WP-600 (like way back on day one), I might have laid the wand down and noticed that water starts draining from it....  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as described maybe a little noisy</li>
            <li> WaterPik is the only brand that I have previously owned that I would be willing to buy again.  </li>
            <li> First, the resevoir does not fit over the unit with the irrigator tool in place after use.</li>
            <li> And while we are on the subject, they recently went to a clear blue reservoir on the Classic WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this as a replacement of my previous unit which had become very noisy and produced an irregular stream.  </li>
            <li> This thing is definitely louder than your average bathroom accessory but no worse than the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I tried the higher setting as a test and can&#x27;t reproduce the bleeding gum problem that the WaterPik appears to have cured in a few weeks of regular use.    </li>
            <li> just ordered the ShowerBreeze w/ 6&#x27; hose by Oral Breeze which is inexpensive, convenient (you use it in the shower so no more mess to clean up!)</li>
            <li> And no more mess to clean up!</li>
            <li> The new one works very well, and I have only one complaint.</li>
            <li> Certain mouthwashes, or too concentrated a mouthwash solution, can destroy it.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to find this particular water pik in stores near me.  </li>
            <li> Note that the WaterPik with the regular tip is great (used at lesser pressure than on the teeth) for cleaning the tongue; food trapped in the pores of the tongue is a major source of bad breath.</li>
            <li> My first Professional model pump finally got too weak after hose and handle replacements.</li>
            <li> I find this unit to be easier to use, and, if other reviews are to be believed, it provides nearly the same benefits as string flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to other water pics that I priced this was by far the lowest price</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to hold up for 2+ years so far.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 other waterpiks and this by far is the strongest stream.</li>
            <li> The second point annoys me every time I use the unit, as it won&#x27;t sit flat when the cord is wound up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After regular use of the WaterPik for a few weeks, I experimented by trying a few passes at nearly full power.</li>
            <li> We just stuck with it, and It did continue to operate at that lower setting for a long time, until finally it would only work at the lowest power setting, then not at all.  </li>
            <li> Always turn the water bowl over and close the lid down on the housing or the entire waterpik will attract dust and grime very quickly risking water damage to the motor due to excessive cleaning.</li>
            <li> last waterpik died a few months ago and with one thing or another I didn&#x27;t get a new one until this week.</li>
            <li> My previous WaterPik last for nearly thirty years.  </li>
            <li> It should be a standard and universal recommendation for every single person to include oral irrigation to their oral hygiene program alongside brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I wrongly assumed when I bought the Model WP-60W that somehow Waterpik had changed the design of their machine and messed up a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the wonders of Amazon, I discovered just this week, when I was looking to replace my Model WP-60W, because I just could not stand its leaking another day, that the reason my second Waterpik was so bad was that I had purchased a bottom-of-the-line model, of far lower quality than my first Waterpik, the Model WP-100, and</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve usually removed my glasses at this point, it&#x27;s a real pain.    </li>
            <li> The first two lasted at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> is my first ever really negative review.</li>
            <li> The Water Pik arrived in the usual lightning fast manner</li>
            <li> Simple machinery which I expect to continue to work as it&#x27;s designed for a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, you can&#x27;t leave any water in it and place the mouth piece in its holder or set it on your counter for a moment, as it begins to slowly drain water if it&#x27;s not held higher than the level of the water--a syphoning effect occours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I turn mine up full blast and shoot the water between my teeth at the gum line for a few seconds; the spray acts like a little tornado and shoves out EVERYTHING!  </li>
            <li> They are not designed to last very long.</li>
            <li> The  NY model was less than a year old and died -  </li>
            <li> so, I went back to CVS and spent the extra cash to get the Ultra cordless.  </li>
            <li> Like the jet control on the handle, but prefer the overall design of the WP-100, with a closed tank, rather than an open tank.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but vibrates too much which is annoying.</li>
            <li> so you either have to dry it with a towel or let it air dry for several hours.  </li>
            <li> This is a very low-range model, and the least desirable Waterpik</li>
            <li> First, if it was cracked then the remaining hose would be no good either.  </li>
            <li> You can brush your teeth all day long and never remove the food that gets lodged between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to replace.  </li>
            <li> Been looking for replacement water pic for long time.</li>
            <li> So with shipping from an outside vendor, I&#x27;ll end up having to pay approximately half the price of the entire unit just to get replacement tips.</li>
            <li> A little hard at first  to line up  water bowl on  power unit, but have the hang of it now!</li>
            <li> I tried using other things like floss picks but saw a deterioration in overall gum health.  </li>
            <li> The price was very low for this type of product compared to other places of bussiness.</li>
            <li> They wrote back and said that they now change out the hose from the bottom but did not address any of the other issues except to say they do not design them with \\&quot;planned obsolescence\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I wish some other company that valued manufacturing over marketing would make one that would last.</li>
            <li> I began using it at mid-power, because I have been a dental water jet user for years and had used my other one at just a bit above mid-power.</li>
            <li> Same if you have hard water - protect your investment by running a soft water rinse.  </li>
            <li> And it was square, which meant I could store some meds on it while I let it dry out.  </li>
            <li> WaterPik should step up, charge around $100 and get back in the Sonic Toothbrush game, $70-$150, and produce a real product.      </li>
            <li> Anyway, the firm listed on the WaterPik web site as the repair place in Dallas says it does no repairs, but only ships units under warranty back to Teledyne.  </li>
            <li> SECOND ADDENDUM (written a few months later):</li>
            <li> could not live without this product</li>
            <li> It was a lot easier then trying to find one at a store since they have a limited selection.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure just what we old time WaterPiK users are to do.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the seal becomes unseated after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to at first</li>
            <li> This one was defective from the start, the water hose would come loose from the pik and spray water all over.  </li>
            <li> The drained reservoir, turned upside down, creates the lid to the unit when storing, and likewise, it simply sits loosely on the bottom, so that if you pick it up that way, you send everything flying.    </li>
            <li> It took some time to get used to using it without totally wetting down the bathroom as well as the cat, who insists upon helping.  </li>
            <li> On the down side, I wish they would last longer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s likely to lose its connection; either press the reservoir down again or add water.    </li>
            <li> The only water that makes it through is a trickle that runs down my hand.  </li>
            <li> We have owned two earlier versions of this product for a number of years (two because my wife and I are usually cleaning our teeth at the same time).  </li>
            <li> It has decidedly less pressure, but appears to be counteracted by having a smaller hole in the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> Thus, less water flow but probably about the same speed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking into purchasing another water flosser from a different company - one that has less 1-star reviews.</li>
            <li> previously I used the middle setting.</li>
            <li> Looking at the inner workings of the base unit, I realized that these things simply aren&#x27;t worth anywhere near the hard-earned money spent on them.</li>
            <li> The usual failure mode is the plastic hose breaks when you least expect it and you know it because it usually gives you a good soaking in a couple of seconds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see how long it lasts, as well, as all my previous WaterPiks have lasted, at most, a few years before leaking and losing power to the point where they were useless.</li>
            <li> , I discovered just this week, when I was looking to replace my Model WP-60W, because I just could not stand its leaking another day, that the reason my second Waterpik was so bad was that I had purchased a bottom-of-the-line model, of far lower quality than my first Waterpik, the Model WP-100, and</li>
            <li> The part that you hold in your hand sits loosely in its storage receptacle, and the curled hose leading to the water reservoir needs to be carefully tucked, or the springiness of it makes the device hop out of its receptacle when preparing to put it away.    </li>
            <li> Every other unit failed in the exact same way lasting less than a year.  </li>
            <li> first, there was only one jet tip plus a tongue cleaner (which I have yet to use), and second, there isn&#x27;t enough room in the base to wind the cord properly.  </li>
            <li> Then came the little rubber tip, deep pocket cleaning, and</li>
            <li> The only problems I have found with this product is removing the pic when the reservoir is in place, it is a little cumbersome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little hesitant to add the following because this is NOT a recommended use for the waterpik and want to emphasize that it may shorten it&#x27;s life.  </li>
            <li> A little noisey and too big a well, but would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Product works fine, but the water flow on this model is not adjustable, so there is only one intensity which is too bad.</li>
            <li> You might as well just take your money and flush it down the toilet.  </li>
            <li> As far as the hose leak, don&#x27;t yank it hard like a spring, just uncoil it</li>
            <li> Despite some of the bad reviews, I chose this model to order and must say I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve converted my dentist who has seen my bad gums become healthy over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sounds like Waterpik is great about replacing bad units within a year (without a receipt!!).  </li>
            <li> Even on sale, this product is too expensive for an expected useful life of one year at a frequency of 3 uses per week.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I wrote this review is because I think some of the criticism of the device comes back to common sense . . .  </li>
            <li> The only reason I wrote this review is because I think some of the criticism of the device comes back to common sense . . .  </li>
            <li> Whatever they did in the past worked and the hoses were long lasting, no longer is that the case.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messier than I expected.</li>
            <li> There are a few issues with the unit obviously.</li>
            <li> Look at the photo carefully.</li>
            <li> The part I don&#x27;t like is that it is all wet from the water</li>
            <li> Have to be careful what setting you use it on and the direction.  </li>
            <li> Pay the extra few bucks and get the WP-100.</li>
            <li> ADDENDUM (written a few months later):</li>
            <li> Click and a few days later it is at my door.</li>
            <li> Saves a few trips to the dentist, so I don&#x27;t have to go for deep scale treatment as often.</li>
            <li> pain to empty resevoir after every</li>
            <li> Once I spent 6 months eating candy corn, poprocks, and caramel chews.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as messy as I remember from years back when we owned one used by children with braces.</li>
            <li> When you get started, set the pressure to the lowest level and hold the pik pointing into the sink until the water starts; then you can get it into your mouth with no spray and carefully turn up the pressure.    </li>
            <li> careful of two things.</li>
            <li> it does everything that we expected and then some.</li>
            <li> My waterpik is place between two pedestal sinks on a makeshift tray.  </li>
            <li> This model sprays harder than the newer one.</li>
            <li> The vinyl o-ring that seals the water chamber needs careful treatment.</li>
            <li> Works as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new one because it&#x27;s only a matter of time before my old one fails in the usual manner.  </li>
            <li> The little switch that changes the force of the water is so loose that I am continually turning it down or off simply by virtue of holding it and working it around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> and I could not live with out one!!.</li>
            <li> but I either have to dry it out thoroughly and turn the tank upside down</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace older model that had broken hose.</li>
            <li> This unit replaced an older one with a broken hose, but I will buy again when this hose breaks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrating and doubt I would buy again this particular water-pick. .</li>
            <li> The main attachment head arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> Both things were easy enough to get around, but annoying.    </li>
            <li> I hate flossing but using this is easy and gets the same effect.</li>
            <li> you do have to hold the button in to stop the water - other than that it has always been recommended by my dentist ....</li>
            <li> Since other owners said the hose line was susceptible to breakage</li>
            <li> to have my teeth cleaned the other day and the pockets in my gums</li>
            <li> The other thing that annoys me a bit is that there is no cover for the water tank</li>
            <li> so I have to rinse it out every other day.</li>
            <li> I think it runs smoother and quieter than the other two models I owned.  </li>
            <li> In other words, if you were to remove or bump the tub while it has water in it, it will spill over everything.</li>
            <li> but it was simply too small</li>
            <li> Then two days later it would only work at a low pressure which was both dissapointing as well as useless.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand</li>
            <li> As other people have noticed, the WaterPik has a vibration problem.</li>
            <li> It has a button I can use to stop the stream and transfer over to the other side.</li>
            <li> It does make a lot of noise when I use it but other than that</li>
            <li> Such a waste!</li>
            <li> The other two piks that come with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got plenty of power that other models, including their WP-100, don&#x27;t always have.</li>
            <li> Other than the noise and bouncing, it works as it should.</li>
            <li> It was a well-made product that I was loathe to retire from service however after 20 years it had other ideas.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> just like some of the other reviews on Amazon says it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once you get past that you will definitely like using it.</li>
            <li> I am looking at other brands that will work with added mouthwash.</li>
            <li> From day one it was time consuming to get the tank/reservoir to fit properly on the base.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying as family gifts and using WP-60 higher end models of the WaterPik for the past 5 years - approximately 17 units.  </li>
            <li> It was loud and messy, as it slowly leaked water even when turned off, but it worked, and I was in need, so proceeded to use.  </li>
            <li> The pressure was minimal and not as controllable as my previous flosser.  </li>
            <li> However, my experience with a number of recent replacement of other small appliances such as toaster ovens and coffee makers is that the quality has gone down hill badly in the last few years and items have much shorter lives.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint so far is that the on-off switch on the left side is difficult to switch on (up) with one hand and you need to have the other hand holding the flosser hndle with shut off button depressed or water will start squirting everywhere.</li>
            <li> Other brands I did like broke down after two years, so I&#x27;m staying with Water Pik.</li>
            <li> I must say, they certainly stand behind their (faulty) product!  </li>
            <li> For $40 what are you expecting, a industrial WaterPik capable of 10,000 mean hours before failure?  </li>
            <li> If your product is registered they will provide you with free replacements, so that&#x27;s nice of them, but why keep replacing crap parts with other crap parts?</li>
            <li> It does not leak as the other one did and it takes up less space on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Only one unit had lasted for almost 15 months before the handle and tubing began leaking resulting in hardly any water pressure at all.  </li>
            <li> The bowl is impossible to clean, residue from the water is caked on.  </li>
            <li> My one and only complaint about the WaterPik is about the coiled hose.  </li>
            <li> I think that they have each lasted about 5 years on the average.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll go in a dark corner shelf in case</li>
            <li> The amount saved on the WP-60W over the Water Flosser is not worth the difference in quality of operation.</li>
            <li> and it is not nearly as powerful.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m an idiot.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved predecessors of this product, but this one is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Beyond this, the motor works (so far), and Waterpik does stand behind the product.  </li>
            <li> Beyond this, the motor works (so far), and Waterpik does stand behind the product.  </li>
            <li> Her old one had broken.  </li>
            <li> I secured the hose with tape, which seems to work ok, except that I cannot store the handle in the base.  </li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re grabbing the base of the unit and shaking the daylights out of it, or unless your vanity top is at a 45 degree angle, it is NOT going anywhere...  </li>
            <li> It does the job of cleaning my mouth, but the noise it makes is loud &amp; irritating.  </li>
            <li> You have to be sure to make the connection between the drain on the inverted cover and the water input on the base unit so that water does not leak out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite messy and I end up getting wet.</li>
            <li> Keeps down the need dentist visits.</li>
            <li> Effect - Yes, if you lay the wand down (lower than the slot that is deigned to hold it) the water will drain from the tank through the wand.  </li>
            <li> Gets to the gunk way up &amp; washes it down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Lean down over the siink as the instructions state so that you don&#x27;t get water all over the sink, the walls, the mirror, yourself.</li>
            <li> so I use it about every other day!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is cheaper than any other Waterpik you can buy, but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sad when august American companies, whose products had ruled the world since WWII, nowadays export their manufacturing to China with the result being unreliable, shoddy products not only such as this one, but also with \\&quot;prestigious name\\</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the problem of other reviewers, mine could wake the dead.</li>
            <li> Previously I had a WP-32W.</li>
            <li> It broke in less than 6 months</li>
            <li> totally (I&#x27;m only sorry they can&#x27;t make a travel version for out of the country that has enough power).  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer pointed out, potential flooding and definite noise have to be dealt with, but it&#x27;s not too difficult to learn the tricks needed to keep water going where you want it.  </li>
            <li> So I bought the one with less bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> Prefer this model to a previously owned one in that</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less noisy.</li>
            <li> Less noise when is on.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one thing the WP-60W could use; something in the design to make it less noisy.</li>
            <li> I do not know if this is a typical problem for these units.   </li>
            <li> Owned a cordless Waterpik product that lasted about a year and a half before the rechargeable battery would no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> needs a slight angle at the bottom in order to use all of the content.</li>
            <li> the price is now $9 less than when I bought it one week ago.</li>
            <li> Eventually they die or start leaking in odd places, turning your bathroom into a rainforest.  </li>
            <li> (about half the price here compared with what I paid in China).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ridiculous that you only receive one Jet Head!  </li>
            <li> I bought a previous version</li>
            <li> Product weighs much less</li>
            <li> then my previous model</li>
            <li> The Conair model lasted 4 years with no problems and it cost $10 less.  </li>
            <li> But, be warned, these thing are highly tempermental,and difficult to control.</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy, but not that bad (and really, you are only running it for 1-2 minutes...</li>
            <li> My previous experience with the hand-held flossers was not good.  </li>
            <li> The only little thing is that it is tough to put the wand back into the base for storing but other than that, it works just right.</li>
            <li> The first two started leaking water like crazy at the handle; nothing came out the tip, it all came out in the handle.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this product gets the job done with out all the mess.</li>
            <li> I do like this, but the motor started sounding funny and cutting out after about a week.  </li>
            <li> they made it a little quieter than previous WP-60 model and the hose is now easier to replace without tearing the machine apart.</li>
            <li> * Press the reservoir down firmly over the gasket.  </li>
            <li> Makes for little bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t last long and were expensive.  </li>
            <li> &quot; combination padlocks I bought that failed and numerous other shoddy Chinese products.</li>
            <li> Add a little mouthwash to the water.</li>
            <li> It will blast away those little bit of food you miss with your toothbrush and floss.</li>
            <li> sometimes a little water leaks out when in use which prevents me from giving it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Other than a change to the weight/color of the resevoir, I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It also seems like this one might be a little quieter than the others.  </li>
            <li> little background.  </li>
            <li> You have this little stream of water that is guided around your mouth to do its job but that water has to go somewhere.</li>
            <li> I guess Water-pik has designed a little obsolescence into the product to keep up the sales.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy</li>
            <li> Yes, waterpiks can be a little messy (spray)</li>
            <li> (Caution, water is wet !!!  </li>
            <li> Too bad, it&#x27;s a useful tool.  </li>
            <li> you need to use it at least for 60 sec.</li>
            <li> The unit never snapped on securely, no matter what I tried.  </li>
            <li> My dentist used to complain about my gum at every visit but stopped since I started to use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take it out and store it because it is a waste of time if you are going to use it every day</li>
            <li> I bought the waterpik for an aunt, unfortunately she plugged it directly to 220 and burnt it.</li>
            <li> It had a rechargable battery that would power it for a few days without having to hookup to electricity.  </li>
            <li> Was missing tongue srcaper.</li>
            <li> This works well in loosening trapped food, as I have a problem with gingivitis.</li>
            <li> When used with mouthwash expect a messy sink as the rinse becomes foamy.</li>
            <li> But I have had it for a few months now, and I have to tell you that per my Dental Hygienist, my mouth has improved 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The floss water stream is difficult to direct because the tip head does not turn in the handle.</li>
            <li> This one  the jet stream of water is almost to harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li> It had been a few years since I used this model, so</li>
            <li> Then hold the handle in the sink below the level of the reservoir to allow water to drain out of the cord and shake it into the sink a few times to remove any remaining water in the handle.  </li>
            <li> being said, this is a messy product.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> the worst part is I can smell my own s***ty smell breath.</li>
            <li> The hose cracked after a few years of use.</li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s real world use I was blasting out crap, last nights rib dinner, plus some stange stuff in the sink bowl.  </li>
            <li> When the rubber gasket for the reservoir is properly inserted into the receiving gasket on the base you have a very topple-proof device.  </li>
            <li> I had simply replaced it because I wanted something new :(</li>
            <li> I have bought2 of th other models, one failed in 28 months, and I will gat the 2nd one in a few days.</li>
            <li> The one we had previously had came with three of them!</li>
            <li> It is not easily user-replaceable.</li>
            <li> it can get a little messy, but with practice- they are improving!</li>
            <li> AND WHAT A MESS!  </li>
            <li> Every unit has been used habitually on the average of at least 3 times per week.  </li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, generally the hoses fail.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new WaterPik, expecting another 40 years of use -- silly me!  </li>
            <li> When my hygienist mentioned that I had a small pocket of inaccessible gumline around two teeth that might benefit from a waterpik, I took her advice and bought this.  </li>
            <li> No more root canals for me.    </li>
            <li> and no more worry about bleeding gums........</li>
            <li> I like these units because they are small and portable</li>
            <li> Now my Pik is useless, and currently Amazon does not carry replacement tips.  </li>
            <li> People has to understand that this small unit has to compress water to generate the pressure needs at the tip of the handle.</li>
            <li> That was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Stores away in a small space.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> (Usually 5-6 years)</li>
            <li> I can see how it wouldn&#x27;t be practical for taking it on trips...which is understandable (and that&#x27;s why they make small hand held ones).</li>
            <li> difficult to use, may sprays water around if not inserted properly.</li>
            <li> The size makes it small</li>
            <li> This was a mistake  This unit failed after only 12 months.  </li>
            <li> Just a small thing.</li>
            <li> this is a noisy device, I&#x27;m usually awake when I use it so the noise does not bother me...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Teledyne Water Piks in the past</li>
            <li> we squirted water on the counter and mirror a few times before we figured out how to keep it in our mouth!</li>
            <li> land-fill fodder-------total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but I cannot afford to buy multiple units.  </li>
            <li> what a waste!  </li>
            <li> I went to two local drugstores and another online store but was unable to find this model.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get a pillow to the back of your head - or worse!</li>
            <li> So, if your a grizzly and want to remove small animals from betwixt your teeth, turn up the power.&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s Waterpik&#x27;s evil plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no more tongue cleaner though.</li>
            <li> Stiff supply line makes it hard to return the nozzle holder to its holding slot.  </li>
            <li> but I am doubtful this machine will last half that long.  </li>
            <li> Also half a teaspoon of bleach added to the water is a dentist secret for destroying bacteria in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Very messy and not well designed.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> B000UWAWQU Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet]], which was awful compared with the 60W--tiny reservoir, extremely awkward to handle, impossible to clean thoroughly--and is going right back to the store.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering from the worst bad breath for more than 5 years and it made me feel like it&#x27;s the end of my social life.</li>
            <li> Gets those hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> I have found that hard water leads to mineral build up inside this machine and causes it to break.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist encouraged me to get a WaterPik to get to hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li> However I cannot get passed how poorly designed the little pump is.  </li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of falling asleep early in the evening,</li>
            <li> It got to the point where I was afraid to eat because cleaning the sockets were such a pain!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the one we had for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Messy, clumsy, frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> This product is awful, the hose and motor broke after only 14 months, it is so loud that I cannot use it in the mornings before going to work at 6am.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day</li>
            <li> No one had ever complained about this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked power brushes and reluctantly bought this product upon advice of dentist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give a negative number review, if it were an option.  </li>
            <li> I also disliked how the cord goes from underneath the unit instead of behind it.  </li>
            <li> Does that mean the Kitchen Aid mixer is inferior?  </li>
            <li> So:  Since I am extremely paranoid about dental/gum health (that reconstructive work was very expensive) I usually add a small amount of salt and hydrogen peroxide to the water in the resevoir.  </li>
            <li> The new version of this water pic is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought a WP-60W less than one year ago and the pump has already failed.</li>
            <li> Some caps were so tight and even joined in spots that regular flossing was difficult to impossible.  </li>
            <li> When I was a teenager, my gums were in such bad shape</li>
            <li> A simple thing like a broken output tube is almost impossible to fix, even though a replacement part is sold, because the end of the tube attached to the unit may have lost its flexibility.</li>
            <li> At this point, if I floss after I use the Waterpik, I get hardly anything off of my teeth!      </li>
            <li> They are extremely noisy and messy and inconvenient and expensive and poorly made.</li>
            <li> The WP-60W is clumsy to use!</li>
            <li> I am posting this review because China has come to earn a very negative reputation for producing inferior quality, just read the newspapers.</li>
            <li> NO MORE IMPULSE BUYING!!</li>
            <li> Just a little inexplicable bleeding that comes with any vigorous dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> This one I kept the box, I am going to call the manufacturer and hopefully they will stand behind their product because the supplier won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> We are addicted to the WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this model for over 7 years and noticed the poor reviews</li>
            <li> Poor design or poor construction, take your pick.</li>
            <li> ** and wants to make a bundle off the customer with their poorly made products and when all the companies are doing that the customer base suffers dramatically, being nickle-and-dimed into the poor house.</li>
            <li> At this point, I thought about super-gluing it together, but realized that I really hated this thing and Water pik in general for duping me into replacing with their product the one I had that lasted 10 years.    </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the water pressure was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> The problem was, I did return it to Walgreens and exchanged it for another WP-60W, but that one leaked, too, and I didn&#x27;t feel like going through the hassle of another return, so I kept the replacement Model WP-60W and have been unhappy with its leaking for the past 2.5 years.</li>
            <li> sit loosely in holes in the base.  </li>
            <li> This was by far the worst water pick I have purchased.</li>
            <li> A bit weak, but still gets the job done!  </li>
            <li> Does not work and is very weak.</li>
            <li> I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device&#x27;s tips quality.  </li>
            <li> pockets getting deeper, and warnings of expensive repairs ahead........</li>
            <li> The problem with it is that you can plan for the unit to fail in some way in 3-4 years.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product acquisted wasn&#x27;t compatible with my country voltage.</li>
            <li> had I just disregarded all those glowing reviews from questionable sources.  </li>
            <li> There have been years when I did not replace a failed Water Pik.  </li>
            <li> Once burnt twice shy.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> You DON&#x27;T need to save your receipt, unless you want to return a failed WP-60 to the store.  </li>
            <li> Probably a random mfg problem.</li>
            <li> After about two months of use, the pump is beginning to fail.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> There is something wrong with the pulse speeds in the handle.</li>
            <li> handle too short, turn off knob in handle virtually unusable, terribly noisy, water all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> I have to close the bathroom door to keep from disturbing everyone in the rest of the house.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews of the replacement hose/wand kits and I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> FAIL, FAIL, FAIL, FAIL,</li>
            <li> so sorry i lke</li>
            <li> I emailed them and they sent me some complicated instructions on how to get it to work.</li>
            <li> I was getting bad and worse reviews by my dentist..........</li>
            <li> If you have any cold sensitivity, and you use cold water, this will intensify the cold and may be difficult to bear.</li>
            <li> afraid I would have to have a wisdom tooth pulled because of a pocket but that cleared.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and bought one anyway, what a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> we any of us have a cold.</li>
            <li> From the beginning this model was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Just plain water is boring.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik periodically starts vibrating and it makes use very difficult.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this product.</li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to keep the mold from forming.  </li>
            <li> Based on my experience in owning water picks over the past two decades, I would rank the WaterPik WP-60W as having the worst quality in my experience.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe all the bad reviews having used WaterPiK for over 20 years</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift and becuse the packaging was so bad it looked like a used one.</li>
            <li> This is food that feeds the bacteria in your mouth causing bad breath, tooth decay, and gum disease.  </li>
            <li> I mentioned this to the hygienist yesterday and she was shocked.  </li>
            <li> Grrr -- the cleaning tip broke this morning when I tried to remove it from the hose.  </li>
            <li> Grrr -- the cleaning tip broke this morning when I tried to remove it from the hose.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> and  I was very unhappy.  </li>
            <li> And the piece that you put into your mouth is where the OFF switch should be, rather than on the base unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok...I hate to floss...........</li>
            <li> I always have to try 2-3 times to get the rubber out-go mechanism to &amp;#34;seat&amp;#34; into the hole in the base</li>
            <li> When the motor is on it seems to pump violently.    </li>
            <li> I hate stuff stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> product consists of the base unit with its hose attached hand unit, and</li>
            <li> The pump in the base sounds like a miniature jack hammer.</li>
            <li> Also the warranty is worthless.</li>
            <li> and Waterpik is a household name like Kleenex or Xerox, but their products are crap.</li>
            <li> If the product is crap</li>
            <li> the product is crap therefore the product is CRAP.  </li>
            <li> and I hated it.  </li>
            <li> I hated the packaging.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Terrible quality Terrible design.</li>
            <li> But the design of the case is really pathetic, and anyone who even tried using the machine before marketing it would see that.      </li>
            <li> When my hygienist suggested I pull it out again, I discovered that it was in terrible shape.  </li>
            <li> Its bulky and vibrates terribly.  </li>
            <li> It works so well and keeps me from getting those nasty sinus infections that used to plague my life.  </li>
            <li> The thing that is awful about it is that mold forms in the handle</li>
            <li> IT IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s messier than I expected. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> based on price, it was a great bargain and works fine.  Compared to other water pics that I priced this was by far the lowest price</li>
            <li> When my hygienist mentioned that I had a small pocket of inaccessible gumline around two teeth that might benefit from a waterpik, I took her advice and bought this.  First, don&#x27;t take seriously those pictures of a guy standing straight up over the sink with a smile on his face.  To use this pik, you need to be face down into the bowl of the sink with the water drooling out of the side of your mouth and onto your hand and back along the hose to the sink top.  And it&#x27;s overdesigned --- who needs to know how many milliliters of water you&#x27;re using?  Who needs 3 piks (yeah ... my wife is going to share this, yeah right)?  And that slinky-like hose takes real talent to get back to the way it was.  My first impression after using this thing reminded me of being given enemas as a child --- sure you felt cleansed when it&#x27;s over but is it worth the mess.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a gift for a friend. He loves it and says the pressure is great and this really works well compared to other water pik&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Stopped using dental floss and started to use this pressure dental wash. That stopped my bleeding gums.&lt;br /&gt;Great. Wopuld recomend it.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I had a WaterPik for over 10 years with great results.  But I have bought two in the last 4 months and both lasted for about 1 month before they lost all pressure.  The first one I bought off of Amazon, the supplier said contact the manufacturer.  I bought another one off of Amazon, not the same supplier.  This one I kept the box, I am going to call the manufacturer and hopefully they will stand behind their product because the supplier won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> this pic is excellent in every respect...you do have to hold the button in to stop the water - other than that it has always been recommended by my dentist ....so if you don&#x27;t like to floss -you have to go this route- you need to use it at least for 60 sec. three to four times a week to help your gums...</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old waterpik (which lasted many many years) this has a lot of power, enough to clean really good between teeth. Great value for the money. I would order this again!</li>
            <li> The unit cannot be covered unless the tip is removed;so I don&#x27;t do it. Looks like hell uncovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is too thick to easily revolve the tip when using in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m comparing the new one to old 25 yr one and yes they don&#x27;t build them like they used  to</li>
            <li> Flossing does not cut the mustard. This product makes me feel good about my dental hygiene. No more root canals for me.    Since other owners said the hose line was susceptible to breakage I got two personal size Water Piks vice the family size which would be stretched more. I will always have this product in my home.</li>
            <li> Works great once it starts.  Have to wiggle the two parts together to get a good seal and then it takes off.  Fits the counter perfectly.</li>
            <li> I had always wanted to try a WaterPik.  So I finally bought one here on Amazon.  As soon as I had it assembled and ready to go, as per the instructions, it leaked everywhere!  The unit never snapped on securely, no matter what I tried.  I also disliked how the cord goes from underneath the unit instead of behind it.  And the piece that you put into your mouth is where the OFF switch should be, rather than on the base unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing that Amazon and this vendor honored my return hassle-free.</li>
            <li> Hope this is really as effective as flossing... I find that distilled water doesn&#x27;t leave marks on this thing. Love love love love love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this waterpik last Dec.  It even got rid of tea stains.&lt;br /&gt;Went to have my teeth cleaned the other day and the pockets in my gums improved!&lt;br /&gt;Was afraid I would have to have a wisdom tooth pulled because of a pocket but that cleared.&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3&#x27;rd water pick.  I love it, but each one I&#x27;ve owned had to be replaced because the little tubing ends up breaking and seemingly can&#x27;t be repaired.</li>
            <li> This product, although poorly constructed, did a good job while it lasted! I bought this waterpik on March 9, 2005 and as of April 5, 2005 the motor is gone. What a rip off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik for several decades now, and while the effectiveness of the product -- excellent for oral irrigation and toughening the gums -- has been consistent, the design and quality of the product have faltered.  My first Waterpik, purchased in the early 1970s for sensitive gums on the recommendation of my dentist, lasted far longer than my more recent purchases.  Sometimes the motor gives out, and sometimes the hose gives out.    That said, no product lasts forever.  But what really annoys me is the design of the current product.  First of all, instead of two \\&quot;picks,\\&quot; Waterpik now gives you one \\&quot;pick\\&quot; and a \\&quot;tongue cleaner.\\&quot;  And when you attempt to purchase replacement picks, you must buy them with the tongue cleaner as well.  Furthermore, the design of the current model is too big and bulky, not neat and compact as it once was.  And lastly, the only way you can close the Waterpik is by removing the pick every time; the top will not fit over the bottom otherwise.    Bottom line:  It is still a good product, but it becomes increasingly inconvenient with each new iteration, and I think the market is ripe for the competition.      Update May 2008:  This Waterpik finally went the way of all moving devices (the cable from the implement broke), and I purchased the newer \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; model.  Many of the inconveniences of the \\&quot;Personal\\&quot; model have been eliminated in the Ultra:  The Ultra has a much smaller footprint, the jet is positioned better, and it has a top to cover the reservoir when not in use.  Even though it is about 50% more in cost, it is worth it to me (despite the blue reservoir, which doesn&#x27;t match any of my countertop accessories).</li>
            <li> The WP-60 has proven very satisfactory - easy to use; easy to clean; very effective.  The only important item missing from this product is the sub-gingival tip, which apparently can only be purchased in sets of two.  The regular &amp; tongue cleaning tip are excellent.  If you use soap as I do, remember to rinse it out after every use.  Otherwise you will collect junk in the tubing, tip and pump.  Same if you have hard water - protect your investment by running a soft water rinse.  Remember that you can force water under the gum if you have soft gums and the force is set high.  Start low - your gums will harden up from the pounding of the jet.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the WaterPik.  The problem is that it is extremely hard to clean.  The bowl is impossible to clean, residue from the water is caked on.  I have to constantly clean it to make sure mildew or mold does not form. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I could not live without this product, I think it is the best of the products offered.  But the manufacturer needs to consider the cleaning process.  Maybe it should be made out of aluminum. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It broke shortly after a month or so. I called the manufacturer after six months. All they asked was the serial number and sent me a brand new one right away.  It&#x27;s a grat product to deep clean your gum. My dentist used to complain about my gum at every visit but stopped since I started to use this product everyday. I bought serval of this product. The first one worked for two years. This was my second. I bought another professional model for my son around the same time and it works well without a problem so far.</li>
            <li> My Water Pik (WP-60W) is unreliable after 5 months.  The fault lies with the reservoir. After 5 months the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;reservoir began to shutter and would not pump water.  The only way to get the system to work is to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;apply pressure to the seal between the reservoir and the pump while you are trying to use the product.  Apparently the seal becomes unseated after a few uses.  Terrible quality Terrible design. I guess Waterpik did not perform enough qualty testing on this one.</li>
            <li> The best, AAA+++  Don&#x27;t buy the small portable unit.Does not work and is very weak.</li>
            <li> Ok...I hate to floss...........I was getting bad and worse reviews by my dentist..........pockets getting deeper, and warnings of expensive repairs ahead........dentist informed me he used Waterpik and his gums really responded.........Tried it.............INCREDIBLE improvement......a little  messy with the water, but after a really good brushing, watching those impacted little food particles floating into the sink with the water spray keeps me using it......and no more worry about bleeding gums........so I use it about every other day!</li>
            <li> PRO: Good strong flush between teeth and under gums from outside and from behind gums every night before bed. Add a little mouthwash to the water. Also half a teaspoon of bleach added to the water is a dentist secret for destroying bacteria in the mouth.  Then brush with a sonic toothbrush using paste not gel. The decay occurs at night while you sleep. Always waterpik before bedtime and keep your own teeth in your head for many years. Easy to use, lean over sink, let the water pour out of your mouth instead of splash on the mirror. I had braces in my early 20&#x27;s and not could imagine not using a waterpik 4x a day just to feel decent.  Anyone with braces should use a waterpik all the time, regardless of age. Nice, neat ritual for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: The power slide switch on the handle is a joke. You get maximum pressure or minimum pressure, no in-between until the motor starts to fade which will be in about 8-9 months. Never run water over the entire waterpik or it penetrates the housing and will weaken the motor almost overnight. Just wipe it off or use a scrub brush rinsed under the faucet to keep the nooks and crannys clean. Always turn the water bowl over and close the lid down on the housing or the entire waterpik will attract dust and grime very quickly risking water damage to the motor due to excessive cleaning. Expect to buy a new one every year for reasons listed here. It&#x27;s really cheap dental insurance so don&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I bought a WP-60W less than one year ago and the pump has already failed. It never did work well. It pumped intermittently with very low pressure or not at all.  It is a cheesy contraption at best in my opinion. Previously I had a WP-32W. It had 2 Pik Pocket Jet Tips 2 reservoirs Lg. &amp; Sm. and it lasted 10 years. Teledyne has stopped making this one. Go figure !!&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for an alternative obviously.</li>
            <li> I began using the Waterpik many years ago and highly recommended it to anyone who would listen.  Unfortunately the company changed a good thing into pure junk.  From day one it was time consuming to get the tank/reservoir to fit properly on the base.  I bought the unit December 15, 2009 and it&#x27;s July 2010, 7 months later, and my Waterpik now will only work on the lowest setting.  The rest of the settings only produce a loud noise and no water. Now comes the hassle again to get it replaced or repaired.&lt;br /&gt;If someone at Waterpik is listening, remember that reputation is everything.  Please revert back to \\&quot;the good old days\\&quot; when you made a decent product.</li>
            <li> We have two children in braces and really needed a better way to clean their teeth. Charged power brushes take care if surfaces well, but not in between, however with two settings - we can get hard to reach areas easily. it can get a little messy, but with practice- they are improving!</li>
            <li> Water Pik has the best water jet system that I have used.  The problem with it is that you can plan for the unit to fail in some way in 3-4 years.  The usual failure mode is the plastic hose breaks when you least expect it and you know it because it usually gives you a good soaking in a couple of seconds.  The most recent failure mode is the \\&quot;on-off\\&quot;  switch stopped working on my old wp-60w and I called water pik and they apologized, but since it was out of warranty (1 year), they couldn&#x27;t help me.  The real difficulty is that there&#x27;s no way to repair these units.  Fortunately, this latest failure occurred with the on-off switch failing in the on mode, so it really didn&#x27;t die, but it made using the water pik a bit inconvenient. I bought a new one because it&#x27;s only a matter of time before my old one fails in the usual manner.  I like these units because they are small and portable and I always take one with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> My first WaterPik was purchased in the 1970s and lasted almost 30 years before the pump finally gave out.  It was the family model and came with four plastic jet tips that also lasted 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend bought me this model as a replacement, and right away I noticed a couple of things I didn&#x27;t like:  first, there was only one jet tip plus a tongue cleaner (which I have yet to use), and second, there isn&#x27;t enough room in the base to wind the cord properly.  The second point annoys me every time I use the unit, as it won&#x27;t sit flat when the cord is wound up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used my new WaterPik very much--no more than 50 times--and the last time I tried to detach the jet tip from the hose, it broke off at the end.  Now my Pik is useless, and currently Amazon does not carry replacement tips.  So with shipping from an outside vendor, I&#x27;ll end up having to pay approximately half the price of the entire unit just to get replacement tips.</li>
            <li> Works great, new like said, recommend seller</li>
            <li> This is my second of the same model, the original having lasted for ten years.  It has always done exactly what the literature and instructions said it would.  Only two complaints -     1. It should be more repairable.  A simple thing like a broken output tube is almost impossible to fix, even though a replacement part is sold, because the end of the tube attached to the unit may have lost its flexibility. In this event it splits when repair is attempted.  2. Certain mouthwashes, or too concentrated a mouthwash solution, can destroy it.  Follow the instructions religiously!</li>
            <li> I had the portable Water Pik and I hated it.  It broke in less than 6 months and it was difficult to handle and it needed to be refilled over and over for one good cleaning.  This one is just perfect as the spray volume is easily adjustable and works very well.  The basin for the water is the right amount of water for one good cleaning.  The only little thing is that it is tough to put the wand back into the base for storing but other than that, it works just right.</li>
            <li> When I got brace, my orthodontist recommended one of these machine to keep my teeth and gum clean. He was right. This machine is inexpensive but works well for what it is designed for. I used it every evening to plush out the food particles and build up between teeth, brace and under the gum line. It leave my mouth feel fresh and clean after brushing the teeth as well. There are a few issues with the unit obviously. This thing is definitely louder than your average bathroom accessory but no worse than the hair dryer. People has to understand that this small unit has to compress water to generate the pressure needs at the tip of the handle. The other thing that annoys me a bit is that there is no cover for the water tank so it collects dust on top so I have to rinse it out every other day. I don&#x27;t take it out and store it because it is a waste of time if you are going to use it every day and it may also cause a leak at the seal. The last issue is the short hose which you need to uncoil it to get it to your mouth. Other than that, it seems to hold up for 2+ years so far. I think that people also do not know how to store the handle correctly to avoid water draining out of the tank, I have no such problem. As far as the hose leak, don&#x27;t yank it hard like a spring, just uncoil it and it should last a lot longer. I tend to agree that the hose should be more flexible and should be another 6\\&quot; longer. For the low cost of the unit assuming it lasts 2 years, it is a great deal to keep your teeth and gum healthy to avoid much more costly bills from the dentists, even if you have dental insurance. Mine comes with two tips so my wife can share the unit as well making it even more cost effective.</li>
            <li> Even more than my toothbrush, I rely on my WaterPik totally (I&#x27;m only sorry they can&#x27;t make a travel version for out of the country that has enough power).  This was a replacement and it&#x27;s terrific...as always.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought me one of these last year - I&#x27;ve never had a waterpik before.    It does a nice, refreshing job of cleaning the teeth and gums.    But the design of the case is really pathetic, and anyone who even tried using the machine before marketing it would see that.      Nothing fits together to stay.  The part that you hold in your hand sits loosely in its storage receptacle, and the curled hose leading to the water reservoir needs to be carefully tucked, or the springiness of it makes the device hop out of its receptacle when preparing to put it away.    The device heads (there are two, one for gums and one for cleaning the tongue) sit loosely in holes in the base.  Whenever you open the case, they fly out, and I have to retrieve them from the bathroom floor.  Since I&#x27;ve usually removed my glasses at this point, it&#x27;s a real pain.    The filled reservoir fits loosely onto the top, so that sometimes you don&#x27;t have it properly in place, and you have to \\&quot;fiddle\\&quot; with it to get it properly seated or the water won&#x27;t flow.    The little switch that changes the force of the water is so loose that I am continually turning it down or off simply by virtue of holding it and working it around my mouth.  They should click firmly at each level to be more user-friendly.    The drained reservoir, turned upside down, creates the lid to the unit when storing, and likewise, it simply sits loosely on the bottom, so that if you pick it up that way, you send everything flying.    Finally, the cord is stored wound around the bottom of the unit, and has no clip or anything to keep it in place, so once wound and ready to replace in its storage place, one must have one hand around the top and bottom - to keep everything inside from opening and flying apart, and one hand on the wound cord, to keep it from unwinding and dangling after you as you take it to its storage place.    I&#x27;m not an engineer, but I think a few little snap-in devices or hinged clips would make me much more enthusiastic about using it.</li>
            <li> Our old WaterPic wore out and we replaced it with a cordless rechargeable flosser. That was a waste of money! We went back to the real WaterPic and it&#x27;s so good to really get all those pockets in the gums cleaned out again. I would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> This is our second WaterPic WP-60W.  The original is still working great after 10 plus years.  This purchase is for use aboard our new motorhome.  They provide excellent results.  Easy to use.  Easy to clean.  Stores away in a small space.  I would recommend one for everyone who like to keep their teeth.</li>
            <li> I have had WaterPiks before. They only needed to be replaced when the hose developed a leak. The older WaterPiks used to scoot across our granite countertop. This new WaterPik had rubber feet that prevents this. Note that the WaterPik with the regular tip is great (used at lesser pressure than on the teeth) for cleaning the tongue; food trapped in the pores of the tongue is a major source of bad breath. Note: the WaterPik is not a replacement for but rather is an adjunct to flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li> Up until I purchased this product I had two designed for travel.  I kept one in  Florida and one here in NY so I wouldn&#x27;t have to carry it back and forth.  The  NY model was less than a year old and died -  it simply wouldn&#x27;t take a charge and  I was very unhappy.  I have the kind of teeth where I literally don&#x27;t dare be  without this product.  I imagine the company would have made good on it but I truly  didn&#x27;t have the time to pursue it and then mail it and so I just bought this stationary model.    I am very happy with it.  My husband has had one here in NY for years and it has always functioned well.  So far mine is perfect.   The adjustment is better on this one than the older models as it is more nuanced and you can dial up a very soft spray or one that will really hurt your gums if they&#x27;re not in good shape. I tend  to have difficulties with batteries and chargers anyway so this was the perfect  solution for me.  I would happily recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have had an older version of this WaterPic for about 20 years and it worked till 1/1/11. The tubbing just stated falling apart (the motor still works, LOL). I am very pleased with the new one I just got from Amazon. It is quieter and seems to work smooter that the old one and still has all the water preasue I need. The blue bowl that sits on top of the unit holds all the water I need for one complete use. I got the WaterPik WP-60W Personal Dental Water Jet System. Now I&#x27;m set for another 20 years, LOL.</li>
            <li> I rate the WaterPik WP-60W that I just received today 5 stars.  I don&#x27;t understand the low ratings and complaining from others.  This is the third WaterPik I have purchased and love this one.  I think it runs smoother and quieter than the other two models I owned.  It works great.  And I like the new design and how it works with my hand and fingers.  My one and only complaint about the WaterPik is about the coiled hose.  The last two I owned that is where the problem lies.  The hose broke off on the last two I owned.  But I&#x27;m not complaining because the WaterPik lasted well over the 2 year warranty and keeps my gums and teeth fresh and clean.  And for under 40 dollars, you can&#x27;t beat that.  I&#x27;ll buy my fourth WaterPik and my sixth and seventh and so on.  Buy it if you are interested in keeping your teeth and gums clean or if someone you know has recommended it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this item 4 years ago and used it consistently for 1 year. I recently started using it again and the hose crumbled.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was that this version is quieter than previous WaterPiks I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Mine came with almost every version of pik tip, but only one of each and it would be more practical to have 2 regular tips in there.  Probably to make more money but to buy 1 replacement regular tip is pricey, about $11.  I didn&#x27;t think much of the rubber tipped ortho pik since water trickled through it.  The tongue cleaner worked OK but you had to use a scrubbing motion with the edge of the cleaner. I think scrubbing the tongue with a regular toothbrush with toothpaste gets better results. The amount of water that squirted through the normal tip at low pressure was more than necessary so I can understand why some people thought the reservoir was insufficient but for me the reservoir was enough. The highest setting had excellent pressure. The only thing that bothers me is that the part of the water tube closest to the machine still raps away at the machine when it is being used at a particular angle; maybe they&#x27;ll have some tube extension that projects the tube away from the machine while in use would help.</li>
            <li> The unit works fine and has a good range of pressure controls.  The water container isn&#x27;t too great a design.  It&#x27;s a bit flimsy, is far too large and isn&#x27;t that easy to remove and reset. It&#x27;s a little tricky to make a good seal when installing the water container after filling it. One doesn&#x27;t need a large volume of water for each use and the water should be replaced each time, so why have such a large water container?</li>
            <li> I have been using a WaterPik for many years.  This is probably my 4th one.  You can brush your teeth all day long and never remove the food that gets lodged between your teeth.  The WaterPik takes care of that.  I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> We have another style of WaterPik flosser and bought this one for travel.  We should have spent the extra money and  repeated the better style.  It is very noisy and you easily spray water all over using it.  I do nots recommend this style.</li>
            <li> I purchased my WaterPik from Amazon , and got a very good price. I didn&#x27;t purchase the newer model since no sinus irrigator adapter is available for it from either WaterPik or 3rd party suppliers such as Sinupulse. I like the ability to rotate the adapters with your thumb&amp;finger without turning your hand/wrist. Overall I am satisfied with it with only 2 minor caveats . The slider switch on the handle which controls the speed/strength can easily be moved inadvertently during use. ( You could tape it to your favorite position, or simply learn not to touch it while in use)A better design in my opinion would be to put the control on the base unit instead of the handle. Lastly,it is somewhat louder than I expected, and might disturb a light sleeper.</li>
            <li> no one will believe why I use this device0000anf how000000</li>
            <li> Group,  I just purchased a WaterPik, premium model.  Bought it because I wanted to strip it for the water pump.  R&amp;D thing.  Guess what, since at home why not try what it was designed for! Teeth.  Really, there is nothing you can buy on the market for $40 that pumps from 5 psi to 80 psi, cool.  Plus it cleans teeth. Let&#x27;s test it on teeth.    In it&#x27;s real world use I was blasting out crap, last nights rib dinner, plus some stange stuff in the sink bowl.  Then came the little rubber tip, deep pocket cleaning, and my mouth was sore at the higher pressure levels. I believe my dentist would approve.  For $40 what are you expecting, a industrial WaterPik capable of 10,000 mean hours before failure?  We are talking about a $40 product that is warranted for 2 yars.  Get a clue!  It&#x27;s the purchased point sale, that has driven the this product to it&#x27;s dismall review, not the product.  WaterPik should step up, charge around $100 and get back in the Sonic Toothbrush game, $70-$150, and produce a real product.      Another thougt.  If WaterPik had a great product, charged $150 or more, would consumers come back...yes.  If WaterPik charge $39.95 per item, sold in big box stores, once, and never had another repeat customer....     db</li>
            <li> I like it fine however it quit working yesterday and will not pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pump is working but is very noisey.Please get back to me as to a solution to this problem as I cant get it to work.</li>
            <li> You would be simply amazed at the particles of food this thing finds. I wish I bought this thing many years ago, would have saved a lot of dentist bills.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that I had years ago but i dont remember it still squirting water once the wand is turned to the off position. Makes for little bit of a mess. I like the results my gums are getting already. So I would still recommend buying, just keep wand in your mouth at all times until machine itself it turned off! :D</li>
            <li> Purchased WaterPik WP-60.  Perfect size for bathroom sink top. Certainly does the job.  Would have preferred to have jet stream pressure setting on the console rather than the handle. Reason being, it is too easy to move to a higher pressure while \\&quot;water picking\\&quot;.(?)  The tongue cleaner is a joke. Would not use it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my WaterPik. It took some time to get used to using it without totally wetting down the bathroom as well as the cat, who insists upon helping.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This device will really flush out the stuff from between your teeth, and scrub your tounge in a most pleasant way!</li>
            <li> IT DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO.....GETS MY TEETH AND GUMS CLEAN AND DISLODGES FOOD PARTICLES.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product acquisted wasn&#x27;t compatible with my country voltage. Altough it&#x27;s the same voltage, the electric components doesn&#x27;t work properly here. Therefor, the product is unusable. Be aware if you are a foreigner.</li>
            <li> Look at the photo carefully. See the tub up on top where the water goes? It&#x27;s not attached permanently. It just kind of wobbles up there with a small gasket around the hole in the bottom where the water is fed into the motor. In other words, if you were to remove or bump the tub while it has water in it, it will spill over everything. Also, you can&#x27;t leave any water in it and place the mouth piece in its holder or set it on your counter for a moment, as it begins to slowly drain water if it&#x27;s not held higher than the level of the water--a syphoning effect occours.&lt;br /&gt;The tube that extends from the unit to the mouthpiece is cheap and way too short (hardly 3 feet) and it&#x27;s so strongly coiled it ends up hardly being able to reach 2 feet.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is very loud and sounds like an old rusty boat motor and shakes itself around my counter. (I learned setting it on a towell helps to immobilize it, and quiet it a bit, which is good because I&#x27;ll also have a towell ready in case I bump into the tub.)&lt;br /&gt;Why then do I use it? Well, because it actually works! Once I mastered the art of using this half-baked contraption, I found my mouth, teeth, and gums are cleaner than ever. The stream of water it puts out is very powerfull and \\&quot;Piks\\&quot; up where brushing and flossing leave off. I&#x27;d gladly buy a better brand if one existed, but to my knowledge, WaterPik are the only ones making such a machine. I think that explains why WaterPik has cut so many corners making this thing--no competition! No one else wants to make them.</li>
            <li> I have had water pik&#x27;s before and everyone I&#x27;ve had has been pretty good including this one.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m an idiot.  My 3rd Water Pik has given up the ghost after 2 months.  The first two started leaking water like crazy at the handle; nothing came out the tip, it all came out in the handle.  The latest one leaks water and so it&#x27;s obviously an electrical hazard.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe all the bad reviews having used WaterPiK for over 20 years so I went ahead and bought one anyway, what a disappointment.  Within a week it started to stutter and lost water pressure now two months later almost all the pressure is gone.  I could have saved some money had I just disregarded all those glowing reviews from questionable sources.  I am not sure just what we old time WaterPiK users are to do.  Anyone know of a product that works? Please email me if you do.</li>
            <li> I recently had my wisdom teeth out, and had issues keeping the sockets clean of debris. Curved syringes did okay, but I felt that it didn&#x27;t quite get everything out of there. It got to the point where I was afraid to eat because cleaning the sockets were such a pain! This unit did a fantastic job of keeping the extraction site nice and clean and free of infection, not to mention allowing me to eat normally after my oral surgery, not just ice cream. I did use the Waterpik at about an inch away from the extraction sites and used the lowest setting possible to avoid dislodging clots for the first week.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a system I had had for many years. Because I liked the original I expected to like the new one. My wants are simple and they didn&#x27;t try to make the new one sing and dance.</li>
            <li> The product functions works exactly as product description. Its price is reasonable for its class. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> We are addicted to the WaterPik.  Everyone in our family uses one.  It is always amazing how much food gets embeded between the teeth that the toothbrush even an electric toothbrush does not remove. We have been using the WaterPik for 20 years.  This is our 3rd.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality of this water pik/ flosser and its not as loud as my former one. I love the fact that the water basin is blue since we have hard water and the clear plastic one would look rusty after a period of time.</li>
            <li> The waterpik 60 (larger receptacle is a must) works so well you can actually reverse the beginning of cavities and gum disease.  Whenever you feel sensitivity of any kind between teeth or especially on gum line, just keep irrigating it daily with a capful of mouthwash or hydrogen peroxide added to the water. Otherwise, once or twice a week focusing on gum line, caps or any other type of dental apparatus works so well the dentist commends me at every visit on my amazing dental hygiene. I purchased the smaller waterpik as a replacement for my long-time larger one but it was simply too small and I had to fill it at least twice to get the amount of irrigation needed to get everything clean.</li>
            <li> Product works fine but motor is extremely loud.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer pointed out, potential flooding and definite noise have to be dealt with, but it&#x27;s not too difficult to learn the tricks needed to keep water going where you want it.  My current one, several years old, has finally burst the water feeder coil, and has a lot of miles on it, so I dropped in to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked on my Pik, despite its flaws, because it really finishes up a teeth cleaning job.  I have some pockets along my gum line that flossing and my Sonicare (which I love) just don&#x27;t clean well enough, making for some nasty breath and potential greater problems, but the Water Pik takes no prisoners.  Gunk is gone!&lt;br /&gt;The Pik also gives the gums a great massage, and when I&#x27;m done, I know I&#x27;ve done everything possible to keep my teeth happy and firmly connected to the rest of me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik to replace one that I had for several years.  This one is not as elaborate as the one I previously had but that is o.k.  I felt I didn&#x27;t need all the parts and attachments I had before since I didn&#x27;t use them. (I didn&#x27;t need the orthodontic or denture attachment since I  do not need those).  So I bought the one with less bells and whistles.  I like this one.  It does not leak as the other one did and it takes up less space on the counter.  The  only thing is the reservoir is also the  cover.  So after using it, you turn over the reservoir and put it on as the cover. The part I don&#x27;t like is that it is all wet from the water so you either have to dry it with a towel or let it air dry for several hours.  On the whole, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought the waterpik for an aunt, unfortunately she plugged it directly to 220 and burnt it.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these water piks. The tubing over time hardens and rottens. I would recommend that you find another material to manufacture them with or provide the means to switch out the tubing when it starts to deteriorate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Casper</li>
            <li> Compared to the same item (brand, device) I have owned for 4-5 years, it sure seems to be a &amp;#34;light-weight&amp;#34; version!  The plastic water reservoir is made of this transparent, &amp;#34;bendy&amp;#34; plastic.  I always have to try 2-3 times to get the rubber out-go mechanism to &amp;#34;seat&amp;#34; into the hole in the base so the water will squirt out.  There are degrees (from stronger to weaker) of water strength markers on the handle of the squirter.  The weakest degree is much stronger than my old device.  Kind of important because the strongest degree is quite harsh &amp; feels as if it could drill a hole in soft tissue!  Makes me wonder if there is much quality control or testing of the individual machines.  How could there be such a difference in my old one &amp; the new?&lt;br /&gt;I try to buy US made products as often as possible and thought that was what I did this time.  But on underside of machine it says &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34;.  Busy people do not always have the time to pack the product up for returning.  So, how many times do we just suffer the idiosyncrasies, get used to the thing and hope it will last a few years??</li>
            <li> Nothing cleans your teeth like a Water-Pik! Or your mirror, or your walls, or your floor..... Trigger doesn&#x27;t always shut the flow all the way off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to replace a 12 year old WaterPic. &lt;br /&gt;This unit is much quieter and it&#x27;s design makes it much easier to clean and store. the rounded surfaces of the reservoir dry easier and protects the whole unit from dust when stored.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve had and the dentist reported that my gums are much better than since my last visit and the hygenist was happy too. Thanks Water Pik</li>
            <li> WOW.. I read all the reviews but still purchased based on rave reviews of a close friend.  It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever owned, it is quite addictive,and I love it...  Great price and great service  Thank you</li>
            <li> The WaterPik dental health aid product I purchased replaced one I&#x27;ve used for a number of years. I bought this brand because I was very well satisfied and comfortable using the my previous unit.</li>
            <li> I bought my first WaterPik ages ago, maybe for college?  It was great.  But it got old and leaky and so I put it away, pack rat that we are.  When my hygienist suggested I pull it out again, I discovered that it was in terrible shape.  Despite some of the bad reviews, I chose this model to order and must say I love it.  Yes, you need to begin with hot water; Yes, you need to make sure the tank is surely seated on the base; and Yes, you need to keep the pik in your mouth with your mouth closed and over the sink.  It will blast away those little bit of food you miss with your toothbrush and floss.</li>
            <li> I have been buying as family gifts and using WP-60 higher end models of the WaterPik for the past 5 years - approximately 17 units.  Every unit has been used habitually on the average of at least 3 times per week.  Only one unit had lasted for almost 15 months before the handle and tubing began leaking resulting in hardly any water pressure at all.  Every other unit failed in the exact same way lasting less than a year.  All units cannot be repaired and have no replaceable parts reasonably available.  Even on sale, this product is too expensive for an expected useful life of one year at a frequency of 3 uses per week.  This product is very cheaply made in that it fails to return a reasonable value.  Yesterday, my newest WP-60 tube and handle finally broke down exactly like its predecessors.  I put this into use new only 8 months ago.  I am now going to look for alternatives elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be a smarter consumer than the marketers.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience in owning water picks over the past two decades, I would rank the WaterPik WP-60W as having the worst quality in my experience.  Its lowest-power setting for the water stream is too low to be valuable.  It has several power settings for the water stream.  Any more forceful setting than the lowest setting is too strong, i.e., probably has the potential to damage gingiva.  I have had this instrument for only one day, and I have tentatively decided to return it.  The box says that it was made in China.  I can only speculate that the designer and/or manufacturer intended it for a species with more durable gingiva than mine.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Water Pik in about 1970 at the recommendation of my dentist at that time.  I think that I am on my 5th one now.  I think that they have each lasted about 5 years on the average.  Like others have mentioned, generally the hoses fail.  In more recent years they have not allowed us to get hose parts and repair this ourselves.  There have been years when I did not replace a failed Water Pik.  However, I keep coming back to using Water Pik and am hooked on using it.  I am especially dependant on Water Pik for a good cleaning of the few dental food pockets that I have.  It has also helped me to have healthy gums.</li>
            <li> The product is light weight, easy to use and does a thorough job of cleaning. Fair priced through Amazon. Prefer this model to a previously owned one in that it&#x27;s less noisy.</li>
            <li> The Water Pik  is an acceptable product.  I had ordered a White  unit, however, a Blue item was sent; same product,just different color. I will use the Blue item however, hopefully future orders will pay closer attentio to the color ordered!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not perfect but it works better than the last one I had (that one held up much longer than I thought possible). Anyway, I can&#x27;t live without it - it&#x27;s the only way my mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace older model that had broken hose. Not as easy to attach tip as old one and have to remove tip to invert reservoir when not using the system. Hose needs to be longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 25 year old model.  There has been no incremental improvement over time.  It is VERY noisy.  The wand handle must be positioned \\&quot;just so.\\&quot; and there is no cover for the large tank. &lt;br /&gt;I would not buy or recomend this model.</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders for my dental care.  Have to be careful what setting you use it on and the direction.  It lifted my cap off. :-) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only problem is the need to make frequent solutions.</li>
            <li> I have always loved predecessors of this product, but this one is terrible.  Its bulky and vibrates terribly.  When making your buying choices, select another model number, I wish I had.</li>
            <li> I am using it everyday and am enjoying it and it is very helpful to me.  That&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Stickles</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my Waterpik! My dentist recommended that I get a dental irrigator and I am wishing I got one sooner.  Okay, it can be a bit messy.  But, it is definately worth wiping up some water for how well it cleans.</li>
            <li> We have been using waterpiks for many years. My first Professional model pump finally got too weak after hose and handle replacements. This new model is lighter, but still pumps great and I like the newer interface for the tank. I can&#x27;t imagine why one would buy the more expensive model, since they have the same pump and do basically the same thing. Still a great product.</li>
            <li> I had never used a waterpik before, but my dentist recommended one to me.  The first time I used it I was surprised for two reasons.  The first was how loud it was!  The second was that I had never had a home cleaning that was so good.  It was so great I didn&#x27;t mind the fact that I needed ear plugs when it was turned on.  Okay it&#x27;s not quite that loud.    Here are the things I didn&#x27;t like.  When gripping the nozzle I found myself accidentally disconnecting it because my fingers were too high.  If I lowered my grip I would accidentally lower the pressure.  Both things were easy enough to get around, but annoying.    Then two days later it would only work at a low pressure which was both dissapointing as well as useless.  Two days!  Not that I was too surprised.  When the motor is on it seems to pump violently.    Well, I bought the WP-100.  I&#x27;ve used it once, and love it so far.  It&#x27;s quiet, and the nozzle is easier to use.  Pay the extra few bucks and get the WP-100.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  There is nothing better for cleaning around crowns, braces and other dental work.  A WaterPik is in no way a substitue for brushing and flossing, but it is the perfect adjunct for complete oral health care.</li>
            <li> The WaterPic I purchased does an excellent job of irriagating my mouth and removing particles from between my teeth and gums</li>
            <li> This unit replaced an older one with a broken hose, but I will buy again when this hose breaks. (Usually 5-6 years)</li>
            <li> Whatever happened to the portable Water Pik that came in a carrying case and was a mini version of the standard unit?  It had a rechargable battery that would power it for a few days without having to hookup to electricity.  Dana</li>
            <li> Smooth new machine. Less noise when is on. Much better than the last generation. I have it for almost 2 month kind of soon review however for now is great.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I purchase the WaterPik as I have the early stages of gum disease.  The WaterPik cleans my teeth and gums effectively.  It is compact, easy to use and stows away under the sink easily.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used WaterPik for years and truly believe it has saved my teeth from gum disease.  Wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand</li>
            <li> I was advised by my dental hygienist to try the WaterPik.  I got the basic cordless and it was ok but, it stopped working after a couple of weeks.  By then I was sold on the idea of the WaterPik so, I went back to CVS and spent the extra cash to get the Ultra cordless.  Loved it!  I didn&#x27;t send in the warranty because I trusted the WaterPik name and certainly the Ultra couldn&#x27;t be problematic. The Ultra stopped working about a month later. I was following all the instructions about charging etc. By now I am addicted to using the Ultra so, I went back again to CVS and got another ultra and filled out the warrantuy just in case. Two months later, still following the care instructions, it stopped working. I mentioned this to the hygienist yesterday and she was shocked.  I told her I purchased an Ultra for my son at CVS when I visited in another part of the state. I said I would call him that night and see if his was still working.  I did and his is working, and he loves it. I will contact the WaterPik people and see if they will honor their 3-year warranty. If I get one that works, I would rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> REplaced a model I had for 15 years.  This one is not as handy to turn on, handle or adjust. Has more pressure then old one</li>
            <li> WaterPik has always been an excellent product and I highly recommend it.  There is no competition.  You can rely on its performance.</li>
            <li> If you are undecided about purchasing a WaterPik, do yourself a favor and buy one. The water flosser cleans in places where dental floss and brushing can&#x27;t. My overall oral health has improved significantly since purchasing one of these and combined with regular dentist visits, daily brushing, flossing and Breath RX Anti-Bacterial Mouth Rinse, my gums are on their way to a complete recovery. I can&#x27;t say eough about how much this product has changed my life. I will never be without one again. It takes a commitment to use it but once you incorporate it into your daily routine, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever lived without it.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik WP-60W Water Flosser is a mini dental treatment each and every day.  With regular use expect stronger gums and healthy dental check-ups.  The WaterPik WP-60W Water Flosser is a must have, essential product.  I am not with the ADA but would definitely recommend its daily use.</li>
            <li> using it.  Have used for years.  Work well.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this.  I bought to replace our old one.  It is a different type, but appears to work well.  Better than leaving the head of the wand stored outside the machine.</li>
            <li> I bought a WaterPik in about 1963, and it ran fine till about 2001, when the pump wore out.  Teledyne, the new owner of the brand, said no replacement parts were available.  I bought a new WaterPik, expecting another 40 years of use -- silly me!  The switch malfunctioned in a couple weeks, and I exchanged the Pik for another one.  This one ran okay till a few weeks ago, when it lost its ability to provide pulses of water at more than one setting.  Yesterday, even that setting produced insufficient pressure to serve any purpose.  And the water in the reservoir simply ran out the bottom of the unit.  I assume the pump leaked.  Anyway, the firm listed on the WaterPik web site as the repair place in Dallas says it does no repairs, but only ships units under warranty back to Teledyne.  Anybody know another brand of oral irrigator that I can try?</li>
            <li> This is the second order I&#x27;ve had for this product. After a short period of time the force of water was cut in half, and I have not been able to correct this problem. It&#x27;s frustrating and doubt I would buy again this particular water-pick. .</li>
            <li> works well. The only problem is the water tank does not fit on easily, but or else it is fine.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my very old waterpik and found this on online. The next model up was available locally, but could not find this model which saved me over $10. It works fine but is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use it twice a day and we find it very effective it is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> The old one wore out. This one works just fine; don&#x27;t like the speed handle as well as the old one.</li>
            <li> This little machine is useful.  It does what it is designed for very well. Because of that I gave it two stars.  However I cannot get passed how poorly designed the little pump is.  Ours broke after a couple of years of very light use.  The nipple on the pump housing which holds the hose snapped 2 mm from the housing, leaving the balance of the nipple inside the hose.  It cannot be repaired, glued together and they don&#x27;t carry that spare part.  &amp;#34;it is not supposed to be opened&amp;#34;, they claim.  The vibration created by the pump, or water impulses inside the hose transmitted enough vibrations to the hose to break-off the nipple.  It is possible that they redesigned it recently, or that the more expensive models are better built.  However we are done with Waterpik.  At the minimum stay away from this model.  The dental hygienist twice a year and the low tech floss string daily will do fine.  I am fed up with these cheaply built plastic gizmos that are flooding the market and don&#x27;t last. Once burnt twice shy.</li>
            <li> The best. Your mouth feels really clean. Although it does tickle! You don&#x27;t want to throw away your string floss though.</li>
            <li> I bought this WaterPik for my sister who really uses it all of the time</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk!  I had it for a full day -- just long enough to throw out my sales receipt, of course -- before the hose popped off the handle, shooting water all over the bathroom.  I&#x27;m not sure why Waterpik expected the hose to stay on the handle in the first place; it looks like it must have been secured with spit -- or prayers -- as there is no tape or gromit of any kind to secure it.  Apparently a \\&quot;handle replacement kit\\&quot; is available from the manufacturer, and I have inquired how I might order one.  I suspect Waterpik does a thriving business selling these, as the hose/handle connection is so flimsy it seems sure to fail -- in my case, within one day.  My advice: save your sales receipt in case you need to return your unit to the store where you bought it, or you require warranty service.  Pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM (written one week later): Well, I was wrong.  You DON&#x27;T need to save your receipt, unless you want to return a failed WP-60 to the store.  I contacted Waterpik at their website, explained the problem -- and one week later they sent a whole new unit.  I must say, they certainly stand behind their (faulty) product!  (Perhaps it helps if you point out, as I did, that if the problem of the hose detaching is common enough to warrant a topic on their customer support page, perhaps they might engineer a more effective solution!)  Does the new unit work?  The hose appears to be affixed more securely to the handle, but I am still using my first unit, as I devised a simple but effective solution while Waterpik was making their move: just by wrapping a length of Scotch plastic tape around the detached hose, you increase the circumference of the hose enough to make a snug fit with the little white plastic collar tucked in the handle where the hose attaches.  So you just remove the collar from the handle, slide the collar on the hose now reinforced with the tape, plug the hose into the handle, then reinsert the collar so the tab fits under the lip of the handle.  Again, one wonders how Waterpik stays in business effecting such elaborate solutions to such simple (but critical) design flaws; it&#x27;s like an auto manufacturer giving you a whole new car because they had installed faulty lug nuts on one of your wheels.  Another design flaw that shouldn&#x27;t exist on such a mature product: the irrigation tips really need a gnurled grip so you can turn them in your mouth easily when they get wet while in use.  Beyond this, the motor works (so far), and Waterpik does stand behind the product.  One also has to wonder, however, what would happen to Waterpik&#x27;s market share if a Japanese company who sweats the details like Panasonic decided to make a plug-in oral irrigator...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND ADDENDUM (written a few months later): Grrr -- the cleaning tip broke this morning when I tried to remove it from the hose.  You&#x27;ll need to keep a spare or two in the house, and I understand that Waterpik only sells the tip with a tongue cleaner, which I don&#x27;t need.  Again, yet another fault in what should by now be a mature product...e.

            <li> I bought this for my mother.  Her old one had broken.  She is thrilled with this product.  It is the perfect size for her and it performs beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Waterpik about a week. I bought it to use with the Waterpik Gentle Sinus Rinse attachment. And it Works very well and does not leak, and the motor sounds as expected. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only improvement is to make the motor run well at its lowest setting as it does with it mid to high settings. The Lowest setting seem to strain the motor, so i just avoid that setting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product since I have gum disease and need to floss.  I always had trouble flossing and this product seemed to be a good solution.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I read some of the reviews before buying this product on Amazon. The reviews were not necessarily glowing but okay. I should have paid more attention to the reviews since they are not wrong. The problems that I ran into are as follows... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) There is no switch to shut off the water stream without turning the system off. So if you move the spayer from your mouth, water will spray across the room. At the lowest setting the stream is strong... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) As other people have noticed, the WaterPik has a vibration problem. The WaterPik periodically starts vibrating and it makes use very difficult. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since my dentist is now recommending an oral irrigation system, I need to look at a different brand. I am now considering the portable Panasonic irrigator. It is not perfect, but I have a number of Panasonic products, at home, which I am happy with...</li>
            <li> I use it for the water pic function in addition to the sinus rinse tool I purchased.  Works great!!</li>
            <li> I use the WP 60 for nasal irrigation and I have found it to be excellent. It has a button I can use to stop the stream and transfer over to the other side. It has a stronger stream than the waterpic that is sold only as a nasal irrigator and I like that also. It does make a lot of noise when I use it but other than that I think it works great as a nasal rinse machine. I did have to pick up the nasal &amp;quot;wand&amp;quot; from another vendor but it attaches fine to the WP60.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my WaterPik!  I wore the first one out, so had to get another one as quickly as possible.  When I see all the food that the WaterPik rinses out from between my teeth, I&#x27;m always amazed.  I know that flossing couldn&#x27;t get that stuff all out.  When I first started using it, my gums bled quite a bit, but they don&#x27;t any more.</li>
            <li> I have owned this type product for years and this company has the best one going. The only problems I have found with this product is removing the pic when the reservoir is in place, it is a little cumbersome. The other problem is the power stream adjustment is on the pic so it can easily be moved. I liked it better when it was on the main body and once you get the strength you like you don&#x27;t have to bother with it again. Those relatively small problems make this product a very good value and does a great job at cleaning the gums and teeth..</li>
            <li> Powerful jetting action for getting to those problem areas. Easy to operate and has all the necessary tips to deep clean past the gumline. Great value!</li>
            <li> waterpik is very functional, good pressure and irrigates under crowns well. sometimes a little water leaks out when in use which prevents me from giving it 5 stars</li>
            <li> My previous experience with the hand-held flossers was not good.  They didn&#x27;t last long and were expensive.  This water flosser has so far worked well and is more powerful and effective than the hand-held.</li>
            <li> Works great, really flushes out all the food that flossing and brushing misses. This unit replaces one that wore out after many years.</li>
            <li> This older type of waterPik has the larger container and stronger pulse with compared to the newer type of Waterpik. In addition, the price is the lowest I can find. Using it everyday will keep your teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and Love it!!! It makes my whole mouth feel super clean. I can see how it wouldn&#x27;t be practical for taking it on trips...which is understandable (and that&#x27;s why they make small hand held ones). I have super sensitive gums and often times when I floss or brush my gums bleed. I feel like this product gets the job done with out all the mess. It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to at first ( I squirted myself in the face a couple of times) but is worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> As with others, mine started to leak at the handle in 3 or 4 months.  So I tried to do what I did with the last one I had (also a Water pik)--I tried to open the handle to replace the cheap plastic tube that goes from the pump to the handle.  In a crass exhibit of planned obsolescence, this one is sealed so that you have to break the handle to get it open.  Once open, I found, as I expected, the cheap plastic tube had cracked, thereby leaking most of the water into my hand when I used it.  At this point, I thought about super-gluing it together, but realized that I really hated this thing and Water pik in general for duping me into replacing with their product the one I had that lasted 10 years.    Don&#x27; buy this one, and if you find one with a plastic tube, determine if you can replace the tube yourself.  If not, your machine has a lifetime of at most a year, and probably less.</li>
            <li> American design, Chinese manufacture.  Plastic hose came off handle first time I tried to use it.  I secured the hose with tape, which seems to work ok, except that I cannot store the handle in the base.  As a tooth/gum cleaner, it works great, if a little messy (water everywhere).  If you buy it, just be aware that you are buying a Chinese made product.</li>
            <li> It is light-weight, and it operates more powerfully and quietly than the previous versions I&#x27;ve had of this same model.</li>
            <li> I have had a WaterPik like this for many yearsthat worked fine until it developed a leak.  I could not get the part to repair it, so I ordered this replacement.  This one was defective from the start, the water hose would come loose from the pik and spray water all over.  And the power setting was not variable.  The seller said he could not replace it and told me to throw it away and they would refund my money.  Such a waste!</li>
            <li> difficult to use, may sprays water around if not inserted properly. wire and hose tangle easy.  Always leaves water on counter top</li>
            <li> Product works fine, but the water flow on this model is not adjustable, so there is only one intensity which is too bad.</li>
            <li> Great enginering, design and craftmanship; works great every day; but I had to throw away a travel size \\&quot;Waterpick\\&quot; after 18 months, because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense to supply an irreplaceable disposable part, on an equipment designed to outlast it three times.</li>
            <li> This is my third Waterpik oral irrigation system.  The first two lasted at least 3 years. This one is a piece of you-know-what. First, the resevoir does not fit over the unit with the irrigator tool in place after use. Second, I have to fiddle with the resevoir several times before the water will travel through the irrigator tip properly...pain in the you-know-what. Third, it seems to need flushing with bleach and water to rid it of a musty smell in the irrigator tip. Once I get the blasted thing to work, it does a wonderful job of getting debris left after flossing, but it&#x27;s still a pain in the you-know-what knowing that there are better models available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this model for over 7 years and noticed the poor reviews so here&#x27;s my quickie - still runs strong, doesn&#x27;t leak, but I&#x27;m upgrading to the Ultra.      If you&#x27;re in the market for a WP you might as well go with that since the price is so close.  I lost my extra tips years ago &amp; the storage inside the lid on the ultra seems like it&#x27;ll be a nice feature.      The only cons IMO are the lack of a lid over the reservoir which needs periodic cleaning.  The 32 oz+ capacity will likely be missed, but I usually only fill this model halfway anyway so it might not be an issue.      I&#x27;m not junking this one - it&#x27;ll go in a dark corner shelf in case it&#x27;s services are required in the future.  I also ordered the panasonic portable model for the car &amp; travel (runs on AAs) - I hate stuff stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the second Water Plk I&#x27;ve owned, the 60 model lasted about 25 years.  They get noisy after a few years, but worked fine.  This 70 model is quiet and sends out quite a strong jet of water. My old 6&#x27;s and now 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s,space between gum and teeth...1 being best</li>
            <li> it did everything it was supposed to do. I would recommend to any one who needs a good water pik.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the one we had for at least 10 years.  The minor design improvements are good ones and all the old tried and true features remain.  Our dentist and is always impressed with the condition of our teeth.  I credit regular use of the Water Pic.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and works as I expected,  I love this one because you can use the different setting on it to manage the amount of water that comes out.  I have crowns and bridges and need to be able to manage the power behind the wand!</li>
            <li> Our dentist told us to purchase this to reduce swelling of gums and it is working for both my husband and I after 1 month the dentist could tell the difference and kept us from getting a deep gum cleaning!</li>
            <li> Stiff supply line makes it hard to return the nozzle holder to its holding slot.  The adjustable pressure flow is good.</li>
            <li> I had another dental system that was working well. I purchased this because of the brand name and the compact design. It works okay, but vibrates too much which is annoying.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this I have only praise for this product. It does what it is supposed to do and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using waterpik for about 6 years now, my 3rd waterpik broke this week. When I tried to replace that one I found Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet in a local store, I had to buy it because they did not have a waterpik and I could not live with out one!!. When I tried Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet I was pleasantly surprised by its performance, it was quiet and jet had enough force but it did not hurt my gums at all!!!. A big problem with Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet was that it has a smaller tank, so you have to stop and refill 3-4 times before you complete!!!.</li>
            <li> To be very honest, I only post negative experiences with products since it is my belief that when one purchases a product good quality should be a given. I own TWO of these units, which are model WP-65W, essentially the very same unit as the 60W. All of the negative issues already posted, such as the motor seizing, have been experienced by me. I am posting this review because China has come to earn a very negative reputation for producing inferior quality, just read the newspapers. On the other hand, WATERPIK is responsible for the specifications on these products. I use these units because I have gum disease and daily use helps me. There seems not to be much of a choice in the marketplace just now.</li>
            <li> waterpik delivered in good time and it works fine.  am completely satisfied.  it does an excellect job of cleaning between my teeth and around my implants.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist. Really does the job. Is neat looking. A refreshing way to clean between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Work better than the last model I had.  Quick, quiet and more powerful at a lower setting.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Messy, clumsy, frustrating to use. Blue top keeps toppling over and making a mess on the countertop. The other two piks that come with keep falling out of their slots. If the top is the least bit off the hole, the water runs through and spills out on the bottom.</li>
            <li> My last WaterPik lasted about 1 year, this piece of junk lasted 1 month. This is the last WaterPik, Made in China, piece of junk I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> I started using a waterpik about fifteen years ago after a horseback riding accident resulted in numerous caps/reconstructive work.  Some caps were so tight and even joined in spots that regular flossing was difficult to impossible.  I tried using other things like floss picks but saw a deterioration in overall gum health.  Once I made the switch to a waterpik the results were outstanding.  Regular flossing doesn&#x27;t begin to compare to a waterpik in reults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last waterpik died a few months ago and with one thing or another I didn&#x27;t get a new one until this week. My mouth felt cleaner and healthier again after the first use.  Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to replace.  Other than a change to the weight/color of the resevoir, I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Yes, waterpiks can be a little messy (spray) but it is well worth it for the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little hesitant to add the following because this is NOT a recommended use for the waterpik and want to emphasize that it may shorten it&#x27;s life.  But it works for me, my dentist hasn&#x27;t objected and whenever I get my teeth cleaned the hygenist invariably says I have the cleanest mouth she has ever seen,  So:  Since I am extremely paranoid about dental/gum health (that reconstructive work was very expensive) I usually add a small amount of salt and hydrogen peroxide to the water in the resevoir.  That way I feel confident that those natural antibacterials are getting into the tight spots.  As I said, it works for me.  Haven&#x27;t needed more than routine cleaning in 15 years.</li>
            <li> I do like this, but the motor started sounding funny and cutting out after about a week.  I just got a replacement, so hopefully this one works right!  It works really well, and now that I have it, I&#x27;m glad that I never have to use and/or buy string floss anymore!</li>
            <li> I bought this model to replace a Water Pik that started leaking.  When I went to use it the first time it leaked and no water would come through the hose at all.  I got my refund and ended up buying the repair hose (tubing) from Waterpik. My old Waterpik is now working beautifully.  Love Waterpik and  would definitely buy another one.  I did not exchange this one because it was a cheaper model than my older one and I decided to try and fix the old one</li>
            <li> Replaced one destroyed by flood! Must have item. Simple, it just does what we wanted. Price was right&lt;br /&gt;The baton rogue</li>
            <li> The WP-60W WaterPik does its job well. It&#x27;s got plenty of power that other models, including their WP-100, don&#x27;t always have. I wish the design was more like the WP-100 though. The WP-100 is better looking, if you care about those kind of things (we do), and it&#x27;s much quieter, as well as a bit heavier, so it feels better built, and probably adds to the quieter design. That&#x27;s one thing the WP-60W could use; something in the design to make it less noisy. If you use it at night, it&#x27;s guaranteed to wake up others in your household, or neighbors unless you put a towel or something below it. I&#x27;m waiting to see how long it lasts, as well, as all my previous WaterPiks have lasted, at most, a few years before leaking and losing power to the point where they were useless. Anyway, all that said, it&#x27;s probably the best unit out there if you&#x27;re looking for a powerful unit that will really remove the food particles from between your teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the problem of other reviewers, mine could wake the dead. So if you have someone sleeping close by it can surely wake them.  I think I will rebuild my old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this water pik for years, so when mine stopped working, I had to find another.  Found this on Amazon and it&#x27;s a perfect replacement for my old one.  Not too big, not too small..... perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this WaterPik for my daughter who has braces.  It is just like mine which I use because I have lots of crowns.  We both use Listerine because my dentist recommended it (4 parts water to 1 part Listerine), and it removes food particles as well as makes the mouth taste great.</li>
            <li> The unit accomplished its purpose of cleaning between teeth.   The problem was that it kept tripping the GFI outlet in my bath.   Probably a random mfg problem. I do not know if this is a typical problem for these units.   I know the outlet is good since I can ( and DO ) regularly plug in a vacuum sweeper that draws around 10 Amps.</li>
            <li> As I am high maintenance when it comes to my dental work, this product is exactly what I have needed.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised and am pleased with the purchase.Keep in mind that all waterpiks make a bit of noise, but its normal. Would recommend this for others.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for getting your mouth clean, and gums healthy. Have used  waterpik for more years that I care to admit. Wore one out completely, and bought this replacement. Great product.</li>
            <li> After 5 months use the waterpik lost it&#x27;s ability to floss my teeth. The pressure is low and can not be adjusted.</li>
            <li> My husband liked this pick so much that when the first one wore out I had to find a replacement for him. The pick arrived on time and was as described. I will buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This item is efficient and exactly the right size for a small family. I like the clear water reservoir and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great and better price than in-store. Was missing tongue srcaper. That&#x27;s why only 4 stars. Very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great to find a replacement online at a reasonable price.  No shopping all over place for what I already know I want.  Click and a few days later it is at my door.</li>
            <li> It works very well, is easy to use and is attractive and efficent.  It is attractive and helps maintain healthy gums.</li>
            <li> Just like my old one! I was afraid i would never get another that good. I think a waterpik is necessary to keep teeth healthy. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent replacement for the one that I had for years and finally gave out.  It is sturdy and works well.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic. Gets those hard to reach spots.  My dentist recommends it too. Would make a great gift for anyone</li>
            <li> I purchased the tool for irrigating my sinuses.  It works so well and keeps me from getting those nasty sinus infections that used to plague my life.  I love it!</li>
            <li> The pressure is to low, the other models have more pressure. I have bought2 of th other models, one failed in 28 months, and I will gat the 2nd one in a few days.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pic. Works exactly as described maybe a little noisy but I can live with  that. Has saved me lots of money in dental fees.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  The main attachment head arrived broken.  No packing slip included with the machine. Shame that I have to take my time to request a replacement.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use and great tool for dental hygiene.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone&#x27;s dental care.</li>
            <li> This waterpik was serving the purpose.  I use warm water for the resevoir since it can bring discomfort to my sensitive teeth.  It works great, and the price is very reasonable, compared to the product of Sonnicare.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the water pressure was not what I had expected. A bit weak, but still gets the job done!  I would recommend it for the price point</li>
            <li> We have owned two earlier versions of this product for a number of years (two because my wife and I are usually cleaning our teeth at the same time).  The piping developed a leak in one so I bought another.  It has decidedly less pressure, but appears to be counteracted by having a smaller hole in the nozzle.  Thus, less water flow but probably about the same speed.  Seems to work about as well, but not if you try to use the old nozzles on the new product.  The last one lasted many years (ten or more, I no longer remember when we bought it) so it was reliable.  However, my experience with a number of recent replacement of other small appliances such as toaster ovens and coffee makers is that the quality has gone down hill badly in the last few years and items have much shorter lives.  If that happens with this, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li> After going through three portable units from Waterpic in two years, two of the units I repaired multiple times, I decided to go with the plug-in unit, which for some foolish reason I though might be more durable.  This is not the case.  After about two months of use, the pump is beginning to fail.  You might as well just take your money and flush it down the toilet.  Clearly this brand manufactures only trash, all of it coming from China, of course.</li>
            <li> Good item. Great price.  Have been using WaterPik for more than 10 years since scare requiring visit to periodentist.  No problems since.  Also have a portable unit with which I travel</li>
            <li> Cleans nicely, love it</li>
            <li> Had one years ago and it lasted years.  After being without one for awhile and complaining about how much we missed it, we thought we&#x27;d buy one again.  We&#x27;re complete fans of the waterpik.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The person for whom I purchased this item seems to be satisfied with its performance. She uses this item daily and it works properly.</li>
            <li> The water flosser works well It is easy to use and does a great job. The multiple tips allow for both my wife and I the ability to use it. The size makes it small enou7gh to leave on the counter top.</li>
            <li> This is my first review of any product, and I don&#x27;t know where to start with this one.my first mistake was not reading the product reviews before purchase, I relied on previous waterpik units that I purchased over the years and never had any issues with the product but this unit not only stop working after three weeks it&#x27;s loud and the company stated that because it was purchase from a third party (amazon) they would not honor the warranty. You&#x27;re taking a risk buying this product .</li>
            <li> not as strong as I expected even at highest setting, runs quiet, pretty effective, gets  way more stuff out from between teeth than regular floss, quite happy with product.</li>
            <li> it cleans my teeth the way I like-------- I have one at home too  I am a snowbird and had to have one for Fl.</li>
            <li> We like this brand,  the force is very good.  When you travel it closes up well.  Makes sense that you use it 2 times a day. Keeps down the need dentist visits.</li>
            <li> I love my waterpik.  I have been using one for over 30years.  Keeps breath nice and clean with daily use.  I highly recommend this product to everyone who doesn&#x27;t have one</li>
            <li> My previous WaterPik last for nearly thirty years.  30!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be amazed if this one lasted to next Christmas.  I&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;let you know.</li>
            <li> This works well in loosening trapped food, as I have a problem with gingivitis. Once you figure out how to best use the flosser, it&lt;br /&gt;isn&#x27;t a big deal though..Saves a few trips to the dentist, so I don&#x27;t have to go for deep scale treatment as often.</li>
            <li> Owned a cordless Waterpik product that lasted about a year and a half before the rechargeable battery would no longer hold a charge.  I bought this plug-in model thinking it would outlast the rechargeable one. This was a mistake  This unit failed after only 12 months.  Even with a two year warranty, I don&#x27;t have the time to pack it and ship it back.  If you buy a Waterpik product, best to use a brick &amp; mortar retailer near your home that you can return the product to for warranty replacement.</li>
            <li> I have been using Waterpik products for 25 years and have always been pleased.  It&#x27;s remarkable the amount of food particles removed by the Waterpik, even after first thoroughly brushing and flossing.  My only displeasure is that after about 5 or 6 years the vinyl plastic hose will split and it&#x27;s not really cost effective, or easy to replace the hose, essentially forcing the purchase of a new unit, but hey, nothing lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I was not able to find this particular water pik in stores near me.  I am pleased with the product and price.</li>
            <li> We have been using this type of waterpic for years, It&#x27;s amazing what a regular toothbruch will miss and we always get good dental checkup reports.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first WaterPik in the mid-sixties.  It still works but I cannot get a rubber part for the bowl sealer.  I am happy with my new WaterPik, but the old one had a less cumbersome swivel on the hand flosser.  I particularly like the clever storage for the tubing on my new one.</li>
            <li> I like most everything about it except for the water canister. I mix peroxide with the water and it wastes a fair amount of the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;It needs a slight angle at the bottom in order to use all of the content. Just a small thing.</li>
            <li> I had an Interplak system and was never quite satisfied with it.  This Water Pik system is superior in every way.  Effective at a lower pressure, easy to assemble and disassemble and easier to use.</li>
            <li> Very messy and not well designed.&lt;br /&gt;How can I be sure that the head is well seated?&lt;br /&gt;Head pops out of seat  and leaks all over counter,floor and wood.&lt;br /&gt;A pain to empty resevoir after every use.&lt;br /&gt;Called Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;What an attitude!&lt;br /&gt;This is my first ever really negative review.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a jackhammer as it bounces on sink counter.  Called Waterpik thinking it was defective. No, that is normal for the product. Other than the noise and bouncing, it works as it should. I am returning it and will continue to use my old one.  BTW the price is now $9 less than when I bought it one week ago.</li>
            <li> This is probably the third or fourth WaterPik I&#x27;ve owned.  On the plus side, I&#x27;m certain (as is my dentist) that it has prevented significant gum disease that otherwise would have occurred.  Brushing and flossing are necessary but in my case not sufficient.  It also seems like this one might be a little quieter than the others.  On the down side, I wish they would last longer.  The most recent one lasted about two years before the plastic tube broke.  Until I find a better alternative, I guess I will keep replacing them rather than risk losing teeth!</li>
            <li> Does the job in a short amount of time. The price was very low for this type of product compared to other places of bussiness.</li>
            <li> Good product. Used it with the \\&quot;Sinupulse Elite Replacement Sinus Irrigator Tip\\&quot; and \\&quot;SinuAir Powdered Saline Convenient Packets.\\&quot; This was my first time to try any such item and it worked well to clear up my sinuses.</li>
            <li> My dental problems have been dramatically reduced since using the WaterPik. It takes some practice to use it without spraying the bathroom, but when you get used to it, it&#x27;s easy. It does not replace flossing, but gets out stuff that flossing doesn&#x27;t. Handle traps water inside which allows thing to grow in there. I drill a hole or two in the bottom of the handle so it can drain, and problem is solved. Rinse handle in hot water after use to keep sanitary. If you find it too noisy, fold a washcloth under it to reduce noise. Also, drying it after use keeps it cleaner (water spots). Just bought the fourth one; first one lasted longer than later ones. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 other waterpiks and this by far is the strongest stream. A new user will need to start at a lower setting, which is easy to do right on the handle. It is a little larger (takes up more space) than other models but has good storage and the tank covers everything. No so good for travel due to the size, but because the tank makes it self enclosed it keeps things together. Only one pik with the unit so I had to buy extra piks for my family. This is easier to clean and dry than other models and the larger tank allows more water for each use and a complete cleaning.</li>
            <li> I hated the packaging. It came in a cardboard box in plastic with a wrinkled instruction book. I was expecting it to be in a WaterPix box and not plastic. This was a birthday gift and becuse the packaging was so bad it looked like a used one. I dont know if the person ever used it because of fear that it might be used. Never Again will I order anything else because of that reason.</li>
            <li> This product is awful, the hose and motor broke after only 14 months, it is so loud that I cannot use it in the mornings before going to work at 6am.  I had one for over 20 years with no problems then is did stop working.  This was my 2nd one in a matter of 2.5 years.</li>
            <li> The new version of this water pic is very disappointing. I still have mine purchased back in 2002 and it still works great. Bought this one for my husband and it quit working after the warranty ran out. There is something wrong with the pulse speeds in the handle. No water squirts out. Even the water basin seems cheaper than mine. Piece of crap. I&#x27;m looking into purchasing another water flosser from a different company - one that has less 1-star reviews.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I ordered this product..It came today and I used it right away...I am very pleased .</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed. This is our 3rd Waterpik, first one, decades old, works better. This unit dribbles water from hand piece(wand) and water runs out of the rubber fitting of the reserve tank. I spend more time cleaning up water than cleaning my teeth. Poor design or poor construction, take your pick.</li>
            <li> We had a Teledyn Waterpic from 1971!  Incredible that it worked perfectly all those years!  And it was square, which meant I could store some meds on it while I let it dry out.  I.e., I turned the water tank on its side when it wasn&#x27;t in use.  This one is rounded on the sides - cute and, granted, it works great - but I either have to dry it out thoroughly and turn the tank upside down or else it rocks back and forth and all the meds fall off.  Picky me!</li>
            <li> . I would have like a lid on the top like the first water pik I purchase.  if I buy again, I would look in to that.</li>
            <li> The waterpik works very well at cleaning my teeth. It is easy to use, and I am amazed at how it removes excess food from my teeth.</li>
            <li> Works better than past pik I had. It is easy to use and gets the job done that I expect.</li>
            <li> My rechargeable WaterPik lasted about a year, then quit holding a charge. So I replaced it with the WP-60W, and it is 10 times the flosser, compared to the rechargeable. I would absolutely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> After some adjustment I can honestly say I like the Waterpik. I suggest using both water and mouthwash in the fill tank. Just plain water is boring. When used with mouthwash expect a messy sink as the rinse becomes foamy. I use the next to the highest power setting and the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; expelled is all over the place! The tank empties quick so plan on a refill. After using the Waterpik I use my Phillips Sonicare power tooth brush. Teeth feel really clean after all this effort.</li>
            <li> this is very easy to use and my son uses it!</li>
            <li> I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device&#x27;s tips quality.  The tips are extremely fragile. if the device tips over, they WILL break.  Mine broke within 2 days.  I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips. I will never buy another waterpik product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original one I bought but does the job.  A little noisey and too big a well, but would buy it again!</li>
            <li> If you travel the seven seas, you don&#x27;t always have access to flourinated water--enough said. Once I spent 6 months eating candy corn, poprocks, and caramel chews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CANNOT use this while having a conversation, or wearing a new shirt.</li>
            <li> I must be the luckiest person on the planet . . .  When I read reviews for products (various types of products) they are filled with out of the box failures, day one failures, failures after just a few days,  etc.  I just don&#x27;t seem to have that kind of luck - even my 2 Telebrands Pocket Hoses work great in the face of over 2,000 really bad reviews right here on Amazon &amp;  I love my two hoses. . .  (There&#x27;s a point here, I promise . . .)  That brings me to the WaterPik WP600 . . .  I LOVE my WP-600 and have already gotten three or four years of great service out of it.  Matter of fact I&#x27;m back here to purchase another one for my vacation home so I don&#x27;t have to tote it back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WP-600 has several great features . . .  High capacity reservoir, variable pressure settings, temporary pressure shut off on the hand-held  wand, extremely easy to clean, simple &amp; straight-forward almost fool-proof operation, etc.  All this is combined with the fact that many dentists recommend these devices as the best way to prevent and correct a number of oral hygiene problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me challenge you to this test - because it amazes me every time I use the WaterPik Wp-600 . . .  Brush your teeth and floss using your usual routine and rinse with your favorite mouthwash - get your teeth as clean as you possibly can ., . .  Now, use the WaterPik WP-600 as directed - you will see all kinds of food particles pouring out of what you thought was a sparkly clean mouth.  These devices remove so much food from between teeth and under gums - food that you thought you removed with regular brushing.  This is food that feeds the bacteria in your mouth causing bad breath, tooth decay, and gum disease.  This is food that non-WaterPik users leave in their mouth EVERY night when they go to sleep - providing an incredible smorgasbord for mouth borne bacteria !!!  The amount of food that these devices remove AFTER you&#x27;ve already brushed, flossed, and rinsed, is nothing short of amazing !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to touch on some of the criticisms in the reviews . . .  Noise - YES this is a noisy device, I&#x27;m usually awake when I use it so the noise does not bother me...  On the bright side, it&#x27;s a good way to know from any room in the house that your kids are using the WaterPik . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Siphoning Effect - Yes, if you lay the wand down (lower than the slot that is deigned to hold it) the water will drain from the tank through the wand.  Here&#x27;s how I see this.  When I first got the WP-600 (like way back on day one), I might have laid the wand down and noticed that water starts draining from it....  So I instantly learned that I needed to place the wand in it&#x27;s holder when it wasn&#x27;t in my mouth.  Was this a problem - NO, I learned day one that when the wand was not in my mouth - put in it&#x27;s proper holder....  No problem....  (My Kitchen Aid mixer splatters batter all over the kitchen if you raise the mixer head while you are mixing batter - so you learn NOT to do that.  Does that mean the Kitchen Aid mixer is inferior?  NO.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topples easily . . .  I just don&#x27;t agree with this...  Unless you&#x27;re grabbing the base of the unit and shaking the daylights out of it, or unless your vanity top is at a 45 degree angle, it is NOT going anywhere...  When the rubber gasket for the reservoir is properly inserted into the receiving gasket on the base you have a very topple-proof device.  I have never come close to causing my WP-600 to topple over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Uses . . .  I know this is something that you put in your mouth and you might not want to do anything else with it, but, if you have an extra tip that you don;t mind using for other things, the WaterPik actually works great in a number of cleaning situation.  (Caution, water is wet !!!  In case you&#x27;re going to say, \\&quot;If you do that, you&#x27;re going to get wet.\\&quot;)  I have used the WaterPik on a few occasions to clean a clogged Keurig Coffee Maker that was not pumping.  I&#x27;ve usedthe water jet to clean the nooks and crannies in my humidifier.  I&#x27;ve used the WaterPik to clean crevices on all kinds of devices.  There are a lot of creative ways you can use a water jet to clean things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the WaterPik WP-600 &amp; I&#x27;m here to buy another one.  The only reason I wrote this review is because I think some of the criticism of the device comes back to common sense . . .  If your KitchenAid mixer splatters batter all over the kitchen when you lift it out of the bowl while it is running - then DON&#x27;T DO IT - but don&#x27;t blame the KitchenAid !!!the water jet to clean the nooks and crannies in my humidifier.

            <li> Product in line with my expectations.</li>
            <li> Not as good quality as the one that I bought years ago.</li>
            <li> i tried the product . it has too much pressure i thaught it would injure my gums. i went back to my battery powered unit</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this product. But I have had it for a few months now, and I have to tell you that per my Dental Hygienist, my mouth has improved 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It actually does what it advertises.  Your mouth feels awesome and you want to do it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It&#x27;s very loud, too loud!  If they could make an improvement, it would be to make it quieter.  I have a bad habit of falling asleep early in the evening, so using this at 10:00 pm or later, is really noisy to my family.</li>
            <li> It is what it is.  The price keeps rising.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier; it does everything I wanted it to do; really like the big water reservoir! Dentist said my gums were very healthy.</li>
            <li> this works great.Its easy to use and easy to store away without taking up a lot of space.recommend it to anyone who has dirty teeth.lol</li>
            <li> Very good product. Thank you</li>
            <li> We have used WaterPik products for many years and have never had any complaints about any of them. They perform as advertised and are durable.  We will continue to buy these products in the future.</li>
            <li> Only thing is there is no cover for the  the container . Unless  you get a cover but should have a cover for the liquid</li>
            <li> handle too short, turn off knob in handle virtually unusable, terribly noisy, water all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;my dentist sold me this piece of ----. I&#x27;m going to switch dentists.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of flossing below the gum line. I get a big build up of tartar and mt detal hygienist thought this might help. Not as messy as I remember from years back when we owned one used by children with braces.</li>
            <li> WaterPik has long been a trusted name in care of teeth and gums, My dentist also suggested it&#x27;s use for my wife who has Parkinson&#x27;s and has trouble maintaining a healthy mouth. However, I am very pissed that I am REQUIRED to justify any purchase that I make. I hope this is not something that makes Amazon thinks will make me want to continue to do business with them.</li>
            <li> This is a definite up grade form the old one. I think it also more powerful and does a great job. As described and more</li>
            <li> There are multiple models of Waterpik water flossers. This is a very low-range model, and the least desirable Waterpik you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a Waterpik water flosser since 2006, and I am hugely grateful to Waterpik for how much it has improved the health of my gums. I purchased my first one from the oral surgeon who recommended I use it for general oral hygiene and specifically because I had large gum pockets around some of my molars. That first one was a [[ASIN:B006HG5A5G Model WP-100]], and it lasted six years. It worked quite well until it finally wore out, and I only had to purchase 2-3 replacement [[ASIN:B0062N5AZO Jet Tips]] for it in all that time. The recommended replacement interval for these Jet Tips is 6 months, but I don&#x27;t replace them if they are still working--the point at which the Jet Tip needs to be replaced is when water dribbles through it instead of in a strong, steady stream, or it won&#x27;t stay seated in place in the Waterpik handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second Waterpik I purchased in 2012 was this one, a [[ASIN:B000063SLR Model WP-60W]]. Do not get this model! Yes, it is cheaper than any other Waterpik you can buy, but you get what you pay for! The other models are so much better than this one. I got mine at a local Walgreens drugstore, and this model was a problem from the start, because the reservoir was constantly leaking water. I know now, from reading today the excellent manual that comes with the Waterpik Model WP-900, that my Model WP-60W had a defective reservoir valve and the warranty would have covered replacing it. The problem was, I did return it to Walgreens and exchanged it for another WP-60W, but that one leaked, too, and I didn&#x27;t feel like going through the hassle of another return, so I kept the replacement Model WP-60W and have been unhappy with its leaking for the past 2.5 years. Since I had purchased my first two Waterpiks locally, and I had not gone online to research Waterpik when I did so, I wrongly assumed when I bought the Model WP-60W that somehow Waterpik had changed the design of their machine and messed up a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the wonders of Amazon, I discovered just this week, when I was looking to replace my Model WP-60W, because I just could not stand its leaking another day, that the reason my second Waterpik was so bad was that I had purchased a bottom-of-the-line model, of far lower quality than my first Waterpik, the Model WP-100, and I learned the different model numbers by looking at the pictures of the various models sold by Waterpik on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting the [[ASIN:B0095IMNI0 WP-900]], which offers a top-of-the-line Waterpik water flosser plus the outstanding Waterpik Sonic electric toothbrush. It is only about $35-40 more than this model, and it is light years more value for the money. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this model. Spend a bit more and get the WP-900. You&#x27;ll be glad you did. (See my review of the WP-900 here on Amazon for more information: http://amzn.to/172qNDN).ught the Model WP-60W that somehow Waterpik had changed the design of their machine and messed up a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the wonders of Amazon, I discovered just this week, when I was looking to replace my Model WP-60W, because I just could not stand its leaking another day, that the reason my second Waterpik was so bad was that I had purchased a bottom-of-the-line model, of far lower quality than my first Waterpik, the Model WP-100, and I learned the different model numbers by looking at the pictures of the various models sold by Waterpik on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting the [[ASIN:B0095IMNI0 WP-900]], which offers a top-of-the-line Waterpik water flosser plus the outstanding Waterpik Sonic electric toothbrush.

            <li> I&#x27;m not much satisfied with the product. It&#x27;s not a user-friendly product, especially the water container. I even damaged my bridge in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Water Pic Flossers since the mid 1970&#x27;s.  This is the noisiest, most difficult to control water stream unit I have ever had.  It does the job of cleaning my mouth, but the noise it makes is loud &amp; irritating.  The floss water stream is difficult to direct because the tip head does not turn in the handle.</li>
            <li> just what my husband ordered. thanks</li>
            <li> Really helps keep my teeth clean! Simple machinery which I expect to continue to work as it&#x27;s designed for a long time.</li>
            <li> Glad to have it... will order more , when in need.</li>
            <li> This contains a letter I wrote to WaterPik about their product.      \\&quot;A little background.  I had the same WaterPik for over 20 years and in that time I replaced the hose twice.  It was a well-made product that I was loathe to retire from service however after 20 years it had other ideas.  Since then I have had nothing but problems from the current models including turning itself on, overheating, then melting the plastic housing and burning out the motor.  It happened during the night, in a power outage and I awoke in the morning to the power being back and found it destroyed.  I was extremely lucky that it did not cause a fire.  At first I thought it was me that somehow left it on in the outage, that is until it happened again to the new one I bought, fortunately I caught that one before it burnt up.  It has not happened since, however I am very cautious about as it is my opinion that the switch has an issue.    I am writing to you today because Waterpik has a problem with the current hosing they are producing for the hose/handles.  After a very short period of time the hose gets brittle and fractures.  This happened to me and to my boyfriend and we both had to replace them.  It has become quite apparent to me that the plastics they are using to manufacture the hose has a chemical defect as it should last far longer than my 2.5 years and his 11 months.  Whatever they did in the past worked and the hoses were long lasting, no longer is that the case.  Building in obsolescence in this manner is only going to upset their customers; I know it has both of us.  The thing I found rather ironic and so did Waterpik&#x27;s customer service representative when I spoke to them, is that their website states: \\&quot; To ensure a successful insertion of the repair hose kit coupler, the original hose should be flexible with no indications of cracking or splitting when flexed.\\&quot;  If that were the case I would not be replacing it.  They provided a coupler for the WP60 replacement hose, I did not however use it and even though it was a lot of work took apart the unit and replaced it back to the inside nipple.  First, if it was cracked then the remaining hose would be no good either.  Second, why would I want an unsightly splice being visible?  If I had not replaced it back to the nipple then I would have had to buy a whole new unit rather than just a hose.  Hmm, they may want to rethink that as someone might wonder if that was their intent all along.    I personally would rather pay more up front for a well-made product that will last 10 to 20 years (like they used to) than buy something that is so cheaply made I must replace or repair it every 3 years.  And while we are on the subject, they recently went to a clear blue reservoir on the Classic WaterPik.  When my one unit burnt up I kept the opaque white reservoir and threw away the new blue one.  The reason being, that while it looks pretty in the short term, clear plastic SCRATCHES where the white is easily cleaned of lime deposits without visible scratching and will maintain its appearance for the life of the unit.  Again, money saving for Waterpik but for the consumer it creates an inferior product.  I wrote all of this in an email to Waterpik and asked that they please stop cheapening their product to save a buck as it makes me want to look elsewhere in the future.  A well-made product will create customer loyalty and right now they are doing the opposite.  Just my opinion, however I am the one with the money.\\&quot;    They wrote back and said that they now change out the hose from the bottom but did not address any of the other issues except to say they do not design them with \\&quot;planned obsolescence\\&quot;.  Also that they take pride in the Waterpik name and strive to provide quality products.  Never once did they address the issue with the hoses fracturing.  Can you say \\&quot;SMOKESCREEN\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it had a lid.  Friend has a waterpik and hers has a lid.  Ours leaks though. You can&#x27;t leave any liquid in it even for an hour without it leaking all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;Do like it working on our gums.</li>
            <li> This particular water pik is powerful enough but I prefer the one I had previous to this where you can select the speed of the water from the pik.  This one  the jet stream of water is almost to harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li> Purchased the WP70W model two months ago. It is already nearly&lt;br /&gt;non-functional. It appears to be leaking water from inside the handle therefore no water pressure at all. I have purchased&lt;br /&gt;Teledyne Water Piks in the past and they didn&#x27;t last very long&lt;br /&gt;either. It had been a few years since I used this model, so I&lt;br /&gt;decided to try them one more time. Big mistake. The Braun Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;MD-15 Oxyjet is your better bet.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps my 5th Waterpik.  Eventually they die or start leaking in odd places, turning your bathroom into a rainforest.  Why do I keep coming back?  THEY WORK!  I get compliments from my dentist and my dental hygienist.  Better than flossing.  Keeps those gums healthy.  It&#x27;s bulky, it tips, and I love it.</li>
            <li> i receive the items within 10 dys . satisfied with the shipment, received in very good condition. operates perfect helps clean teeth efficiently and clean tongue satisfactory . only one problem  i need mor acessories e.g. tip for using below the gums etc.</li>
            <li> For many months my wife has had problems of things sticking between two of her teeth.  Toothpicks didn&#x27;t work, dental floss didn&#x27;t work.  I purchased for her, the devices that are pre strung with floss in the hope that having a rigid support, the floss would work...to no avail.  Her last resort was the WaterPic.  It worked like magic!!!</li>
            <li> We love this thing.  It is the best thing since the toothbrush, better even than floss.  Took us a while to get used to it--we squirted water on the counter and mirror a few times before we figured out how to keep it in our mouth!</li>
            <li> This unit was a replacement for one I&#x27;d owned for years. It gave great service, but finally its motor quit. The new one works very well, and I have only one complaint. When using it I mix Listerine and water (as recommended) in the tub. Doing so results in the mixture bubbling up, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;However, with my older unit, I had no problem lining up the rubber grommet on the bottom of the tub with the grommet on top of the pump mechanism, even though that tub was white opaque plastic. The two grommets just seemed naturally to connect. For some reason, I have to &amp;#34;hunt and seek&amp;#34; to get the grommets on the new unit to connect. Once I have flossed, dumped the Listerine/water mix and filled the tub with fresh rinse water, it&#x27;s a simple matter to re-set the tub on the pump because the new tub is transparent plastic, the water is clear (not bubbly) and I can look down and see exactly how to line up the grommets. I&#x27;m sure that over time I&#x27;ll learn how to line them up with no problem, but for now it takes me several tries.</li>
            <li> Product works but not like it used to.&lt;br /&gt;Motor runs loud and the entire unit is considerably lighter than the older one I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in China explains everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works.</li>
            <li> The water pick replaced my old one and it is just as good as the one that I used for almost 20 years.  It really helps with sinus washes/  It helps with avoiding sinus infections.  It more than expected meets my needs.  Pollen season is on us and our water pik is really helping.,</li>
            <li> The WP-60W is clumsy to use! The Water Flosser is much easier to use. The amount saved on the WP-60W over the Water Flosser is not worth the difference in quality of operation. ALWAYS BUY THE WATER FLOSSER!!</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager, my gums were in such bad shape the dentist said I would have no teeth at all by age 20.  I have been using WaterPik for many years, I&#x27;ve just purchased a new replacement at age 80 and a dentist recently asked me if I had just had my teeth cleaned. My teeth and gums are like a young person&#x27;s and I thank WaterPik for that.  I use it at least once a day and I receive compliments for my smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same old WaterPik I have been using for so many years is now being called a Water Flosser!  It does that job, too.  I recommend it for everyone, not only does it affect your appearance,  it makes you feel sparkling bright after using it.</li>
            <li> It works well so far and dosn&#x27;t take up alot of space.Ask me again in another year or 2, please.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is working as intended and easy to use.  It is worth the money and convenient to store when not in use.</li>
            <li> Worth every nickel. I bought it to keep my implants clean and realized I should have had gotten one years ago! 4 stars</li>
            <li> Great... I used it with Dr. Grossan sinus irrigator, works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I surveyed the prices and felt this was a good price for a quality product.</li>
            <li> The older models are much louder.  It&#x27;s a shame that I have to keep getting new units as they start to leak after a while.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a replacement of my previous unit which had become very noisy and produced an irregular stream.  This one is not noisy but the stream is just as irregular as the one it replaced.  I am wondering if I wound up with a &#x27;re-conditioned&#x27; unit.  I will keep this one and I am resigned to having to replace this appliance annually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my WP-60W for almost two years, ever since I started getting sore gums periodically, but rarely used it regularly.  I have almost no counter space by the sink, so I kept putting it in the closet, where it would be forgotten until I started hurting again.      I finally gave in and now keep it perched on the edge of the sink.  I had some bleeding the first couple times I used it, but now that&#x27;s stopped and I even think the most troublesome pocket may be holding less debris.  When I&#x27;m in a hurry I just irrigate the problem areas, but at night I give myself a thorough session with it.  At this point, if I floss after I use the Waterpik, I get hardly anything off of my teeth!      The little monster is loud, but hey, it has to create a lot of pressure from a teeny tiny motor, and I&#x27;m sure the short lifespan of 2-4 years is what keeps the price so low.  With twice-daily use I don&#x27;t expect it live more than a couple more years, which frankly is a great bargain if I can avoid an oral surgeon or more fillings due to receding gums.    Last week I decided to splurge on a [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet]], which was awful compared with the 60W--tiny reservoir, extremely awkward to handle, impossible to clean thoroughly--and is going right back to the store.  Even with its noise and size, the 60W is far easier to use.  I did consider the [[ASIN:B000ODV872 QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator w/ 36\\&quot; hose]], but it doesn&#x27;t allow you to use mouthwash, which is important if you&#x27;ve got serious gum problems.    Here are some tips for the WP-60W:    * Press the reservoir down firmly over the gasket.  When the water level is low it&#x27;s likely to lose its connection; either press the reservoir down again or add water.    * When you get started, set the pressure to the lowest level and hold the pik pointing into the sink until the water starts; then you can get it into your mouth with no spray and carefully turn up the pressure.    * I never leave water in the reservoir; if you do, you&#x27;re just asking for contamination or bacteria.  That&#x27;s why I decided not to buy the one with the covered reservoir.      * To keep things as sanitary as possible, rinse the reservoir and run clear water through the machine if you&#x27;ve used mouthwash.  Remove the &#x27;pik&#x27; and rinse it out under the faucet.  Then hold the handle in the sink below the level of the reservoir to allow water to drain out of the cord and shake it into the sink a few times to remove any remaining water in the handle.  I then turn the reservoir over and prop it up on the unit until it dries out, since I&#x27;m concerned with bacterial or algae buildup.    All in all, this is a great machine.  It sounds like Waterpik is great about replacing bad units within a year (without a receipt!!).  Nothing is made the way it used to be, but given the low price I&#x27;m not too concerned.</li>
            <li> Not sure how safe using this product is.  I find that it does a good job of cleaning between my teeth, but I then tend to forget to floss, which is probably not a good idea, and using this and flossing is the best idea.  The thing that is awful about it is that mold forms in the handle and it is very difficult to keep the mold from forming.  I try light solugion of bleach and waterr.</li>
            <li> Best WaterPik  I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li> Had one for years, and it started leaking where it shouldn&#x27;t-but after 10 years of using it, hey, not bad.  Had to get a new one and Amazon had a good price on it, for sure.  Love it, hardly can skip waterpiking my teeth at night - just doesn&#x27;t feel clean enough.  Gets to the gunk way up &amp; washes it down the drain.  Love this product, can&#x27;t live without.  My dentist recommended it &amp; glad he did those many years ago.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a 8 year old unit. Was exactly what I expected. Thanks for the excellent service.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I just cannot use the string floss. I find this unit to be easier to use, and, if other reviews are to be believed, it provides nearly the same benefits as string flossing.&lt;br /&gt;The product consists of the base unit with its hose attached hand unit, and storage area for four pik units, and a cover that inverts to become the water storage tank during use. You have to be sure to make the connection between the drain on the inverted cover and the water input on the base unit so that water does not leak out but that&#x27;s not difficult to do and I&#x27;ve had no leak problems.&lt;br /&gt;I have found it easy to use and it seems to do its job. The instructions say you can add mouthwash to the water and I found that to be nice. It does give a fresher feeling after use. All in all, I think it&#x27;s doing its job and pretty well at that.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a messy product. You have this little stream of water that is guided around your mouth to do its job but that water has to go somewhere. Lean down over the siink as the instructions state so that you don&#x27;t get water all over the sink, the walls, the mirror, yourself. It&#x27;s also a very noisy product. The pump in the base sounds like a miniature jack hammer. It&#x27;s not unbearable and you only have it on for a couple of minutes, but, just be aware of the issue.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful of two things. 1. The handle has a pressure control. I have found that the second level is more than enough. 2. Use warm water. If you have any cold sensitivity, and you use cold water, this will intensify the cold and may be difficult to bear.</li>
            <li> We purchased this WaterPik to replace one that had stopped pumping water and couldn&#x27;t be resuscitated. This replacement fared no better, its performance deteriorating within the first year of purchase. It would then only work in the lower settings. We just stuck with it, and It did continue to operate at that lower setting for a long time, until finally it would only work at the lowest power setting, then not at all.  Too bad, it&#x27;s a useful tool.  I wish some other company that valued manufacturing over marketing would make one that would last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WaterPiks over 25 years. They get stuff out of my teeth that neither brushing or flossing will remove (you still need to brush and floss). I have found that hard water leads to mineral build up inside this machine and causes it to break. I only use filtered water in it and it sill looks like new after a year os use.</li>
            <li> Love it. Others I tried had no power. Would definately purchase another. A little hard at first  to line up  water bowl on  power unit, but have the hang of it now! Would go with 4 and 1/2 stars!</li>
            <li> A very handy supplement to regular flossing, gets into the gum pockets but I am not sure it does the whole job between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used Waterpik over the decades. This is my 3rd one. This is first one from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Others were at local stores, who did not always have model in stock. And I had to go to 2&lt;br /&gt;or 3 stores. This time, I got what I wanted on first try from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Well, if you&#x27;ve got to have a waterpik, I hear this is the best.  But, be warned, these thing are highly tempermental,and difficult to control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  It&#x27;s more efficient and quieter than the one I replaced.  The swivel tip is also easier to use.</li>
            <li> thank you for fast shipping. I love this product very much. it gives me a perfect oral hygene.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this WaterPik Flosser EVERY night.  Won&#x27;t go a day without using it.  She loves it !!  I think this is our second or third time we&#x27;ve purchased a WaterPik Flosser and she would recommend it to anyone with gum problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this WaterPik WP-60W Water Flosser on line to replace my old WaterPik WP-60W water flosser which just died.</li>
            <li> This cleans between teeth very well. It&#x27;s quite messy and I end up getting wet. But my dentist recommended it so I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  We actually use it with a special tip for nasal rinsing and it works great we any of us have a cold.</li>
            <li> Wish it were more convenient to use.  Don&#x27;t like having to put it away, then take out ot use it.&lt;br /&gt; and take out to use.</li>
            <li> it is so helpful and fair priced for every body to keep oral health, and save lots of dentist fee.</li>
            <li> From the time it was purchased, it has provided exceptional service. My wife purchased one from her dentist but it can&#x27;t compare with mine.</li>
            <li> it does everything that we expected and then some. will recommend it to anyone. it is perfect for getting the junk out</li>
            <li> Does a great job- compact- does not take a lot of counter space-  it easy to clean- and store away-</li>
            <li> This is about the 4th  one I have had. Would not be without one!!!!  They have improved them over the years.</li>
            <li> I floss every day but don&#x27;t seem to feel totally clean.  This waterpik really helps.  I&#x27;ve tried three different models and this seems to be the most reliable and durable so far.  I&#x27;ve one in each bathroom.  My kids have just started to use it.  My dentist also tells me that I&#x27;ve good oral hygiene after using the waterpik in addition to regular brushing and flossing.  The most common problem I encounter using this waterpik has to do with no water flow when the machine is not set on a level surface.  My waterpik is place between two pedestal sinks on a makeshift tray.  Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly with the Sinupulse Elite Replacement Sinus Irrigator Tip and is great for anyone with sinus problems or sinus infections.  It was recommended by a ear, nose and throat specialist doctor and both my wife and I use it when we need to with great success.</li>
            <li> WaterPik works great and flushes most of the food from pockets in gum. I highly recommend this product. Love it!</li>
            <li> The best system for healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It is easy to use and fulfills all expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used WaterPiks for years. Much more thorough than flossing, includes a tongue cleaner, much stronger motor, really gets out hard to get food like carrots and lettuce. Helps tremendously with gums.</li>
            <li> I had stopped giving reviews, but I had to say something about this Waterpik WP-60W. It works fine, in fact great, getting the smallest food particles from your teeth. But I could not believe the noise it makes.I have to close the bathroom door to keep from disturbing everyone in the rest of the house.&lt;br /&gt; When I first used it, I thought the motor had come loose and that the unit was beginning to full apart. I started asking around and found out that all of this model makes this noise, just like some of the other reviews on Amazon says it does.&lt;br /&gt; I would have returned it, but I was having dental work done and I really needed a waterpik.&lt;br /&gt; My advice, don&#x27;t buy, the noise will keep you from using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid user of Water-pik dental sprayers. I got braces as an adult, and wore them for two plus years; Water-pik made my mouth feel somewhat clean during that time. I&#x27;m on my 4th Water-pik, I think. My gums are in very good shape thanks to daily use. This model sprays harder than the newer one. There are replacement hose kits sold for this model, so that is a help for a handy person. The weakness in the Water-pik is the vinyl hose; it ages and breaks.The on-off switches also can go. The vinyl o-ring that seals the water chamber needs careful treatment. I guess Water-pik has designed a little obsolescence into the product to keep up the sales. I have sent one back for repair, and it was replaced without question. So overall, it&#x27;s a good product that doesn&#x27;t have any competitor to equal the value.</li>
            <li> This product is the second one I have purchased.  The first one was an earlier model I got from my dentist and I literally wore it out from use.  It lasted about six years.  This is the only model that has a large enough water reservoir to get the job done without having to refill it.</li>
            <li> It works great, all of the food particles are removed for brushing. It is exactly what I wanted and could not find anywhere else</li>
            <li> Works as I expected.  I was pleasantly surprised to find new on/off controls, that actually worked with me.  Nice update to the old.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUT THE WATER PIK 480 IT IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT! The battry polls rust the switch doesn&#x27;t work I want my money back!</li>
            <li> Purchased one of these in December at a local K-Mart and it lasted for three weeks until the pump stopped pumping. Returned it for another one and this one lasted only two weeks until the same pump issue occurred. I picked up my third unit today and since we will only be in the Keys for another three weeks I am hopeful that the third unit will make it until we leave. When I get home I will have to find a more reliable replacement.</li>
            <li> i chose itbecause the other one brokeit works better than a regular toothbrush i have used water pic for years</li>
            <li> Nozzles don&#x27;t fit great.  Kind of hard to snap on and off.  Water leaks from the fittings so you have to hold it over the sink the entire time you are using it.  Hoping that as it is used more it may work a little smoother.</li>
            <li> Item as described and delivered promptly</li>
            <li> Best model yet! Highly recommend this product - especially with the nasal irrigator attachment (purchased separately through a doctor&#x27;s office).</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Chosen for compact profile when not in use.  It easily fits beneath the shelf below the vanity mirror when the cover is in the storage position.  Great product for the price (about half the price here compared with what I paid in China).</li>
            <li> This is fine for me as I have limited space and did not want one so harsh. you can adjust the pressure and filling is a breeze.</li>
            <li> This baby can blow out your back teeth. But it blew itself out after six weeks. The good news: the Pikheads were willing to replace it with a phone call. So if they keep replacing it, I&#x27;d give it five stars though it is noisy and I use it in my apt at three in the morning. A towel underneath dampens most of the ruckus.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but it&#x27;s ridiculous that you only receive one Jet Head!  The one we had previously had came with three of them!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but my dentist charges $35 a minute for his fillings.  For the same price, you will get two years from a device which, no matter how hard you brush, will kick surprising amounts of crud from between your teeth, can be filled with mouthwash to kill halitosis sources from between your teeth, virtually stops gum bleeding (me) with use 3x a week, and (bonus) can clean industrial parts quite well!  Sure, its 89 decibals, vibrates like a banshee and squirts all over the bathroom (until you become expert), but let&#x27;s not quibble!  There is no substitute.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a similar system made by a different mfr, after that one developed an irreparable leak following many years of use.    There is no doubt the WaterPik is far more effective than its predecessor. I began using it at mid-power, because I have been a dental water jet user for years and had used my other one at just a bit above mid-power. The WaterPik cleans thoroughly, as the WaterPik Website video illustrates. It removes irritants below the gum line. I can vouch for this because (to my surprise) I had some minor bleeding of the gums during the first few days of use.    Not that such bleeding is a good thing, but its importance will be clear in a moment. Please note that I don&#x27;t have any peridontal disease or gum recission. Just a little inexplicable bleeding that comes with any vigorous dental cleaning. I get good numbers on the gum measurements at each exam, so this issue has just been a \\&quot;keep an eye on it\\&quot; thing for a long time. But the WaterPik appears to have solved it.    After regular use of the WaterPik for a few weeks, I experimented by trying a few passes at nearly full power. No bleeding. At full power, the WaterPik is quite vigorous, and I&#x27;d guess that anyone with any gum issues would not be able to tolerate it. Mid-power works just fine for me, so that&#x27;s what I use. I tried the higher setting as a test and can&#x27;t reproduce the bleeding gum problem that the WaterPik appears to have cured in a few weeks of regular use.    So apparently, my previous personal dental hygiene--which included brushing, flossing, and irrigating six times per day (once after each meal)--wasn&#x27;t sufficient to keep my gumline free of irritants and to properly stimulate my gums. Dentists have recommended digitally (finger) rubbing my gums as a remedy, but I&#x27;ve never been able to stick with it--too easy to invoke the gag reflex. The WaterPik, however, has proven to be a solution I can stick with.    Because this cleans so well, I now floss only twice a day (meaning I buy 2/3 less dental floss) and yet still have clean teeth and gums.    During my semi-annual dental cleaning and exams, I sometimes had the same minor gum bleeding that I experienced upon first use of the WaterPik. The reason for this has always been a mystery, until now. It was a mystery because I did everything right--brush, floss, irrigate. What I didn&#x27;t know was there is a huge difference in irrigators (dental water jets). From now on, it&#x27;s the WaterPik brand for me. I will accept no substitutes.</li>
            <li> Amazing how effective this spouting water cleans between the teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent flossing....recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to cover and keep neat.</li>
            <li> Water pick is excellent to remove food parts from areas that tooth brushes can not reach.&lt;br /&gt;If you try this item you will be happy, because it works</li>
            <li> I have one and I love it better than flossing. I gave one to my nephew for his birthday and he really needed one because he has braces.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase!! This waterpik gets the job done and so very easy to use. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the best waterpik I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;ve bought many over the years.  Has a nice strong jet -- I use the strongest setting as my gums remain strong with regular waterpik use.  I&#x27;ve converted my dentist who has seen my bad gums become healthy over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is pretty, to boot!</li>
            <li> I have had a WaterPik for many years and my old one wore out. This replacement model does a great job. It works really well cleaning under my bridge.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner every time I use this. There is a learning curve to learning how not to spray water all over the bathroom mirror but once you get past that you will definitely like using it.</li>
            <li> land-fill fodder-------total waste of money!  never worked right I had to go to bed bath &amp;beyond to get the real deal that would actually work.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use. It really keeps the gums healthy and cured my gingivitis. I bought it on my dentists recommendation.</li>
            <li> This is about the fifth WaterPik machine I have owned in the last several years.  I use this machine with a special nasal tip for allergy/sinus rinses and although it works well, the unit is not as heavy duty as the last WaterPik I owned.  The last machine lasted 2-years but I am doubtful this machine will last half that long.  One again like so many electromechanical devices in recent years, the quality of manufacture and long term durability continue to decrease as the replacement cost increases.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement product. I am very happy with price and performance. I would definitely buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I already knew this product.  I bought a previous version and I used it for more than 5 years with no trouble but a single disruption in the hose.  After has been fixed, everything was ok again.  Very effective.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet.  Wow, can I tell you how improved my gums and mouth felt for about 2 months!  But.... It was very short lived, as the tubing leading to the pic began leaking--then quickly lost all function.  Sorry, but I cannot afford to buy multiple units.  Also, it seems the motor is fine...what a waste!  Not doing it!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for what appeared to be the same model only about 5+ years old.  It actually works better than the old one ever did.</li>
            <li> does the job perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I like the adjustable tension for the water pressure.&lt;br /&gt;Better than floss but I still use both.&lt;br /&gt;also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> WaterPik is the only brand that I have previously owned that I would be willing to buy again.  It does the job.</li>
            <li> great shoots like a lasor getting all the food between your teeth and gums wish had my headphones to jam</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Water Piks for years. They&#x27;re great.  I turn mine up full blast and shoot the water between my teeth at the gum line for a few seconds; the spray acts like a little tornado and shoves out EVERYTHING!  Every 3 years or so, I wear one out and have to buy a new one, which is why I bought this one.  I really like it that they never change much.</li>
            <li> My last WaterPik Water Flosser stopped working after 4 years of constant use.  I went to two local drugstores and another online store but was unable to find this model.  Actually, I don&#x27;t use it for flossing but for a chronic sinus problem and after nasal surgery, the ENT doctor/surgeon gave me an attachment that fits this model.  It&#x27;s fast and easy to use and has really helped reduce the number of infections I used to have.  I was so relieved when I went to Amazon and found just what I was looking for.  It was shipped almost immediately and I received it in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> To reduce wear and tear, never remove the water tank from the device.  Instead, use a measuring cup to fill it with water.  This will keep the gasket from wearing out.  Also, watch instructional videos on youtube to learn how to use it properly.  They are very helpful.</li>
            <li> I love my new waterpik although I wish now I had spent the extra $20 to get the deluxe model. This one does a great job it just doesn&#x27;t have a lot of options so when it breaks I will most deffinately upgrade. I love it, well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> We use this for our ears.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Just what my dentist told me to get.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, but I was surprized to see there&lt;br /&gt;are so many different models.  This one is&lt;br /&gt;about in the middle of the pack, but works&lt;br /&gt;well for me.</li>
            <li> The Water Pik arrived in the usual lightning fast manner one expects from Amazon.  It works as intended.  My problem with it is it sounds like a gas generator with no muffler.  It is LOUD!  Use it when your spouse is sleeping and you&#x27;ll get a pillow to the back of your head - or worse!</li>
            <li> Waterpik, the easy way to good breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has several speeds and, pressures to adjust to your liking.  So, if your a grizzly and want to remove small animals from betwixt your teeth, turn up the power.&lt;br /&gt;Want to simply floss, turn it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very handy, and great way to keep the nasty out of your mouth</li>
            <li> I hate flossing but using this is easy and gets the same effect.</li>
            <li> Product weighs much less then my previous model and it is not nearly as powerful.  I have to use the highest setting - previously I used the middle setting.</li>
            <li> This is a good product ! But need improve on the water refill , can be easier and noise when operate.</li>
            <li> Been looking for replacement water pic for long time. But all fell short of the power this has. It is able to help keep your teeth clean!!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from the worst bad breath for more than 5 years and it made me feel like it&#x27;s the end of my social life. No one had ever complained about this but, I can see the reaction of the people and the worst part is I can smell my own s***ty smell breath. The day I have experience WaterPik the day I felt like I am born again. That&#x27;s why WaterPik is MY HERO.    Sincerely  Rosette</li>
            <li> My order was filled and delivered quickly.  The item was in its original package and arrived with no visible damage.  Set-up was simple and quick.  This was a replacement for one which had been used for many years.  Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I can use my WaterPik in about a quarter of the time it takes me to use regular floss, and it does a more thorough job.  It is a little noisy, but not that bad (and really, you are only running it for 1-2 minutes...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. My first WaterPik lasted about 10 years. This one lasted 3 months. I have replaced the hose twice. The first replacement lasted 3 weeks, the second hose lasted 1 week. I was told that since I add Listerine I need to rinse the machine withy warm water after I use it. I do this and it still stops working. Also the warranty is worthless. I am looking at other brands that will work with added mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked power brushes and reluctantly bought this product upon advice of dentist.  I love it.  Compact, easy to use, does the job  quickly and is refreshing.  Instead of a chore, it is a pleasure to use.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and think it will hold up well even though it wasn&#x27;t the highest priced unit.  These are so beneficial for gum health. the older you get, the more you need to pay attention to oral health.</li>
            <li> A little noisy (compared to earlier model) but is highly effective in removing plaque</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Wish I had bought one earlier in life.</li>
            <li> I use this machine on a daily basis with a compatible sinus attachment -- keeps the allergens out of my sinuses and preps me for singing.  Long-lasting, durable, and a must-have in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> The water Pik was very good and is an excellent tool to preventing  tooth decay  and other mouth problems. I recommend it to everybody</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it!</li>
            <li> (1-31-2013)  Like so many others, I will proclaim that oral irrigation is extremely beneficial to your health, blasting out rotting food particles, plaque and bacteria from places your toothbrush, floss and rinse can&#x27;t go. If you only suspect you might need to try it, you do. If you don&#x27;t suspect you might need to try it, you still do. Simply put, everybody should be doing this. It should be a standard and universal recommendation for every single person to include oral irrigation to their oral hygiene program alongside brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT proclaim that Waterpik is the way to go for oral irrigation. Yes, I know, they&#x27;ve been around for years and set the standard and made it popular and Waterpik is a household name like Kleenex or Xerox, but their products are crap. Sorry, but it&#x27;s true. They are not designed to last very long. I had the Waterpik WP&#x3D;60W for a short while. The hose cracked after a few years of use. It is not easily user-replaceable. I have read the reviews of the replacement hose/wand kits and I am not impressed. It seems that the wand will not accept the assortment of older-style tips I have and I would need to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the newer style. That&#x27;s a lot more money to buy new tips and a new hose/wand and why not just go all out and buy another, newer model Waterpik while I&#x27;m at it, it&#x27;s only hard-earned money, right? I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s Waterpik&#x27;s evil plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days, it seems that just about every company is greedy as **** and wants to make a bundle off the customer with their poorly made products and when all the companies are doing that the customer base suffers dramatically, being nickle-and-dimed into the poor house. (For you old enough, remember when a box of Corn Flakes was actually affordable?) It all adds up. I want to save my hard-earned money and I can be rather crafty when I want to be, so I decided to figure out a way to replace the original hose with off-brand hose and splice it onto the original hose below the wand with tube connectors and save myself a bundle by not having to pay Waterpik for a new hose/wand replacement kit and replacement tips, so I pulled the base unit apart to get to where the original hose connects directly to the pump inside (I found a customer review that explained how easy that is to do). When I carefully tried to pull the hose off the nipple on the pump, the cheap, brittle plastic nipple broke with NO hope of repair or replacement or work-around. Looking at the inner workings of the base unit, I realized that these things simply aren&#x27;t worth anywhere near the hard-earned money spent on them. They have virtually no user-replaceable parts and are built like a child&#x27;s toy. I recall paying around $45 at Target for this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched the newer models of Waterpik and only read that the same problems still exist. The main problem being the hoses crack after a short while. If your product is registered they will provide you with free replacements, so that&#x27;s nice of them, but why keep replacing crap parts with other crap parts? If the product is crap the product is crap therefore the product is CRAP.  Is Waterpik really the best way to go? No. They are extremely noisy and messy and inconvenient and expensive and poorly made. FAIL, FAIL, FAIL, FAIL, FAIL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Waterpik the only way to go? No. Time to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the ShowerBreeze w/ 6&#x27; hose by Oral Breeze which is inexpensive, convenient (you use it in the shower so no more mess to clean up!), quiet (no more pump to wake up the rest of the house!), efficient (doesn&#x27;t require counter top space or electricity), made in America and is very well-reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update here my experience with the ShowerBreeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (2-12-2013) I&#x27;ve used the Oral Breeze Shower Breeze for about a week and a half now and am very impressed. It&#x27;s construction is dead-simple and parts are user-serviceable, so if I were to ever damage the hose I can pick up something from any hardware store and fix it in minutes. Also, I get a stronger cleaning stream due to the house&#x27;s strong water pressure. It easily beats the WaterPik. And no more mess to clean up! So glad I switched to Oral Breeze.</li>
            <li> This product was bought for gift giving. -not for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Was informed that the receiver was very happy with the system.</li>
            <li> i bought this fom you and now 6 weeks or so later it doesnt pump water, i wish i had kept my old one instead to buying this one.  i never have had problem with any product from amazon but i guess this was going to happen.  i probably wont purchase anything from youe site again(im so sorry i lke amazon)&lt;br /&gt;dave</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Water Pik. I saw an immediate improvement in my oral health. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is effective. A little flimsy but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Comes with three adjustable piks, and adjustable water pressure.  It is easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik flosser has been a great addition to our dental hygene process.  We have been pleased with the improvement in the health of our gums since using this product.  It was just as described and is of good quality. It is not a substitute for flossing, but a great addition.  It arrived in a timely manner, just as we were  told it would.  We would definitly recommend this product and the seller as well.</li>
            <li> I had the battery version of the WaterPic that I bought from Walmart two years ago and had to replace it about 1 year later just out olf warranty because the batteries were not recharging.  The second one did the same so I bought this on sale for the same price.  The stream is more powerful so I set it about halfway on two because full open can cause my gums to bleed.  My only complaint so far is that the on-off switch on the left side is difficult to switch on (up) with one hand and you need to have the other hand holding the flosser hndle with shut off button depressed or water will start squirting everywhere.</li>
            <li> Makes fast work of the job.  Takes just minutes each morning.  I liked the clear water holder better than the blue color.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT SO FAR, SEEMS TO BE DOING A GOOD JOB.&lt;br /&gt;MY DENTIST SUGGESTED I GET ONE SO I WILL SEE.</li>
            <li> Despite negative reviews, I decided to give the waterpik a try, after an acquaintance insisted it was the better buy, and reliable.  It was loud and messy, as it slowly leaked water even when turned off, but it worked, and I was in need, so proceeded to use.  Well, it still makes a loud racket, tries to skate around the counter top, and leaks water through the hand held device, but it no longer pumps water through.  The only water that makes it through is a trickle that runs down my hand.  I was going to return or even exchange, but its been 31 days.  How about that!  Paid $35 for a months use of a crummy, cheap device.  I&#x27;d give a negative number review, if it were an option.  It&#x27;s a cheat.</li>
            <li> works really well, much lighter and less noisy then older models. I highly recommend if having problem with bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this item at a great price and it was delivered pronto. It works great, is compact and is the top quality I expected from WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Bought this model at the local big department store to replace a Conair model.  From the beginning this model was a disappointment.  The pressure was minimal and not as controllable as my previous flosser.  AND WHAT A MESS!  Water everywhere.  No matter how I held it, it over shot the spot every time.  But since I had been foolish enough the throw the receipt away I kept it. That was &lt; 3 months ago.  Last week it just simply died....No pressure at all. I was very disappointed! The Conair model lasted 4 years with no problems and it cost $10 less.  I had simply replaced it because I wanted something new :( NO MORE IMPULSE BUYING!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked using the WaterPik flosser especially for my gums.  In between my dentist visits, I like to keep my gums healthy.  The WaterPik flosser helps to keep my gums and teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> Like the jet control on the handle, but prefer the overall design of the WP-100, with a closed tank, rather than an open tank.</li>
            <li> This is number 4 or more of Water Piks; they last a long time, and do the job (still have my teeth).  Other brands I did like broke down after two years, so I&#x27;m staying with Water Pik.</li>
            <li> I have another Water Flosser just like it but decided I needed to replace it.  Just love it and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the fact that it is shorter than a lot of them so it fits better on my counter and most of all it&lt;br /&gt;does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought it to replace my old one which eventually wore out after several years of daily use. Much better than flossing if you have crowns.</li>
            <li> The flosser can be adjusted for strength of flow. It is easy to fill with water and remove water. It works very effectively. Only wish that they had included more than ! regular tip.</li>
            <li> These things are made cheaper each time we buy one. Looking for a alternative products.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is not as good as poast models.</li>
            <li> Works really good and hope to get allot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> The quality is great, Amazon beats all prices hands down. This unit is much smaller than the old style and convieniently slts on the vanity, Pressure is adjustible and I love the way it makes my move feel. Buy it you will love it.  Sam, RN</li>
            <li> Very noisy. Lacks flexibility. Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist encouraged me to get a WaterPik to get to hard to reach teeth. I have used it and my teeth feel cleaner and it works real good to get those back teeth that dental floss sometimes won&#x27;t get to.[[ASIN:B000063SLR WaterPik WP-60W Personal Dental Water Jet System</li>
            <li> This was my third water pick in ten years....I believe wearing out after five years is fair, given the hard water in my area. This was by far the worst water pick I have purchased. It lost the water pressure to the pick after two weeks. I sent an email to their customer service and they said I needed to replace the reservoir valve. They sent me a replacement valve.  Replaced it and nothing changed.  I emailed them and they sent me some complicated instructions on how to get it to work. Still did not work.  I told them that the unit was defective and have not heard back. My guess is that they, like a lot of manufacturers have skimped on quality and went for cheap.  The unit is in the trash and I will purchase from a competitor brand....I hope it works as well as my \\&quot;old\\&quot; Water pick.</li>
            <li> I felt like the water pic was opened before I got it and that raised sanitation concerns.  I did mix peroxode and water and use that in it, but still if I knew the condition it was in when I got it, i would not have ordered it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sad when august American companies, whose products had ruled the world since WWII, nowadays export their manufacturing to China with the result being unreliable, shoddy products not only such as this one, but also with \\&quot;prestigious name\\&quot; combination padlocks I bought that failed and numerous other shoddy Chinese products.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly on a number of levels.  Bought it for nasal irrigation  for myself and water pic for my son.  You have to purchase the Sinupulse Elite Replacement Sinus Irrigator Tip to use with it, but this is much more cost effective than purchasing more expensive models and just getting one use!  I&#x27;m convinced that this saved me from the annual sinus infection I get every autumn.  I just remove the tip and rinse the reservoir and then my son, who has braces, can use it for himself.  It makes both of our lives much easier.</li>
            <li> IT WENT COMPLETELY INOPERATIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on , makes noise but there is no water flow at all no matter how I push on the tank and its link to the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I return it and get a replacement?</li>
            <li> I have purchased many WaterPik&#x27;s - they are very functional in cleaning debris from between the teeth.  Since I use the device daily, they need to be periodically replaced.  This time I went to the WaterPik site and found their most economical model and then I shopped on the internet to locate a provider.  It was a lot easier then trying to find one at a store since they have a limited selection.  The product was received quickly and I am satisfied with my purchasing experience.</li>
            <li> they made it a little quieter than previous WP-60 model and the hose is now easier to replace without tearing the machine apart. my old one blew the pump apart when the plastic got old (about 2.5 years) and it was a bear to get apart. no more tongue cleaner though. that&#x27;s ok i never used it anyway.</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate, and it is a fantastic product.The WaterPik Water Flosser came recommended by my Dental Hygenist. MD</li>
