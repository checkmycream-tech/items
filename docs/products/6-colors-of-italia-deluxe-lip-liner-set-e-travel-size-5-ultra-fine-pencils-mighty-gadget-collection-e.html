            <li> These were actually quite nice! I would have given 5 stars, but I didn&#x27;t like the lighter colors. Other then that, they went on smooth, lasted for a while, non ashy and very pigmented!</li>
            <li> They were OK lip liners for the price and they do the job. I&#x27;m satisfied. They also came quickly in just a few days</li>
            <li> Great range of colors, but not creamy at all.  I like to fill in my lips with the pencil before I apply lipstick or gloss.  These do not do the job.  I can outline my lips only.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, they glade on easily, they last all day long and match perfectly with my lip gloss and lipstick.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how much I loved these colors. I mainly wear red lips, so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how I would feel about the other colors, but there is enough of a red tone to the purples that works beautifully with my darker red shades. Love all the colors!</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as I would have liked but it&#x27;s great for the price.</li>

            <li> For the price, you couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set and great lip pencils.  Mostly darker color...there are a few I don&#x27;t need...but at this price, no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> I love it. They are smooth, long lasting and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lip liners. They are well pigmented and easy to apply.  Colors are gorgeous, creamy with a matte finish. Better than some other quality brand I would say. Very pleased with this product.</li>

            <li> Line the lips nicely. I needed this reddish colors.</li>
            <li> Love these! Smooth color to line lips or wear as a full color. Use gloss after for a shimmer. Coming from a wedding stylist, I loved this product.</li>

            <li> Great pencils I would recommend  ladies buy it really excellent  products</li>
            <li> Great deal for the money. If you&#x27;ve priced lip liners you know. Never as many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; shades as you&#x27;d like, but they all suffer from this drawback. These apply well, don&#x27;t get too badly eaten up in the sharpener and last well. One additional application during the day is all I need and I am hard on lip products because I drink a lot of tea during the day.</li>
            <li> Very good but there is tow colors that are the same</li>
            <li> they are beautiful colors and have a matte finish it blends very well and it glides it also last long</li>
            <li> Love Love all beautiful rich colors</li>
            <li> Didnt use these at all. They are much darker than expected. I like natural colors and for me none of the are natural tone</li>
            <li> Long-lasting color. I sometimes shade my entire lips with the pencil and wear it without lipstick/gloss for a matte finish. I&#x27;ve recieved multiple compliments.</li>
            <li> good quality! Easy application. One complaint is that some of the colors were extremely similar, also could have done without the hot pink</li>
            <li> Great colors,  good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These lip liners are very good quality. They are bold colors that show and last for many hours. Love them! And the shipping was very quick. Got to my house about 3 days after I ordered. . ‚ô°‚ô•‚ô°‚ô•</li>
            <li> I love the colors , and long stay lip liner</li>
            <li> Very nice, wish there was a little bit more of a variety in colors but all in all, very nice.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The person I brought this for loves this</li>
            <li> Very good quality. It can be compared with all the fancy make up brands.</li>
            <li> these are perfect. they are soft and easy to apply, they last a long time and are very easy to store and travel with. I&#x27;d buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I loved these, they are easy to apply and last awhile, shipping was fast I was very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the price for these</li>
            <li> Fast and great shipping! I love the quality of these colors!</li>
            <li> My lip liners arrived packaged nice and secure- I&#x27;d definitely buy these again as they are just as good as a &amp;#34;famous&amp;#34; maker that I paid $13 for.  Nice to have more options at such a reasonable price!!!! Shipper was great- no problems at all!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> They came is 3 days! They glide on, and they aren&#x27;t shiny or anything. The stay on for a while, I have to reapply like once a day, but it&#x27;s good for about 3 or 4 hours. They&#x27;re medium sized, not small, not large. Nothing to complain about with this, honestly. I love mine</li>
            <li> smooth to apply.  I compare to my NYX pencils as for as application.  I would like to see some more color variation.  I use only two of them regularly.</li>
            <li> i love them. its a great deal but the thing is they don&#x27;t last much &amp; their packaging is not that great but for the price its awesome</li>
            <li> I like these.  i&#x27;m not a big lipstick wearer, but when I do, these outlining pencils compliment the color and seem to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely AMAZING! no idea why these are so cheap because WOW these are crazy good. They go on like a creamy consistency and stay matte. I put a clear gloss over them and do not even NEED a lipstick! Definitely amazing and WILL absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love them great texture very smooth to apply. Beautiful colors. Amazing. I&#x27;ll def order more &amp;#60;3 üòçüë∏üëåüíÑ‚ù§</li>
            <li> Nice colors and smooth but not long stay</li>
            <li> Beautiful Colors! every one of them are neutral reds and can be used with many shades of lipstick or used alone. Love them just has much as high end products. Would definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> They work wonderfully</li>
            <li> Never knew lipliners could be this creamy and smooth... The colors are soo bright n rich!</li>
            <li> Excellant, but the colors are almost similar</li>
            <li> LOVE just wish they had a bit more staying power. Couple with make up finishing powder for greater application. I am medium, dark complexion and it looks great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> these are perfect. they are soft and easy to apply, they last a long time and are very easy to store and travel with. I&#x27;d buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I Never Got The Eyelashes üëé</li>
            <li> I love then, didn&#x27;t really think the where going to be small, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I was running low on lip liner and this is what I needed.The colors are absolutely beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> Great colors and price. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I got these, the colors were kind of from what was shown in pictures. They came in a really big envelope. But, still pretty good for the cost.</li>
            <li> Great colors. And fast shipping. Not very creamy but I guess it will do.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive any eye lashes but I love the lipstick in ordering more as we speak</li>
