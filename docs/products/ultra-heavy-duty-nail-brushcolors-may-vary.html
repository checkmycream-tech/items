            <li>Two sets of bristles is a great thing.</li>
            <li>great brush</li>
            <li>It is good for taking off the sticky substance found on some rhododendrons when dead-heading.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li>This brush is a good size and does what is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are nice for the price.</li>
            <li>An excellent fingernail brush at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>it was very strong and scrubbed well.</li>
            <li>Just a great all-around brush.</li>
            <li>I wish it were better made.</li>
            <li>What I especially love about this nail brush is the double sided capacity to scrub nails.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love about that.</li>
            <li>This item really does a great job at what it&#x27;s supposed to do - clean my nails.  </li>
            <li>HAVE BETTER HAND BRUSHES OFF CHEAP WALMART STUFF</li>
            <li>liked it so much, I ordered more.</li>
            <li>An excellent, basic fingernail brush, just right for all the crevices and crannies at the washstand.  </li>
            <li>The larger bristles are softer, the shorter side gets under nails beautifully.</li>
            <li>I wear acrylic nails most of the time and it&#x27;s really important to me to keep them clean and sanitary since I do a lot of cooking at home.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>I liked this nail brush, it came with the nail cleaner that really helped clean under nails.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a significant mark-up on what is already packaged for retail.</li>
            <li>The brush was perfect in size and angle - but it only lasted 1 month before the bristles went in wild directions so the quality isn&#x27;t there that I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I had some wood nail brushes, but they quickly became moldy.</li>
            <li>Now that I know these brushes are good, I am going to buy a few more.</li>
            <li>Would love to find something longer lasting and would pay more to do so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good nail brush!</li>
            <li>After using this brush to clean my hands and fingernails, the nail brush area or top brush stems collapsed after one week of daily use.</li>
            <li>This thing is really sturdy and I would describe it as almost heavy duty; it is a great quality, and I would expect to find something like this in the nail salon.  </li>
            <li>i love to have a nail brush at the sink especially when baking</li>
            <li>It is heavy duty as described and is nice and wide to fit most of your fingers across at one time.</li>
            <li>It really is a Ultra Heavy-duty nail brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough to be comfortable and yet strong enough for the job.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on top are shorter than those on bottom, but it&#x27;s a bed of bristles the same general area as those on bottom.</li>
            <li>Second, I paid $6.75 for the brush but the product packaging has $3.19 printed right on it.</li>
            <li>Stiff bristles makes for better cleaning.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering a nail brush with a single row of bristles on a top ledge, for getting underneath long nails.</li>
            <li>First, the nail brush is called &amp;#34;ultra white&amp;#34; and the picture of the brush was white.</li>
            <li>They are way too soft to scrub my old-lady-farm hands.  </li>
            <li>THESE ARE WAY TO SOFT</li>
            <li>it does the very well and lasts a long time to so</li>
            <li>I am not someone who buys something just because it&#x27;s pink, it has to be functional first.  </li>
            <li>Very Heavy Duty at such a Reasonably Price !!!</li>

            <li> Very Heavy Duty at such a Reasonably Price !!!</li>
            <li> This brush split and the bristles collapsed within a few months of normal use.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I particularly like this product because it&#x27;s firm enough to really get the dirt out from under my nails but not so tough that it scratches my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> It might sound silly</li>
            <li> Not highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not stiff and therefore not effective in removing grease under nails.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are wimpy, and after only a few weeks of use, it&#x27;s worn out.</li>
            <li> I do not think it can get everything under the nails, as other brushes I have do.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without those little brushes - love them for scrubbing dirty fingers and nails but also use others in the kitchen scrubbing cutting boards, etc.</li>
            <li> Therefore the name Ultra Heavy-duty Nail brush is in my opinion is not true, and I would not suggest anyone purchase this nail brush.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;ll use it to bush my little lamb&#x27;s whiskers...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little bit picky with my nail tools.  </li>
            <li> This was an unusual disappointing Amazon experience.</li>
            <li> but alas it finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give the Eppco Heavy Duty nail brush a shot.</li>
            <li> Ultra Heavy duty?  </li>
            <li> they can call it &amp;#34;Ultra Heavy Duty&amp;#34; I do not understand.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail brush because the ad said it was heavy duty (used by gardners and painters, etc).  </li>
            <li> Overall not a great representation of the product.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not strong at all.  </li>
            <li> WAY TO SOFT TO GET ANY REAL DIRT AND GRIM</li>
            <li> I am going to have to replace it, as I know how germs can negatively affect people&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> Not exactly long-lasting quality, I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> Bristol&#x27;s are softer than expected and would like due to how dirty my hands can get!</li>
            <li> The brush is tough and will prove to be long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know of a truly tough nail brush?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is not that nail brush.  </li>
            <li> so it was my mistake for getting fooled by the image and heading, but still disappointing.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because fewer people do manual labor and get dirty hands these days?</li>
            <li> If very dirty, wash in laundry.</li>

            <li> This is a great scrub brush for the gardener getting rid of dirt and slug-slime.  It is good for taking off the sticky substance found on some rhododendrons when dead-heading. Great for the painter removing splatter from hands and arms.  Just a great all-around brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice for the price. They get the job done to keep the germs off the hands and fingernails!</li>
            <li> I liked this nail brush, it came with the nail cleaner that really helped clean under nails. it was very strong and scrubbed well. It really is a Ultra Heavy-duty nail brush. great product.</li>
            <li> The search goes on. Bristles are flimsy on both sides.  I got to Mexico and wear flip flops for weeks at a time. I need something that will get the grime out from under my toenails. I had a great one that I got from my mom but alas it finally gave up the ghost. I have found nothing in comparable searching in beauty shops and drug stores.I&#x27;m going to give the Eppco Heavy Duty nail brush a shot.</li>
            <li> Ultra Heavy duty?  You&#x27;ve got to be kidding.  Not only is it NOT ultra or heavy-duty, I would classify it as woosy-duty!  The bristles arrived bent, just from leaning up again the shell-plastic it was packaged in.  They are way too soft to scrub my old-lady-farm hands.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll use it to bush my little lamb&#x27;s whiskers...that&#x27;s about all it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li> WAY TO SOFT TO GET ANY REAL DIRT AND GRIM OFF I WORK WITH INK AND HAVE BETTER HAND BRUSHES OFF CHEAP WALMART STUFF THESE ARE WAY TO SOFT</li>
            <li> The bristles are wimpy, and after only a few weeks of use, it&#x27;s worn out. I wish it were better made.</li>
            <li> What I especially love about this nail brush is the double sided capacity to scrub nails. The larger bristles are softer, the shorter side gets under nails beautifully. I purposefully. Bought several different brushes at one time to try them out against one another. This brush has lasted the longest and cleans nails and hands the best. I am going to stock every sink in my house with these.</li>
            <li> An excellent fingernail brush at a reasonable price.  The brush is tough and will prove to be long-lasting.</li>
            <li> The photo on this is misleading. I thought I was ordering a nail brush with a single row of bristles on a top ledge, for getting underneath long nails. Instead, the plastic handle is actually U shaped. The bristles on top are shorter than those on bottom, but it&#x27;s a bed of bristles the same general area as those on bottom.</li>
            <li> Bristol&#x27;s are softer than expected and would like due to how dirty my hands can get!</li>
            <li> liked it so much, I ordered more.</li>
            <li> sturdy;plastic nailbrush with bristles on both sides</li>
            <li> After using this brush to clean my hands and fingernails, the nail brush area or top brush stems collapsed after one week of daily use. Therefore the name Ultra Heavy-duty Nail brush is in my opinion is not true, and I would not suggest anyone purchase this nail brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good size and does what is supposed to do.  Easy to clean--just throw it in the dishwasher. If very dirty, wash in laundry. I had some wood nail brushes, but they quickly became moldy. Now that I know these brushes are good, I am going to buy a few more.</li>
            <li> i love to have a nail brush at the sink especially when baking</li>
            <li> This brush split and the bristles collapsed within a few months of normal use.&lt;br /&gt;How they can call it &amp;#34;Ultra Heavy Duty&amp;#34; I do not understand.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without those little brushes - love them for scrubbing dirty fingers and nails but also use others in the kitchen scrubbing cutting boards, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail brush because the ad said it was heavy duty (used by gardners and painters, etc).  I do garden, and was looking for a nailbrush that is sturdy, and gets the dirt out from under the nails.  This is not that brush  The bristles are not strong at all.  Does anyone know of a truly tough nail brush?</li>
            <li> First, the nail brush is called &amp;#34;ultra white&amp;#34; and the picture of the brush was white. Both of these things indicated that I was ordering a white nail brush. I received a navy blue nail brush - I know it seems picky, but I didn&#x27;t want a navy blue brush. I now see in parentheses that it says (colors may vary) so it was my mistake for getting fooled by the image and heading, but still disappointing. Second, I paid $6.75 for the brush but the product packaging has $3.19 printed right on it. Hmmmm... That&#x27;s a significant mark-up on what is already packaged for retail. Overall not a great representation of the product. This was an unusual disappointing Amazon experience.</li>
            <li> Purchased three of these in September 2011.  My specific need was to get grease and dirt out from under my nails after working outside around the yard, in the garage or basement.  This they do well.  However, after 10 months I have worn out two of the three.  Ultra heavy-duty?  Guess it depends on how you define the words.  For the price I guess I cannot argue that they work as advertised.  Would love to find something longer lasting and would pay more to do so. Written by Barbara&#x27;s husband.</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase. It is heavy duty as described and is nice and wide to fit most of your fingers across at one time. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I do not think it can get everything under the nails, as other brushes I have do. I would not buy this again. I am going to have to replace it, as I know how germs can negatively affect people&#x27;s health. Not highly recommended.</li>
            <li> just what i wanted. It works the way I thought it would, we even use one in the kitchen for cleaning vegetables.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a nail brush that would get all the grease out from under my fingernails.  Unfortunately this is not that nail brush.  The bristles are not stiff and therefore not effective in removing grease under nails.  It&#x27;s hard to find a good nail brush!</li>
            <li> The brush was perfect in size and angle - but it only lasted 1 month before the bristles went in wild directions so the quality isn&#x27;t there that I&#x27;d like. Not exactly long-lasting quality, I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> An excellent, basic fingernail brush, just right for all the crevices and crannies at the washstand.  The bristles are soft enough to be comfortable and yet strong enough for the job.  I had looked for this in Walmart and drug stores all over town and Amazon was the only source I could find.  Maybe it&#x27;s because fewer people do manual labor and get dirty hands these days?</li>
            <li> Needed a brush for the nails.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;hands on&amp;#34; person, you&#x27;ll need something to scrub under the nails.&lt;br /&gt;This gets the job done !&lt;br /&gt;Enough said, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It might sound silly but I&#x27;m a little bit picky with my nail tools.  I am not someone who buys something just because it&#x27;s pink, it has to be functional first.  This item really does a great job at what it&#x27;s supposed to do - clean my nails.  I wear acrylic nails most of the time and it&#x27;s really important to me to keep them clean and sanitary since I do a lot of cooking at home.  I particularly like this product because it&#x27;s firm enough to really get the dirt out from under my nails but not so tough that it scratches my cuticles.  This thing is really sturdy and I would describe it as almost heavy duty; it is a great quality, and I would expect to find something like this in the nail salon.  If this product ever wears out, which I don&#x27;t think will be any time soon, I would buy another in a heart beat!</li>
            <li> Excellent Nail Brush.  Very Heavy Duty at such a Reasonably Price !!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Is big enough to get a grasp on it. Stiff bristles makes for better cleaning. Two sets of bristles is a great thing.</li>
            <li> The color in the picture when I bought this item was blue! The item I received was white. I noticed in another review that someone received some sort of nail cleaner. All that was in my package was the white nail brush like the one pictured.</li>
            <li> great brush it does the very well and lasts a long time to so what&#x27;s not to love about that.</li>
