            <li>Nice combo.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the best shampoo I have ever used it makes my hair so nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant light smell when lathering but fades</li>
            <li>But the best part of this deal is the sheer quantity of shampoo you get--68 ounces!</li>
            <li>Started using this stuff about 2 months ago and since i have my hair is in much better shape</li>
            <li>I love this Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Save $$$ &amp; your gas and buy through Amazon :)</li>
            <li>it seems to help with my scalp better, but it is not a life changing shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the smell this shampoo, which is manly, and leaves your scalp with a soothing minty feeling while it&#x27;s being washed.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and cleaning experience of this product.</li>
            <li>They came sealed in a plastic bag inside the box so integrity of the box was OK .If</li>
            <li>I love it and</li>
            <li>Its been my favorite brand for many years</li>
            <li>Seems to be way more manageable as it gets to those longer lengths before I go to get a haircut.</li>
            <li>to take care of oily hair.. cause it dern sure dont Work</li>
            <li>and it  does smell ok for men</li>
            <li>This is much better</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo helped with flaking skin from using women&#x27;s shampoo for too many years.  </li>
            <li>It also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, and if you read the ingredients, they are all extracts and natural additives.</li>
            <li>Your hair will be revitalized and smooth.     </li>
            <li>If you use this in concert with American Crew gel, you will have great results.     </li>
            <li>Getting the salon size at a great price will keep me coming back.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>I do feel like I am getting clean hair.  </li>
            <li>This one in particular has a great smell, a sort of masculine scent, you could say.</li>
            <li>Feels cool and tingly on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>This product cost more than twice as much in stores.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price, even more so if you buy the large bottle.</li>
            <li>quickly ones</li>
            <li>the price is worth it</li>
            <li>Normally what happens is that a fine amount of oil reappears after 5-ish hours on my scalp and face.</li>
            <li>The price is VERY cheap compared to what you would pay in your local drug store, or even at a wholesale store.</li>
            <li>Nice everyday shampoo that is easy on your hair but still feels clean, not dried out.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t a problem since only the plastic at the top shattered, so</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s various vendors is much better than most salons, especially in the 33.8 oz size.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it has never failed to satisfy my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t recommend with any higher marks.</li>
            <li>But comparing bottle labels etc, the seemed to be an exact match.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>seem to be the exact product.</li>
            <li>The smell is masculine and fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>and it is consistent which not all cheaper store brands seem to be.</li>
            <li>they all seem to clean and leave my hair about the same when done however this stuff does cause a sort of clean tingling feeling</li>
            <li>Actually meant to buy the shampoo for dry scalp, but this is working great.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean, soft, and shiny without striping it of sheen and life.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, if you&#x27;re interested in a more high quality shampoo, and you don&#x27;t want to break the bank doing so, buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li>which you can&#x27;t, since it&#x27;s so large and the cap is narrow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a fresh clean smell and really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I believe the supply is coming straight from overseas.  </li>
            <li>My husband is very picky about his shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The reason I ordered this was because it works very well on my hair, and you can&#x27;t get it any cheaper than what I paid on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>or so I&#x27;ve really noticed an improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>take much to get a think lather in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily, straight fine black Asian hair and this shampoo does a great job of taking down the oil levels on my head.  </li>
            <li>I have been using American Crew hair products for some time, and their shampoo is just as good as their other products.</li>
            <li>As long as they make this product I will not need to look for another fine shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though be careful--since the bottles are so large, they are a little hefty, and so if you drop one on its head like I did, the cap at the top might break.  </li>
            <li>The problem now is that there is limited amount available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend purchasing this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone who uses Crew.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>it is much better than my usual shampoo, however I can&#x27;t really give it a glowing review.</li>
            <li>All right I am getting rather thin up top</li>
            <li>I used it every day for several years now, using the large 33 ounces bottles, and with a subscription for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I finally found this product, and bought it despite its relatively high price.  </li>
            <li>Both were fantastic, and I usually switch off and on between those two.</li>
            <li>It washes clean every time, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I usually order the two big bottles which last me about a year and take advantage of the free shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and never get dry.</li>
            <li>Applying American Crew styling products work better in conjunction with the shampoos / conditioners as well, there&#x27;s less &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34;, for me at least.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the money, and I finally saw some the other day at my local Target store.</li>
            <li> issue I had is the lids were not on quite tight enough and they did leak just a little , not enough that I really lost enough to notice</li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive.  </li>
            <li> The items arrived much earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair with what seems to be just enough moisture so that it style well without gel or other products.</li>
            <li> I started using American Crew products a little over a year ago, and I haven&#x27;t gone back to grocery store shampoos / conditioners since.</li>
            <li> and i dont have as dry of scalp as i used to.</li>
            <li> Suds well in both hard and soft water.</li>
            <li> it turns my hair rough (non silky).</li>
            <li> It is just about the only shampoo product that I&#x27;ve found that does not leave my hair dried out.</li>
            <li> Used to use head and shoulders but this one leaves my scalp less dry.</li>
            <li> Other than the sodium laureth sulfates or whatever.</li>
            <li> Check out their other products too</li>
            <li> The reviews by other Amazon users say that it leaves a manly smell.</li>
            <li> : My hair is a little dry though.</li>
            <li> No dry hair even in mile high desert and cold winters.</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> it still works (just the hinge has a hole in it now, so shampoo can leak out if I stored it upside down...</li>
            <li> Showering every day, I think I might get through both of these bottles in over a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> (You&#x27;d rub your hand, and you&#x27;d see a slight sheen on your fingers)</li>
            <li> This was the case previously as well, where I labeled \\&quot;Note\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but it made a mess of the bottles.</li>
            <li> My hair used to get a little oily at the end of the day, but not after using this product.</li>
            <li> Started using this a few years ago when my wife bought me some, I was a lifetime &amp;#34;pert&amp;#34;user.  </li>
            <li> My scalp was pretty bad; I got scalpne.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you have never used this product, you need  VERY LITTLE of it .  </li>
            <li> but I still need to shampoo what I got left, this is quite expensive compared to cheaper and store brands and it is just shampoo</li>
            <li> This products just short of stinks with no scalp tingle.  </li>
            <li> no good product..same oily hair ..</li>
            <li> Buy this product to remove it from my scalp greasy, and was worse, every time I use my head shines.</li>
            <li> is how bad it was.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I looked everywhere for a shampoo designed for oily hair.  I finally found this product, and bought it despite its relatively high price.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the money, and I finally saw some the other day at my local Target store.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily, straight fine black Asian hair and this shampoo does a great job of taking down the oil levels on my head.  It also smells pretty good. But the best part of this deal is the sheer quantity of shampoo you get--68 ounces! they&#x27;re enormous.  Showering every day, I think I might get through both of these bottles in over a year and a half.  Can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though be careful--since the bottles are so large, they are a little hefty, and so if you drop one on its head like I did, the cap at the top might break.  Mine broke but it wasn&#x27;t a problem since only the plastic at the top shattered, so it still works (just the hinge has a hole in it now, so shampoo can leak out if I stored it upside down... which you can&#x27;t, since it&#x27;s so large and the cap is narrow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I use it every day.  It has a fresh clean smell and really goes a long way.  The best price I have found is on Amazon.  I usually order the two big bottles which last me about a year and take advantage of the free shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great price for 2 liters of shampoo. Very good for men with oily scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Started using this stuff about 2 months ago and since i have my hair is in much better shape and i dont have as dry of scalp as i used to. Also leaves your hair smelling great.</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo. The smell is great, and if you read the ingredients, they are all extracts and natural additives. Other than the sodium laureth sulfates or whatever. My hair stays soft and never get dry. This stuff is a fraction of the cost of your local drugstore prices; ie. C^$ or WA(&amp;R33n$.</li>
            <li> One of the Best All Around Shampoos out there at a Great Price. Save $$$ &amp; your gas and buy through Amazon :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month. it is much better than my usual shampoo, however I can&#x27;t really give it a glowing review. it seems to help with my scalp better, but it is not a life changing shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky and when I use non daily shampoo it remains the same but when I started using this daily shampoo it turns my hair rough (non silky).</li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew hair products for some time, and their shampoo is just as good as their other products. I love the smell this shampoo, which is manly, and leaves your scalp with a soothing minty feeling while it&#x27;s being washed. Your hair will be revitalized and smooth.     If you use this in concert with American Crew gel, you will have great results.     The price from Amazon and it&#x27;s various vendors is much better than most salons, especially in the 33.8 oz size. I&#x27;d highly recommend purchasing this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always like this shampoo as it doesn&#x27;t have a girly smell and the smell it does have is not overpowering. It leaves my hair with what seems to be just enough moisture so that it style well without gel or other products. Amazon also has a great price since buying this at Target you would pay about $14+ for a bottle that is 1/3 the size of one of these two bottles.</li>
            <li> Work great on my Husbands hair. Sorry to see store and online isn&#x27;t going to carry it any more.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo for men that is excellent quality and smells great. Despite a hefty price tag, Amazon pricing is 25% of the local barber shop!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it has never failed to satisfy my expectations.  The problem now is that there is limited amount available.  I believe the supply is coming straight from overseas.  It took a long time to arrive.  That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> My husband is very picky about his shampoo.  This is only brand he will use.  Getting the salon size at a great price will keep me coming back.</li>
            <li> My scalp was pretty bad; I got scalpne. Or headne. Anyways, I had acne on my scalp is how bad it was. Not anymore. Normally what happens is that a fine amount of oil reappears after 5-ish hours on my scalp and face. (You&#x27;d rub your hand, and you&#x27;d see a slight sheen on your fingers) Now I don&#x27;t have that for my scalp, which brings me to the title, I wish I had a product like this for my face. That&#x27;s how good it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: My hair is a little dry though. Nothing a dab of conditioner may or may not fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After using it regularly for about 2, 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair and scalp...I dunno, readjusted to this shampoo and my hair is now smooth*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*After waking up in the morning, cause I take evening showers. This was the case previously as well, where I labeled \\&quot;Note\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and cleaning experience of this product. Feels cool and tingly on the scalp.  Leaves hair clean, soft, and shiny without striping it of sheen and life.  I always lather twice and this product lasts forever.  No dry hair even in mile high desert and cold winters. As long as they make this product I will not need to look for another fine shampoo. Worth the price, even more so if you buy the large bottle. Couldn&#x27;t recommend with any higher marks.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for several years now, using the large 33 ounces bottles, and with a subscription for a decent price. Smells good, good wash. I used it with the matching conditionner. Nice combo.  I&#x27;ll use it again for a while, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been warned that some of these products are knockoffs. But comparing bottle labels etc, the seemed to be an exact match.&lt;br /&gt;Does seem to be the exact product. The reason I ordered this was because it works very well on my hair, and you can&#x27;t get it any cheaper than what I paid on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I had is the lids were not on quite tight enough and they did leak just a little , not enough that I really lost enough to notice&lt;br /&gt;it in the bottle but it made a mess of the bottles.They came sealed in a plastic bag inside the box so integrity of the box was OK .If&lt;br /&gt;you have never used this product, you need  VERY LITTLE of it .  When I finally run out I will be checking on Amazon for it again.</li>
            <li> Crew is the stuff that is made just for guys.  The smell is masculine and fantastic.  One of the best if not the best men&#x27;s grooming shampoos.  Check out their other products too, they are all good!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best shampoo I have ever used it makes my hair so nice and soft.  I love it and the price is worth it I have had one bottle last me about 6 months</li>
            <li> Buy this product to remove it from my scalp greasy, and was worse, every time I use my head shines.</li>
            <li> Used to use head and shoulders but this one leaves my scalp less dry. Scent is great too without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> My hair used to get a little oily at the end of the day, but not after using this product. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I love it! It smells manly also.</li>
            <li> Shampoo works great. Its been my favorite brand for many years so that has never been an issue.  Product leaked during shipment.</li>
            <li> I started using American Crew products a little over a year ago, and I haven&#x27;t gone back to grocery store shampoos / conditioners since. For the shampoos, I&#x27;ve used this one and the Daily Moisturizing Shampoo. Both were fantastic, and I usually switch off and on between those two. This one in particular has a great smell, a sort of masculine scent, you could say. It washes clean every time, and a little goes a long way. Over the year or so I&#x27;ve really noticed an improvement in my hair. Seems to be way more manageable as it gets to those longer lengths before I go to get a haircut. Applying American Crew styling products work better in conjunction with the shampoos / conditioners as well, there&#x27;s less &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34;, for me at least. Ultimately, if you&#x27;re interested in a more high quality shampoo, and you don&#x27;t want to break the bank doing so, buy on Amazon. The price is VERY cheap compared to what you would pay in your local drug store, or even at a wholesale store.</li>
            <li> Changed the formula. Smells terrible.</li>
            <li> It is just about the only shampoo product that I&#x27;ve found that does not leave my hair dried out. So, basically it cleans without flaking. And you cannot beat the price for the quantity you are getting.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need. I have oily hair so wash it quite a lot. The shampoo is great in that it cleans well but doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all.</li>
            <li> They are a great company to work with.  The items arrived much earlier than expected.  When I emailed them they were very nice.</li>
            <li> no good product..same oily hair .. I do not know why this product was adv. to take care of oily hair.. cause it dern sure dont Work</li>
            <li> Nice everyday shampoo that is easy on your hair but still feels clean, not dried out. I&#x27;ve used this for several years now.</li>
            <li> This product cost more than twice as much in stores.  Great price for an amazing product. Highly recommend this to anyone who uses Crew.</li>
            <li> All right I am getting rather thin up top but I still need to shampoo what I got left, this is quite expensive compared to cheaper and store brands and it is just shampoo they all seem to clean and leave my hair about the same when done however this stuff does cause a sort of clean tingling feeling and it  does smell ok for men and it is consistent which not all cheaper store brands seem to be.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this (bought 2 bottles a year ago). I&#x27;ve used this throughout the year. The reviews by other Amazon users say that it leaves a manly smell. After getting out of the shower, there is no scent at all.</li>
            <li> Started using this a few years ago when my wife bought me some, I was a lifetime &amp;#34;pert&amp;#34;user.  This is much better and I&#x27;m sure better for my hair.  Non stop user since then and I really enjoy using this product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Actually meant to buy the shampoo for dry scalp, but this is working great. Smells good, and doens&#x27;t take much to get a think lather in my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helped with flaking skin from using women&#x27;s shampoo for too many years.  It has a pleasant light smell when lathering but fades quickly ones your hair dries after the shower. Suds well in both hard and soft water.</li>
            <li> A good quality shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for the past 7 years and it doesn&#x27;t abuse the scalp or hair.  I used to always have to rotate shampoos to remove whatever they left on my hair, or to let the hair recover from whatever the shampoo removed.  I don&#x27;t need to do that with this one.  Works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years.  It works well, leaving my hair look good.  It has a pleasant, manly smell.</li>
            <li> When I use the product bought from the salon, it smells minty and my scalp tingles.  This products just short of stinks with no scalp tingle.  It does lather up.  I do feel like I am getting clean hair.  I just don&#x27;t feel like I got the product I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I ordered 2 bottles shampoo and 2 bottles conditioner.  I received 4 bottles shampoo.  One of those bottles leaked during shipment.</li>
