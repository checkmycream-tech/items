            <li> I found NAKED BEE products in a tiny town in another state a few years back.  I am hooked. LOVE the sweet smell (but not too sweet in my opinion) and the organic components.  We just purchased some for our 100 year old grandma and she loves it too!  The candle in the travel kit is an added bonus :) And of course, Amazon did a fantastic job in fulfilling the order!</li>
            <li> This is a great little travel kit. It has everything you need, shampoo/conditioner, soap, lotion, lip balm and a bonus, a candle for some ambiance while you travel. Everything smells great and it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my niece for Christmas.  She has sensitive skin and cannot tolerate many of the other brands.  She loves this kind and asked me where I got it so she can get more. She also loves that the products are not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this for the bag, you may be disappointed. However, the contents are great. Wife loves the lotion and soaps, very good scent, and likes it better than the competition.</li>
            <li> I adore the naked bee product line, love the body lotion and wanted to try the shampoo so bought this travel kit.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom. She was very happy. She has used everything except the little soap and candle that came with it. Her only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t buy bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift. Price very reasonable! I am sure recipient will like. I do plan on ordering more to have on hand.</li>
            <li> These arrived and looked used because the plastic &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34; the products were in was scratched and dirty. Couldn&#x27;t use these as gifts, as I intended, so I sent back. It&#x27;s too bad because I do like the naked bee products. Very similar to Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a birthday gift to a dear friend and she loved it as I did when I received it as a birthday gift from another friend. It is a nice sampler of products from Naked Bee. Worth the money....love the orange blossom honey fragrance...</li>
            <li> Great way to try different products from this manufacturer. The candle is a great addition. Neat reuseable case to use when traveling.</li>
            <li> I ordered the travel pack in plastic but it came in a tote with handles.  I was surprised but kept it as is because it was a cute tote and I didn&#x27;t mind having it anyway; love the product.</li>
            <li> Some products are very good and the rest are fillers.</li>
            <li> I discovered the Naked Bee product line while on vacation a few weeks ago. I bought it on a whim because the salt water was drying out my skin. By the time I was half way home, I said. Wow! I wish I would have bought more of this stuff!! My 10 year old nephew refers to this lotion as the lotion that makes my skin super smooth to touch! I purchased the travel kit because I wanted to try out all the product options. They are amazing on my skin and hair and I will be adding this line to my regular purchase status!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift. Overall I am happy. The products are a little smaller than I thought but about what I expected. I like that it came in a cute bag, but the zipper was extremely hard to open and I thought it was going to break.</li>
            <li> My mother in law received the assorted gift bag for Christmas and gave me the lip balm. It&#x27;s wonderful. She then gave my husband the hand and cuticle healing salve. I was so pleased that it soaked into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve tried several of this type of winter dry hands products and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in packing.  The zippered case was brittle and broke open as soon as I took it out of the box.  This was intended for a Christmas gift so I had to wrap it without the bag.  As far as the product, I&#x27;m sure the recipient will love it, just wish it could have been wrapped with bag.</li>
            <li> I got the packet today. It smells so nice out of the delivery package. Tried the lotion, really amazing. Skin feels soft and smells great. Looking forward to try the other products soon!</li>
            <li> The perfect sizes of my favorite products.  I&#x27;m not sure why it has a candle, though.  I don&#x27;t consider a teeny candle to be a travel accessory.  I would have preferred that they substitute a cuticle balm.  Everything else is perfect, and I love the product line.  Everything, including the candle, is delicately scented, and does not have an overpowering honey smell.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the shampoo or the votive candle.  I absolutely love the body lotion!  It smells like fresh orange blossoms for hours after putting it on!</li>
            <li> Good shipping time.  Appropiate packaging.  excellent product.  I am in the health care field, washing my hands several hundred times a day.  This product does not wash off with the first cleansing, which is terrific.  The fragrance is soothing.</li>
            <li> there wre things in the kit that I had no use for.  I wanted the lotion and I like it.  I didn&#x27;t need a candld, etc.</li>
            <li> Love this product.... Smells like heaven to me.&lt;br /&gt;I will always buy my Naked Bee from this great site.</li>
