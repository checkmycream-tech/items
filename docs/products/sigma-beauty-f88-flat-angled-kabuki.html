            <li>Sigma now has included the F88 in a kit with the F80, 82, 84 &amp; 86, if you don&#x27;t own those brushes I suggest purchasing the kit, they are all amazing &amp; have many uses!</li>

            <li>but I&#x27;m already loving this brush.  </li>
            <li>This is my own opinion, I was not influenced in any way to write it.</li>
            <li>Makes the application so easy and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost complete with the full set of these brushes, they have the best brushes for the best price - to me better than MAC</li>
            <li>Sigma Makes truly high quality brushes, the best !!</li>

            <li>The shape of this brush is excellent for getting under the eye, and next to your nose.</li>

            <li>Sigma Angled Brush Flat Kabuki - F88 makeup glides perfectly and in turn saves!</li>
            <li>I love Sigma and all of their brushes have been fantastic</li>
            <li>, the brush is so soft and the angle and great to get in around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li>This brush is by far the best brush of the whole kabuki collection.</li>
            <li>easy for u to make up</li>
            <li>Its so soft and nice !</li>
            <li>This is best, hands down.</li>
            <li>They are soft and apply the product amazingly, they are super soft and I cannot wait to buy more!!!</li>
            <li>I use liquid foundation and i can go from very light application to very heavy and it will work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>applies foundation easily and smooth and gives a buffed and matte look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to use it again because the results are brilliant but paying another $20 for 1 brush with just two months of usage is not worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks for another winning brush, Sigma!</li>
            <li>but I will not mind if I can get a great application and a super soft brush.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap versions or imitations, go for the Sigma brushes every time.</li>
            <li>Happy I finally decided to get it.</li>
            <li>Great for the angles of the face and the entire neck</li>
            <li>It works very good, very soft and high quality product.  </li>
            <li>Super soft and amazing!</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>I seriously need about five more of my brushes because it is amazing for not just foundation, but also powder, blush, conturing, shimmer, etc!!</li>
            <li>I use a conditioner/olive oil mix to clean it.</li>
            <li>It is perfect, to soft, Now it is essential for me put foundation on my face.</li>
            <li>I recieve my first Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80 brush a couple weeks ago and its by far the best brush i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This SIGMA angled brush is far better!  </li>
            <li>This contours the face perfectly, so easy to get right under eyes, around the hair line &amp; around the nose.</li>
            <li>Sigma F88 Angled Kabuki brush is good for CC cream or foundation application on the face, especially in the corners of the noses or eye areas..</li>
            <li>and I really want to love this brush</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Sigma</li>
            <li>It is super dense and does not shed like the cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li>There are not enough words to express how much I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Simply...... I just love this brush!</li>
            <li>It also takes many, many days to dry.</li>
            <li>and I even got a free eyeliner brush with my order which was really neat.</li>
            <li>Nice brush with very dense but soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft the bristles feel.  </li>
            <li>even if it&#x27;s one brush at a time it will be well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>I recommend is more soft than a Mac one that I have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 2 of this already, this brushes are so soft, don&#x27;t shed and the quality is better than MAC</li>
            <li>These brushes are a luxury but worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>love this brush much better than other brushes i have tried.</li>
            <li>I have never used such high quality brushes at such a great price!</li>
            <li>I bought this brush after having bought a cheaper one at Target and it started shedding right away.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, the price was right and the product came when we wanted it to.  </li>
            <li>So, I bought it right away.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is that it is very soft</li>
            <li>Makes such a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>I really, really like this brush!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of these brushes.</li>
            <li>I will be reviewing with a get ready with me on my YouTube channel, isonmommy1 soon!</li>
            <li>Overall, I like the brush, but am not in  love.</li>
            <li>I have this brush and thought it was going to be superb, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>Be price for a high quality brush!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I can say; this cosmetic brush feels like real fur against my skin!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, but takes overnight to dry.</li>
            <li>I plan to try different foundations, as I am on this make up kick and can&#x27;t stop :) I am looking into the other sigma brushes because they are that nice.</li>
            <li>It does exactly the job it was designed to do, though I think I prefer the flat top Kabuki.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased the F80 Flat Kabuki brush from Sigma and fell in love with it until.....</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I finally just bought the highly recommended Sigma Flat Angled Kabuki brush!  </li>
            <li>I also have large pores and was concerned that brush wouldn&#x27;t give me the coverage that I wanted but it absolutely does!  </li>
            <li>fast shipping, i wish i got the flat top though and not the angle one...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a pro at using a brush to apply foundation, but this brush makes it quick and easy, and leaves absolutely no streaks.  </li>
            <li>I own about 6 other Sigma brushes and although this one has that angle which makes it easier to get into the curves of your face, I do like the flat top original brush much better--but this is exact same just at an angle.</li>
            <li>Super soft and dense.</li>
            <li>It came really fast</li>
            <li>This one has shorter bristles so much stiffer swipe.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very dense and VERY well constructed.</li>
            <li>This brush came highly recommended by my make up artist friends!</li>
            <li>i dab it onto my skin and it blends very well.</li>
            <li>The kabuki spreads the foundation on so smoothly and the angled shape definitely helps with the corners.  </li>
            <li>Considering how much I paid for it</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m working on acquiring the whole collection...</li>
            <li>Also I let it get really caked up and should have cleaned it sooner</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li>WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!</li>
            <li>No shedding and blends really well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but i really donnt know about this  </li>
            <li>the whole silver metal casing that holds the hair fell off.</li>
            <li>So Soft!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very SOFT and holds product VERY well!</li>
            <li>If anyone has suggestion on how to clean it, please let me know because I have tried everything, even the beauty blender solid cleaner.</li>
            <li>I have socked it, deep clean it and everything in between</li>
            <li>It feels like it is poking me, I hope is the same cleaning issue and once is clean</li>
            <li>No shedding, cleaning was incident free, and dried quickly.</li>
            <li>I have never had a brush so soft but still very dense!  </li>
            <li>The actual brush is great quality, but definitely difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this brush.</li>
            <li>So worth the extra cash.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more Sigma in the near future!</li>
            <li>I have no idea if I have not been able to clean it right because it feels stiff and scratchy in the middle, as if it had old dry product in there.</li>
            <li>I will probably get a new one soon.</li>
            <li>I was using my Sigma F80 to apply my liquid foundation when I discovered this new brush had come out.</li>
            <li>The extra brush made me feel a little bit better about spending this much on one brush though.</li>
            <li>The only time it was F84 and F80 soft was the first time I use it.</li>
            <li>Feels very soft though so will use it anyways, but i&#x27;m NOT expecting the same performance as my real sigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the silver part came loose right away</li>
            <li>I have other Sigma brushes F80, F84, and they are super soft.</li>
            <li>This brush feels soft against the skin.</li>
            <li>soft</li>
            <li>It is so soft...</li>
            <li>I want this one to be that soft to.</li>
            <li>It is so soft.</li>
            <li>I have bought the Sigma Flat Angled Kabuki - F88 and Sigma Large Angled Contour - F40</li>
            <li>Although I use high quality cleaner, the brush has never quite been the same.</li>
            <li>and you are paying for a quality brush, no regrets</li>
            <li>I use it with Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked Liquid Foundation line and it gives me whatever coverage I need from light to heavy.  </li>
            <li>The packaging this product arrived in was the bare minimum - just a plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit hard to clean because it is so dense.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very densely packed hair, no shedding and Sigma brushes last a long time when cared for properly.</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m already loving this brush.  </li>
            <li> This is my own opinion, I was not influenced in any way to write it.</li>

            <li> Love sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a brush that would keep more of the product on the brush than it would apply to my face.</li>
            <li> The shape of this brush is excellent for getting under the eye, and next to your nose.</li>
            <li> I would hope it would stay for more that 2 years...</li>
            <li> I love everything Sigma</li>
            <li> I want to love it.    </li>

            <li> In about 4 more uses (I wash them twice a week)</li>
            <li> Sigma Angled Brush Flat Kabuki - F88 makeup glides perfectly and in turn saves!</li>
            <li> I love Sigma and all of their brushes have been fantastic</li>
            <li> , the brush is so soft and the angle and great to get in around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> This brush is by far the best brush of the whole kabuki collection.</li>
            <li> easy for u to make up</li>
            <li> Its so soft and nice !</li>
            <li> This is best, hands down.</li>
            <li> They are soft and apply the product amazingly, they are super soft and I cannot wait to buy more!!!</li>
            <li> I use liquid foundation and i can go from very light application to very heavy and it will work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> applies foundation easily and smooth and gives a buffed and matte look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to use it again because the results are brilliant but paying another $20 for 1 brush with just two months of usage is not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks for another winning brush, Sigma!</li>
            <li> but I will not mind if I can get a great application and a super soft brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap versions or imitations, go for the Sigma brushes every time.</li>
            <li> Happy I finally decided to get it.</li>
            <li> Great for the angles of the face and the entire neck</li>
            <li> It works very good, very soft and high quality product.  </li>
            <li> Super soft and amazing!</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> I seriously need about five more of my brushes because it is amazing for not just foundation, but also powder, blush, conturing, shimmer, etc!!</li>
            <li> I use a conditioner/olive oil mix to clean it.</li>
            <li> It is perfect, to soft, Now it is essential for me put foundation on my face.</li>
            <li> I recieve my first Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80 brush a couple weeks ago and its by far the best brush i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This SIGMA angled brush is far better!  </li>
            <li> This contours the face perfectly, so easy to get right under eyes, around the hair line &amp; around the nose.</li>
            <li> Sigma F88 Angled Kabuki brush is good for CC cream or foundation application on the face, especially in the corners of the noses or eye areas..</li>
            <li> and I really want to love this brush</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Sigma</li>
            <li> It is super dense and does not shed like the cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> There are not enough words to express how much I love this brush!  </li>
            <li> Simply...... I just love this brush!</li>
            <li> It also takes many, many days to dry.</li>
            <li> and I even got a free eyeliner brush with my order which was really neat.</li>
            <li> Nice brush with very dense but soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft the bristles feel.  </li>
            <li> even if it&#x27;s one brush at a time it will be well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> I recommend is more soft than a Mac one that I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of this already, this brushes are so soft, don&#x27;t shed and the quality is better than MAC</li>
            <li> These brushes are a luxury but worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> love this brush much better than other brushes i have tried.</li>
            <li> I have never used such high quality brushes at such a great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after having bought a cheaper one at Target and it started shedding right away.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, the price was right and the product came when we wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> So, I bought it right away.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about it is that it is very soft</li>
            <li> Makes such a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> I really, really like this brush!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of these brushes.</li>
            <li> I will be reviewing with a get ready with me on my YouTube channel, isonmommy1 soon!</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the brush, but am not in  love.</li>
            <li> I have this brush and thought it was going to be superb, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> Be price for a high quality brush!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I can say; this cosmetic brush feels like real fur against my skin!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, but takes overnight to dry.</li>
            <li> I plan to try different foundations, as I am on this make up kick and can&#x27;t stop :) I am looking into the other sigma brushes because they are that nice.</li>
            <li> It does exactly the job it was designed to do, though I think I prefer the flat top Kabuki.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased the F80 Flat Kabuki brush from Sigma and fell in love with it until.....</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I finally just bought the highly recommended Sigma Flat Angled Kabuki brush!  </li>
            <li> I also have large pores and was concerned that brush wouldn&#x27;t give me the coverage that I wanted but it absolutely does!  </li>
            <li> fast shipping, i wish i got the flat top though and not the angle one...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pro at using a brush to apply foundation, but this brush makes it quick and easy, and leaves absolutely no streaks.  </li>
            <li> I own about 6 other Sigma brushes and although this one has that angle which makes it easier to get into the curves of your face, I do like the flat top original brush much better--but this is exact same just at an angle.</li>
            <li> Super soft and dense.</li>
            <li> It came really fast</li>
            <li> This one has shorter bristles so much stiffer swipe.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very dense and VERY well constructed.</li>
            <li> This brush came highly recommended by my make up artist friends!</li>
            <li> i dab it onto my skin and it blends very well.</li>
            <li> The kabuki spreads the foundation on so smoothly and the angled shape definitely helps with the corners.  </li>
            <li> Considering how much I paid for it</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m working on acquiring the whole collection...</li>
            <li> Also I let it get really caked up and should have cleaned it sooner</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li> WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!</li>
            <li> No shedding and blends really well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but i really donnt know about this  </li>
            <li> the whole silver metal casing that holds the hair fell off.</li>
            <li> So Soft!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very SOFT and holds product VERY well!</li>
            <li> If anyone has suggestion on how to clean it, please let me know because I have tried everything, even the beauty blender solid cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have socked it, deep clean it and everything in between</li>
            <li> It feels like it is poking me, I hope is the same cleaning issue and once is clean</li>
            <li> No shedding, cleaning was incident free, and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> I have never had a brush so soft but still very dense!  </li>
            <li> The actual brush is great quality, but definitely difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this brush.</li>
            <li> So worth the extra cash.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more Sigma in the near future!</li>
            <li> I have no idea if I have not been able to clean it right because it feels stiff and scratchy in the middle, as if it had old dry product in there.</li>
            <li> I will probably get a new one soon.</li>
            <li> I was using my Sigma F80 to apply my liquid foundation when I discovered this new brush had come out.</li>
            <li> The extra brush made me feel a little bit better about spending this much on one brush though.</li>
            <li> The only time it was F84 and F80 soft was the first time I use it.</li>
            <li> Feels very soft though so will use it anyways, but i&#x27;m NOT expecting the same performance as my real sigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the silver part came loose right away</li>
            <li> I have other Sigma brushes F80, F84, and they are super soft.</li>
            <li> This brush feels soft against the skin.</li>
            <li> soft</li>
            <li> It is so soft...</li>
            <li> I want this one to be that soft to.</li>
            <li> It is so soft.</li>
            <li> I have bought the Sigma Flat Angled Kabuki - F88 and Sigma Large Angled Contour - F40</li>
            <li> Although I use high quality cleaner, the brush has never quite been the same.</li>
            <li> and you are paying for a quality brush, no regrets</li>
            <li> I use it with Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked Liquid Foundation line and it gives me whatever coverage I need from light to heavy.  </li>
            <li> The packaging this product arrived in was the bare minimum - just a plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to clean because it is so dense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very densely packed hair, no shedding and Sigma brushes last a long time when cared for properly.</li>
            <li> The brush is perfectly stiff (but so very soft!)</li>
            <li> I found this F88 Angled Flat Kabuki!!</li>
            <li> Never put directly on the brush as it will sink into it &amp; waste foundation.</li>
            <li> long time i m heres for this product</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff but soft.</li>
            <li> Before getting the kabuki I was using a MAC brush that&#x27;s similar to the Kabuki except the bristles aren&#x27;t as close to each other.  </li>
            <li> The head of the brush is flat on on one side and not as dense as my other brushes from Sigma.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles have came loose</li>
            <li> This is my third Sigma brush and just like the other two it has not let me down.</li>
            <li> but I think I must have gotten the handle wet</li>
            <li> The size and density of this brush was not what I expected from what was described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, soft (but firm enough to hold the foundation) and the makeup doesn&#x27;t sink into the brush and get wasted.  </li>
            <li> I gave the product a 4 instead of 5 because it&#x27;s pretty expensive in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit shorter than their other handles, which I like for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> No matter what I use the makeup just &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; and that doesn&#x27;t happen with my other foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush with some yellow glue on it and make it hard to be used.</li>
            <li> It is densely packed and the streak marks left behind by this brush is minimal, so I can paint my face with no worries unlike other brushes from other brands!!&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of money on other brushes, when this was the one all along.  </li>
            <li> The quality is nothing less than I&#x27;ve come to expect from a Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> You can build coverage using much less fondation than with your fingers or a sponge.  </li>
            <li> Bought this brush a few years ago...</li>
            <li> However i have found that The F82 round kabuki does the job</li>
            <li> The angled brush gets its places that a round brush wont.  </li>
            <li> I recently become addicted to Sigma Beauty brushes and ordered this one after having the round the</li>
            <li> and I still get that stiff scratchy feeling.</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely firm and hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Not much more</li>
            <li> Received a fake ass sigma brush, says made in China in the back and doesn&#x27;t say USA on front of handle.</li>
            <li> and I am only sorry I didnt know about it sooner.</li>
            <li> but when I received this brush it was broken.</li>
            <li> Sadly it had to be returned.</li>
            <li> If that... Not impressed at all</li>
            <li> Also the handle stinks of paint.</li>
            <li> I like not getting my hands dirty</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this brush after having bought a cheaper one at Target and it started shedding right away. This brush feels soft against the skin. It is super dense and does not shed like the cheaper alternatives. So worth the extra cash. Looking forward to acquiring some more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation brush!! Makes the application so easy and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I love Sigma and all of their brushes have been fantastic but when I received this brush it was broken. The handle had come unattached from the metal bristle end. This I believe was a shipping/seller issue. I own 10+ Sigma brushes and have never had this. Sadly it had to be returned.</li>
            <li> Nice brush with very dense but soft bristles.  I use with powder foundations.</li>
            <li> I seriously need about five more of my brushes because it is amazing for not just foundation, but also powder, blush, conturing, shimmer, etc!!</li>
            <li> I love Sigma brushes and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  It does exactly the job it was designed to do, though I think I prefer the flat top Kabuki.  Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap versions or imitations, go for the Sigma brushes every time.</li>
            <li> it great for blending. i use it for liquid foundation and gives me an airbrush looks. i love this brush</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, the price was right and the product came when we wanted it to.  Not much more I can say about a makeup brush</li>
            <li> One of the best makeup brushes ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after watching a beauty guru gal on YouTube recommend it. I have always worn makeup but never foundation and saw that it&#x27;s best to use a brush like this. So, I bought it right away.  It came really fast and I even got a free eyeliner brush with my order which was really neat. I gave the product a 4 instead of 5 because it&#x27;s pretty expensive in my opinion. The extra brush made me feel a little bit better about spending this much on one brush though.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this brush! It&#x27;s great for full coverage, and it works well with any foundation I have tried. It&#x27;s a bit hard to clean because it is so dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that mine actually showed up dented, so some of the bristles have been damaged.</li>
            <li> Love sigma brushes.  This one has shorter bristles so much stiffer swipe.  Easy to clean, but takes overnight to dry.</li>
            <li> This is the first Sigma brush that I have purchased and I&#x27;m so impressed. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting any product when I use this brush. It applies my full coverage cream foundation flawlessly. I used to use a brush that would keep more of the product on the brush than it would apply to my face. I will definitely be purchasing more of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Sigma F88 Angled Kabuki brush is good for CC cream or foundation application on the face, especially in the corners of the noses or eye areas.. It is densely packed and the streak marks left behind by this brush is minimal, so I can paint my face with no worries unlike other brushes from other brands!!&lt;br /&gt;very soft and you are paying for a quality brush, no regrets</li>
            <li> There are not enough words to express how much I love this brush!  It is so soft...it is so sturdy...it gives the best foundation coverage...it is just awesome!  I have extremely oily skin and I used to apply my foundation with my finger tips.  My face would look oily after just an hour of wear.  Since using this brush, my face doesn&#x27;t get as oily as soon.  My foundation just glides over my face and looks so smooth and so flawless.  I also have large pores and was concerned that brush wouldn&#x27;t give me the coverage that I wanted but it absolutely does!  It works like magic and has become my new best friend!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I first purchased the F80 Flat Kabuki brush from Sigma and fell in love with it until..... I found this F88 Angled Flat Kabuki!! The shape of this brush is excellent for getting under the eye, and next to your nose. It is also perfect for applying highlighter and contouring!!! The brush is very dense and VERY well constructed. It&#x27;s very SOFT and holds product VERY well! I have not had any problem with shedding or bristles falling out and I use this brush DAILY!!! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this brush a few years ago... And it&#x27;s finally on its last straw and fell apart... 25 dollars for one brush I would hope it would stay for more that 2 years... If that... Not impressed at all</li>
            <li> Best liquid foundation brush ever. Tried all kinds, all brands. This is best, hands down. So soft, doesn&#x27;t shed, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love everything Sigma and I really want to love this brush but I do not. I have no idea if I have not been able to clean it right because it feels stiff and scratchy in the middle, as if it had old dry product in there. If anyone has suggestion on how to clean it, please let me know because I have tried everything, even the beauty blender solid cleaner. I have socked it, deep clean it and everything in between and I still get that stiff scratchy feeling. I have other Sigma brushes F80, F84, and they are super soft. I want this one to be that soft to. The only time it was F84 and F80 soft was the first time I use it. Please help! I want to love it.    I also cannot use to stipple product on. It feels like it is poking me, I hope is the same cleaning issue and once is clean right it will work great.    I also feel it socks up a lot of product but I will not mind if I can get a great application and a super soft brush.</li>
            <li> Good brush but the silver part came loose right away second brush i bought from etailz that came this way.</li>
            <li> Super soft and dense. Gives a great flawless finish to foundation!</li>
            <li> Brush quality is excellent!  Product arrived in time and well packaged.  Happy I finally decided to get it.</li>
            <li> I love to use this brush to apply my foundation it leaves my skin looking flawless I highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li> I love this brush and use if for putting on bronzer.  The bristles are stiff but soft. I have been using this brush for 2-3 months and the bristles are staying put.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and durability of this brush not to mention the multi use you get out of it. Works great with any type of foundation liquid or powder.</li>
            <li> I love Sigma brushes they are real good quality brushes.  I&#x27;m almost complete with the full set of these brushes, they have the best brushes for the best price - to me better than MAC</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> easy to use, great product, love using it with liquid foundation. fast shipping, i wish i got the flat top though and not the angle one...</li>
            <li> I just received this brush with some yellow glue on it and make it hard to be used. very disappointed. Finally I returned it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Great price, nice quality &amp; awesome brushes!!</li>
            <li> this brush is great. I couldn&#x27;t have made a better desicion that buy this sigma brush. I simply love it. it&#x27;s a must.&lt;br /&gt;A.Miranda</li>
            <li> Simply...... I just love this brush! Great for the angles of the face and the entire neck</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush!  I have never had a brush so soft but still very dense!  It&#x27;s great at getting all areas of your face when putting on foundation.  Will definitely be purchasing more Sigma in the near future!</li>
            <li> I choose this because its soo good, is perfect!!!! So Soft!!! I&#x27;m in loveee....and i gone by more brushes whit you for shore!! And i gone talk to all my friends abaut...because is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I recently become addicted to Sigma Beauty brushes and ordered this one after having the round the I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Sigma</li>
            <li> I love this brush for applying thicker foundations like kat Von dee or Laura mercier. Beauty blender step aside because you&#x27;ve been replaced! The handle is a bit shorter than their other handles, which I like for applying foundation. I will be reviewing with a get ready with me on my YouTube channel, isonmommy1 soon!</li>
            <li> I love it! Sigma Angled Brush Flat Kabuki - F88 makeup glides perfectly and in turn saves! definitely better than mac brushes</li>
            <li> I just received this brush today and applied my foundation with it. Flawless application! I was using a beauty blender before but I prefer this!</li>
            <li> Super soft and amazing! This brush came highly recommended by my make up artist friends!</li>
            <li> This came to me fairly quickly and is perfect for what I need.  I use it with Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked Liquid Foundation line and it gives me whatever coverage I need from light to heavy.  The brush is perfectly stiff (but so very soft!) and angled for just how I need it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product by Sigma Beaty. Excellent quality! I was travelling in US and it just arrived on time at my friends house.</li>
            <li> The packaging this product arrived in was the bare minimum - just a plastic wrap. The actual brush is great quality, but definitely difficult to clean. Although I use high quality cleaner, the brush has never quite been the same. Overall, I like the brush, but am not in  love.</li>
            <li> i love this brush. i dab it onto my skin and it blends very well. good for contouring too! i would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice but I&#x27;m already loving this brush.  Before getting the kabuki I was using a MAC brush that&#x27;s similar to the Kabuki except the bristles aren&#x27;t as close to each other.  Imagine a paintbrush.  The kabuki spreads the foundation on so smoothly and the angled shape definitely helps with the corners.  I love how soft the bristles feel.  Considering how much I paid for it I&#x27;m relieved it&#x27;s a good product.  Now if the bristles start falling apart like my MAC brush did then I&#x27;ll be back here to complain!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush. It&#x27;s easy to use and your skin look very polished and so perfect. Excellent brush, great quality and good prices. I will continue buying this brand,</li>
            <li> Just received this brush and applied my foundation with it! Love it! Its so soft and nice ! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I own about 6 other Sigma brushes and although this one has that angle which makes it easier to get into the curves of your face, I do like the flat top original brush much better--but this is exact same just at an angle.</li>
            <li> I have this brush and thought it was going to be superb, but i was wrong. It leaves streaks on my face when applying any type of cream or liquid foundation or concealer. The only good thing about it is that it is very soft, I actually wish it worked for me. But it doesn&#x27;t. However i have found that The F82 round kabuki does the job</li>
            <li> Sigma Makes truly high quality brushes, the best !! This brush is by far the best brush of the whole kabuki collection. It is a must have.</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely firm and hard to use.  I feel like it is almost bruising my face when I apply my makeup.  I don&#x27;t recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Great foundation brush. Makes such a HUGE difference! i would definitely  recommend it!</li>
            <li> This brush is everything I hoped it would be. The quality is nothing less than I&#x27;ve come to expect from a Sigma brush. I highly recomend this brush.</li>
            <li> Holy grail to apply foundation. Gives me the most flawless effect. I love it. I use liquid foundation and i can go from very light application to very heavy and it will work wonderfully. Doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and skin looks airbrushed. Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I finally just bought the highly recommended Sigma Flat Angled Kabuki brush!  I wasted a lot of money on other brushes, when this was the one all along.  Now I&#x27;m working on acquiring the whole collection... even if it&#x27;s one brush at a time it will be well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sigma brush and just like the other two it has not let me down. I have never used such high quality brushes at such a great price!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I actually gave this as a gift cause someone got me one. I have not had a makeup line since using the brush and have gotten complements on my makeup. I use a conditioner/olive oil mix to clean it. Some of the bristles have came loose but I think I must have gotten the handle wet which is a no-no. Also I let it get really caked up and should have cleaned it sooner so is my fault. I will probably get a new one soon. So worth it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product It works very good, very soft and high quality product.  My daugther love it and it is very happy with the product</li>
            <li> Must have brush!! I love this brush. It is so soft. I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more. It feel happy happy happy.</li>
            <li> Received a fake ass sigma brush, says made in China in the back and doesn&#x27;t say USA on front of handle. Also the handle stinks of paint. Feels very soft though so will use it anyways, but i&#x27;m NOT expecting the same performance as my real sigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE.</li>
            <li> I was using my Sigma F80 to apply my liquid foundation when I discovered this new brush had come out. This contours the face perfectly, so easy to get right under eyes, around the hair line &amp; around the nose. I place the product on the back of my hand, dab the brush in &amp; swirl onto my face. Never put directly on the brush as it will sink into it &amp; waste foundation. I love this brush! Very densely packed hair, no shedding and Sigma brushes last a long time when cared for properly. I plan to get the P88 for concealer application, same brush in a smaller size for precision coverage. Sigma now has included the F88 in a kit with the F80, 82, 84 &amp; 86, if you don&#x27;t own those brushes I suggest purchasing the kit, they are all amazing &amp; have many uses! Thanks for another winning brush, Sigma! *This is my own opinion, I was not influenced in any way to write it.*</li>
            <li> It is perfect, to soft, Now it is essential for me put foundation on my face. I recommend is more soft than a Mac one that I have. it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I recieve my first Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80 brush a couple weeks ago and its by far the best brush i&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m hooked I have bought the Sigma Flat Angled Kabuki - F88 and Sigma Large Angled Contour - F40 and they are just amazing!!!! I am going to buy more for sure. It makes your face feel like a flawless airbrushed finish with maximum coverage. I highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li> I use this after my BB cream when I&#x27;m putting on translucent powder.  The angled brush gets its places that a round brush wont.  Sigma brushes are fantastic and great prices.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush, it evenly applies my make up and I am only sorry I didnt know about it sooner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BRUSH! FAST SHIPPING! GREAT QUALITY! EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR PLUS MORE! THANK YOU SO MUCH! WILL BE ORDERING FROM AGAIN! I PURCHASED 2 SIGMA BRUSHES AND THEY ARE WONDERFUL! WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying foundation. The angle is perfect for my face! Be price for a high quality brush!! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of this already, this brushes are so soft, don&#x27;t shed and the quality is better than MAC</li>
            <li> applies foundation easily and smooth and gives a buffed and matte look. love this brush much better than other brushes i have tried.</li>
            <li> I am on the fence with a 4 and 5.... but i bought a BB cream to sue with this brush, which didn&#x27;t give me the overall look i was wanting. But I use this brush with a cover girl stick concealer as my foundation, and love it! I like not getting my hands dirty, the brush is so soft and the angle and great to get in around the eyes and nose. I plan to try different foundations, as I am on this make up kick and can&#x27;t stop :) I am looking into the other sigma brushes because they are that nice. No shedding, cleaning was incident free, and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> The angled F88 is the best brush i&#x27;ve ever used to apply and blend foundation. It provides a silky light finish and it covers and blends beautifully.  You can build coverage using much less fondation than with your fingers or a sponge.  I also have the Precision brushes and P88 is the best in that set as well.  These brushes are a luxury but worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I can say; this cosmetic brush feels like real fur against my skin! My cream/liquid foundation applies like a breeze and leaves next to nothing on the brush. How do they do that? I have no idea but you need to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation brush ever! Great quality!</li>
            <li> The size and density of this brush was not what I expected from what was described. The head of the brush is flat on on one side and not as dense as my other brushes from Sigma. I prefer my F84 over this brush for foundation.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!! They are soft and apply the product amazingly, they are super soft and I cannot wait to buy more!!!</li>
            <li> i love it .  i bought the F80 before. and this one is as good as that one. easy for u to make up</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush ever! No shedding and blends really well.</li>
            <li> wounderful easy to put apply make up on !!!!&lt;br /&gt;in love, it make my time for make up speed .every one must have.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush!!! Flawless application, so easy to use. The angle is great for precision and under the eye! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The last brush I purchased to apply liquid foundation was from Clinique.  This SIGMA angled brush is far better!  It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve used!!  It&#x27;s thick, soft (but firm enough to hold the foundation) and the makeup doesn&#x27;t sink into the brush and get wasted.  Perfect for the countours of your face!  I&#x27;m not a pro at using a brush to apply foundation, but this brush makes it quick and easy, and leaves absolutely no streaks.  Plus it&#x27;s perfect to use for stippling if you want!</li>
            <li> long time i m heres for this product but i really donnt know about this  but now i know im fall in love</li>
            <li> Great product... Perfect to apply the foundation...</li>
            <li> I bought this brush 8 weeks ago and was pretty happy with it till the brush began to shed! In about 4 more uses (I wash them twice a week) the whole silver metal casing that holds the hair fell off. I&#x27;d love to use it again because the results are brilliant but paying another $20 for 1 brush with just two months of usage is not worth it for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brand if you use your brushes often either as they&#x27;re pricey. I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars because it was amazing while it lasted.</li>
            <li> It applies makeup SO WELL but it is a PAIN to wash. No matter what I use the makeup just &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; and that doesn&#x27;t happen with my other foundation brushes. It also takes many, many days to dry.</li>
    </ol>
