            <li>I don&#x27;t know which product is responsible, this one or the NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Lotion</li>
            <li>One thing I REALLY</li>
            <li>I have heard products take months to really work, so I plan to keep using this.</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>I do not even use foundation because my skin is glowy smooth that i only put a dab of blush and some lose face powder</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good service, great product!</li>
            <li> If you want to stay young looking use all the NeoStrata products. I do and my face looks great for being a 50 year old women. I highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years.  It&#x27;s the best treatment I&#x27;ve found for preventing spots, which I get a lot when not using it.  I use it twice a day.  It contains glycolic acid, whereas most acne prevention treatments you can buy over the counter have salycylic acid as the active ingredient. I recently forgot to put it in my hold baggage for a flight and it was confiscated from my hand luggage, so I had to go for a while without any before I could get another order in.  Sure enough, after about 3 days my spots started reappearing. I recommend it for that reason.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion every night for a month and it is fantastic. My skin stays hydrated without being greasy or flaky, my pores are clearing out and becoming less visible, and the overall tone is much more even. I use a Vitamin C serum and sunscreen during the day. Great for acne prone, combo skin. A little goes a long way. Great value!</li>
            <li> I really like this - it worked well on my face but no I am using Avene Eluage and the combination is too drying... but meanwhile I have used it on my chest and back and it leaves my skin super smooth and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was in a study concerning its effectiveness. The study was done by aa near by hospital. It proved to be effective. I could see the results for myself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know which product is responsible, this one or the NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Lotion AHA 10 that I use at night, buy my pores are disappearing!  Of course they won&#x27;t completely disappear, but after about 1 month of use they are noticeably smaller.  Many products have used the buzz words &amp;#34;pore shrinking&amp;#34; as their claim to fame, but this family of products actually deliver!  I&#x27;m so glad that I was pointed in this direction!</li>
            <li> An excellent body/face lotion. My skin&#x27;s texture is transformed from dry and somewhat rough to hydrated and silky smooth. I continue to use and purchase other products from Neo Strata.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really great for dry skin.  It makes really rough, dry skin smooth without using a lot of it - a little bit goes a long way. One thing I REALLY like:  it is not greasy at all.  While I did not care for the NeoStrata face cream, I do like the body lotion and also the foaming glycolic face wash.</li>
            <li> Not pleased as the order was not in good condition - look used</li>
            <li> Made a dramatic difference on my skin.  It does have a little odor to it when you put it on but it doesn&#x27;t last long but more important wrinkles are reduced.</li>
            <li> this is the first time i try this. i always get the cream form. was thinking it is convenent to get lotion, that has the pump.</li>
            <li> I used this as directed  but saw no improvement. Beauty products  ike this are over rated. We are all going to end up in a wrinkle heap one day.</li>
            <li> I have been using it morning and night for a couple weeks now.  I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic improvement (I am starting to get crow&#x27;s feet, boo hoo!), but my face feels smoother and pores smaller. I have heard products take months to really work, so I plan to keep using this.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results. There is a tingling (some would call a burn) on initial application, with repeated and consistent use, I saw a difference in my skin. I would recommend to use it as a PART of a regimen otherwise you may not see a difference.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and my mom loved it. Shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and its a great value for the price. You don&#x27;t need alot of it either. My girlfriends commented on my skin while we were out and said it looked amazing...this stuff rocks. I have oily skin and I think it helps alleviate it. I also have acne scars which it helped reduce as well. Loving this!!</li>
            <li> worked for 2 weeks to make my skin smoother and softer, then stopped working all together.</li>
            <li> First time to use it&lt;br /&gt;Kind of itchy at first&lt;br /&gt;Get more comfy later after three or four or fiver days</li>
            <li> I have been using aha moisturizers as a part of my skin care regimen for years now and I&#x27;ve pretty much tried them all.  This 10% blend is one of the best retail aha concoction I&#x27;ve tried.  It absorbs quickly, dries well and is a great value considering volume you&#x27;re getting for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t sting either and because of this, it could be great for first time aha users.  It is also mild enough to use as a daytime moisturizer, as a base for makeup after aplying a generous amount of sunblock. I do not even use foundation because my skin is glowy smooth that i only put a dab of blush and some lose face powder and i am good to go!  Get THIS neostrata aha, you won&#x27;t regret it!  I even prefer this mote than the 15% gel/cream versions that sting and are harsher on sensitive skin--and also twice as expensive for lesser quantity.  I&#x27;ve tried them all and this formulation is the best by far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only affordable way to purchase this, and it works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to help my Keratosis Pilaris (KP) and it truly made a difference. My skin is smoother and has fewer bumps. I also use it on my face, as it is mild enough. Even my husband and kids noticed the difference in my skin. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> warning for those that have never used AHA before/sensitive skin, it STINGS! putting it on for the first time, and even continue to use it for 3+ weeks, i still feel a burning sensation every time I put this on my face. for first-time user of AHA, definitely recommend a lower concentration. 3+ weeks of using it, do not notice a difference... (skin tone has probably? lightened up a bit?) Use sunscreen in daytime is a must.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. AHA 10 is one of the highest content of  glycolic acid available. This lotion works to rejuvenate new skin cell growth. There&#x27;s a notable difference in the appearance of the skin after one month use. I start using the lotion on my face after the summer months.( I avoid using the lotion during the summer or in the sun which can cause the skin to burn). I start out by using twice a day for two weeks, then once a day. The lotion gives an even skin tone and brightness to the complexion and helps to eliminate brown spots. I have had many people compliment me for radiant skin tone. I have no doubt that anyone who uses this lotion will see an improvement. The unscented. lotion is one of the best skin lotions available and so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong for young skin ,but might be good for moms. after i use it my face become peeling</li>
            <li> Love this lotion - had trouble with dry skin and it has helped a ton!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and works great on my skin.  Great product for the money.</li>
