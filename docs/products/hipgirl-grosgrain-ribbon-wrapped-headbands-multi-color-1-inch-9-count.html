            <li>Love these headbands..</li>
            <li>These are great headbands, super cute, and super for holding hair out of eyes.  </li>
            <li>Many colors in the pack means it is easy to coordinate with almost any outfit.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t slip easily and they dont hurt your head</li>
            <li>Fabric easily tears off the plastic band</li>
            <li>My 9 year old isn&#x27;t much into bows anymore &amp; these r great!</li>
            <li>Bows slide in easily</li>
            <li>Headbands are of decent Quality and good color selection.</li>
            <li>daughter loves matching to outfits and they are comfortable.</li>
            <li>These fit both of my girls.  </li>
            <li>They are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fit my kids well too.</li>
            <li>Her 5 year old sister also loved them so I bought her a set.</li>
            <li>While they last they do look very nice.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter and she was so excited to see all the colors.  </li>
            <li>The headbands came in a beautiful variety of colors and were extremely well made.</li>
            <li>I bought theses headbands to cover with special ribbon that I had purchased.  </li>
            <li>Yes, this is true, but I put a dot of super glue on the underside where each ribbon meets up, and it solved that problem.  </li>
            <li>Other than that they are great.</li>
            <li>I only wish they were a bit more snug or gripped better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the vivid colors!</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>very cute headbands wished the colors were a little more varied</li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly and are very durable.</li>
            <li>If they come out with another set of different colors we will be buying more!</li>
            <li>The red one matches my red lipstick perfectly too ;)</li>
            <li>Exactly what it looks like in the picture!</li>
            <li>They fit me (an adult) as well as my daughter just fine.</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter has fine very curly hair that is always in her face, so headbands are huge for her right now.</li>
            <li>Delicate and beautiful appearance just for girls.</li>
            <li>these are awesome since they are wide, ship quick and the ribbon is glued down and does not come unraveled...be</li>
            <li>A super quick and easy fix to make these adorable headbands last a long time!</li>
            <li>However, all of them fit my adult sized head without any issues.</li>
            <li>and they are made really well !</li>
            <li>Best of all there are no weird bumps or scratchy parts at the ends, which drives her crazy.  </li>
            <li>These are large enough to fit my head, I would&#x27;ve preferred brighter colors (you don&#x27;t get to choose), and the ribbon on them starts unwinding after a couple months.</li>
            <li>(you can&#x27;t see any edges or plastic) and they are very durable.</li>
            <li>They seem to be well made and are much cheaper than those sold in boutique stores.  </li>
            <li>They have held up really well.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very picky on how they feel and the width.  </li>
            <li>They stay on really well and don&#x27;t slip off.  </li>
            <li>Wow first time my daughters</li>
            <li>The colors are not as vibrant as the picture.  </li>
            <li>I guess my girl just has a small funny shaped head because I had no luck with any of them fitting her.</li>
            <li>High quality, don&#x27;t squeeze your head or give headaches.</li>
            <li>They also do not have hard glued ends, which is nice because that is something my children tend to complain about after wearing headbands for a while.</li>
            <li>The colors are as pictured and so far they seem to be really well made.  </li>
            <li>And they kind of slide off your head if you&#x27;re not super careful</li>
            <li>My youngest still wears them, but my oldest does not though they do still fit her head (getting a bit tight though).  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that they are a little wide and not a thin strip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult woman</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a bit of a sensitive child though.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had no problem with any of the fabric coming undone, even after they were discovered by my cat.</li>
            <li>These headbands were well worth the money I spent.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some headbands I have purchased in the past, these do not unravel easily.  </li>
            <li>My 3-year-old can wear them but they&#x27;re not great; I&#x27;d recommend then for an older kid if they were better quality.</li>
            <li>Only down side is they don&#x27;t fit my six year olds head.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last one day for my 4 year old before the ribbon unwrapped!</li>
            <li>The only things I didn&#x27;t appreciate is that the darkest headband is brown, not black as it appears in the pictures.</li>
            <li>My little one loves the headbands so much she even sleeps with them.</li>

            <li> My little one loves the headbands so much she even sleeps with them.</li>
            <li> Ive had better luck with these then the typical plastic drugstore headbands which tend to snap in half after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The outside one is usually stretched out.</li>
            <li> Also, some of the head bands are bigger than others because they have been stacked inside each other.</li>
            <li> She got one dirty at school and it was easily cleaned with a damp washcloth.  </li>
            <li> careful other brands the ribbon comes unwrapped...</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because my daughter loves them I&#x27;m hoping that the rest hold up better</li>
            <li> Inside of each other.</li>
            <li> I know that some reviewers complained about the ribbon moving around and causing the white headband underneath to show.  </li>
            <li> The one I thought was black is brown.  </li>
            <li> They unwrapped with a few use.</li>
            <li> These are just not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I added bows to a few of them just to give my daughter a variety</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find plain headbands, so this worked out well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find plain grosgrain headbands</li>
            <li> but the headband is very stiff and the edges dig into the scalp.</li>
            <li> My daughter (age 7) says they hurt her behind her ears a bit.  </li>
            <li> poor quality ...</li>
            <li> Poor quality!</li>
            <li> Terrible quality!  </li>

            <li> Had these for months and they haven&#x27;t come apart yet.  daughter loves matching to outfits and they are comfortable.</li>
            <li> These headbands are awesome.  I&#x27;m an adult woman but I use these on a regular basis.  The wrapping is very good (you can&#x27;t see any edges or plastic) and they are very durable.</li>
            <li> Poor quality! They unwrapped with a few use.</li>
            <li> The headbands arrived and they were really cute and the colors were great, and I was really pleased. But 4 of them have already come apart after only a couple of uses. The ribbon began to loosen and unravel. I was really disappointed because my daughter loves them I&#x27;m hoping that the rest hold up better</li>
            <li> Love the quality and colors.  My daughter (age 7) says they hurt her behind her ears a bit.  She&#x27;s a bit of a sensitive child though.  She prefers the thinner ones.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality!  Didn&#x27;t last one day for my 4 year old before the ribbon unwrapped!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and a great price.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just got them .. Look Great haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet tho</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price!</li>
            <li> very pretty, bright colors BUT they are ribbons wrapped around plastic. So, the ribbons shift revealing the white, plastic headband underneath. For the price, they&#x27;ll do and my kids wear them a lot - but I wish it was glued in place so the ribbons didn&#x27;t shift.&lt;br /&gt;Get the solid fabric version instead.</li>
            <li> These are just not comfortable. The colors are beautiful and the ribbon is pretty - but the headband is very stiff and the edges dig into the scalp. If you have a really tiny head it might work for a short event, but I can&#x27;t imagine keeping one on for an entire school-day!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! Wow first time my daughters no complain about they hurt.. perfect buy I will go order them again</li>
            <li> The colors are not as vibrant as the picture.  The one I thought was black is brown.  But there are a bunch of them for the money so I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she was so excited to see all the colors.  This was a really great price for the quantity and quality!  Would buy these again in a heartbeat!!!</li>
            <li> Could have made them, but for the price, it was easier to buy them.  My daughter likes them.  Nice job!</li>
            <li> great quality! don&#x27;t slip easily and they dont hurt your head</li>
            <li> This is such a great price for 12 grosgrain headbands - 1 in just about every color!  I added bows to a few of them just to give my daughter a variety and she wears them almost every day.  They seem to be well made and are much cheaper than those sold in boutique stores.  It&#x27;s so hard to find plain grosgrain headbands anyway so I was thrilled to see them on Amazon.  Great purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I bought theses headbands to cover with special ribbon that I had purchased.  I couldn&#x27;t find plain headbands, so this worked out well.</li>
            <li> very cute headbands wished the colors were a little more varied they tend to be the same tone without a lot of darker shades.  And they kind of slide off your head if you&#x27;re not super careful</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters.  They have held up really well.  Many colors in the pack means it is easy to coordinate with almost any outfit.  Unlike some headbands I have purchased in the past, these do not unravel easily.  They also do not have hard glued ends, which is nice because that is something my children tend to complain about after wearing headbands for a while. At the time of purchase, my children were 6 and 11.  These fit both of my girls.  My youngest still wears them, but my oldest does not though they do still fit her head (getting a bit tight though).  We have now had these for a year, and they are still holding up well.  These headbands were well worth the money I spent.  I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Fabric easily tears off the plastic band</li>
            <li> My daughter loves headbands...in fact she prides her self on a different headband for every outfit....these are awesome since they are wide, ship quick and the ribbon is glued down and does not come unraveled...be careful other brands the ribbon comes unwrapped...</li>
            <li> These are large enough to fit my head, I would&#x27;ve preferred brighter colors (you don&#x27;t get to choose), and the ribbon on them starts unwinding after a couple months. My 3-year-old can wear them but they&#x27;re not great; I&#x27;d recommend then for an older kid if they were better quality. While they last they do look very nice.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter has fine very curly hair that is always in her face, so headbands are huge for her right now. She wears them from the time she gets up until she goes to bed.  She&#x27;s very picky on how they feel and the width.  I took a chance buying these online and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  They are fantastic.  The colors are as pictured and so far they seem to be really well made.  She got one dirty at school and it was easily cleaned with a damp washcloth.  Best of all there are no weird bumps or scratchy parts at the ends, which drives her crazy.  They stay on really well and don&#x27;t slip off.  If they come out with another set of different colors we will be buying more!</li>
            <li> This was a Fantastic Purchase! My 9 year old isn&#x27;t much into bows anymore &amp; these r great! Quality grosgrain ribbon wrapped headbands and so many great colors!! These r a great find!!</li>
            <li> Headbands are of decent Quality and good color selection. Only down side is they don&#x27;t fit my six year olds head. Some are bigger and some smaller depending on how they are stacked together from inner to outer. I guess my girl just has a small funny shaped head because I had no luck with any of them fitting her.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and priced well.</li>
            <li> These are great headbands, super cute, and super for holding hair out of eyes.  I know that some reviewers complained about the ribbon moving around and causing the white headband underneath to show.  Yes, this is true, but I put a dot of super glue on the underside where each ribbon meets up, and it solved that problem.  A super quick and easy fix to make these adorable headbands last a long time!</li>
            <li> Very nice, well made would order again</li>
            <li> These are really cute! The only things I didn&#x27;t appreciate is that the darkest headband is brown, not black as it appears in the pictures. Also, some of the head bands are bigger than others because they have been stacked inside each other. However, all of them fit my adult sized head without any issues.</li>
            <li> I wear headbands with my pixie cut just about every day, and these are SO cute!!! I absolutely love the vivid colors! The red one matches my red lipstick perfectly too ;)</li>
            <li> i love the price and the choose of colors and we can emblish them any way we want .they are wounderful and i will be buying some more.</li>
            <li> My daughter would keep these things ... or anything on or in her hair! I love the fact that they are a little wide and not a thin strip. My daughter had curly hair, so the width helps!</li>
            <li> All the colors I could ask for. They fit me (an adult) as well as my daughter just fine. I only wish they were a bit more snug or gripped better. Still a great deal.</li>
            <li> These are great inexpensive headbands that do not hurt you head for wearing them all day.  Great colors, and inexpensive</li>
            <li> The headbands came in a beautiful variety of colors and were extremely well made. You won&#x27;t find this quality at walmart! And the price was really good considering the volume and quality of the items.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it looks like in the picture! Plus, it arrived in 3 days! I got a variety of colors and they&#x27;re sturdy! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors, I can find one to match about any outfit. So far I&#x27;ve had no problem with any of the fabric coming undone, even after they were discovered by my cat. Ive had better luck with these then the typical plastic drugstore headbands which tend to snap in half after a few uses.</li>
            <li> These are great. High quality, don&#x27;t squeeze your head or give headaches.</li>
            <li> My little one loves the headbands so much she even sleeps with them. They arrived very quickly and are very durable.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them. Great colors.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Love these headbands.. Bows slide in easily and they are made really well !</li>
            <li> Very pretty and I was able to glue on fake flowers with a glue gun.  Fit my kids well too.</li>
            <li> I buy them to add an extra detail and combine different outfits for every occasion. They are nicely wrapped. Delicate and beautiful appearance just for girls. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 8 year olds birthday and she loved them. Her 5 year old sister also loved them so I bought her a set. The only flaw is the way they are packed. Inside of each other. The outside one is usually stretched out. Other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> Nice fitting good assortment of colors</li>
            <li> fit perfect great price-color for every outfit</li>
            <li> poor quality ...the material keeps coming undone on them.</li>
            <li> The width is very good and holds fine hair better than the narrower bands.  Colors great!</li>
