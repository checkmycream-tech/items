    <ol>
            <li>As so often happens, if you want something done you have to do it yourself, so I went hunting on the internet and found the hair masque on Amazon.com and have been a very happy camper since.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Awesome!!</li>
            <li>and I do not have those fly away frizzies!</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Also this company padded the shipping box with samples, so I have plenty to take on vacation instead of the liter bottles, which is great when airlines charge for weighed luggage.</li>
            <li>Great Combination.</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner..</li>
            <li>Very very happy:)</li>
            <li>This product continues to work best on my fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>love it ;}  It works great.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>Good for gor hair but doesn&#x27;t make hair easy to comb out</li>
            <li>just very fine.  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and easy!!!</li>
            <li>My hair look soooo much better</li>
            <li>I love this mask.  </li>
            <li>Wife is pleased.</li>
            <li>definitely more conditioning than just using the nioxin conditioner..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many &amp;#34;well reviewed&amp;#34; products, like Ojon, etc.</li>
            <li>On top of the platinum bleach I&#x27;d done for all my life.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner....</li>
            <li>I am a long-time fan of Nioxin, and this is one of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li>I am using system 5 because hair is falling out but much better.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft I love it!!</li>
            <li>PRODUCT IS FINE ~  </li>
            <li>I am over 50 and my hair has always been fine.  </li>
            <li>This is THE best product I have found for my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>have never found a product that has worked as well as this one - in this case, less is more!!!</li>
            <li>This is the most economical way to purchase this conditioner that I have found.</li>
            <li>the company changed the formula and it was filled with parfume fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The Masque pumps into your hand like a luxurious lotion, and it works through your hair smoothly, with no greasy feeling at all.  </li>
            <li>I can use it on a daily basis if I want to, plus the applicator is easy to use and smells good.</li>
            <li>I had gotten a sample of the product several years ago and loved it, but then could never find it in any of the salons in my area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my hair is so fine, it is always full of static and fly-aways, regardless of the season, so I took a chance and purchased the deep repair</li>
            <li>This is thick and ideal and comes with a pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair masque, it makes my hair feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks and have learned something in the first two weeks -</li>
            <li>First time I use this product and as soon as it touch my hair it made it extremely soft!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner, but I was hoping for better results than the conditioner I already use, which is less than a third of the price.</li>
            <li>Wished it had that same tingly feeling as the regular condition has but loved the feel of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li>When using this product, I actually sleep with it in my hair once a week with a disposable shower cap (the husband loves that part), the next day I rinse out, and my hair looks very healthy</li>
            <li>I use it more often during the winter to combat the effects of dry air.  </li>
            <li>the pump bottle and the large size.</li>
            <li>and it is NOT falling at much.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it once a week to keep my hair from drying out too much.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my medium length hair</li>
            <li>It has really made a difference this winter.</li>
            <li>because I didn;t think anything would work, but Nioxin really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>But not as much as I used it in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Nioxin has changed my hair into a way thicker situation than it was (I had bald spots on top due to stress, coumadin, and heredity).  </li>
            <li>The scent of this conditioner is better than their other conditioners.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this conditioner!</li>
            <li>if I use this product too much, my hair is toooo soft!</li>
            <li>I was so excited I put some in a plastic bag for a coworker who has also been struggling with dry hair.</li>
            <li>Very please so far with this item.  </li>
            <li>I have tried tons of products for my normal bleach-blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Certainly worth trying as a deep scalp and hair cleansing</li>
            <li>Not oily, but soft!</li>
            <li>This was the first product that actually soothed my allergy plagued scalp and the Nioxin deep repair hair masque really softened and conditioned my permed and dyed hair.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the pump bottle on the larger size.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft, and has bounce, and no fly-aways!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hair is so soft after use</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just old.</li>
            <li>The product is well worth the time and effort spent on the search.</li>
            <li>My fine, thin, straight hair loves this product.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Nioxin 4 System for my very fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>- I scaled it back last week to leaving it on my hair for about an hour Sunday and washed my hair as normal during this week.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, foiled hair and this is by far my favorite-must have conditioner.</li>

            <li> love it ;}  It works great.  My hair look soooo much better and it is NOT falling at much.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was complaining to my hairdresser how my scalp constantly itched and that I felt I was loosing a lot of hair.  She introduced me to the Nioxin products.  This was the first product that actually soothed my allergy plagued scalp and the Nioxin deep repair hair masque really softened and conditioned my permed and dyed hair.  Since I started using Nioxin I have not used any other product.  And when I ran out of the product recently, my new hairdresser was unable to find the Deep repair hair masque.  As so often happens, if you want something done you have to do it yourself, so I went hunting on the internet and found the hair masque on Amazon.com and have been a very happy camper since.  The product is well worth the time and effort spent on the search.</li>
            <li> My stylist used to note how dry my hair was between visits--until I began using this hydrating product.  This really works.</li>
            <li> I buy the Nioxin System 4 liters of shampoo and conditioner.  Nioxin has changed my hair into a way thicker situation than it was (I had bald spots on top due to stress, coumadin, and heredity).  I wanted a deep conditioner, but wanted to stick with the Nioxin brand.  This is thick and ideal and comes with a pump bottle.  Also this company padded the shipping box with samples, so I have plenty to take on vacation instead of the liter bottles, which is great when airlines charge for weighed luggage.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Good for gor hair but doesn&#x27;t make hair easy to comb out</li>
            <li> What can I say? My fine, thin, straight hair loves this product. I use it in conjunction with their Nioxin shampoo. Great Combination.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft I love it!! I have been using Nioxin shampoo and conditioners for the past few months and I can defiantly tell it is making a difference.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I love it!</li>
            <li> Very please so far with this item.  I&#x27;m using it once a week to keep my hair from drying out too much.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my medium length hair and I really like the pump bottle on the larger size.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin cleanser and scalp conditioner for almost two years and have been amazed that my hair has grown longer that it has in the past 20 years - even my co-workers have noticed how long my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is so fine, it is always full of static and fly-aways, regardless of the season, so I took a chance and purchased the deep repair masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks and have learned something in the first two weeks - if I use this product too much, my hair is toooo soft! Not oily, but soft! I&#x27;ve never had that happen with a product before!!!! I started out using it about three times a week for five minutes - I scaled it back last week to leaving it on my hair for about an hour Sunday and washed my hair as normal during this week.  My hair is shiny, soft, and has bounce, and no fly-aways!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never found a product that has worked as well as this one - in this case, less is more!!!</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS FINE ~  BUT THE PUMP BOTTLE WILL NOT PUMP AT ALL. TRYING TO FIND SOMEKIND OF SQUEEZE TUBE TO TRANSFER IT TO. HAVE TO UNSCREW PUMP AND POUR IT OUT TO USE, WHAT A MESS.</li>
            <li> why do companies stop making products  I like? The scent of this conditioner is better than their other conditioners. It arrived on time and according to specs. Not sure what I will do when the source stops supplying.</li>
            <li> This is a very good conditioner. Leaves my hair soft and healthy.  This is the most economical way to purchase this conditioner that I have found.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Wife is pleased.</li>
            <li> This is Luis A&#x27;s wife: I love this hair masque, it makes my hair feel so soft and hydrated. I like that I can use it on a daily basis if I want to, plus the applicator is easy to use and smells good.</li>
            <li> Too soon to say it works but at least my hair stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> Hair is so soft after use</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Very very happy:)</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner, but I was hoping for better results than the conditioner I already use, which is less than a third of the price.</li>
            <li> Love love love! Will be buying again</li>
            <li> I use this with the Nioxin 4 System for my very fine, thin hair.  A hairdresser once told me in my younger days, I had lots of hair...just very fine.  When using this product, I actually sleep with it in my hair once a week with a disposable shower cap (the husband loves that part), the next day I rinse out, and my hair looks very healthy and I do not have those fly away frizzies!</li>
            <li> So far I really like this conditioner!</li>
            <li> First time I use this product and as soon as it touch my hair it made it extremely soft!!!! Delivery was fast and easy!!! Hoping to start seeing changes soon!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in my area with the other Nioxin. Wished it had that same tingly feeling as the regular condition has but loved the feel of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of nioxin products..This is a great conditioner..definitely more conditioning than just using the nioxin conditioner..</li>
            <li> This product continues to work best on my fine, color-treated hair. Product was well-packaged and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.  It appears to be a different product in the Nioxin bottle. For years I have been using this product and this is not it. The content has a horrible chemical smell. Maybe it&#x27;s just old. Regardless I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I thought it was ALL hype. I&#x27;ve tried so many &amp;#34;well reviewed&amp;#34; products, like Ojon, etc. None of them worked! I recently went to a crappy salon which bleached my hair twice and dyed it twice. On top of the platinum bleach I&#x27;d done for all my life. It ruined me, I had to cut off almost all of my hair, I had big red welts that peeled off all over my scalp. It was a horrible experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, afterwards I was crying. I have tried tons of products for my normal bleach-blonde hair. I have used everything from Lionesse, Ojon, Nexxus, Paul Mitchell, a dozen others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing on earth has done what this did. In five minutes. I just left it on AS THE IINSTRUCTIONS SAID. It was amazing. I could actually comb my hair. I could feel the tips without them breaking off. I didnt lose my hair overnight (usually I wake up to 10-20 hairs on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe that this actually stood up to my horrible, horrible hair. I was so excited I put some in a plastic bag for a coworker who has also been struggling with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of the product several years ago and loved it, but then could never find it in any of the salons in my area. I have short, curly hair and I use it on a weekly basis and I can see a difference in the texture and manageability of my hair. It has really made a difference this winter.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, foiled hair and this is by far my favorite-must have conditioner. Ive used it daily for ten or so years. Helps with frizzies!</li>
            <li> the company changed the formula and it was filled with parfume fragrance.  I&#x27;m allergic and have asthma.  I returned the product, per the seller&#x27;s instruction.  Had to keep after them to refund my credit card.  It took a very long time.  Will never use this dealer again.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair soft and shine with little portion every time of use. Definitely is a plus for the results of my hair be the way I want it.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner....</li>
            <li> This is THE best product I have found for my fine, limp hair. My hair dries, but other products weigh down and make my hair become &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; by the end of the day. This product is wonderful. Conditions hair and lets my hair stay in shape all day.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time fan of Nioxin, and this is one of my favorite products.  The Masque pumps into your hand like a luxurious lotion, and it works through your hair smoothly, with no greasy feeling at all.  I use it more often during the winter to combat the effects of dry air.  I have some gray hair, some natural color, and a few low lights - Nioxin&#x27;s Hair Masque conditions it all.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky. I am using system 5 because hair is falling out but much better. Also taking vitamins for hair .</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and my hair has always been fine.  I started to lose big sections about 2 years ago.  My hairdresser recommended this company.  I use the Shampoo, conditioner and the Deep Therapy and my hair all came back and it is thicker.  I was skeptical because I didn;t think anything would work, but Nioxin really worked for me.  Took a bit of time, but I was patient and continued to use it.  I now only use the deep conditioner a couple times a week.  I do Highlight my hair, so I do still need the deep conditioing.  But not as much as I used it in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Certainly worth trying as a deep scalp and hair cleansing should help with DHT issues and encourage health growth.&lt;br /&gt;Love the pump bottle and the large size.</li>
