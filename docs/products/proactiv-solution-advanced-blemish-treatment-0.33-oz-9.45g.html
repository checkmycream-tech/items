            <li>Great Product, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It also seems that Proactiv works best with mild and mild-moderate blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so happy to be able to buy this product from sellers on amazon.</li>
            <li>receiver was  very pleased with product</li>

            <li>But like I said, if you skip a day - more pimples will pop up!</li>
            <li>I would love something to correct those as well!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully and FAST!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>It gets rid of the blemishes very quickly and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>This is full of chemicals and it cannot be good for my skin!</li>
            <li>Works Amazing</li>
            <li>Magically amazing product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
            <li>The mask has some kind of greasy oil all over it</li>
            <li>I like to apply a nice size dot and leave it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been nice...  </li>
            <li>I get on time, nice price.</li>
            <li>Also, it isn&#x27;t all that effective in rapidly reducing scarring.</li>
            <li>Also, it isn&#x27;t all that effective in rapidly reducing scarring.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe this wasn&#x27;t as effective as I thought,</li>
            <li>Works quickly with great results.</li>
            <li>It is very effective and works quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective rapid-spot treatment that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to order just one product through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised and happy!</li>
            <li>She bought the Neutragena 3-piece kit and liked it better.</li>
            <li>can purchase this quantity of Benzyl Peroxide @ 10% concentration as a generic cream for under $1 (on Amazon and elsewhere), and mix it with the moisturizers they already know works the best for their own skin (for me that is Vanicream, Cetaphil, or CeraVe.)</li>

            <li>so it fits into your pores better and can penetrate deeper to fight the bacteria a lot more effectively. :)</li>
            <li>Another great product for my son and it really works!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product it worked great,</li>
            <li>Did exactly what it was supposed to do and great price</li>
            <li>work quick but is good</li>
            <li>Better than anything you will get at any store.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The product itself is OK, but</li>
            <li>I have never found anything better for &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; of acne than this product.</li>
            <li>Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li>I had dropped out of the club because I received more product than I could use.  </li>
            <li>but make sure you do not get it on your clothes, towels or sheets.  </li>
            <li>He love it and would advise any one with blemish problems to try this.</li>
            <li>and I love having clearer skin</li>
            <li>I also love this package of \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; sizes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this item a lot.</li>
            <li>I think the Clearsil brand works a lot better in this case.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had better luck with cheaper store bought blemish treatments.</li>
            <li>Grand daughter beginning to get some signs of acne on cheeks.</li>
            <li>I bought better stuff at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li>Most whiteheads</li>
            <li>Works great for my granddaughter for spot treatment, great price , came as expected</li>
            <li>Proactiv is probably the most well-known acne treatment system on the planet.</li>
            <li>They have many commercials, celebrity endorsements, mall kiosks, and even vending machines to sell their products.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and make sure I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li>If I have to reapply it is just to be sure</li>
            <li>I have noticed that if you don&#x27;t keep with the routine, you will break out even more than you did before.</li>
            <li>Love Proactive products.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure and wash your hands after applying it though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember, prevention is better than cure.</li>
            <li>I like the mask better.  </li>
            <li>It works better</li>
            <li>Have used this product before I love it but gets enpensive</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>sure it has not expired.  </li>
            <li>She ended up consulting a dermatologist who prescribed medication that is working much better.</li>
            <li>but nothing more.</li>
            <li>However, my teenage daughter has had excellent luck with this product.</li>
            <li>but it can&#x27;t jump out of your medicine cabinet and onto your face :)</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Many applications work.</li>
            <li>its great to treat those spot pimples...pretty much works overnight.</li>
            <li>It sure worked for me.</li>
            <li>But be sure to wash your hands after applying this and don&#x27;t use colored towels as it leaves a stain on them , I use a q-tip now to apply with no worries</li>
            <li>My daughter started using this product and her face cleared up really fast!!!!</li>
            <li>EXACTLY as promised!!!  </li>
            <li>It helped me pretty good.</li>
            <li>Happy New Year to you....</li>
            <li>This is a very good spot-treatment for pimples that are just starting or are already at the skin&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li>However, the most important underlying question is how well do Proactiv products work?</li>
            <li>So when I saw this on Amazon, as a single item and saw all of the glowing reviews I had to give it a try, and let me say it was a very good decision.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pay more for the quick result every time.</li>
            <li>I have never had anything work on my face so well and so quickly!</li>
            <li>But this product came quickly and was packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li>I  would recommend it pregnant or not!</li>
            <li>At this point in my life I have started getting HUGE volcano like zitts on my chin.</li>
            <li>I switched to Acne Free about a year ago.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great product at a low cost item.</li>
            <li>It is the most useful product to anti blemish</li>
            <li>From what I have gathered, they work amazingly well for some, reasonably well for some others, and poorly/not at all for others.</li>
            <li>but this (Proactiv Solution Advanced Blemish Treatment) product took me by surprise.</li>
            <li>This particular product works best when used regularly during breakouts.</li>
            <li>Additionally, Advanced Blemish Treatment is priced about the same as the high-strength (20% - 35%+ concentration) of salicylic acid or salicylic acid &amp; lactic acid gel peels, which can also be used for spot treatments and are much more effective than the Advanced Blemish Treatment (search &amp;#34;Salicylic Acid Gel Peel&amp;#34; here on Amazon and compare the User Reviews.)</li>

            <li>I am very fair skinned, and once my pimples have healed and went away, it does leave dark spots, and I&#x27;m just finding myself putting on lots of make up to hide them.</li>
            <li>the refining mask works so much better to make my skin feel a lot smoother, but it smells like hot garbage.</li>
            <li>In the past I had been very happy with Proactiv products, thus this is way</li>
            <li>Results take way too long, shipping was great but</li>
            <li>face was clean until I started facing this acne torture.</li>
            <li>Works great on single blemishes.</li>
            <li>After reading what I thought were authentic positive reviews I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>but again I love it would love it even more if it was just a little cheaper :-)</li>
            <li>This is very effective in getting pimples dry so they can go away faster.</li>
            <li>not really that great.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for the first time recently and am amazed at how great it works.</li>
            <li>I love the fast results, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more because it really works</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product! :-)</li>
            <li>I recommend this production, though I cannot see much difference on my face, but to my daughter, her face is much better than before.</li>
            <li>this works better than the whole proactiv wash kit.  </li>
            <li>in actuality, it&#x27;s a lot more than the 10%, 12%, whatever% that you find at CVS or your local drugstore because it&#x27;s prescription grade medication (very finely milled benzoyl peroxide)</li>
            <li>Pretty good but not the AMAZING solution it is purported to be - works about 60% of the time or a bit less.</li>
            <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and makes your blemishes more red and more permanent.</li>
            <li>Better than most topical creams.  </li>
            <li>It works well and quickly.</li>
            <li>I finally had to lock them out of my PayPal account to keep them from taking more more money.  </li>
            <li>This cleared up his acne quickly and is keeping it gone.  </li>
            <li>Was very smooth at 1st now 1/2 way through tube becoming gritty.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping - got this for my son and it works great - helps to clear up those unexpected blemishes that pop out now and then used along with the Proactive Micro-Crystal Acne Kit.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch!!</li>
            <li>Fast!!</li>
            <li>This product is very effective, doesn&#x27;t take much of it and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original version of this product as well as the new Advanced version.</li>
            <li>And very often online offers more than what is available at the mall.  </li>
            <li>Differin gel works amazing, but unfortunately my current insurance does not cover the cost of the prescription, which is $250 out of pocket!</li>
            <li>A powerful product indeed</li>
            <li>It was worth a shot</li>
            <li>Similar items sell for a sixth of the price at any drugstore and are just as effective as this one.</li>
            <li>Does Advanced Blemish Treatment work any better than buying generic Benzyl Peroxide cream?</li>
            <li>Does Advanced Blemish Treatment work any better than buying generic Benzyl Peroxide cream?</li>
            <li>I rarely get any acne</li>
            <li>They sort of work for awhile, but they aren&#x27;t worth all that money.</li>
            <li>I love this product it treats acne and promotes clear appearance.</li>
            <li>Only requires a drop for effective treatment.</li>
            <li>bought this for my 17 year old grand daughter.  </li>
            <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li>, I switched back to my original clearasil!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>If the price is right I would buy again.</li>
            <li>and it work right away</li>
            <li>This is a magic little tube top help blemishes go away.</li>
            <li>My son uses this product and finds it to be easy and clearing blemishes nearly overnight.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really dry out the skin so that is a nice thing.</li>
            <li>So far, it doesn&#x27;t work on well grown acne and the medication is not as strong as it needs to be.  </li>
            <li>wow, I&#x27;m sure this will clear it right up!</li>
            <li>so very much.</li>
            <li>What can I sat this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>Please be aware that this company means to hook you.....</li>
            <li>Stick a Proactive label on a product and charge three times as much!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got 6% benzoyl peroxide, which is a whole lot!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li>Tried this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and product really works!</li>
            <li>first try</li>
            <li>She is pre teen and was highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Ok, gave it to my teenage niece.</li>
            <li>but this isn&#x27;t the first time  </li>
            <li>As the User Reviews here (and elsewhere) show, Proactiv Advanced Blemish Treatment works well for some people, but does not work nearly as well for others.</li>
            <li>You have to try it first to see if it works for you or not.</li>
            <li>I tend to break out a lot right around a certain time a month, and Proactiv has helped heal some of those break outs.</li>
            <li>I am currently out of it and need to purchase more.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and it never fails.</li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>Works fast!</li>
            <li>was buying it for retail price in the mall- almost twice as much!</li>
            <li>AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF A PIMPLE I APPLY THIS STUFF AND</li>
            <li>Hot towel needed in between.</li>
            <li>Thank you ;)</li>
            <li>The first time i used it one</li>
            <li>This really zaps the zits!</li>
            <li>this is a good product even for someone with dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This spot treatment works OK for me, but I have used various other products that are not only more effective, but much less-expensive.</li>
            <li>I like Clean and Clear persa-gel 10.</li>
            <li>It seems in recent years, retailers have eliminated many of the acne medication thanks to concerns about</li>
            <li>Naturally, skin is more oily and when pregnant there are only certain products recommended.  </li>
            <li>Super strong and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li>This item is so HOT that my whole family is always borrowing one or asking me..</li>
            <li>Zits are eliminated pretty fast because the product really dries out the skin (like alcohol times 10).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels good, but I&#x27;m not sure if it really works or if its the Proactiv I use that&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a large tube for $5.  </li>
            <li>just put a large dab on.  </li>
            <li>and it is doing nothing to help the large under the skin &amp;#34;blemish&amp;#34; I have trying to pop through.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a large amount to apply - use sparingly.  </li>
            <li>The active ingredient in this product is Benzoyl peroxide and many other products including \\&quot;Pernex AC\\&quot; and \\&quot;Panoxyl\\&quot; all contain Benzoyl peroxide and are just as effective at 1/3rd the price.  </li>
            <li>While it may be a product worth trying, due to the high price &amp; the good availability of highly-effective acne products (many available right here, on Amazon), my personal advice is to try a few other products before shelling out the cash for Proactiv&#x27;s Advanced Blemish Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is just amazing because as soon as you come to know or start feeling a tingling sensation under your skin, immediately apply this and wait for few hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an on the spot treatment which works really well.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this if you have one or two troublesome blemishes, as this will shrink them in no time!</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Dries out pimples fast ....</li>
            <li>Thanks Proactive</li>
            <li>but if you put it on like you are suppose to blemishes do heal fast would recommend</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well at all.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and product was as promised</li>
            <li>After much trial and error with others, I decided to try the Proactive brand.</li>
            <li>and it has worked really well.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it works really well</li>
            <li>but it does make the whole process happen quicker than if I did nothing</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It works so fast.</li>
            <li>This product is very overpriced and undersized, just like all Proactiv products.</li>
            <li>Works very well on blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Dries them up fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>As a result, companies like Proactiv can jack up prices thanks to demand.</li>
            <li>Pro activ didn&#x27;t really work for my daughter.</li>
            <li>This product works fast and works well.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer now and remains that way for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I have really patchy combination skin</li>
            <li>and it helps to gently treat all areas of my face without drying or irritation.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference in the length of my breakout but</li>
            <li>and it really helped.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t do much at all.</li>
            <li>This work&#x27;s and fast no need to wait weeks for results.  </li>
            <li>This was something I bought along with the Proactiv set, this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>However if you want to see fast result  then its recommended to use it three times a day.</li>
            <li>This product really does work, just like the commericals claim.</li>
            <li>In two years I have only been able to maintain partially clear skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works any better than some of the other OTC products.</li>
            <li>It dries up acne better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, even prescription strength.</li>
            <li>The advance blemish treatment works great on getting rid of big and small pimples.</li>
            <li>Great for spot treating those deep and troublesome pimples that are hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li>That concentration is a middle-of-the-road strength (some products have more, some less.)</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with Proactiv as a company is their practice of making you commit to \\&quot;regularly\\&quot; scheduled deliveries of their products, which is why I shop independent sellers through Amazon even though I have to pay slightly more.</li>
            <li>It dries it up quickly, and they scab over a coarse of two to three days.</li>
            <li>So far she has only used the advanced blemish treatment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The Advanced Blemish Treatment is easy to use, does not really burn much, and its moisturizers do not clog pores to make the original blemish worse (or cause additional blemishes.)</li>
            <li>The Advanced Blemish Treatment is easy to use, does not really burn much, and its moisturizers do not clog pores to make the original blemish worse (or cause additional blemishes.)</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the proactive company offers.</li>
            <li>This product really helped keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>I use Clinque Acne Solutions because my skin works better with that everyday care</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t seen to be powerful enough for me.</li>
            <li>Normally acne medications burn, and the fact that this doesn&#x27;t even burn or even tingle makes me feel like I&#x27;m just rubbing lotion on my face.</li>
            <li>and I wish it was bigger because I run out of it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Works about as good or maybe even worse than over the counter spot treatments.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li>It did make a difference for her, but she was still getting new pimples.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry all of my acne out as quickly as I like</li>
            <li>I finally was able to cancel the account, but ended up paying over twice as much as they advertise for half the product.  </li>
            <li>This is smaller and less effective than the old invisible acne treatment.</li>
            <li>they were all nearly 90% gone!</li>
            <li>This was my first and last time buying something from proactive.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t live near me</li>
            <li>I have a pretty clear complexion but who doesn&#x27;t get a occasional blemish?</li>
            <li>Another thing about this is that it will dry out your face quickly so you should only just use it on pimple and not your whole face.</li>
            <li>having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We will find something else that will work to clear up her skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything to clear up the outbreak faster (if at all).  </li>
            <li>I like that it is clear on</li>
            <li>It works well to clear up blemishes in about 3 days.</li>
            <li>I have had this product 3 days and my problem areas are almost clear.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>This product has really helped my teenage daughter battle her outbreaks.  </li>
            <li>I havnt seen much of any improvement on any of my sudden pimples .</li>
            <li>Obviously this product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but it works very well for my skin.</li>
            <li>Still looking for something cheaper than Origins spot remover at $15 a bottle that works anywhere near as well without drying face...</li>
            <li>and then I can &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; on them to then go away completely so all in all about a week for those.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really burn unless the pimple is open because I poppped it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looking forward to buying the whole kit next time we make a purchase.  </li>
            <li>, it took me nearly three months and dozens of phone calls to cancel my \\&quot;introductory\\&quot; offer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would be like the old formula, but it&#x27;s not</li>
            <li>I used Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Vanishing Acne Treatment, which works as well</li>
            <li>We ordered it for our seventeen year old son and within days of using his face started to clear up.</li>
            <li>It treats all kinds of adult acne.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my 17 yr old son.  </li>
            <li>My wife bought this product for treat an adult acne it made acne worts...</li>
            <li>Still good product, not good for long time use.</li>
            <li>I started using this to give me some insurance for a nice clear face before my wedding - 2 days after I began using I broke out worse</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom and see likes it but wish the tube was a little bit bigger other wise no problems.</li>
            <li>my kids love proactiv+ as it really helps their skin to be free from spots, where other products have failed</li>
            <li>More is not better!</li>
            <li>Our body chemistries are seemingly different enough so that certain acne treatments work miracles for some people, while that exact same treatment does not work at all for others.</li>
            <li>Does NOT work, its very plausible the other reviews for this product have been finessed and are not authentic.</li>
            <li>my fiancé uses this along with the full daily proactive line in his daily regimen - we will continue to purchase from here in the future when replacement needed- Thank You</li>
            <li>Need a bigger size it came in a small boxes didn&#x27;t like that, but seem ok so far.</li>
            <li>I moved from the address, which is one of many reasons I canceled my \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; and yet I received a letter from a shady collection agency (SKO Brenner American) saying I owe $67.89......</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for teenage acne!</li>
            <li>I recently started a new medication that caused breakouts.  </li>
            <li>plus it is clear and does not dry skin out or interfere with make-up or wash regime.</li>
            <li>It cleared the acne in just a few days and left my skin blemish free.</li>
            <li>I had been using the dark spot corrector for a couple months already and noticed more of a difference after using this product than I did the dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li>It is really great!I have used more expensive products</li>
            <li>Luckily, I started purchasing this product to help me with my deep, dark blemishes.</li>
            <li>As far as other reviews about the price if you have true acne you&#x27;ve already spent hundreds on products that just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m older (45), and don&#x27;t use Proactiv cleansing system on my skin regularly, this spot treatment works wonders on my teenagers, and on my occasional peri-menopausal break outs</li>
            <li>And over about 6 months i dont even see the dark spots on my cheek that at one point bothered me very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that the active ingredients in this product are similar to others you can purchase at any local store.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s face has completely cleared up in such a short time, I could see a huge difference in just a few days!</li>
            <li>The only problem I have had with it is it doesn&#x27;t help clear the acne scars.</li>
            <li>I had heard mixed reviews on Proactiv for clear skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since I was 17 years old (ten years)</li>
            <li>I order on line only when I cannot get to the mall to purchase directly.  </li>
            <li>I have a mature skin but get occasional out breaks on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>There are natural and cheaper alternatives, such as toothpaste for blemishes.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old clearasil.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have coco butter or something to lighten the affected area it will become a lil dark once it has dried out.</li>
            <li>Either way, it has worked really well compared to other major brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I had about 7 large zitts on my chin that wouldnt go away with any other product.</li>
            <li>i put sparingly on whole face every other day</li>
            <li>, it is that no single product works well for everyone.</li>
            <li>I should add that I usually have pretty clear skin</li>
            <li>They do seem to work pretty well, but just a little word ahead - when using the Proactiv products, you have to keep up with it.</li>
            <li>This stuff definitely works, but like another reviewer said, you can get pretty much the same ingredients for less in other products.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product I have ever used that has successfully cleared up those annoying blemishes almost completely overnight!</li>
            <li>Not sure if its just not the right solution for her skin type or what.</li>
            <li>this little tube really</li>
            <li>/&gt;This Blemish Treatment, which is intended for usage on small areas as a &amp;#34;spot treatment,&amp;#34; uses Benzyl Peroxide as the primary active ingredient at a concentration of 6%.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works Amazing</li>
            <li> Magically amazing product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
            <li> The mask has some kind of greasy oil all over it</li>
            <li> I like to apply a nice size dot and leave it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been nice...  </li>
            <li> I get on time, nice price.</li>
            <li> Also, it isn&#x27;t all that effective in rapidly reducing scarring.</li>
            <li> Also, it isn&#x27;t all that effective in rapidly reducing scarring.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe this wasn&#x27;t as effective as I thought,</li>
            <li> Works quickly with great results.</li>
            <li> It is very effective and works quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective rapid-spot treatment that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to order just one product through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised and happy!</li>
            <li> She bought the Neutragena 3-piece kit and liked it better.</li>
            <li> can purchase this quantity of Benzyl Peroxide @ 10% concentration as a generic cream for under $1 (on Amazon and elsewhere), and mix it with the moisturizers they already know works the best for their own skin (for me that is Vanicream, Cetaphil, or CeraVe.)</li>

            <li> so it fits into your pores better and can penetrate deeper to fight the bacteria a lot more effectively. :)</li>
            <li> Another great product for my son and it really works!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it worked great,</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it was supposed to do and great price</li>
            <li> work quick but is good</li>
            <li> Better than anything you will get at any store.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The product itself is OK, but</li>
            <li> I have never found anything better for &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; of acne than this product.</li>
            <li> Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li> I had dropped out of the club because I received more product than I could use.  </li>
            <li> but make sure you do not get it on your clothes, towels or sheets.  </li>
            <li> He love it and would advise any one with blemish problems to try this.</li>
            <li> and I love having clearer skin</li>
            <li> I also love this package of \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this item a lot.</li>
            <li> I think the Clearsil brand works a lot better in this case.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had better luck with cheaper store bought blemish treatments.</li>
            <li> Grand daughter beginning to get some signs of acne on cheeks.</li>
            <li> I bought better stuff at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> Most whiteheads</li>
            <li> Works great for my granddaughter for spot treatment, great price , came as expected</li>
            <li> Proactiv is probably the most well-known acne treatment system on the planet.</li>
            <li> They have many commercials, celebrity endorsements, mall kiosks, and even vending machines to sell their products.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and make sure I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> If I have to reapply it is just to be sure</li>
            <li> I have noticed that if you don&#x27;t keep with the routine, you will break out even more than you did before.</li>
            <li> Love Proactive products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure and wash your hands after applying it though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember, prevention is better than cure.</li>
            <li> I like the mask better.  </li>
            <li> It works better</li>
            <li> Have used this product before I love it but gets enpensive</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> sure it has not expired.  </li>
            <li> She ended up consulting a dermatologist who prescribed medication that is working much better.</li>
            <li> but nothing more.</li>
            <li> However, my teenage daughter has had excellent luck with this product.</li>
            <li> but it can&#x27;t jump out of your medicine cabinet and onto your face :)</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> Many applications work.</li>
            <li> its great to treat those spot pimples...pretty much works overnight.</li>
            <li> It sure worked for me.</li>
            <li> But be sure to wash your hands after applying this and don&#x27;t use colored towels as it leaves a stain on them , I use a q-tip now to apply with no worries</li>
            <li> My daughter started using this product and her face cleared up really fast!!!!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY as promised!!!  </li>
            <li> It helped me pretty good.</li>
            <li> Happy New Year to you....</li>
            <li> This is a very good spot-treatment for pimples that are just starting or are already at the skin&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li> However, the most important underlying question is how well do Proactiv products work?</li>
            <li> So when I saw this on Amazon, as a single item and saw all of the glowing reviews I had to give it a try, and let me say it was a very good decision.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pay more for the quick result every time.</li>
            <li> I have never had anything work on my face so well and so quickly!</li>
            <li> But this product came quickly and was packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li> I  would recommend it pregnant or not!</li>
            <li> At this point in my life I have started getting HUGE volcano like zitts on my chin.</li>
            <li> I switched to Acne Free about a year ago.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great product at a low cost item.</li>
            <li> It is the most useful product to anti blemish</li>
            <li> From what I have gathered, they work amazingly well for some, reasonably well for some others, and poorly/not at all for others.</li>
            <li> but this (Proactiv Solution Advanced Blemish Treatment) product took me by surprise.</li>
            <li> This particular product works best when used regularly during breakouts.</li>
            <li> Additionally, Advanced Blemish Treatment is priced about the same as the high-strength (20% - 35%+ concentration) of salicylic acid or salicylic acid &amp; lactic acid gel peels, which can also be used for spot treatments and are much more effective than the Advanced Blemish Treatment (search &amp;#34;Salicylic Acid Gel Peel&amp;#34; here on Amazon and compare the User Reviews.)</li>

            <li> I am very fair skinned, and once my pimples have healed and went away, it does leave dark spots, and I&#x27;m just finding myself putting on lots of make up to hide them.</li>
            <li> the refining mask works so much better to make my skin feel a lot smoother, but it smells like hot garbage.</li>
            <li> In the past I had been very happy with Proactiv products, thus this is way</li>
            <li> Results take way too long, shipping was great but</li>
            <li> face was clean until I started facing this acne torture.</li>
            <li> Works great on single blemishes.</li>
            <li> After reading what I thought were authentic positive reviews I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> but again I love it would love it even more if it was just a little cheaper :-)</li>
            <li> This is very effective in getting pimples dry so they can go away faster.</li>
            <li> not really that great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for the first time recently and am amazed at how great it works.</li>
            <li> I love the fast results, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more because it really works</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product! :-)</li>
            <li> I recommend this production, though I cannot see much difference on my face, but to my daughter, her face is much better than before.</li>
            <li> this works better than the whole proactiv wash kit.  </li>
            <li> in actuality, it&#x27;s a lot more than the 10%, 12%, whatever% that you find at CVS or your local drugstore because it&#x27;s prescription grade medication (very finely milled benzoyl peroxide)</li>
            <li> Pretty good but not the AMAZING solution it is purported to be - works about 60% of the time or a bit less.</li>
            <li> So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and makes your blemishes more red and more permanent.</li>
            <li> Better than most topical creams.  </li>
            <li> It works well and quickly.</li>
            <li> I finally had to lock them out of my PayPal account to keep them from taking more more money.  </li>
            <li> This cleared up his acne quickly and is keeping it gone.  </li>
            <li> Was very smooth at 1st now 1/2 way through tube becoming gritty.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping - got this for my son and it works great - helps to clear up those unexpected blemishes that pop out now and then used along with the Proactive Micro-Crystal Acne Kit.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch!!</li>
            <li> Fast!!</li>
            <li> This product is very effective, doesn&#x27;t take much of it and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original version of this product as well as the new Advanced version.</li>
            <li> And very often online offers more than what is available at the mall.  </li>
            <li> Differin gel works amazing, but unfortunately my current insurance does not cover the cost of the prescription, which is $250 out of pocket!</li>
            <li> A powerful product indeed</li>
            <li> It was worth a shot</li>
            <li> Similar items sell for a sixth of the price at any drugstore and are just as effective as this one.</li>
            <li> Does Advanced Blemish Treatment work any better than buying generic Benzyl Peroxide cream?</li>
            <li> Does Advanced Blemish Treatment work any better than buying generic Benzyl Peroxide cream?</li>
            <li> I rarely get any acne</li>
            <li> They sort of work for awhile, but they aren&#x27;t worth all that money.</li>
            <li> I love this product it treats acne and promotes clear appearance.</li>
            <li> Only requires a drop for effective treatment.</li>
            <li> bought this for my 17 year old grand daughter.  </li>
            <li> Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li> , I switched back to my original clearasil!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> If the price is right I would buy again.</li>
            <li> and it work right away</li>
            <li> This is a magic little tube top help blemishes go away.</li>
            <li> My son uses this product and finds it to be easy and clearing blemishes nearly overnight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really dry out the skin so that is a nice thing.</li>
            <li> So far, it doesn&#x27;t work on well grown acne and the medication is not as strong as it needs to be.  </li>
            <li> wow, I&#x27;m sure this will clear it right up!</li>
            <li> so very much.</li>
            <li> What can I sat this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> Please be aware that this company means to hook you.....</li>
            <li> Stick a Proactive label on a product and charge three times as much!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got 6% benzoyl peroxide, which is a whole lot!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and product really works!</li>
            <li> first try</li>
            <li> She is pre teen and was highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Ok, gave it to my teenage niece.</li>
            <li> but this isn&#x27;t the first time  </li>
            <li> As the User Reviews here (and elsewhere) show, Proactiv Advanced Blemish Treatment works well for some people, but does not work nearly as well for others.</li>
            <li> You have to try it first to see if it works for you or not.</li>
            <li> I tend to break out a lot right around a certain time a month, and Proactiv has helped heal some of those break outs.</li>
            <li> I am currently out of it and need to purchase more.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it never fails.</li>
            <li> it really works!</li>
            <li> Works fast!</li>
            <li> was buying it for retail price in the mall- almost twice as much!</li>
            <li> AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF A PIMPLE I APPLY THIS STUFF AND</li>
            <li> Hot towel needed in between.</li>
            <li> Thank you ;)</li>
            <li> The first time i used it one</li>
            <li> This really zaps the zits!</li>
            <li> this is a good product even for someone with dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This spot treatment works OK for me, but I have used various other products that are not only more effective, but much less-expensive.</li>
            <li> I like Clean and Clear persa-gel 10.</li>
            <li> It seems in recent years, retailers have eliminated many of the acne medication thanks to concerns about</li>
            <li> Naturally, skin is more oily and when pregnant there are only certain products recommended.  </li>
            <li> Super strong and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li> This item is so HOT that my whole family is always borrowing one or asking me..</li>
            <li> Zits are eliminated pretty fast because the product really dries out the skin (like alcohol times 10).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels good, but I&#x27;m not sure if it really works or if its the Proactiv I use that&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a large tube for $5.  </li>
            <li> just put a large dab on.  </li>
            <li> and it is doing nothing to help the large under the skin &amp;#34;blemish&amp;#34; I have trying to pop through.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a large amount to apply - use sparingly.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this product is Benzoyl peroxide and many other products including \\&quot;Pernex AC\\&quot; and \\&quot;Panoxyl\\&quot; all contain Benzoyl peroxide and are just as effective at 1/3rd the price.  </li>
            <li> While it may be a product worth trying, due to the high price &amp; the good availability of highly-effective acne products (many available right here, on Amazon), my personal advice is to try a few other products before shelling out the cash for Proactiv&#x27;s Advanced Blemish Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing because as soon as you come to know or start feeling a tingling sensation under your skin, immediately apply this and wait for few hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an on the spot treatment which works really well.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if you have one or two troublesome blemishes, as this will shrink them in no time!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Dries out pimples fast ....</li>
            <li> Thanks Proactive</li>
            <li> but if you put it on like you are suppose to blemishes do heal fast would recommend</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well at all.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and product was as promised</li>
            <li> After much trial and error with others, I decided to try the Proactive brand.</li>
            <li> and it has worked really well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works really well</li>
            <li> but it does make the whole process happen quicker than if I did nothing</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It works so fast.</li>
            <li> This product is very overpriced and undersized, just like all Proactiv products.</li>
            <li> Works very well on blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Dries them up fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> As a result, companies like Proactiv can jack up prices thanks to demand.</li>
            <li> Pro activ didn&#x27;t really work for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This product works fast and works well.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much clearer now and remains that way for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have really patchy combination skin</li>
            <li> and it helps to gently treat all areas of my face without drying or irritation.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference in the length of my breakout but</li>
            <li> and it really helped.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t do much at all.</li>
            <li> This work&#x27;s and fast no need to wait weeks for results.  </li>
            <li> This was something I bought along with the Proactiv set, this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> However if you want to see fast result  then its recommended to use it three times a day.</li>
            <li> This product really does work, just like the commericals claim.</li>
            <li> In two years I have only been able to maintain partially clear skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works any better than some of the other OTC products.</li>
            <li> It dries up acne better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, even prescription strength.</li>
            <li> The advance blemish treatment works great on getting rid of big and small pimples.</li>
            <li> Great for spot treating those deep and troublesome pimples that are hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> That concentration is a middle-of-the-road strength (some products have more, some less.)</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with Proactiv as a company is their practice of making you commit to \\&quot;regularly\\&quot; scheduled deliveries of their products, which is why I shop independent sellers through Amazon even though I have to pay slightly more.</li>
            <li> It dries it up quickly, and they scab over a coarse of two to three days.</li>
            <li> So far she has only used the advanced blemish treatment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Advanced Blemish Treatment is easy to use, does not really burn much, and its moisturizers do not clog pores to make the original blemish worse (or cause additional blemishes.)</li>
            <li> The Advanced Blemish Treatment is easy to use, does not really burn much, and its moisturizers do not clog pores to make the original blemish worse (or cause additional blemishes.)</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the proactive company offers.</li>
            <li> This product really helped keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> I use Clinque Acne Solutions because my skin works better with that everyday care</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seen to be powerful enough for me.</li>
            <li> Normally acne medications burn, and the fact that this doesn&#x27;t even burn or even tingle makes me feel like I&#x27;m just rubbing lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> and I wish it was bigger because I run out of it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Works about as good or maybe even worse than over the counter spot treatments.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li> It did make a difference for her, but she was still getting new pimples.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry all of my acne out as quickly as I like</li>
            <li> I finally was able to cancel the account, but ended up paying over twice as much as they advertise for half the product.  </li>
            <li> This is smaller and less effective than the old invisible acne treatment.</li>
            <li> they were all nearly 90% gone!</li>
            <li> This was my first and last time buying something from proactive.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t live near me</li>
            <li> I have a pretty clear complexion but who doesn&#x27;t get a occasional blemish?</li>
            <li> Another thing about this is that it will dry out your face quickly so you should only just use it on pimple and not your whole face.</li>
            <li> having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We will find something else that will work to clear up her skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything to clear up the outbreak faster (if at all).  </li>
            <li> I like that it is clear on</li>
            <li> It works well to clear up blemishes in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have had this product 3 days and my problem areas are almost clear.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li> This product has really helped my teenage daughter battle her outbreaks.  </li>
            <li> I havnt seen much of any improvement on any of my sudden pimples .</li>
            <li> Obviously this product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but it works very well for my skin.</li>
            <li> Still looking for something cheaper than Origins spot remover at $15 a bottle that works anywhere near as well without drying face...</li>
            <li> and then I can &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; on them to then go away completely so all in all about a week for those.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really burn unless the pimple is open because I poppped it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looking forward to buying the whole kit next time we make a purchase.  </li>
            <li> , it took me nearly three months and dozens of phone calls to cancel my \\&quot;introductory\\&quot; offer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be like the old formula, but it&#x27;s not</li>
            <li> I used Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Vanishing Acne Treatment, which works as well</li>
            <li> We ordered it for our seventeen year old son and within days of using his face started to clear up.</li>
            <li> It treats all kinds of adult acne.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 17 yr old son.  </li>
            <li> My wife bought this product for treat an adult acne it made acne worts...</li>
            <li> Still good product, not good for long time use.</li>
            <li> I started using this to give me some insurance for a nice clear face before my wedding - 2 days after I began using I broke out worse</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and see likes it but wish the tube was a little bit bigger other wise no problems.</li>
            <li> my kids love proactiv+ as it really helps their skin to be free from spots, where other products have failed</li>
            <li> More is not better!</li>
            <li> Our body chemistries are seemingly different enough so that certain acne treatments work miracles for some people, while that exact same treatment does not work at all for others.</li>
            <li> Does NOT work, its very plausible the other reviews for this product have been finessed and are not authentic.</li>
            <li> my fiancé uses this along with the full daily proactive line in his daily regimen - we will continue to purchase from here in the future when replacement needed- Thank You</li>
            <li> Need a bigger size it came in a small boxes didn&#x27;t like that, but seem ok so far.</li>
            <li> I moved from the address, which is one of many reasons I canceled my \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; and yet I received a letter from a shady collection agency (SKO Brenner American) saying I owe $67.89......</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for teenage acne!</li>
            <li> I recently started a new medication that caused breakouts.  </li>
            <li> plus it is clear and does not dry skin out or interfere with make-up or wash regime.</li>
            <li> It cleared the acne in just a few days and left my skin blemish free.</li>
            <li> I had been using the dark spot corrector for a couple months already and noticed more of a difference after using this product than I did the dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> It is really great!I have used more expensive products</li>
            <li> Luckily, I started purchasing this product to help me with my deep, dark blemishes.</li>
            <li> As far as other reviews about the price if you have true acne you&#x27;ve already spent hundreds on products that just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m older (45), and don&#x27;t use Proactiv cleansing system on my skin regularly, this spot treatment works wonders on my teenagers, and on my occasional peri-menopausal break outs</li>
            <li> And over about 6 months i dont even see the dark spots on my cheek that at one point bothered me very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that the active ingredients in this product are similar to others you can purchase at any local store.  </li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s face has completely cleared up in such a short time, I could see a huge difference in just a few days!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have had with it is it doesn&#x27;t help clear the acne scars.</li>
            <li> I had heard mixed reviews on Proactiv for clear skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was 17 years old (ten years)</li>
            <li> I order on line only when I cannot get to the mall to purchase directly.  </li>
            <li> I have a mature skin but get occasional out breaks on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> There are natural and cheaper alternatives, such as toothpaste for blemishes.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old clearasil.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have coco butter or something to lighten the affected area it will become a lil dark once it has dried out.</li>
            <li> Either way, it has worked really well compared to other major brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I had about 7 large zitts on my chin that wouldnt go away with any other product.</li>
            <li> i put sparingly on whole face every other day</li>
            <li> , it is that no single product works well for everyone.</li>
            <li> I should add that I usually have pretty clear skin</li>
            <li> They do seem to work pretty well, but just a little word ahead - when using the Proactiv products, you have to keep up with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely works, but like another reviewer said, you can get pretty much the same ingredients for less in other products.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product I have ever used that has successfully cleared up those annoying blemishes almost completely overnight!</li>
            <li> Not sure if its just not the right solution for her skin type or what.</li>
            <li> this little tube really</li>
            <li> /&gt;This Blemish Treatment, which is intended for usage on small areas as a &amp;#34;spot treatment,&amp;#34; uses Benzyl Peroxide as the primary active ingredient at a concentration of 6%.</li>
            <li> With just the Proactiv Skincare System alone, she was still having some hot-spots; however, after using the Blemish Treatment (consistently), she has very few problem areas.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product, and the other Proactiv products quite frequently.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit high considering how little product you get.  </li>
            <li> Love it, smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant and goes on clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne.</li>
            <li> but the tube it came in is extremely small and ya don&#x27;t get all that much.</li>
            <li> I have used other Proactiv products in the past with some success</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend using a very tiny amount on spots and not slathering it on, though, or it won&#x27;t last very long!</li>
            <li> Not bad, small, yet a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this product would live up to the same standards as past products</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for persons who are dealing with facial blemishes due to acnes and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Little tip don’t buy anything direct from proactive.</li>
            <li> Does not dry anything out or make the skin peel like other acne medicines</li>
            <li> In a matter of a few days this product completely healed my blemishes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The sum up this review, proactive does NOT work and this product was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> As my skin aged I needed a different product line.</li>
            <li> I am going to try the dark spot remover for my newly created dark spots, I&#x27;m hoping to may see faster results.</li>
            <li> They work extremely well and we will be purchasing them again in the future.</li>
            <li> My acne isn&#x27;t that bad, but when I felt one coming up, I thought this would help zap it - and it most definitely didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This spot treatment will usually dry them up in two days.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I try to use it twice a day although, when it dries, it appears to leave the skin dry looking if you dont rub it in.</li>
            <li> It helps dry out a pimple</li>
            <li> DRY</li>
            <li> on the upside, it doesnt dry the skin out like some do.</li>
            <li> Apply conservatively as it can also dry out surrounding skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really dry up the breakouts I got from using the OUI Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> In the past, I tried the Neutrogena counterpart, Clean N Clear, etc., with mediocre results.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t find anything past maintaining semi clear skin buy this product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my acne problem as proclaimed on all of the TV commericals!</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry or rough.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if the tube was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> product simply doesnt work as least for me and my facial blemishes.</li>
            <li> The wife had a problem with her &amp;#34;complexion&amp;#34; a few months back and ordered this and the Revitalizing Toner.  </li>
            <li> Peeling skin is expected with the dryness.  </li>
            <li> it did no such thing and money was wasted.</li>
            <li> the product its self is not very affective...</li>
            <li> The back end of the tube&#x27;s seal was completely broken and the cream was almost completely all out.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, it works!  </li>
            <li> Plain &amp; simple, it was like lighting a firecracker w/ no sparks.</li>
            <li> You only need little portion of this treatment to cover the affected area and so this tube lasts for a while though the quantity is less.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think it does, or at least the differences are very minor, but the cost differences are major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think it does, or at least the differences are very minor, but the cost differences are major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as drying as some of the other products on the market, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate surrounding skin like the acne gels.    </li>
            <li> Also, just like all the other proactive stuff, it bleached everything.</li>
            <li> I have tried other spot acne creams and they do not seem to work that</li>
            <li> I would say for some acne it is gone in a day and other maybe two.</li>
            <li> I got the other proactiv stuff,  </li>
            <li> usage for this product is for occasional pimples that break out, sometimes in small clusters.</li>
            <li> I used it along with other proactive products, the 3 step cleaning stuff.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount of it .</li>
            <li> The other in a yr.</li>
            <li> Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin.</li>
            <li> last time I seen her she had few pimples and her hair was green</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not suitable for your entire face, though, so you should use the Proactiv repairing lotion for all-over face.     </li>
            <li> I thought this product would work better, but I was totally wrong!!</li>
            <li> If you closely look at their adverts you can see that the people used for &#x27;before-after&#x27; testimonials are wearing heavy duty concealer and other makeup.</li>
            <li> Typically if I need to I put it on in the evenin  ven if I suspect a slight blemish an</li>
            <li> half the amount of a kiosk or a member.</li>
            <li> Rids you of black heads in 2-3 days every time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical since I am older, but it worked and it has kept on working.</li>
            <li> That makes it difficult for me to recommend this product, and so I recommend trying a few other products prior to this.is product is for occasional pimples that break out, sometimes in small clusters.</li>
            <li> It works no better than other less costly products.</li>
            <li> but I found a little dab will do it.</li>
            <li> This product hasn&#x27;t helped even a little.</li>
            <li> This product was misrepresented as the Proactiv Dark Spot corrector!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a little tube of miracles.</li>
            <li> Like anything, you must follow the directions and give it a little time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the other products as well!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about trying this product because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you do not have bad skin but just get that one breakout and want to cover that area the clear it up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money--get a cheaper brand that works.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I suggest ordering a few.</li>
            <li> After putting it on 3 of my pimples before bed I awoke to find all 3 dried up, and within 48 hours (of 2 treatments a day)</li>
            <li> than I ever have before sooooooo don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I applied this product three times and the zip rapidly dried up and was almost gone within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Got 2 tubes noticed one expires in a few mo.</li>
            <li> Opens pores and medication soaks in and dissolves trapped dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> so, I gave it a break for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This product brought the few pimples I had to a head and then worked on clearing them.  </li>
            <li> IF THE PRODUCT REALL WORKS, SO BUY A FEW</li>
            <li> He was having trouble with his acne using treatment products from the store, they just were not working.  </li>
            <li> I would also get the Proactiv green tea moisturizer with it too.</li>
            <li> Dried my pimples after 3 days.</li>
            <li> Something starts popping up, I put the proactiv on it overnight, and usually it&#x27;s gone or significantly down by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That makes it difficult for me to recommend this product, and so I recommend trying a few other products prior to this.</li>
            <li> little small and need to buy for using&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I tried this hoping it would at least be half as effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, not worth the price!!</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but it lasted me a LONG time, even with my Mom stealing it.</li>
            <li> It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin.</li>
            <li> Just the price is not ok</li>
            <li> I usually use the repairing lotion at night, but there&#x27;s always one or two pimples that seem to sneak through.     </li>
            <li> Frankly I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the cream that ends up working or just</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to do so since I tried Proactive in the past and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This was not much better than the OTC stuff</li>
            <li> small and convenient.</li>
            <li> Small tube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for the tiny tube, but it does work.  </li>
            <li> IS ITS SOO SMALL</li>
            <li> If there was one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this it would be that its kinda of small</li>
            <li> I ordered the initial kit from proactiv and not only did it make my skin worse, THEY RIPPED ME OFF!!!</li>
            <li> Expensive but works for well to dry up blemishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s less expensive than going to the dermatologist every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I found this out only after receiving the product and reading the label, I then carried it to a pharmacist who gave me the bad news that I had wasted my money.</li>
            <li> at least so they say.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt, she hasnt complained about it</li>
            <li> Disappointed that using it did not help clear blemishes any faster than not using it!</li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> It is expensive ($ per ounce), but I use less of it.</li>
            <li> but it seriously doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Did me no good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the uproar about Proactiv is about lately!  </li>
            <li> Expensive and  its a small bottle, but....</li>
            <li> How do you send me a tube that is completely broken with cream oozing out of it.  </li>
            <li> I had terrible acne all through high school and even worse acne scars moving into college.</li>
            <li> Her acen was very serious before, after using this product for a 4 days, I can tell obviouse changing.</li>
            <li> Please note I have very sensitive skin and at worst it causes peeling</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl and it dried her face out really bad.</li>
            <li> This product arrived as scheduled, but unfortunately, it did nothing to improve my daughter&#x27;s blemishes.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird texture so you can wear it during the day and under makeup.</li>
            <li> This product is not good for acne, as I have not seen results as promised!!</li>
            <li> Sorry to see I had to buy the blemish cream separately.  </li>
            <li> I think it is too expensive</li>
            <li> the second time when I felt a Really nasty under-skin-zit on the side of my nose</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try the proactiv product line but was too chicken to try.  </li>
            <li> it works for my wife whom has suffers from bad blemishes.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to cancel (have to call in and wait on hold forever) and even after I did they sent me another kit, or</li>
            <li> They are unethical and make it nearly impossible to cancel once they have your info.  </li>
            <li> We were really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I am very dirty by the time I get home.</li>
            <li> I hate the  seller relationship.&lt;br /&gt; ,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying but tolerable.</li>
            <li> I hate that!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Warns you to stay out of sun if you are using this product.</li>
            <li> What can I sat this stuff really works!  Better than anything you will get at any store. Little tip don’t buy anything direct from proactive.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s an on the spot treatment which works really well. I don&#x27;t use it that much only when I need it . A powerful product indeed</li>
            <li> Please be aware that this company means to hook you.....once they have your credit card number watch out..................you could be billed for a lot stuff you didn&#x27;t receive !! The product itself is OK, but cheaper ingredients elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work bottom line. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Save your money and buy something else with the same ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li> I have never found anything better for &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; of acne than this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Something starts popping up, I put the proactiv on it overnight, and usually it&#x27;s gone or significantly down by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv has gone from having a manned kiosk in my local mall, to a vending machine. I hate that! I am so happy to be able to buy this product from sellers on amazon.</li>
            <li> Stick a Proactive label on a product and charge three times as much!  The active ingredient in this product is Benzoyl peroxide and many other products including \\&quot;Pernex AC\\&quot; and \\&quot;Panoxyl\\&quot; all contain Benzoyl peroxide and are just as effective at 1/3rd the price.  I found this out only after receiving the product and reading the label, I then carried it to a pharmacist who gave me the bad news that I had wasted my money.</li>
            <li> $20.70 at the kiosks!   works great tho! spot treat 2 or 3 times a day and the blemish disappears in a couple days! you can even spot treat when you feel one coming to the surface and it catches it before you see it. it&#x27;s got 6% benzoyl peroxide, which is a whole lot! in actuality, it&#x27;s a lot more than the 10%, 12%, whatever% that you find at CVS or your local drugstore because it&#x27;s prescription grade medication (very finely milled benzoyl peroxide) which basically means its smaller so it fits into your pores better and can penetrate deeper to fight the bacteria a lot more effectively. :)</li>
            <li> The BEST product for getting rid of pesky pimples in a hurry!</li>
            <li> Works great on single blemishes.</li>
            <li> Great product that works. I have noticed the difference within 3 days after using it. Its a bit price though.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely works, but like another reviewer said, you can get pretty much the same ingredients for less in other products. I like Clean and Clear persa-gel 10.</li>
            <li> Another great product for my son and it really works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was 17 years old (ten years) and I love it! I use Clinque Acne Solutions because my skin works better with that everyday care but I still use this Proactiv product. In fact, my Mom used to steal it from me until I bought her another one today.   It isn&#x27;t going to get rid of the big pimples overnight, but it actually took away some of the pain that comes with it.  I totally recommend giving it a try. It is a little expensive but it lasted me a LONG time, even with my Mom stealing it. haha</li>
            <li> This product is the best out there for spot treatment.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective rapid-spot treatment that I&#x27;ve used. In the past, I tried the Neutrogena counterpart, Clean N Clear, etc., with mediocre results. However, after using the Proactiv solution, my blemishes were noticeably drier and smaller after just a couple of hours. I would highly recommend this if you have one or two troublesome blemishes, as this will shrink them in no time!</li>
            <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Do use all three components of the set if you can. Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li> I had used this product when I was a member of the Pro Activ Club.  I had dropped out of the club because I received more product than I could use.  It is nice to be able to order just one product through Amazon.  This product is very effective, doesn&#x27;t take much of it and lasts a long time.  A good value.</li>
            <li> Works. Just the price is not ok</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time.  Works very well.  The 33% benzol peroxide works great.....but make sure you do not get it on your clothes, towels or sheets.  It will bleach it white!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that the active ingredients in this product are similar to others you can purchase at any local store.  I have adult acne, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  The Proactiv product clears the nastiest pimple overnight instead of over a week.  I&#x27;ll pay more for the quick result every time.</li>
            <li> Seriously?  How do you send me a tube that is completely broken with cream oozing out of it.  It wasn&#x27;t a shipping mistake because the tube was inside of two different boxes.  The back end of the tube&#x27;s seal was completely broken and the cream was almost completely all out. The mask has some kind of greasy oil all over it and I just can&#x27;t believe the quality you would send a customer. Do you not even have a customer quality assurance team?  Obviously not!</li>
            <li> This product will not make blemishes disappear, but it does help control and prevent them.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for well over a year and plan to continue.  That&#x27;s an endorsement.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try the proactiv product line but was too chicken to try.  But since the the product is here u cant tell me nothing....Thanks a bunch!!</li>
            <li> This is very effective in getting pimples dry so they can go away faster. It was affordable and effective, so I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Dries out pimples fast .... Great product !</li>
            <li> This is a very good spot-treatment for pimples that are just starting or are already at the skin&#x27;s surface. I usually use the repairing lotion at night, but there&#x27;s always one or two pimples that seem to sneak through.     This spot treatment will usually dry them up in two days. I&#x27;ve had very good lick with this product. It&#x27;s not as drying as some of the other products on the market, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate surrounding skin like the acne gels.    I have dry skin but I still get occasional breakouts around my mouth and nose, so this is a good product even for someone with dry and sensitive skin. It&#x27;s not suitable for your entire face, though, so you should use the Proactiv repairing lotion for all-over face.     Recommended.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my teenage daughter battle her outbreaks.  With just the Proactiv Skincare System alone, she was still having some hot-spots; however, after using the Blemish Treatment (consistently), she has very few problem areas.  She is on her 3rd tube, and we are going to order 2 boxes next time.  The only issue I have with Proactiv as a company is their practice of making you commit to \\&quot;regularly\\&quot; scheduled deliveries of their products, which is why I shop independent sellers through Amazon even though I have to pay slightly more.</li>
            <li> My son uses this product and finds it to be easy and clearing blemishes nearly overnight. He love it and would advise any one with blemish problems to try this. It works!! Fast!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 6 months. I try to use it twice a day although, when it dries, it appears to leave the skin dry looking if you dont rub it in. I like to apply a nice size dot and leave it. And over about 6 months i dont even see the dark spots on my cheek that at one point bothered me very much. I am going to try the dark spot remover for my newly created dark spots, I&#x27;m hoping to may see faster results.</li>
            <li> I dont know if Im allergic to this stuff, but it does not work at all. It bleaches the skin, your clothes, etc. and makes your blemishes more red and more permanent. This is full of chemicals and it cannot be good for my skin!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product, thank you!!</li>
            <li> It works on my face and I love having clearer skin and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry or rough. Thanks Proactive</li>
            <li> This blemish treatment does work it takes about two days but if you put it on like you are suppose to blemishes do heal fast would recommend</li>
            <li> Before this product, I was using Proactiv which works great, but is on the pricey side. I switched to Acne Free about a year ago. For me, it works just as well as Proactiv and it&#x27;s much cheaper. I also love this package of \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; sizes. These are much bigger sizes than the Proactiv bottles. If you are looking for something similar to Proactiv, give this a try.</li>
            <li> Works fine. I don&#x27;t think it works any better than some of the other OTC products. If the price is right I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the initial kit from proactiv and not only did it make my skin worse, THEY RIPPED ME OFF!!! It is almost impossible to cancel (have to call in and wait on hold forever) and even after I did they sent me another kit, or at least so they say.  I moved from the address, which is one of many reasons I canceled my \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; and yet I received a letter from a shady collection agency (SKO Brenner American) saying I owe $67.89...... Tried calling proactiv and of course they could not help.  Do yourself a favor and save your time, money, and skin.  STAY AWAY from proactiv!!</li>
            <li> Great delivery time and great product!</li>
            <li> This product arrived as scheduled, but unfortunately, it did nothing to improve my daughter&#x27;s blemishes.  We were really disappointed.  We will find something else that will work to clear up her skin.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well at all.  However, it may simply be that it&#x27;s not what I actually needed.</li>
            <li> This blemish treatment product works alright.  It helps dry out a pimple but it doesn&#x27;t work for every pimple.  The price is a bit high considering how little product you get.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it but I probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I&#x27;d recommend using a very tiny amount on spots and not slathering it on, though, or it won&#x27;t last very long!</li>
            <li> THIS GOT RID OF ALL MY ACNE IM SO HAPPY IT DIDNT DRY AND  MAKE MY SKIN PEEL IT WORKED OVER NIGHT I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE SATISFIED!!!</li>
            <li> I havnt seen much of any improvement on any of my sudden pimples . Kinda disappointed.  It was worth a shot I guess</li>
            <li> My daughter started using this product and her face cleared up really fast!!!! Happy daughter makes a very happy mom</li>
            <li> Did me no good.  Go to the pharmacy.  Ask for benzoyl peroxide.  It comes in a large tube for $5.  It will make your zits flake off after one night...just put a large dab on.  Then moisturize with trader joes vitamin e oil (3.99).  It will get rid of all your scars and help with acne while it moisturizes.  Don&#x27;t spend money on this.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, it works!  Make sure you have coco butter or something to lighten the affected area it will become a lil dark once it has dried out.</li>
            <li> This is great at spot treating blemishes. It goes away in a day. Two days max. This has been a life savor.</li>
            <li> Works in 12 hours I will go to bed with a blemish and wake up and it will be gone</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the uproar about Proactiv is about lately!  It didn&#x27;t dry my acne problem as proclaimed on all of the TV commericals!</li>
            <li> When I feel that I have a pimple coming on, or there is one, I put some of this on it and it seems to go away or stop from forming quicker than if I were to just leave it.  The only downfall is that I wish that it came in a larger tube.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work. Plain &amp; simple, it was like lighting a firecracker w/ no sparks. Nothing their used for days &amp; no results.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and product really works! I would recommend this to my friends. You don&#x27;t have to buy this product through Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Obviously this product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but it works very well for my skin. It gets rid of the blemishes very quickly and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I guess it works. It isn&#x27;t fantastic. Also, just like all the other proactive stuff, it bleached everything. It doesn&#x27;t really dry out the skin so that is a nice thing.</li>
            <li> This is a magic little tube top help blemishes go away. I love the fast results, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> All the hype-its all advertising&lt;br /&gt;Forget it.&lt;br /&gt;This product simply doesnt work as least for me and my facial blemishes.</li>
            <li> Proactive always works great.  I order on line only when I cannot get to the mall to purchase directly.  And very often online offers more than what is available at the mall.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this item a lot. It is very effective and works quickly. I would recommend this for any age and problem with acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product before and within a week of using it I noticed a change in my skin. Within 2 weeks others were commenting on the improvement in my skin.  Shipping was fast and product was as promised</li>
            <li> I have used other Proactiv products in the past with some success but this one just does not cut it.  I think the Clearsil brand works a lot better in this case.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything to clear up the outbreak faster (if at all).  Don&#x27;t waste your money--get a cheaper brand that works.</li>
            <li> I have tried other spot acne creams and they do not seem to work that well. Frankly I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the cream that ends up working or just inevitably the acne goes away. After much trial and error with others, I decided to try the Proactive brand. I was hesitant to do so since I tried Proactive in the past and it did nothing for me. It has been about a week now that I have used this and it has worked really well. I put it on at night after washing my face and in the morning I notice a difference. I would say for some acne it is gone in a day and other maybe two. Either way, it has worked really well compared to other major brands I&#x27;ve tried. It is expensive ($ per ounce), but I use less of it. I recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s o.k. I used proactive before and its sort of a hit or miss with me. Sometimes it works really well and sometimes I still get breakouts.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with the proactive system but this spot treatment actually works really well. I use it every night before bed and can feel the difference in the morning.</li>
            <li> not really that great. the refining mask works so much better to make my skin feel a lot smoother, but it smells like hot garbage. i tried to replace it with this stuff but it seriously doesn&#x27;t work. i&#x27;ve tried it on acne bumps that were just starting to form under the skin and then on surfaced spots too and it didn&#x27;t do anything. i&#x27;ve had better luck with cheaper store bought blemish treatments.</li>
            <li> This product works well with the Solution. The blemishes cleared up. I would recommend this product to anyone with blemish problems.</li>
            <li> so so. doesn&#x27;t seen to be powerful enough for me. on the upside, it doesnt dry the skin out like some do.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY as promised!!!  THANK YOU so very much. I would look to do business once again!!!! Happy New Year to you....</li>
            <li> Works awesome and it works i get blemishes I was using Orgins  and was not working  first try and it work right away</li>
            <li> Grand daughter beginning to get some signs of acne on cheeks. Worked great! She is pre teen and was highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great Solution!!  Will be buying more because it really works and I will be buying&lt;br /&gt;the other products as well!!</li>
            <li> Great Product, very easy to use. Would recommend and purchase it again in the future.  Saw improvement in seven days of use</li>
            <li> I have never had anything work on my face so well and so quickly! I was so surprised and happy!</li>
            <li> Similar items sell for a sixth of the price at any drugstore and are just as effective as this one. Disappointed that using it did not help clear blemishes any faster than not using it!</li>
            <li> For my niece who asked for it because of TV ads.  It works no better than other less costly products.Lot of hype.</li>
            <li> Better than most topical creams.  I give it an 8 for speediness in clearing up blemishes.  Would recommend it to people.</li>
            <li> Still looking for something cheaper than Origins spot remover at $15 a bottle that works anywhere near as well without drying face...the search continues.  This was not much better than the OTC stuff</li>
            <li> Great product. small and convenient.</li>
            <li> I bought better stuff at Rite Aid. This was a waste of money. You pay for the name not the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  Have been buying it for years.</li>
            <li> I think this spot treatment works. I like that it is clear on and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird texture so you can wear it during the day and under makeup. It doesn&#x27;t dry all of my acne out as quickly as I like but it does make the whole process happen quicker than if I did nothing a let nature take its course. I do use this during the day and a sulfur one at night and I like the way that works. Most whiteheads I can get to go away in 3-5 days doing that and the cystic ones come to a head quicker (2-4 days) and then I can &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; on them to then go away completely so all in all about a week for those. It doesn&#x27;t really burn unless the pimple is open because I poppped it.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints. Happy with purchase. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again because of the price and there are cheaper BP spot treatments with the same concentration of BP that I want to try. But this product came quickly and was packaged appropriately. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Not bad, small, yet a little goes a long way. Use sparingly and it will last. Much cheaper than the proactive company offers. I suggest ordering a few. It is a deal to invest in. This particular product works best when used regularly during breakouts.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  It works well and quickly.</li>
            <li> Consistency works best with this product</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work that good</li>
            <li> I had always seen the TV ads for Proactiv and I would shake my head and think who would spend all that money on a subscription service. So when I saw this on Amazon, as a single item and saw all of the glowing reviews I had to give it a try, and let me say it was a very good decision. After putting it on 3 of my pimples before bed I awoke to find all 3 dried up, and within 48 hours (of 2 treatments a day) they were all nearly 90% gone! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  In a matter of a few days this product completely healed my blemishes.  It&#x27;s the only product I will be using in the future.</li>
            <li> Ok, gave it to my teenage niece.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to buying the whole kit next time we make a purchase.  Great product at a low cost item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt, she hasnt complained about it so Im assuming it served its purpose.</li>
            <li> NICE ITEM, AS DESCRIBED, WORKS GOOD, A+++</li>
            <li> Wonderful! It is the most useful product to anti blemish i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Who do I write to  about never getting this?... I got the other proactiv stuff,  haven&#x27;t used it yet because I cannot read the directions I think this is  about the end of my relationship with AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s been nice...  but this isn&#x27;t the first time  I was  dissapointed. I hate the  seller relationship.&lt;br /&gt; ,</li>
            <li> Really good product, and I get on time, nice price.</li>
            <li> Works great for my granddaughter for spot treatment, great price , came as expected</li>
            <li> Was as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original version of this product as well as the new Advanced version. This spot treatment works OK for me, but I have used various other products that are not only more effective, but much less-expensive. As the User Reviews here (and elsewhere) show, Proactiv Advanced Blemish Treatment works well for some people, but does not work nearly as well for others. While it may be a product worth trying, due to the high price &amp; the good availability of highly-effective acne products (many available right here, on Amazon), my personal advice is to try a few other products before shelling out the cash for Proactiv&#x27;s Advanced Blemish Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is one thing about acne/pimples I have come to realize, it is that no single product works well for everyone. Our body chemistries are seemingly different enough so that certain acne treatments work miracles for some people, while that exact same treatment does not work at all for others. Proactiv is probably the most well-known acne treatment system on the planet. They have many commercials, celebrity endorsements, mall kiosks, and even vending machines to sell their products. However, the most important underlying question is how well do Proactiv products work? From what I have gathered, they work amazingly well for some, reasonably well for some others, and poorly/not at all for others. It also seems that Proactiv works best with mild and mild-moderate blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Blemish Treatment, which is intended for usage on small areas as a &amp;#34;spot treatment,&amp;#34; uses Benzyl Peroxide as the primary active ingredient at a concentration of 6%. That concentration is a middle-of-the-road strength (some products have more, some less.) It also contains a variety of moisturizers which are designed NOT to clog pores. However, it does contain alcohol, and the specific alcohol used (SD Alcohol 40) can cause dryness and skin irritation for some (it did not for me, personally.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usage for this product is for occasional pimples that break out, sometimes in small clusters. The Advanced Blemish Treatment is easy to use, does not really burn much, and its moisturizers do not clog pores to make the original blemish worse (or cause additional blemishes.) And while it does speed the recovery process for me somewhat, it&#x27;s not dramatically faster healing. Also, it isn&#x27;t all that effective in rapidly reducing scarring. Does Advanced Blemish Treatment work any better than buying generic Benzyl Peroxide cream? I personally don&#x27;t think it does, or at least the differences are very minor, but the cost differences are major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can purchase this quantity of Benzyl Peroxide @ 10% concentration as a generic cream for under $1 (on Amazon and elsewhere), and mix it with the moisturizers they already know works the best for their own skin (for me that is Vanicream, Cetaphil, or CeraVe.) Additionally, Advanced Blemish Treatment is priced about the same as the high-strength (20% - 35%+ concentration) of salicylic acid or salicylic acid &amp; lactic acid gel peels, which can also be used for spot treatments and are much more effective than the Advanced Blemish Treatment (search &amp;#34;Salicylic Acid Gel Peel&amp;#34; here on Amazon and compare the User Reviews.) That makes it difficult for me to recommend this product, and so I recommend trying a few other products prior to this.is product is for occasional pimples that break out, sometimes in small clusters.

            <li> Thank you for the prompt service. This product is great.</li>
            <li> the stuff seems to work but not to great, the package and everything was good. but the tube it came in is extremely small and ya don&#x27;t get all that much. so check it out if it works for you great. i might have to try some different products by this company.</li>
            <li> Expensive but works for well to dry up blemishes.</li>
            <li> Small tube. Works Amazing</li>
            <li> This product is the best!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 days in a row, multiple times a day and it is doing nothing to help the large under the skin &amp;#34;blemish&amp;#34; I have trying to pop through. I rarely get any acne and I had this and thought, wow, I&#x27;m sure this will clear it right up! But, no. Normally acne medications burn, and the fact that this doesn&#x27;t even burn or even tingle makes me feel like I&#x27;m just rubbing lotion on my face. Does not dry anything out or make the skin peel like other acne medicines so I wonder how it is working.</li>
            <li> I have a mature skin but get occasional out breaks on my cheeks. This product definitely dries them up but I found a little dab will do it. More is not better! recommend.</li>
            <li> This product hasn&#x27;t helped even a little. Gave it one star since zero is not an option.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage children.  It works well to clear up blemishes in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> I order this item over and over - wouldn&#x27;t be without it!  And I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;senior citizen&amp;#34; - it works!</li>
            <li> This blemish treatment is amazing!  It kills pimples immediately.  I&#x27;ve used it twice now and after applying it overnight the next morning the pimple(s) were gone.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I was having breakouts during my pregnancy. Naturally, skin is more oily and when pregnant there are only certain products recommended.  This product really helped keep my skin clear.  I  would recommend it pregnant or not!</li>
            <li> It helped me pretty good. You have to try it first to see if it works for you or not. I used it along with other proactive products, the 3 step cleaning stuff. After using it for two months my face is finally look like ... well face.</li>
            <li> I started using this to give me some insurance for a nice clear face before my wedding - 2 days after I began using I broke out worse than I ever have before sooooooo don&#x27;t waste your money. I should add that I usually have pretty clear skin</li>
            <li> The wife had a problem with her &amp;#34;complexion&amp;#34; a few months back and ordered this and the Revitalizing Toner.  It did make a difference for her, but she was still getting new pimples.  She bought the Neutragena 3-piece kit and liked it better. I&#x27;m no expert so please be polite.... I&#x27;m just the messenger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Proactiv products before and have found them to work, but not to be as great as the informacials make it appear. I ordered this product for the first time recently and am amazed at how great it works. The day I received the product, I felt a deep and under the skin zit growing on my cheek. I applied this product three times and the zip rapidly dried up and was almost gone within 24 hours. It dries up acne better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, even prescription strength. Great for spot treating those deep and troublesome pimples that are hard to get rid of. I will continue to use this product and make sure I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> This product is truly a miracle worker. Especially if you do not have bad skin but just get that one breakout and want to cover that area the clear it up. It works so fast. Typically if I need to I put it on in the evenin  ven if I suspect a slight blemish an it is gone beore I know it by a.m. If I have to reapply it is just to be sure plus it is clear and does not dry skin out or interfere with make-up or wash regime. This item is so HOT that my whole family is always borrowing one or asking me.. So I often need to reorder. The price here is great .. half the amount of a kiosk or a member. Would recommend this to anyone at any age group.</li>
            <li> This product is very overpriced and undersized, just like all Proactiv products. They sort of work for awhile, but they aren&#x27;t worth all that money. There are natural and cheaper alternatives, such as toothpaste for blemishes.</li>
            <li> Does NOT work, its very plausible the other reviews for this product have been finessed and are not authentic. After reading what I thought were authentic positive reviews I decided to try this product. This was my first and last time buying something from proactive. This product does nothing. i decided to try this out after my differing gel ran out. Differin gel works amazing, but unfortunately my current insurance does not cover the cost of the prescription, which is $250 out of pocket! So I tried this hoping it would at least be half as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sum up this review, proactive does NOT work and this product was a complete waste of money. If you closely look at their adverts you can see that the people used for &#x27;before-after&#x27; testimonials are wearing heavy duty concealer and other makeup.</li>
            <li> little small and need to buy for using&lt;br /&gt;look same with pic&lt;br /&gt;got it on time&lt;br /&gt;not work quick but is good</li>
            <li> I purchased the $29.95 trial pack from Proactive for my teen-aged son.  Not only did it not work well, it took me nearly three months and dozens of phone calls to cancel my \\&quot;introductory\\&quot; offer.  I finally had to lock them out of my PayPal account to keep them from taking more more money.  I ended up paying $119.90 for two boxes of their product that does not work.  I finally was able to cancel the account, but ended up paying over twice as much as they advertise for half the product.  They are unethical and make it nearly impossible to cancel once they have your info.  Avoid Proactiv as it doesn&#x27;t work and they are crooks.</li>
            <li> Expensive and  its a small bottle, but....it works for my wife whom has suffers from bad blemishes. But she has to use the rest of the proactiv steps 1-3 for this to work.</li>
            <li> This product is not good for acne, as I have not seen results as promised!! I would not recommend this product, not worth the price!! You can buy clearasil and thats cheaper and it works!!  I thought this product would work better, but I was totally wrong!! :(&lt;br /&gt;So, I switched back to my original clearasil!!</li>
            <li> This product was misrepresented as the Proactiv Dark Spot corrector! It doesn&#x27;t even work for its intended purpose. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting your money on this!</li>
            <li> This is smaller and less effective than the old invisible acne treatment. I bought this hoping it would be like the old formula, but it&#x27;s not and it&#x27;s much smaller.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, and the other Proactiv products quite frequently. They do seem to work pretty well, but just a little word ahead - when using the Proactiv products, you have to keep up with it. They all say use twice a day, at night before bed, and in the morning. I have noticed that if you don&#x27;t keep with the routine, you will break out even more than you did before. I tend to break out a lot right around a certain time a month, and Proactiv has helped heal some of those break outs. It dries it up quickly, and they scab over a coarse of two to three days. But like I said, if you skip a day - more pimples will pop up! It&#x27;s great if you can keep it up, though. The only problem I have had with it is it doesn&#x27;t help clear the acne scars. I am very fair skinned, and once my pimples have healed and went away, it does leave dark spots, and I&#x27;m just finding myself putting on lots of make up to hide them. I would love something to correct those as well!</li>
            <li> Found proactiv works if you are faithful in the regiment.  Sorry to see I had to buy the blemish cream separately.  I think it is too expensive so I don&#x27;t buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of pimples.Works Good. Its compact. You only need to use a small amount of it . I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love Proactive products. Works very well on blemishes.  Dries them up fast. I like this item. ( can&#x27;t think of anything else)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s like a little tube of miracles. I am currently out of it and need to purchase more. But it only takes a tiny bit and BAM the next day your zit is gone. I love it. Please buy this if your looking to get rid of a bothersome zit.</li>
            <li> This dries out the acne and is a very good product. I highly recommend this product. Make sure and wash your hands after applying it though.</li>
            <li> It is really great!I have used more expensive products but they do not measure up to Proactive.The reults are almost immediate!!!</li>
            <li> Magically amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;My face was clean until I started facing this acne torture. This product is just amazing because as soon as you come to know or start feeling a tingling sensation under your skin, immediately apply this and wait for few hours. Boom.... it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;I started using Proactiv 3 step treatment recently but this (Proactiv Solution Advanced Blemish Treatment) product took me by surprise. I used Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Vanishing Acne Treatment, which works as well but Proactiv is way smoother and once it dries up it even fades the redness or scar color.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say that this works 101% on preventing acne/pimples to pop on your skin. Curing an existing pimple is a pain and time consuming task. This is all from experience. You only need little portion of this treatment to cover the affected area and so this tube lasts for a while though the quantity is less. This is not a moisturizer that you have to apply it all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;Remember, prevention is better than cure. Go for it...</li>
            <li> I like the mask better.  It works better</li>
            <li> this stuff is great... zaps away blemishes</li>
            <li> bottle is pretty small for the price, but it does work</li>
            <li> I will never be without this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and see likes it but wish the tube was a little bit bigger other wise no problems.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before I love it but gets enpensive so I try to order it every 3 to 6 months so I only use it when I get a blemish...... but again I love it would love it even more if it was just a little cheaper :-)</li>
            <li> We ordered it for our seventeen year old son and within days of using his face started to clear up. Works great!</li>
            <li> I recently started a new medication that caused breakouts.  Although the pimples/acne gradually disappeared, I was left with skin discoloration where the pimples used to be.  This product reduced the discoloration/redness after a couple of treatments.  It doesn&#x27;t take a large amount to apply - use sparingly.  I highly recommend this product! :-)</li>
            <li> Good but drying - will buy again to replace dermo rx. i put sparingly on whole face every other day</li>
            <li> Proactiv delivers again w/effective acne treatments.  While I&#x27;m older (45), and don&#x27;t use Proactiv cleansing system on my skin regularly, this spot treatment works wonders on my teenagers, and on my occasional peri-menopausal break outs</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s face has completely cleared up in such a short time, I could see a huge difference in just a few days! Highly recommend for teenage acne!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help at all I didn&#x27;t see results at all don&#x27;t recamend it at all</li>
            <li> Great product! Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend! It does exactly what it says it does. I will be ordering more when I run out. I love it!</li>
            <li> Proactive helps! It treats all kinds of adult acne. This cream is better for random breakouts for on the spot blemish treatment.</li>
            <li> I recommend this production, though I cannot see much difference on my face, but to my daughter, her face is much better than before. Her acen was very serious before, after using this product for a 4 days, I can tell obviouse changing.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and was really disappointed. Nothing great about this stuff. Works about as good or maybe even worse than over the counter spot treatments.</li>
            <li> Nuff said.  I guess we are all paying for the brand name.  It seems in recent years, retailers have eliminated many of the acne medication thanks to concerns about it&#x27;s effect on pregnancies.  As a result, companies like Proactiv can jack up prices thanks to demand.</li>
            <li> I It does the job as descibe in the product description. I love this product it treats acne and promotes clear appearance. I would definitely recommend this product for persons who are dealing with facial blemishes due to acnes and blackheads.</li>
            <li> If it for me I dont write nothing to this people they said in the page the product was shipped but at this day I dont have NOTHING I woul try to contact the seller with message through Amazon but they NOT ANSWER my messages, I paid the product but dont have it....</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just my skin but this product did not do anything for me even after a month of use</li>
            <li> my son puts this on a pimple and it is gone.  this little tube really works.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure it has not expired.  that is the one thing about proactive products.  If they have expired they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it worked great, but I guess my body got used to the product because it does not work so well for me anymore. Still good product, not good for long time use.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it was supposed to do and great price</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and FAST!</li>
            <li> Got 2 tubes noticed one expires in a few mo. The other in a yr. Was very smooth at 1st now 1/2 way through tube becoming gritty. Works well though!</li>
            <li> Pro activ didn&#x27;t really work for my daughter. She ended up consulting a dermatologist who prescribed medication that is working much better. Surprisingly, the prescription medication is a LOT cheaper than is Proactive!</li>
            <li> This product works fast and works well.  Apply conservatively as it can also dry out surrounding skin</li>
            <li> Very good product for blemishes or acne.</li>
            <li> Best anti acne product. A little goes a long way. Opens pores and medication soaks in and dissolves trapped dirt and oil. Rids you of black heads in 2-3 days every time. I have been using this product for years and it never fails. i highly recommend it. Please note I have very sensitive skin and at worst it causes peeling but nothing more. The latter resolves within a day sooner with moisterizer. best of the proactive products available. it really works!</li>
            <li> My son controls his acne well with this product. I would have given it 5 stars if the tube was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> my kids love proactiv+ as it really helps their skin to be free from spots, where other products have failed</li>
            <li> I had terrible acne all through high school and even worse acne scars moving into college. Luckily, I started purchasing this product to help me with my deep, dark blemishes. I thought maybe this wasn&#x27;t as effective as I thought, so, I gave it a break for a few weeks. I noticed that the acne scars were darker and stayed longer when I didn&#x27;t use this product. Now, when I have a breakout, I apply this treatment immediately to start the healing process. My skin is much clearer now and remains that way for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this, I have really patchy combination skin and it helps to gently treat all areas of my face without drying or irritation. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Awesome solution for acne ---- my fiancé uses this along with the full daily proactive line in his daily regimen - we will continue to purchase from here in the future when replacement needed- Thank You</li>
            <li> Need a bigger size it came in a small boxes didn&#x27;t like that, but seem ok so far. Great  product</li>
            <li> Good for overnight zit or pimple size reduction. Not over powering. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin. Only requires a drop for effective treatment.</li>
            <li> I rate it as good product and hope everyone else will use this product .  This product is a good product to have on hand each day to use</li>
            <li> purchased as a Christmas present . receiver was  very pleased with product and I was very pleased with price would recommend</li>
            <li> A great product for dealing with stress zits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels good, but I&#x27;m not sure if it really works or if its the Proactiv I use that&#x27;s working.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get this again.</li>
            <li> Picked this up for a member of the family. Shipped fast. Does it work? No clue but last time I seen her she had few pimples and her hair was green</li>
            <li> I had heard mixed reviews on Proactiv for clear skin. However, my teenage daughter has had excellent luck with this product. It has been very effective and gentler on her skin. It&#x27;s pricey, but buying it through Amazon has helped.</li>
            <li> This product is really good for spot treating acne.  It&#x27;s expensive for the tiny tube, but it does work.  Zits are eliminated pretty fast because the product really dries out the skin (like alcohol times 10).  Peeling skin is expected with the dryness.  It&#x27;s annoying but tolerable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the teens and find myself reaching for it when something pops up. Works fast! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I read some mixed reviews on this product but when I speak to people who say this product doesnt work (or any proactive product) I come to discover that they dont use it properly or AT ALL and expect results. Like anything, you must follow the directions and give it a little time. I have tried every product, prescriptions and otc, to help my son&#x27;s severe acne. Proactive worked, and it was the only one that actually did work. It&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s less expensive than going to the dermatologist every two weeks. (co-pays and prescriptions cost a fortune).&lt;br /&gt;Proactive works.. but it can&#x27;t jump out of your medicine cabinet and onto your face :)</li>
            <li> I use this regularly for my daughter&#x27;s acne flair-ups.. was buying it for retail price in the mall- almost twice as much! Glad I checked Amazon...</li>
            <li> bought this for my 17 year old grand daughter.  Also bought her the entire system. So far she has only used the advanced blemish treatment. She doesn&#x27;t live near me so I haven&#x27;t  seen the results, but she said it is wonderful. Works quickly with great results.</li>
            <li> AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF A PIMPLE I APPLY THIS STUFF AND ..POOF! GONE. HOWEVER CAN BE OVER DRYING SO USE SPARINGLY.</li>
            <li> I was a proactiv customer for years. As my skin aged I needed a different product line. But I still get an occasional pimple at 60!  So I&#x27;m happy I can purchase this separately</li>
            <li> this works better than the whole proactiv wash kit.  i&#x27;ll continue buying this. only gave 4 starts because doesnt rid the acne just tames it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good but not the AMAZING solution it is purported to be - works about 60% of the time or a bit less.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about trying this product because I have sensitive skin.  This product did what it was suppose to do and I&#x27;m very pleased with the outcome.  This product brought the few pimples I had to a head and then worked on clearing them.  I Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really dry up the breakouts I got from using the OUI Vitamin C serum. I went back to my old clearasil. Healed faster.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl and it dried her face out really bad. Not sure if its just not the right solution for her skin type or what. Used proactiv products before but this one was just not for her</li>
            <li> Great for breakouts no matter your age.</li>
            <li> gift for my daughter, she loves the product!</li>
            <li> Many applications work. Hot towel needed in between.</li>
            <li> Works well and does what it says it will do! Works almost INSTANTLY!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Excellent product. Thank you ;)</li>
            <li> The first time i used it one my face I didn&#x27;t see much difference in the length of my breakout but the second time when I felt a Really nasty under-skin-zit on the side of my nose I immediately put that on for two nights after I washed my face each night and the zit didn&#x27;t even come though!!! Thoroughly pleased with this product!!! DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!! Don&#x27;t doubt yourself on this!</li>
            <li> I have a pretty clear complexion but who doesn&#x27;t get a occasional blemish? This is the ONLY product I have ever used that has successfully cleared up those annoying blemishes almost completely overnight! Amazing!</li>
            <li> its great to treat those spot pimples...pretty much works overnight. would recommend to use with the proactiv face wash...over all great buy.</li>
            <li> IS ITS SOO SMALL YOU CANT GET A GOOD USE TO SEE IF THE PRODUCT REALL WORKS, SO BUY A FEW IF YOU WANT TO SEE RESULTS</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 17 yr old son.  He was having trouble with his acne using treatment products from the store, they just were not working.  This cleared up his acne quickly and is keeping it gone.  He is a very happy camper.</li>
            <li> It works for blemishes.  I was looking for on the spot treatment for when my time of month comes around and it really helped.</li>
            <li> It sure worked for me. My acne on my back has gone!</li>
            <li> i gave this product 5 stars because it works great and does what it is made to do ,we will recomend this pruduct to any one who needs it.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t do much at all. My acne isn&#x27;t that bad, but when I felt one coming up, I thought this would help zap it - and it most definitely didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have acne bc of medication I take. In two years I have only been able to maintain partially clear skin. I have had this product 3 days and my problem areas are almost clear. As far as other reviews about the price if you have true acne you&#x27;ve already spent hundreds on products that just don&#x27;t work. This work&#x27;s and fast no need to wait weeks for results.  If you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t find anything past maintaining semi clear skin buy this product.</li>
            <li> This was something I bought along with the Proactiv set, this stuff really works. It doesn&#x27;t take much. But be sure to wash your hands after applying this and don&#x27;t use colored towels as it leaves a stain on them , I use a q-tip now to apply with no worries</li>
            <li> The advance blemish treatment works great on getting rid of big and small pimples. However if you want to see fast result  then its recommended to use it three times a day. Another thing about this is that it will dry out your face quickly so you should only just use it on pimple and not your whole face. I would also get the Proactiv green tea moisturizer with it too. If there was one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this it would be that its kinda of small and I wish it was bigger because I run out of it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I am a 48 year old female who really never had acne or zitts. At this point in my life I have started getting HUGE volcano like zitts on my chin. I had about 7 large zitts on my chin that wouldnt go away with any other product. I saw a commercial for this treatment on TV on night and decided to order it. I wrote a review after using it for about 4-5 days. I saw a big improvement. Now I am updating my review because its been about 2 weeks and ALL of my zitts are gone on my chin. I am still using the cream every morning and night to keep everything at bay until I know the zitts are gone for good. This product really does work, just like the commericals claim. I was skeptical since I am older, but it worked and it has kept on working. Give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> So far, it doesn&#x27;t work on well grown acne and the medication is not as strong as it needs to be.  On smaller acne it takes a couple of days to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Blemish treatment seems to be the best product out of all of the Proactiv products I&#x27;ve tried. Last minute, makes blemishes disappear within a day.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product for treat an adult acne it made acne worts...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it did NOTHING. In the past I had been very happy with Proactiv products, thus this is way I had faith this product would live up to the same standards as past products it did no such thing and money was wasted. People keep your money don&#x27;t purchase.</li>
            <li> Results take way too long, shipping was great but the product its self is not very affective... I would suggest a different brand of blemish treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would help like the rest of the Proactiv Products do. I work in a mill and I am very dirty by the time I get home. This product didn&#x27;t help one bit. Maybe it would for someone who doesn&#x27;t work where they are always covered in grime, but it didn&#x27;t stand up to what I needed it to.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  This really zaps the zits! It cleared the acne in just a few days and left my skin blemish free.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of a pimple within like 2 days! Super strong and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin! Love it, smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant and goes on clear. Definite buy again!</li>
            <li> Dried my pimples after 3 days. I use it often when l get breakouts and will continue to use it on a regular now. Love!</li>
            <li> We have been so please overall with ALL proactiv products. They work extremely well and we will be purchasing them again in the future.</li>
            <li> I had been using the dark spot corrector for a couple months already and noticed more of a difference after using this product than I did the dark spot corrector. I would recommend this product to anyone who has spots or blemishes that they are trying to get rid of. This stuff is GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping - got this for my son and it works great - helps to clear up those unexpected blemishes that pop out now and then used along with the Proactive Micro-Crystal Acne Kit.</li>
