            <li>Love the hempz body wash scent - Pomegranate is my favorite right now.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant and sometimes strong smells are overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is hands down one of the best body washes I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I do like the product just fine.</li>

            <li>I really love the lotion and thought it would be as good, but it just seemed like any other body wash.</li>
            <li>But nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Lovely product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>so this will last a while and is a good value.</li>

            <li> Liked it, didn&#x27;t love it. I really love the lotion and thought it would be as good, but it just seemed like any other body wash.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Soft on your skin, smells good and lots of bubbles.  I can&#x27;t keep enough stocked in my house!</li>
            <li> Love the hempz body wash scent - Pomegranate is my favorite right now.  Keep up the great products</li>
            <li> Just ok overpriced, but I did like the aroma, I felt like it cost too much money for the product, not by the seller, by the manufacturer</li>
            <li> It is soft feeling and light smell. I am pregnant and sometimes strong smells are overwhelming. This is perfect for me.  It is my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t suds up as much as I would like.  I love the smell and I do like the product just fine.</li>
            <li> this product smells so good I could eat it! I bought 2 and I will definitely order again!!! I really love it!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.will most likely buy some more stuff later. We bought this item 3 times all ready. So it must be good.</li>
            <li> Love the smell...i also buy the lotion and use daily</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s great</li>

            <li> But nothing special.  Just like any other body wash you can buy at Walgreens.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best body washes I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am a self-proclaimed body wash snob and used Bath and Body Works washes exclusively.  However, I am now converted to Hempz!  I live in a very dry climate and naturally have horribly dry skin.  I barely even need to use lotion after washing with this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out nearly as much as the BBW products would.  Great buy and this scent in particular is one of the best!  You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday before I go tanning. amazing I couldn&#x27;t possibly be any happier with this body wash.</li>
            <li> Its an OK body wash. There are certainly better options out there. The scent smells a little more like alcohol than I would like and the gel doesn&#x27;t do much for moisture. I love the pomegranate lotion but this misses the mark. I&#x27;ll use the tube, but I won&#x27;t being buying again.</li>
            <li> I says it&#x27;s okay it feels like a regular body wash.  no complaints as long as my body is clean.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash!  It smells amazing and really moisturizes my dry skin.  I want to try the other scents now!</li>
            <li> The body wash is great stuff especially If you also use the sugar scrub. The body was is vey sudsy and smells great. Wish I could find a local store and try different scents.</li>
            <li> Really love the smell of this stuff. Its gentle and lathers well!!! But once you&#x27;ve rinsed, the smell is gone. You&#x27;d have to use the lotion.</li>
            <li> After using this shower gel, your skin becomes very soft and gentle. Light and unobtrusive smell is staying on the skin a long time.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this stuff.  It smells amazing and leaves my skin nice and soft.  I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I have used Hempz products since I discovered then.  The Pomegranate Herbal Body Wash works well for alleviating dry skin</li>
            <li> Lovely product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves my skin smooth</li>
            <li> love it love it just love the smell of it would buy it again and again and again thanks great buy it was</li>
            <li> The scent is nice enough, a tad strong while in use, but is much softer and appealing after you towel off.We live as green as we can afford to, and this product has some ingredients I am not crazy about. I doubt I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels great. Leaves the skin smooth and smelling great. It is concentrated so not much is needed so this will last a while and is a good value.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more moisterizing than what it was.  I didn&#x27;t dry my skin out but it didn&#x27;t make it feel soft and smooth afterwards.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell either.  I love the body cream so I thought I&#x27;d really like the body wash.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
