            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>But I love it.</li>
            <li>I started using this on my eyebrows because I wanted to make sure I don&#x27;t have any reaction to it and see how it worked before I started on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>In a cute bottle.</li>
            <li>color is perfect for a blonde............</li>
            <li>Thank you. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>For some people it may work better than others in May</li>
            <li>I love make up...</li>
            <li>and this growth serum.... makes my eyelash thicker and more shiny</li>
            <li>So I thought, it should be OK.  </li>
            <li>Would love an explanation for the discrepancy.</li>
            <li>They seem to come out a lot more too.</li>
            <li>Also i have a lot more eye boogies in the morning after I use this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am sure this will be on of my go to things and can&#x27;t wait for 2-3 weeks to pass</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 3 - 4 weeks now and find it to be ok.</li>
            <li>I truly was hoping for more growth in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I get this level from using just castor oil and better than this for using the mascaras that offer grwoth stimulation for eyelashes.</li>
            <li>okay....</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simple to use, no negative side effects and beautiful lashes as a result.</li>
            <li>I can see my lashes getting thicker and they are seem to be getting longer but will need more time using this product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure product has does before applying mascara or eye liner.</li>
            <li>I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion...</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this Eyelash growth serum.</li>
            <li>particular serum is great because it is much more affordable than Latisse and extensions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to keep using this product.</li>
            <li>Most important there  has been no irritation to either my lashes or brow area.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily, very smooth, and it feels cool gliding on.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and didn&#x27;t cause my eyes any irritation.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with the applicator.</li>
            <li>It applied easily, did not bother my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to apply and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all.</li>
            <li>Easy application!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really easy to put on but it did burn my eyes when it leaked in one time.  </li>
            <li>This serum is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to slip into any bag and carry around with you all day.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t perceive any strong odor.</li>
            <li>but I am fine with it.  </li>
            <li>The pointed brush makes applying the serum easy and precise onto the lash line.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is  super cute.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and am very pleased with my results so far.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my eyelashes already</li>
            <li>This product is light and doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product for free for review, this did not bias my review.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I did follow the instruction and applied a light amount nightly</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy to see this product is different.</li>
            <li>i have long beautiful lashes now</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a good quality/value eyelash growth serum and so far this seems quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li>but the ArtNaturals Best EyeLash made them look not only normal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on day 6 now of using product and lashes are significantly longer and &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited,</li>
            <li>I am excited to see the difference in a month.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so excited I received my package on Friday.</li>
            <li>it is more pricey, but it works better for me - no side effects, and I have seen better results after only 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>but I am thinking that was because I had just washed my face clean.</li>
            <li>On the bright side its very easy to apply and as long as you don&#x27;t put too much to get in your eye it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to update later with more results because this is really important to me.  </li>
            <li>It will irritate your eyeball if you get any in there (have to be sure you don&#x27;t have too much product on the brush when you go to apply).  </li>
            <li>If you love longer eyelashes like me I highly recommend you this product!</li>
            <li>Good product - does help eyelashes grow with daily use for 4-6 weeks!</li>
            <li>Will buy again at full price.</li>
            <li>The lashes were always somewhat full but this serum makes them look comely fuller.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving it.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to the full effects yet</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love thick, beautiful lashes?</li>
            <li>It can be easy to make the mistake but it is clearly 3.5 and you can see that there is certainly more than .5ml</li>
            <li>I looked into Latisse to see if their product could help with my eyebrows&#x27; hair growth, but its price quickly turned me off.</li>
            <li>, exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>I know I should try this product for 14 days before reviewing, but I have seen such amazing results already.</li>
            <li>So far love the product</li>
            <li>only used a week waiting for some kind of improvement in lashes does burn eyes if you get into eye</li>
            <li>I apply this right before I go to bed</li>
            <li>i waited some time before i reviewed, you have to try the product first and get results am i right?</li>
            <li>Wow i really love this item, it so really works for me</li>
            <li>I received this super fast.</li>
            <li>But I received the product very fast.</li>
            <li>This stuff was amazing, Not only is it easy to apply but it actually works my lashes look 5 times longer than they would before use.</li>
            <li>I swear, in only one week my lashes have become strong, longer and more lush as well as eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>this really works!</li>
            <li>Mascara swept through lashes and lengthened immediately on first coat.</li>
            <li>I also must admit I haven&#x27;t been as consistent as I should be.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyelash enhancer and will recommend it to everybody!</li>
            <li>On the first night using it, I felt some itching on my eye lids.  </li>
            <li>Okay, the only reason why it irritated my eyes was because I got the brush in my eye when I used it once on accident.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will, no joke.</li>
            <li>It works very well on me!</li>
            <li>Mine already look so much Fuller!</li>
            <li>It stays put exactly where I apply it.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future and I will use this seller.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works, because when it came in, it was only 3/4 ways filled!</li>
            <li>Item shipped really fast!</li>
            <li>and more accuracy in getting the serum on the lashes only.  </li>
            <li>I was only able to use this product once.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different mascaras and thickening tricks but nothing ever really worked the way I wanted it too.</li>
            <li>I bought this one for my niece after reading my positive reviews from amazon.</li>
            <li>I thought it worked really well for the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>My lashes are gonna be long and sexy in the end.</li>
            <li>Will update review once i get a few more days to try!</li>
            <li>To keep my testing accurate, I tested on only one eye</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got my before ones ready.</li>
            <li>Since I have started using this product, my eyebrows have filled out a lot where I have to only fill in a spot or two.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows were very spotted</li>
            <li>really.  </li>
            <li>I did want to report that the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really need to put a lot of it on your lashes and brows.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Instead, there are enough hairs for it to look natural enough if I just dust some light brown eyeshadow on top for added color and depth.</li>
            <li>I am back to Revitalash Advanced -</li>
            <li>so I can really see results...</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT HAS MADE A REAL DIFFERENCE.    </li>
            <li>and I really can see the difference.</li>
            <li>If you have sparse areas in your brows, this could very well be the solution.</li>
            <li>This eyelash growth serum is extremely gentle.  </li>
            <li>Received fast.</li>
            <li>so far I think my lashes are starting to grow more.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work at all waste of money to be honest</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results but will definitely do so with great expectancy.  </li>
            <li>I really hope that this new pattern of increased hair growth continues since my eyebrows are looking fuller and are starting to take on a much more natural appearance than they have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Later on I will also show a photo of my lashes clean with no makeup at all.</li>
            <li>However, patience pays off with this particular product since I have personally gotten greatresults (fuller, thicker eyebrow hairs resulting in a more natural-looking appearance) from daily and consistent application over 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just started using Lush this week  for a low testing price, its easy to apply just like eyeliner at night before bed, no irritation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I love that the bottle is little to travel with.</li>
            <li>I also really like the  clear container so you can tell at a glance when it&#x27;s time to re-order.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast, but the product was not sealed, alrhough it&#x27;s packed in a clear plastic.</li>
            <li>then I had expected, which isn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
            <li>Left lashes feeling lush and full.</li>
            <li>It is also incredibly easy to use - the pointed brush operators similarly to liquid eyeliner and allows me to apply it to more specific and localized areas rather than messily heaping it on everywhere.</li>
            <li>But this little thing is so quick and easy to use, it has been no problem to actually use it each night since I received</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to have super long lashes or anything</li>
            <li>and u already have a lot of new growth.</li>
            <li>Its definitely a light consistency and the bottles pretty small</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to apply though, only takes less than 10 seconds to apply on both eyelids.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and skin, the product cause no excess sensitivity or allergy reactions.</li>
            <li>No irration or funny smell.product was recieved for low or no cost at all .</li>
            <li>Received numerous compliments after the first week of usage and noticed a considerable difference myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my natural pretty blonde!</li>
            <li>This product is effective and essential for the everyday makeup wearer and hose with problems growing the lashes you desire!</li>
            <li>I did want to clear up something another reviewer said.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have not seen any improvement so far.</li>
            <li>This has finally stopped me from paying so much money.</li>
            <li>Really surprised at the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have been growing out my eyebrows for a few years now and they have finally taken to their natural shape, but I still have some areas (namely the front ends of my eyebrows) that are more sparse than others.</li>
            <li>So far I had use it about 2weeks.</li>
            <li>There is no harshness to it (which you wouldn&#x27;t want near your eyes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;serum does not irritate my sensitive eyes or surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>My left eyelashes had a gap that has no eyelashes, and right now the eyelashes grow back!!!</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are growing in and it&#x27;s not dark hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two weeks now and have noticed new growth on my upper lashes.</li>
            <li>I would give this product to my niece who wants this product badly based on the good experiences from her friends.</li>
            <li>Them were tame and full andi didnt have to cake my face a ton of make up.  </li>
            <li>This is a great serum for those desperate for long luxurious natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY LIGHT AND THIN EYELASHES.</li>
            <li>Definitely will but this again for mom and aunties as a special little gift.</li>
            <li>Received at discount for review, this serum goes on smooth and i have hardly any eye lashes, it makes your eye lashes thicker with growth, ty</li>
            <li>My lashes have always been long but never really thick.</li>
            <li>but when I was a kid I cut them and now they are longer than ever, I barely need mascara anymore</li>
            <li>I will have to update on any results but so far I like the overall product.</li>
            <li>I was given this item to review and I have to say if you have thin lashes or just want more then</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t apply it everyday, only like twice a week for the last month, and there is a significant effect.</li>
            <li>Other serums, though advertised as being gentle, made  my eyes sting.  </li>
            <li>The most dramatic difference is when I applied mascara.</li>
            <li>:( really lol.</li>
            <li>SO DON&#x27;T. I also have not been consistent with using this, but it seems to be working even with missing a day or two in between.</li>
            <li>So far 5 stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I noticed a slight diffence in the length and also in new growth.</li>
            <li>4th time trying to review this item so I am making it much briefer than my previous attempts.</li>
            <li>Burns your eyes a little if to much is applied.</li>

            <li> , i love my skin better after using this product.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> But I love it.</li>
            <li> I started using this on my eyebrows because I wanted to make sure I don&#x27;t have any reaction to it and see how it worked before I started on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> In a cute bottle.</li>
            <li> color is perfect for a blonde............</li>
            <li> Thank you. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> For some people it may work better than others in May</li>
            <li> I love make up...</li>
            <li> and this growth serum.... makes my eyelash thicker and more shiny</li>
            <li> So I thought, it should be OK.  </li>
            <li> Would love an explanation for the discrepancy.</li>
            <li> They seem to come out a lot more too.</li>
            <li> Also i have a lot more eye boogies in the morning after I use this.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am sure this will be on of my go to things and can&#x27;t wait for 2-3 weeks to pass</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 - 4 weeks now and find it to be ok.</li>
            <li> I truly was hoping for more growth in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I get this level from using just castor oil and better than this for using the mascaras that offer grwoth stimulation for eyelashes.</li>
            <li> okay....</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple to use, no negative side effects and beautiful lashes as a result.</li>
            <li> I can see my lashes getting thicker and they are seem to be getting longer but will need more time using this product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure product has does before applying mascara or eye liner.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this Eyelash growth serum.</li>
            <li> particular serum is great because it is much more affordable than Latisse and extensions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Most important there  has been no irritation to either my lashes or brow area.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily, very smooth, and it feels cool gliding on.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and didn&#x27;t cause my eyes any irritation.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with the applicator.</li>
            <li> It applied easily, did not bother my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to apply and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all.</li>
            <li> Easy application!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is really easy to put on but it did burn my eyes when it leaked in one time.  </li>
            <li> This serum is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to slip into any bag and carry around with you all day.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t perceive any strong odor.</li>
            <li> but I am fine with it.  </li>
            <li> The pointed brush makes applying the serum easy and precise onto the lash line.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is  super cute.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and am very pleased with my results so far.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my eyelashes already</li>
            <li> This product is light and doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free for review, this did not bias my review.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> I did follow the instruction and applied a light amount nightly</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy to see this product is different.</li>
            <li> i have long beautiful lashes now</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a good quality/value eyelash growth serum and so far this seems quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> but the ArtNaturals Best EyeLash made them look not only normal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day 6 now of using product and lashes are significantly longer and &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited,</li>
            <li> I am excited to see the difference in a month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so excited I received my package on Friday.</li>
            <li> it is more pricey, but it works better for me - no side effects, and I have seen better results after only 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> but I am thinking that was because I had just washed my face clean.</li>
            <li> On the bright side its very easy to apply and as long as you don&#x27;t put too much to get in your eye it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to update later with more results because this is really important to me.  </li>
            <li> It will irritate your eyeball if you get any in there (have to be sure you don&#x27;t have too much product on the brush when you go to apply).  </li>
            <li> If you love longer eyelashes like me I highly recommend you this product!</li>
            <li> Good product - does help eyelashes grow with daily use for 4-6 weeks!</li>
            <li> Will buy again at full price.</li>
            <li> The lashes were always somewhat full but this serum makes them look comely fuller.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving it.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to the full effects yet</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love thick, beautiful lashes?</li>
            <li> It can be easy to make the mistake but it is clearly 3.5 and you can see that there is certainly more than .5ml</li>
            <li> I looked into Latisse to see if their product could help with my eyebrows&#x27; hair growth, but its price quickly turned me off.</li>
            <li> , exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> I know I should try this product for 14 days before reviewing, but I have seen such amazing results already.</li>
            <li> So far love the product</li>
            <li> only used a week waiting for some kind of improvement in lashes does burn eyes if you get into eye</li>
            <li> I apply this right before I go to bed</li>
            <li> i waited some time before i reviewed, you have to try the product first and get results am i right?</li>
            <li> Wow i really love this item, it so really works for me</li>
            <li> I received this super fast.</li>
            <li> But I received the product very fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff was amazing, Not only is it easy to apply but it actually works my lashes look 5 times longer than they would before use.</li>
            <li> I swear, in only one week my lashes have become strong, longer and more lush as well as eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> this really works!</li>
            <li> Mascara swept through lashes and lengthened immediately on first coat.</li>
            <li> I also must admit I haven&#x27;t been as consistent as I should be.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyelash enhancer and will recommend it to everybody!</li>
            <li> On the first night using it, I felt some itching on my eye lids.  </li>
            <li> Okay, the only reason why it irritated my eyes was because I got the brush in my eye when I used it once on accident.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will, no joke.</li>
            <li> It works very well on me!</li>
            <li> Mine already look so much Fuller!</li>
            <li> It stays put exactly where I apply it.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future and I will use this seller.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, because when it came in, it was only 3/4 ways filled!</li>
            <li> Item shipped really fast!</li>
            <li> and more accuracy in getting the serum on the lashes only.  </li>
            <li> I was only able to use this product once.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras and thickening tricks but nothing ever really worked the way I wanted it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my niece after reading my positive reviews from amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked really well for the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> My lashes are gonna be long and sexy in the end.</li>
            <li> Will update review once i get a few more days to try!</li>
            <li> To keep my testing accurate, I tested on only one eye</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got my before ones ready.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using this product, my eyebrows have filled out a lot where I have to only fill in a spot or two.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows were very spotted</li>
            <li> really.  </li>
            <li> I did want to report that the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really need to put a lot of it on your lashes and brows.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Instead, there are enough hairs for it to look natural enough if I just dust some light brown eyeshadow on top for added color and depth.</li>
            <li> I am back to Revitalash Advanced -</li>
            <li> so I can really see results...</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS MADE A REAL DIFFERENCE.    </li>
            <li> and I really can see the difference.</li>
            <li> If you have sparse areas in your brows, this could very well be the solution.</li>
            <li> This eyelash growth serum is extremely gentle.  </li>
            <li> Received fast.</li>
            <li> so far I think my lashes are starting to grow more.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all waste of money to be honest</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results but will definitely do so with great expectancy.  </li>
            <li> I really hope that this new pattern of increased hair growth continues since my eyebrows are looking fuller and are starting to take on a much more natural appearance than they have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Later on I will also show a photo of my lashes clean with no makeup at all.</li>
            <li> However, patience pays off with this particular product since I have personally gotten greatresults (fuller, thicker eyebrow hairs resulting in a more natural-looking appearance) from daily and consistent application over 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just started using Lush this week  for a low testing price, its easy to apply just like eyeliner at night before bed, no irritation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love that the bottle is little to travel with.</li>
            <li> I also really like the  clear container so you can tell at a glance when it&#x27;s time to re-order.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast, but the product was not sealed, alrhough it&#x27;s packed in a clear plastic.</li>
            <li> then I had expected, which isn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
            <li> Left lashes feeling lush and full.</li>
            <li> It is also incredibly easy to use - the pointed brush operators similarly to liquid eyeliner and allows me to apply it to more specific and localized areas rather than messily heaping it on everywhere.</li>
            <li> But this little thing is so quick and easy to use, it has been no problem to actually use it each night since I received</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to have super long lashes or anything</li>
            <li> and u already have a lot of new growth.</li>
            <li> Its definitely a light consistency and the bottles pretty small</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to apply though, only takes less than 10 seconds to apply on both eyelids.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and skin, the product cause no excess sensitivity or allergy reactions.</li>
            <li> No irration or funny smell.product was recieved for low or no cost at all .</li>
            <li> Received numerous compliments after the first week of usage and noticed a considerable difference myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my natural pretty blonde!</li>
            <li> This product is effective and essential for the everyday makeup wearer and hose with problems growing the lashes you desire!</li>
            <li> I did want to clear up something another reviewer said.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have not seen any improvement so far.</li>
            <li> This has finally stopped me from paying so much money.</li>
            <li> Really surprised at the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have been growing out my eyebrows for a few years now and they have finally taken to their natural shape, but I still have some areas (namely the front ends of my eyebrows) that are more sparse than others.</li>
            <li> So far I had use it about 2weeks.</li>
            <li> There is no harshness to it (which you wouldn&#x27;t want near your eyes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;serum does not irritate my sensitive eyes or surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> My left eyelashes had a gap that has no eyelashes, and right now the eyelashes grow back!!!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are growing in and it&#x27;s not dark hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and have noticed new growth on my upper lashes.</li>
            <li> I would give this product to my niece who wants this product badly based on the good experiences from her friends.</li>
            <li> Them were tame and full andi didnt have to cake my face a ton of make up.  </li>
            <li> This is a great serum for those desperate for long luxurious natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY LIGHT AND THIN EYELASHES.</li>
            <li> Definitely will but this again for mom and aunties as a special little gift.</li>
            <li> Received at discount for review, this serum goes on smooth and i have hardly any eye lashes, it makes your eye lashes thicker with growth, ty</li>
            <li> My lashes have always been long but never really thick.</li>
            <li> but when I was a kid I cut them and now they are longer than ever, I barely need mascara anymore</li>
            <li> I will have to update on any results but so far I like the overall product.</li>
            <li> I was given this item to review and I have to say if you have thin lashes or just want more then</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t apply it everyday, only like twice a week for the last month, and there is a significant effect.</li>
            <li> Other serums, though advertised as being gentle, made  my eyes sting.  </li>
            <li> The most dramatic difference is when I applied mascara.</li>
            <li> :( really lol.</li>
            <li> SO DON&#x27;T. I also have not been consistent with using this, but it seems to be working even with missing a day or two in between.</li>
            <li> So far 5 stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I noticed a slight diffence in the length and also in new growth.</li>
            <li> 4th time trying to review this item so I am making it much briefer than my previous attempts.</li>
            <li> Burns your eyes a little if to much is applied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a while to begin seeing results (at least 3-4 weeks) due to the time it takes for the follicles to stimulate hair growth, but after a month passed, I began noticing significant results.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get in your eye because it burns like no other.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just did not do it for long enough or something.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t last long flysh eye with water</li>
            <li> Will last a very long time because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used other products similar in the past and they were very runny</li>
            <li> I put it on at night following the directions, which are minimal, and each day after I used it my eyes bothered me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had long eyelashes</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product too long</li>
            <li> Whereas I previously had to draw and fill in the sparse areas of my eyebrows, those same areas began growing out hairs that would have taken multiple months to do before.</li>
            <li> It also indicates that is has double the concentration than other leading brands.</li>
            <li> product will last you a long time a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have very sensitive skin that often gets irritated or dried out by new or unfamiliar products, but have not experienced any irritation from this serum.</li>
            <li> have been using Art Naturals LUSH Eyelash &amp; Brow Growth serum on my eye lashes for a little over a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to many products, so this does not mean that it is a bad product, it is just something that I am unable to use unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little bigger</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that it burns just a little when taking off.</li>
            <li> I did not really see results.  </li>
            <li> I will come back and update after a few days.</li>
            <li> Not really very noticable.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a few days</li>
            <li> and when I received it, the box was wet and</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I started with minimal length to my lashes.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use, but it made my eyes feel very weird.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle, but you only use a little, so it looks like it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this for a week,</li>
            <li> Other brands leave you guessing until you run out</li>
            <li> I just followed the instructions because there really is no need to change anything when applying!</li>
            <li> All other brow fillers were too dark.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small in container but it should last a while because it&#x27;s still 3.5 oz</li>
            <li> Other brands didn&#x27;t work, had a chemical smell, burned my eyes and made eyes watered continuously .  </li>
            <li> I saw very minimal results.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about these types of products but it actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t mind the product might make your eyes uncomfortable, and you really want to grow your eyelashes, BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> I did not use them on my eyebrows as they are thick enough!</li>
            <li> I used less mascara on day 6 than I have in years.</li>
            <li> After a week I started to notice my lashes we falling out less.</li>
            <li> I can see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> and it may cause a slight irritation if you get it into your eyes.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes feel slightly thicker and longer without the need for using anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been using once a day as directed for less than two weeks</li>
            <li> I have tried the mascara that is supposed to thicken your lashes but it always gets crusty and breaks off leaving a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this every day for a little over a week and</li>
            <li> I got a little disount on this</li>
            <li> in the little jar.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows were always a little sparse</li>
            <li> I see a little bit of a change..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a little over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have noticed little change in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow becomes a little thicker after 4 weeks, not 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Will revisit this review in a few weeks to validate.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes,we always thin and short.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone that has the same thin eyebrow problem that I do&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I cannot say the same for my eyelashes, they are still thin and spindly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks and didn&#x27;t see any growth except for a few lashes.</li>
            <li> This is helping my lashes grow after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> THIS product however, has no chemical smell, went on easily, no burning and my eyes never watered.  </li>
            <li> I have put on my lashes morning and night for the past few days</li>
            <li> For the past few days, I have not felt the need to draw them in, something I have done for years now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t attest to whether it works well or not since I only used it for a few days before stopping.</li>
            <li> some missing hair spots its been working!</li>
            <li> The serum doesn’t have any color or small to it.</li>
            <li> When I recieved it it came in a plastic bag and is small which I thought well maybe you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li> It has a small brush at the end that you use to swipe on a small line on your eyelid.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows and am constantly looking for ways to make them look fuller.</li>
            <li> Seems like there was one in my eye at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> But my eyelashes are already thick.</li>
            <li> After a few days I could see a difference!!</li>
            <li> Its not a huge dramatic difference</li>
            <li> I have always had very small eyelashes</li>
            <li> is a lot less expensive than making appointments for lash extensions every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Shocked to see what is left.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as slow as it used to be!</li>
            <li> I felt like there was something in my eye or something irritating them.</li>
            <li> The symptoms have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> Not happy for the eyelash.</li>
            <li> At my age eyebrows and eyelashes start to thin.</li>
            <li> The brush is thin which aids in ease of</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I use to have to get false lashes every 2 weeks for $35.</li>
            <li> almost half of it had leaked :(</li>
            <li> Mascara is so difficult to remove</li>
            <li> The next day, I started having this terrible headache.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product arrived damaged and could not be used.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY THIN EYELASHES, THEY ARE LOOKING FULLER ALREADY.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in the false advertising.  </li>
            <li> it is crazy...</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> This product burns so bad.</li>
            <li> It feels like u got soap in your eyes that how bad it burns.</li>
            <li> I had my son order this for me, and I was shocked to receive a 0.3 ml tube of product rather than the 3.5 ml tube as advertised.  </li>
            <li> and I hate filling them in</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good product, and gives best result, i love my skin better after using this product.</li>
            <li> 4th time trying to review this item so I am making it much briefer than my previous attempts. I saw very minimal results.</li>
            <li> I just started using Lush this week  for a low testing price, its easy to apply just like eyeliner at night before bed, no irritation.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, very smooth, and it feels cool gliding on. It&#x27;s a small bottle, but you only use a little, so it looks like it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this for a week, I see no difference at all. Maybe I need to test it longer, maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Will continue to use it and see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> i waited some time before i reviewed, you have to try the product first and get results am i right? anyways! OMG! this really works! i been using it for two weeks.. and i apply it when i remember. i have long beautiful lashes now and i have been adding some on my eyebrows to fill in some missing hair spots its been working! its a miracle hair growth serum! i will buy more!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I have very thin eyebrows and they don&#x27;t grow to well.. After a few days I could see a difference!! ( I got this product for testing )</li>
            <li> Wow i really love this item, it so really works for me i love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my niece after reading my positive reviews from amazon. I would give this product to my niece who wants this product badly based on the good experiences from her friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this prodoct for three weeks.Not a lot of excitement.</li>
            <li> Giving this a provisional 5 star rating because it&#x27;s totally non-irritating and only needs to be applied once daily. I also really like the  clear container so you can tell at a glance when it&#x27;s time to re-order. Other brands leave you guessing until you run out completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 stars are provisional because it&#x27;s still too soon to tell if the product actually increases lash length etc. Will revisit this review in a few weeks to validate.</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in the length and thickness in my lashes, so happy with that. Have also used on eyebrows, not as successful in that area.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked really well for the first two weeks. I noticed a difference in my lash length and thickness. However, after a while my eyelashes started to fall out again, and they have become as sparse as they were before.</li>
            <li> Noticed a visible lengthening of lashes in only 3 days! I&#x27;m on day 6 now of using product and lashes are significantly longer and &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; like. The most dramatic difference is when I applied mascara. I used less mascara on day 6 than I have in years. Mascara swept through lashes and lengthened immediately on first coat. To keep my testing accurate, I tested on only one eye so I could see a honest difference and not fool myself.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin no problem, my eyebrows are getting thicker</li>
            <li> Left lashes feeling lush and full. Received numerous compliments after the first week of usage and noticed a considerable difference myself.</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical. But I love it. My eyelashes,we always thin and short.I have noticed they are fuller and longer. I was so happy to see That is does work. It is easy to apply and didn&#x27;t cause my eyes any irritation. I will continue to use it. I RECEIVED THIS  PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this every day for a little over a week and so far I think my lashes are starting to grow more.  I&#x27;m really excited, years ago I wanted to get some of this when you could only get it from the Dr but I couldn&#x27;t afford it then. So, now they have over the counter I&#x27;m so happy. I got a little disount on this so I wanted to give it a review. I will be sure to update later with more results because this is really important to me.  I can&#x27;t wear false eyelashes and I want to show off my eyes so its nice to be able to put this on each night and help out the cause. I just put it on when I take off my makeup and apply my nightly moisturizer.  Very easy. Just use a tiny bit.  I did want to clear up something another reviewer said. she said it was just .5 ml instead of 3.5ml.  It is 3.5 but I think she looked at it and thought the 3 was a 0.  It can be easy to make the mistake but it is clearly 3.5 and you can see that there is certainly more than .5ml in the little jar.  I also was impressed with the packaging.  I can&#x27;t wait to post pictures in a month.  I&#x27;ve got my before ones ready.</li>
            <li> Just received this today. Hope it works!</li>
            <li> I know I should try this product for 14 days before reviewing, but I have seen such amazing results already. I started using this on my eyebrows because I wanted to make sure I don&#x27;t have any reaction to it and see how it worked before I started on my lashes.  My eyebrows were always a little sparse and I would fill them in whenever I went out. Since I have started using this product, my eyebrows have filled out a lot where I have to only fill in a spot or two.  I can&#x27;t wait to try this on my lashes!</li>
            <li> I am going on week one.. I see a little bit of a change.. I am hoping by months end it will be back to the way they were when I was in my 20&#x27;s .. I will edit the review with before and after at the months end!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZPYYG4C?redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_12</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use, but it made my eyes feel very weird. I felt like there was something in my eye or something irritating them. I put it on at night following the directions, which are minimal, and each day after I used it my eyes bothered me. I don&#x27;t know if it is just me, maybe it&#x27;s because I wear contact or have allergies or something, but it bothered my eyes so I stopped using (I didn&#x27;t want to take the chance that it would do something that affected my vision). Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t attest to whether it works well or not since I only used it for a few days before stopping.</li>
            <li> In a cute bottle. I have not seen any improvement so far. I will update this review after a month of use.</li>
            <li> After a week I started to notice my lashes we falling out less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found this item because it works! I&#x27;ve used it on my eyebrows for those problem areas where the hair won&#x27;t grow back and I&#x27;m noticing a huge difference in their growth! It isn&#x27;t as slow as it used to be! I just followed the instructions because there really is no need to change anything when applying! Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received this item for testing &amp; review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have always had very small eyelashes I love thia product! It is very easy to use and it works great for me! I got this through amz review trader!</li>
            <li> This product is used for three weeks and did not see any result</li>
            <li> All other brow fillers were too dark.&lt;br /&gt;This color is perfect for a blonde............</li>
            <li> This has finally stopped me from paying so much money. I use to have to get false lashes every 2 weeks for $35. Within a couple  of weeks I saw the difference and was very satisfied with the results. No irration or funny smell.product was recieved for low or no cost at all .</li>
            <li> The vote is still out on this product ...  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  It will irritate your eyeball if you get any in there (have to be sure you don&#x27;t have too much product on the brush when you go to apply).  Always easier to apply another coat rather than have it run in your eye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will see how things look in a month or so.  I remain hopeful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about w week and I&#x27;ve seen some great results! My eyebrows were very spotted and I hate filling them in so I got this to test it out. It. Works. Amazingly. My eyebrows are growing in and it&#x27;s not dark hair. It&#x27;s my natural pretty blonde!</li>
            <li> I love this eye lash serum it made my eye lash grow and its vey beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product for the purpose of this review and the opinions are entirely my own.  I thought it was a little bigger but I am fine with it.  I did not really see results.  Maybe I just did not do it for long enough or something.  I will be updating as time goes on and hope they improve my eyelashes.  I did not use them on my eyebrows as they are thick enough!</li>
            <li> My eylashes and eyes brows are almost non Existent ..really.  When I take pictures looks like I don&#x27;t even have eyelashes..:( really lol. This product helps the growth and thickens your eyelashes as well as your eyebrows. I will be using this for my eye lashes only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will last you a long time a little goes a long way. The product moisturizes your eyelashes, repairs them from the makeup we use. Mascara is so difficult to remove and I&#x27;m always breaking them. It nourishes and enhances the look of your eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not hurt my eyes, no burning and no discomfort at all. Easy to use with the applicator. Will last a very long time because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. No smell at all. When I sweat it does not burn my eyes. So no worries about that. Give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample ,review and give you my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about these types of products but it actually works pretty well. I have put on my lashes morning and night for the past few days and I have noticed a difference. Its not a huge dramatic difference but you can see it. I suggest taking before and after pictures so you can truly see the difference. My lashes look thicker and fuller. Be careful not to get in your eye because it burns like no other. Make sure you wipe off any excess serum to make sure that it doesn’t get into your eyes and you should be good. The serum doesn’t have any color or small to it. The package states its good for an 8 week supply. I am excited to see the difference in a month.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; below. Thank you. :)&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I am so excited I received my package on Friday. I have not tried it yet, I will be trying it tonight. I will come back and update after a few days. I did want to report that the shipping was really fast. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results so I can share it here. I will post a before photo. This is what my lashes look like curled with mascara on. Later on I will also show a photo of my lashes clean with no makeup at all. So far 5 stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I noticed a slight diffence in the length and also in new growth. Not really very noticable. So I did change my rating to 4 stars. I also must admit I haven&#x27;t been as consistent as I should be. I will continue testing.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on this product and applied the lash growth every night before bed. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a little over 2 weeks. I can see a slight difference. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to have super long lashes or anything so even the slightest growth has been great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small in container but it should last a while because it&#x27;s still 3.5 oz and you don&#x27;t really need to put a lot of it on your lashes and brows. I really like this eyelash enhancer and will recommend it to everybody!</li>
            <li> Just started using this product today - the packaging states &amp;#34;Guaranteed Results in 14 Days&amp;#34; - so will post an updated review after daily use.  It applied easily, did not bother my eyes.  Really surprised at the size of the bottle.  It holds 3.5ml, &amp;#34;approx. 4 months supply&amp;#34; per the packaging.  It also indicates that is has double the concentration than other leading brands. Made in the USA!  Can&#x27;t wait to see the results!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product! I&#x27;ve always had long eyelashes but when I was a kid I cut them and now they are longer than ever, I barely need mascara anymore</li>
            <li> This product is light and doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it. I&#x27;ve been using it overnight and is too soon to say if it&#x27;s working.  I received a discount to try this product.  Will upadate in a month</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and have noticed new growth on my upper lashes. I apply this right before I go to bed and it may cause a slight irritation if you get it into your eyes. SO DON&#x27;T. I also have not been consistent with using this, but it seems to be working even with missing a day or two in between. I have tried using it on my eyebrows and have not seen a change in them. Only on my lashes. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about 4 weeks now. &amp; I have noticed little change in my eyelashes. For some people it may work better than others in May it does not</li>
            <li> Great product! This is easy to apply and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all. I&#x27;m very excited to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been growing out my eyebrows for a few years now and they have finally taken to their natural shape, but I still have some areas (namely the front ends of my eyebrows) that are more sparse than others. I looked into Latisse to see if their product could help with my eyebrows&#x27; hair growth, but its price quickly turned me off. I came across this product - although it is advertised as an eyelash growth product, I found that it works just as well in accelerating hair growth on my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while to begin seeing results (at least 3-4 weeks) due to the time it takes for the follicles to stimulate hair growth, but after a month passed, I began noticing significant results. Whereas I previously had to draw and fill in the sparse areas of my eyebrows, those same areas began growing out hairs that would have taken multiple months to do before. For the past few days, I have not felt the need to draw them in, something I have done for years now. Instead, there are enough hairs for it to look natural enough if I just dust some light brown eyeshadow on top for added color and depth. I really hope that this new pattern of increased hair growth continues since my eyebrows are looking fuller and are starting to take on a much more natural appearance than they have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular serum is great because it is much more affordable than Latisse and extensions. It is also incredibly easy to use - the pointed brush operators similarly to liquid eyeliner and allows me to apply it to more specific and localized areas rather than messily heaping it on everywhere. Additionally, I have very sensitive skin that often gets irritated or dried out by new or unfamiliar products, but have not experienced any irritation from this serum. My only critique is that it will take several weeks before seeing results, and some people may not have the patience for that. However, patience pays off with this particular product since I have personally gotten greatresults (fuller, thicker eyebrow hairs resulting in a more natural-looking appearance) from daily and consistent application over 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li> I love make up...this make me feel.more confident...and I am one of the fan having a beautiful eyelashes...... its more beautiful when its.growing very pretty..... and this growth serum.... makes my eyelash thicker and more shiny and.beautiful...thank u</li>
            <li> I received the item after 2 days.  The delivery was fast, but the product was not sealed, alrhough it&#x27;s packed in a clear plastic. So I thought, it should be OK.  On the first night using it, I felt some itching on my eye lids.  The next day, I started having this terrible headache.  I did not use it the night after.  The next day, my headache went away.  I applied it again that night, and the same symptoms came back.  I gave it another try the night after... The symptoms have gotten worse. I returned the product, and was immediately given a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not for me.  If you are a migraine sufferer, please check the ingredients before you buy.  I am back to Revitalash Advanced - it is more pricey, but it works better for me - no side effects, and I have seen better results after only 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I had my son order this for me, and I was shocked to receive a 0.3 ml tube of product rather than the 3.5 ml tube as advertised.  Extremely disappointed in the false advertising.  Would love an explanation for the discrepancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for maybe a week. I feel like it drys my lashes out. They seem to come out a lot more too. Also i have a lot more eye boogies in the morning after I use this. I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth. But my eyelashes are already thick. It also could be the fact that i also take hair skin and nail vitamins? On the bright side its very easy to apply and as long as you don&#x27;t put too much to get in your eye it doesn&#x27;t sting. Its definitely a light consistency and the bottles pretty small so u can carry it everywhere. I recieved this product for free for review, this did not bias my review.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great product</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a few days and it can see some fullness already. I am sure this will be on of my go to things and can&#x27;t wait for 2-3 weeks to pass so I can really see results...I will update this review.</li>
            <li> Well i havent notice any grownth yet but they are fuller. This product burns so bad. It easly get in your eyes cause it liquid not a gel. It feels like u got soap in your eyes that how bad it burns. But it doesn&#x27;t last long flysh eye with water</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows and am constantly looking for ways to make them look fuller. I have tried pencils and make up but the ArtNaturals Best EyeLash made them look not only normal ut really good. Them were tame and full andi didnt have to cake my face a ton of make up.  I recommend this for anyone that has the same thin eyebrow problem that I do&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE</li>
            <li> The eyebrow becomes a little thicker after 4 weeks, not 2 weeks. However, for eyelash, it doesn&#x27;t work. Not happy for the eyelash.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! But I&#x27;m only leaving 3 stars because I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days and when I received it, the box was wet and almost half of it had leaked :( don&#x27;t know if it was the weather or what.</li>
            <li> This stuff was amazing, Not only is it easy to apply but it actually works my lashes look 5 times longer than they would before use. comes packaged in a nice reusable case . I was given this item to review and I have to say if you have thin lashes or just want more then give this a try.</li>
            <li> I got this product at a reduced cost in order to offer a review on the product. I have been using this product for about 3 - 4 weeks now and find it to be ok. At my age eyebrows and eyelashes start to thin. It has caused some regrowth and thickining of the eyebrows but I cannot say the same for my eyelashes, they are still thin and spindly. I truly was hoping for more growth in my eyelashes. I get this level from using just castor oil and better than this for using the mascaras that offer grwoth stimulation for eyelashes. I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> okay.... this thing did work, and it works great. I didn&#x27;t apply it everyday, only like twice a week for the last month, and there is a significant effect. My left eyelashes had a gap that has no eyelashes, and right now the eyelashes grow back!!! it is crazy... So if you don&#x27;t mind the product might make your eyes uncomfortable, and you really want to grow your eyelashes, BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I could use this product on my eyebrows... which is what I&#x27;m doing now to make them fuller as well as my eyelashes. This is such a great product. I recieved this product st a discount for my unbiased opinion and review</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for her and she loves it! Definitely will but this again for mom and aunties as a special little gift.</li>
            <li> I received  this product for an honest and unbiased opinioon.  I was amazed to find that I could see a difference in my lashes and brows after a week of use.  My lashes look longer and appear fuller.  My eyebrows feel lusher and look enriched by the nutrients in the product.  Most important there  has been no irritation to either my lashes or brow area.  Great product</li>
            <li> Just as advertised!  Easy application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer Discounted</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. I HAVE VERY THIN EYELASHES, THEY ARE LOOKING FULLER ALREADY. I WOULD DEFINATELY BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THE MERCHANT. I HAVE VERY LIGHT AND THIN EYELASHES. THIS PRODUCT HAS MADE A REAL DIFFERENCE.    DISCLOSURE: I WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE, IN RETURN FOR A HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use any type of eyelash growth treatment and I am very pleased with this product! This product is incredible!! I swear, in only one week my lashes have become strong, longer and more lush as well as eyebrows. I Received this great product at discount in Exchange for my Honest and Unbiased Opinion, and I&#x27;m so happy that it is working!  I have very sensitive eyes and skin, the product cause no excess sensitivity or allergy reactions.I don&#x27;t perceive any strong odor. I did follow the instruction and applied a light amount nightly and I really can see the difference. I can&#x27;t wait to see what they look like after continue use in the following weeks!! If you love longer eyelashes like me I highly recommend you this product!</li>
            <li> Good product - does help eyelashes grow with daily use for 4-6 weeks!</li>
            <li> Okay, the only reason why it irritated my eyes was because I got the brush in my eye when I used it once on accident. This product is really great. It does exactly what it says it will, no joke.</li>
            <li> It works very well on me! I use it every night before I am going to bed like the instruction said. So far I had use it about 2weeks. And my eye lashes did get a litter longer. I will continue use it.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to put on but it did burn my eyes when it leaked in one time.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks and didn&#x27;t see any growth except for a few lashes. But I received the product very fast.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> Received at discount for review, this serum goes on smooth and i have hardly any eye lashes, it makes your eye lashes thicker with growth, ty</li>
            <li> I started using this product about two weeks ago. My lashes have always been long but never really thick. I have tried many different mascaras and thickening tricks but nothing ever really worked the way I wanted it too. After using this product I can safely say give it a try! It wont hurt your existing lashes just improve them! Mine already look so much Fuller! I was given this product at a reduced price to try and give a review and I can it you know that I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This serum is so easy to apply. It stays put exactly where I apply it. I have used other products similar in the past and they were very runny so I&#x27;m happy to see this product is different. The quality is amazing. I will be purchasing more in the future and I will use this seller. I received this super fast.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love thick, beautiful lashes? Well, I know I do!! This serum is simple to use, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, and seems to be working quite nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews of some products causing issues with vision- I&#x27;ve not had that issue at all! NO blurriness, no stinging either! I&#x27;ve seen no changes in my skin or lash color either, which is another concern with growth serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use, no negative side effects and beautiful lashes as a result. Reviewing this has been my pleasure! All opinions are my own and not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> The packaging is  super cute. It&#x27;s so easy to slip into any bag and carry around with you all day. There is no smell or any kind of burning sensation. I have yet to use this on my lashes. I have been religiously applying it to my brows twice a day and u already have a lot of new growth. If you have sparse areas in your brows, this could very well be the solution. I highly recommend and am very pleased with my results so far.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to apply. I can see my lashes getting thicker and they are seem to be getting longer but will need more time using this product. So far love the product</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all waste of money to be honest</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, because when it came in, it was only 3/4 ways filled!</li>
            <li> Caused eyes to itch, burn and lashes to start shedding.  Going to return.</li>
            <li> only used a week waiting for some kind of improvement in lashes does burn eyes if you get into eye</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected. Received product for discount to provide honest feedback. Aplus shipper and great product. Cant complain at all. Will buy again at full price.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.  Can&#x27;t see any difference yet</li>
            <li> Loved the ease with which I could apply this product and amazingly saw results within the first week.  Just make sure product has does before applying mascara or eye liner.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Art Naturals LUSH Eyelash &amp; Brow Growth serum on my eye lashes for a little over a week and a half.  The lashes were always somewhat full but this serum makes them look comely fuller. They look darker and stronger. My eyelashes always seemed to fall out.  Seems like there was one in my eye at least once a week.  I have notified that this hasn&#x27;t happened in over a week.  I use this product every night. My lashes are gonna be long and sexy in the end. I just know it</li>
            <li> This eyelash growth serum is extremely gentle.  Other serums, though advertised as being gentle, made  my eyes sting.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  I also like how you can apply it to both your upper and lower lashes.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results but will definitely do so with great expectancy.  I purchased this product with a discount but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> After using it for a while, I noticed a bit of thickening and added length! Lovely!</li>
            <li> I got this product For a discounted price to review.  I&#x27;m happy with the product, couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  Other brands didn&#x27;t work, had a chemical smell, burned my eyes and made eyes watered continuously .  THIS product however, has no chemical smell, went on easily, no burning and my eyes never watered.  Very happy with this product!  Also can be use in eyebrows, so I&#x27;m trying it there too!</li>
            <li> Item shipped really fast! It was a lot smaller then I had expected, which isn&#x27;t a huge deal. I put some on tonight and experience some eye irritation but I am thinking that was because I had just washed my face clean. There is no odor to the product, went one nicely and easy to apply. Will update review once i get a few more days to try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my eyelashes already and I&#x27;ve only used for 5 days, there growing in thicker an longer, exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> I have tried the mascara that is supposed to thicken your lashes but it always gets crusty and breaks off leaving a mess. This is helping my lashes grow after just a few applications. My eye lashes feel slightly thicker and longer without the need for using anything else. Very happy with the results. Thank you for the discount on this product in return for my personal review.</li>
            <li> awesome growth serum. Noticable difference!!!!</li>
            <li> Its a great product! I received a great coupon from Elitedealclub to try this product! Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I just got this today. It arrived in perfect condition, exactly as described. Will update review in 1 week to reflect my progress.</li>
            <li> Received fast. Can&#x27;t wait to see my eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li> I think I am the only person reviewing here who wasnt paid for their review. GO WITH LATISSE or rogaine, this stuff does not work. You migh as well go to the grocery store and rub apples on your face. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and it guarantees results in 14 days. I will wait another week but I doubt I will see a change</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product arrived damaged and could not be used.  Serum leaked all over product packaging.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I started with minimal length to my lashes. My lashes are now longer and getting thicker. The lashes that you see in the picture are my lashes!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice any change of length or thickness in my eyelashes. The product is very easy to apply though, only takes less than 10 seconds to apply on both eyelids. If I notice any change, I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I will have to update on any results but so far I like the overall product. The product is easy to apply. There is no harshness to it (which you wouldn&#x27;t want near your eyes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am terribly low maintenance, and have no beauty routines. But this little thing is so quick and easy to use, it has been no problem to actually use it each night since I received it.&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a good quality/value eyelash growth serum and so far this seems quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this Eyelash growth serum. We purchased the serum in a&lt;br /&gt;promotion for testing and review.  The brush is thin which aids in ease of&lt;br /&gt;application, and more accuracy in getting the serum on the lashes only.  The&lt;br /&gt;serum does not irritate my sensitive eyes or surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> This product came with no problems. When I recieved it it came in a plastic bag and is small which I thought well maybe you don&#x27;t need a lot and that is the case. It has a small brush at the end that you use to swipe on a small line on your eyelid. I haven&#x27;t been using this product too long so I haven&#x27;t seen any changes but I have hope. The only problem I have is that it burns just a little when taking off. I love that the bottle is little to travel with. Fits perfect in my purse so I rembember to use it.</li>
            <li> I got this item for review.  So far I am loving it.  The pointed brush makes applying the serum easy and precise onto the lash line.  i have only been using this for a couple days since receiving it so I can&#x27;t speak to the full effects yet but i will update after having used this for awhile.</li>
            <li> A+ product! This is a great serum for those desperate for long luxurious natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a lot less expensive than making appointments for lash extensions every 2 weeks. This product is effective and essential for the everyday makeup wearer and hose with problems growing the lashes you desire!</li>
            <li> The box says 4 month supply.  I have been using once a day as directed for less than two weeks and it is almost gone.  Did not examine the level of serum in the body when I received it because I didn&#x27;t have my glasses on.  Shocked to see what is left.</li>
            <li> After using I have noticed growth in my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I was only able to use this product once. I used it before bed and I woke up with red swollen eyes. I am sensitive to many products, so this does not mean that it is a bad product, it is just something that I am unable to use unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I cannot rate this product yet. Received it and using it, but see no results yet. Have been using it 1 week.</li>
            <li> Burns your eyes a little if to much is applied. I do notice my lashes getting longer</li>
