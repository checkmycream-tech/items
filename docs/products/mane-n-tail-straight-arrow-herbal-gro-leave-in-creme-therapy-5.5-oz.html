            <li>I really liked it but wish it came in larger size containers.  </li>
            <li>I put it in right after I was, detangle (with Mane n Tail detangler) and brush.  </li>
            <li>I can say honestly it took a couple of tries before I figured out the right amount of product to use for my hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much of it.</li>

            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>My hair is to my knees and I love this product because it keeps my hair moisturized here in the dry desert climate.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but the formula is not very good for keeping things moisturized.</li>
            <li>Also I recommend the shampoo and conditioner main n tail herbal gro!</li>
            <li>maybe i used to much ?</li>
            <li>It really works I can see a difference</li>
            <li>My horses tail was much softer after using this product.</li>
            <li>I think that it would make your hair greasy as others have said if you use way too much of it.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged at the ends</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>It works very well, I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>split ends after one application were so much stronger</li>
            <li>My first attempt I used way to much, with this product the less the better.</li>
            <li>This product worked wonders on my horse&#x27;s main and tail.</li>
            <li>Have not seen much growth as of yet, but it made my hair extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>My hair is looking better but not sure if it has been growing yet.</li>
            <li>If it came in a bigger size I&#x27;d definatley consider buying more, but at this point it&#x27;s not worth the price of buying and shipping it.</li>
            <li>Even a tiny amount spread as evenly as I could, made my hair super greasy-looking and flat.</li>
            <li>i have not used it before a blow-out, but i have used it to keep my hair naturally curly.</li>
            <li>my hair literally feels stronger and is still soft.</li>
            <li>I also realized that I didn&#x27;t need to apply this to my roots, I have naturally oily hair at the roots and adding this cr√®me made it too oily, it looked like I hadn&#x27;t taken a shower when I just did.</li>
            <li>My hair was flat and very greasy looking.</li>
            <li>when taking medication and now it is back to normal.</li>
            <li>Other ingredients all Herbal Gro products include: keratin amino acids (found in all hair and to help strengthen hair shaft), aloe vera,pathenol (B5),horsetail grass (said to stimulate hair growth),coltsfoot,horse chestnut,meadow sweet and red clover,to name the herbs.</li>
            <li>It does fine in hair especially when hair is damaged and dried out.</li>

            <li>I use Straight Arrow Leave in Conditioner everyday and my hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I just concentrate it on my ends after my shower and blow dry (along with the matching spray) and my hair has completely transformed.</li>

            <li> is if too much is applied to naturally soft caucasian type hair,so use a little at a time due to the shea butter and several oils (canola,almond,and castor),in it.</li>

            <li> Small amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> So I just colored it dark!</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy so a little dab will do you.</li>
            <li> However, she complained that it made her hair feel wet...</li>
            <li> It might have been the smell, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> but the amount needed is very small.  </li>
            <li> (I swear this isn&#x27;t a fake review.)</li>
            <li> Too bad I bought three!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> this stuff goes along way.  I still have it.  It does fine in hair especially when hair is damaged and dried out.</li>
            <li> LOVE ALL THE Mane &#x27;n Tail Straight Arrow Herbal Gro products!</li>
            <li> Not quite sure what to say about this one yet. My hair is looking better but not sure if it has been growing yet.</li>
            <li> OK so 2 weeks ago I grabbed the scissors &amp; cut a lot of my hair off!!!! Because I bleached it &amp; it got fried! So I just colored it dark! My hair looked horrible! So I ordered this product &amp; omg!!! It has helped my hair after 1 wash! I put some on before blow drying my hair &amp; my hair has so much volume &amp; beautiful!!!!! A little oily because I put a little to much but wow!!! So good!!! I&#x27;ll definitely buy this til the day I die! Also I recommend the shampoo and conditioner main n tail herbal gro! Its amazing! NO NEED TO SPEND A FORTUNE ON PRODUCTS LIKE I DID BEFORE THIS PRODUCT! THE OTHER EXPENSIVE ONES DONT REALLY WORK!</li>
            <li> Smells good but the formula is not very good for keeping things moisturized. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. It is supposed to \\&quot;Maximum volumizing and shine for thicker, fuller, healthier looking hair\\&quot; It does the opposite. My hair was flat and very greasy looking. Too bad I bought three! I do love the shampoo and conditioner through.</li>
            <li> Definitely didn&#x27;t help with volume! Even a tiny amount spread as evenly as I could, made my hair super greasy-looking and flat. The only upside was that it smells nice.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for more then 6 months, changes i have seen in my hair is hair became thinner and  i have been losing more hair....</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff! Small amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Received product timely. The product definitely moisturized my previously \\&quot;VERY\\&quot; dry hair. Have not seen much growth as of yet, but it made my hair extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> made my hair a bit greasy feeling.. maybe i used to much ? love all of the main and tail products though! good stuff!!</li>
            <li> It really works I can see a difference</li>
            <li> First time using this. I was expecting something more light-weight because my hair tends to get oily. i have not used it before a blow-out, but i have used it to keep my hair naturally curly. I love the results! I wash and put this cream on to keep my hair curly. I has a slight hold but keeps my curls soft and in place. While maintaining the appearance of a wet curl look. Curls look hydrated. I will definitely keep using this especially as the temperature outside gets warmer, to leave my hair curly.</li>
            <li> so far, I love it. my hair literally feels stronger and is still soft. great combination.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product as expected....love it</li>
            <li> I love the mane&#x27;n tail products until this, my hair looks so greasy.</li>
            <li> I really liked it but wish it came in larger size containers.  Only used it a few times and it was gone.  My horses tail was much softer after using this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Use a smallest amount rubbed on my hands and tossled throughout my hair.  Really a great leave on conditioner but the amount needed is very small.  My jar probably last a year!</li>
            <li> My horse responded terribly to this leave in product. It might have been the smell, I&#x27;m not sure. Whenever she saw me approaching with it, she started neighing all over the place!</li>
            <li> Good product and really works. Had lost a lot of&lt;br /&gt;hair when taking medication and now it is back to normal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product has bad reviews! This is a miracle product for me. (I swear this isn&#x27;t a fake review.) I think that it would make your hair greasy as others have said if you use way too much of it. You don&#x27;t need very much of it. I just concentrate it on my ends after my shower and blow dry (along with the matching spray) and my hair has completely transformed. My hair is very damaged at the ends, I ombr&amp;eacute;&#x27;d my hair and I love my curling iron. I feel like this moisturizes my hair amazingly. Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Really clumpy and hard to use</li>
            <li> It works very well, I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Just got this product today 2/9/09,but tried the Creme Therapy to see how it was (along with the shampoo/conditioner and leave in spray). The leave in spray isn&#x27;t greasy unlike the creme therapy is if too much is applied to naturally soft caucasian type hair,so use a little at a time due to the shea butter and several oils (canola,almond,and castor),in it. Other ingredients all Herbal Gro products include: keratin amino acids (found in all hair and to help strengthen hair shaft), aloe vera,pathenol (B5),horsetail grass (said to stimulate hair growth),coltsfoot,horse chestnut,meadow sweet and red clover,to name the herbs. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feel like it did 20 years ago.  I use Straight Arrow Leave in Conditioner everyday and my hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is to my knees and I love this product because it keeps my hair moisturized here in the dry desert climate.  I put it in right after I was, detangle (with Mane n Tail detangler) and brush.  It helps my braid stay in because my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out and get frizzy curls.  I put extra in because I want the weight of my hair to hold itself together.  It&#x27;s made my hair very soft and shiny when I do wear it down and loose.</li>
            <li> It was shipped and delivered as expected.  It is a little heavy so a little dab will do you.</li>
            <li> this product realy works i use it every day i will be buying it again and telling my friends thank you</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT DO NOT BUY. IT DRYS YOUR HAIR OUT</li>
            <li> This product worked wonders on my horse&#x27;s main and tail. It kept the hair from breaking and tangling. The only downside is I used the entire jar in only TWO applications (applied Moderately). If it came in a bigger size I&#x27;d definatley consider buying more, but at this point it&#x27;s not worth the price of buying and shipping it.</li>
            <li> Love because helps your grow</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I live in Florida so humidity is a frizzing issue for me. I can say honestly it took a couple of tries before I figured out the right amount of product to use for my hair. My first attempt I used way to much, with this product the less the better. I also realized that I didn&#x27;t need to apply this to my roots, I have naturally oily hair at the roots and adding this cr√®me made it too oily, it looked like I hadn&#x27;t taken a shower when I just did. I suggest when you get this product you play around on a day you don&#x27;t have to go to work so that you have enough time to figure it out. After a few tries I found the right amount for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My split ends after one application were so much stronger, they weren&#x27;t brittle anymore. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked after one time. I have been using this product for over a month and I love the amount of shine and smoothness it gives my hair. I use it after every shower, I even now bought the herbal gro shampoo and conditioner. Now my roots are nice and shiny as well.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had initially purchased it for herself. However, she complained that it made her hair feel wet... I just started using it. But, am feeling that this product works great with my wavy hair. I look forward to my continuing application of this product. It, has put additional body to my hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look all blown out of place... And, has added stability in the wind. Which has also allowed me to maintain my look! Great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I love it on my hair after conditioning! I even used it on some wigs as a leave in and it still helped the wigs to keep it&#x27;s texture as well.</li>
            <li> I  am also  satisfied with this  product.</li>
