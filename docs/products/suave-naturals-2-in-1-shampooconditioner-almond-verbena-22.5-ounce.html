    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner smells very delicious.</li>
            <li>And maybe people will be impressed with your budgeting abilities if not with your champagne tastes.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li>In 1 Almond Verbena Shampoo smells delicious!</li>
            <li>My best friend, Sue, introduced it to me.  </li>
            <li>That would be totally awesome.  </li>
            <li>That would be totally awesome.  </li>
            <li>Almond Verbena Shampoo/Conditioner smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>best part is how great is smells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But at the end of the day, this is a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner formula that just doesn&#x27;t do a heck of a great job on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This creamy 2-in-1 shampoo works just great for my non-permed, non-color treated hear.  </li>
            <li>Suave Naturals 2 in 1 is one of the great ones.</li>
            <li>So, I was happy to have the opportunity to try this 2-in-1 shampoo-conditioner product.</li>
            <li>the smell is also very nice and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>A very nice experience.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has a mild but delightful sent and my hair looks great after using it.  </li>
            <li>She says it smells good, and it is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Cleans our hair well and leaves it with a good scent.  </li>
            <li>In 1 Almond Verbena Shampoo is a good low-priced shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>But I have tried some that are just as good as things</li>
            <li>Good value shampoo.  </li>
            <li>For those times, a good combined shampoo is a blessing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for your hair to switch around the types of products that you use in order to stop any sort of product build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fair as well for wave and curl retention, body, and comb-out.</li>
            <li>This is a good compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And I like their conditioners because they are good an affordable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily which is good.</li>
            <li>Good stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>love Suave 2 in 1 products like this because they are great for travel and when in cramped spaces (like the camper).  </li>
            <li>This would save me more money and would be great for taking on trips.  </li>
            <li>This would save me more money and would be great for taking on trips.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and makes a good lather.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much better!</li>
            <li>I like it, and as I said, it is pleasant, but I just don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Still likes the smell and for its use it is effective.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>When I tried this, I liked the lather, and found I liked the way my hair felt a lot after using it.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an effective surfactant; it lowers the surface tension of the liquid to help it get evenly distributed in one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to try the Suave Naturals 2 IN 1 Shampoo + Conditioner Almond Verbena.  </li>
            <li>All the conditioning intended for hair softens up my skin quite nicely.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>In 1 products for my own hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product and will most certainly be nabbing another bottle when this one runs out!</li>
            <li>However, I think that, as two-in-ones go, this was surprisingly good, smelled pleasant, and is economical.</li>
            <li>used the product on my oily hair and my hair came out full of body and not just looking but feeling great too.</li>
            <li>(he doesn&#x27;t mind the scent, it isn&#x27;t very strong).</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and mild and the shampoo and conditioner are both effective.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that tends toward dryness, but I can keep it looking silky with excellent conditioners.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is very light though.</li>
            <li>Pleasant and not overly powerful almond-verbena scent.  </li>
            <li>I have never thoroughly enjoyed one scent more than this.</li>
            <li>I actually tried it myself and it was awesome!</li>
            <li>The top note and most dominant note</li>
            <li>Shampooing twice uses more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this one is just okay.</li>
            <li>I was paying much more for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this smell.</li>
            <li>have tried several 2 in 1 shampoos over the years and not been impressed</li>
            <li>I think this product is better suited for my kids or husbands hair</li>
            <li>I love the smell of verbena.  </li>
            <li>She and I both enjoying using the Bath and Body Works Signature Collection Coconut Lime Verbena Anti Bacterial Foaming Hand Soap ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It can be enjoyed by every member of the family.  </li>
            <li>3 in 1, citrus rush, 28oz]]), that I would love to use on a trial basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3 in 1, citrus rush, 28oz]]), that I would love to use on a trial basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
            <li>However, this Almond Verbena Shampoo does better than some.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this on the days when I want to speed things along in the shower, but stick to separate shampoo and conditioner most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>While I love the smell, he doesn&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ve used another, more conditioning shampoo the day before this works fine</li>
            <li>The fragrance is more sweet almond than verbena, but it&#x27;s pleasant enough and produces a good lather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li>The scent is quite nice and the price was right for the size.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up easily, and I put on my bath gloves and scrub away.</li>
            <li>liquid is nice and thick and lathers up wonderfully.</li>
            <li>how &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; the product may be - if the scent is too strong</li>
            <li>The scent works for me, though it is too strong in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>So, my wife says this is fine in a pinch</li>
            <li>This works fine as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>It worked for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine once on the hair, and that&#x27;s what matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a value shampoo that doesn&#x27;t overclean your hair and has some conditioning power, this Suave product is just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the cheapest brands on the market and it works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised and sometimes impressed by Suave&#x27;s new line of shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a prestigious brand, and no one is going to be impressed by how expensive a shampoo you buy, but for good results, this one works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Rinsing was easy and my hair felt clean.</li>
            <li>and it sure it an economical deal.  </li>
            <li>It is a great daily shampoo with built in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Results into shiny and smooth to touch hair.  </li>
            <li>They are also easily available in any store.</li>
            <li>My recommendation would be to use this for people that don&#x27;t need a strong conditioner and prefer the stronger sweet scent.</li>
            <li>It is surprisingly rich and moist.</li>
            <li>It is gender and age friendly.  </li>
            <li>I was able to comb it out and my curls sprang up nicely like they do when they are properly</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean.</li>
            <li>I like their shampoos because it leaves my hair clean and extends the time between washes.</li>
            <li>I find 2 in 1 products don&#x27;t clean as thoroughly as shampoo alone or soften/moisturize as well as a stand alone conditioners.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and won&#x27;t make you pay and arm and a leg for the experience.</li>
            <li>my S.O. did mention that my hair was very soft and asked what I had changed-that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I would not use this everyday because of my hair length and amount, I think it would be absolutely ideal for someone with shorter hair or a great choice for kids who have long hair and don&#x27;t want to condition.</li>
            <li>I have a special needs daughter who can&#x27;t handle a separate step for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>That said, the time saved using this 2 in 1 is significant,  and I will continue using this shampoo as a quick &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; type shampoo for those mornings I don&#x27;t have time to linger in the shower.  </li>
            <li>and I generally need something more potent to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>I have an obsession with sweet almond oil scented anything</li>
            <li>I really like most Suave products</li>
            <li>As a total package and for value, it&#x27;s as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how effectively this one product both shampooed and conditioned my hair.</li>
            <li>you want a true full-spectrum salon-level conditioner, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work okay with him, but he doesn&#x27;t condition very often anyways.  </li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and smells of sweet almonds, and the feel of my hair after use is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I got this item for a great discount due to a coupon and subscribe and save 15% discount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for 2 weeks and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Works well with my very fine thin hair (which tangles with great ease)</li>
            <li>shampoo has quite a nice fragrance, although it&#x27;s a bit strong when I&#x27;m in the shower and while my hair is still wet.</li>
            <li>I bought one bottle at $1.50/22.5 ozs and love it so much that I came back for two more bottles.  </li>
            <li>They also have a lot of fun scents.  </li>
            <li>Of all that I have tried, this surprised me by being my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I love this product.  </li>
            <li>However, I would definitely buy more of this same 2-in-1 product if I found it in a scent I loved.</li>
            <li>, Usually they don&#x27;t feel like they are doing a great job cleaning or conditioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of shampoo and conditioner in the formula really makes this product deliver well!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just sweet enough to be interesting and the whole aroma sits well with me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Suave always have very reasonable prices and that is why we have their shampoos all the time.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most cheap shampoos, it is gentle on my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>After working out my scalp is extra sweaty and I find that shampooing twice feels more clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This manages to still smell like cookies with no weird chemically vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>For me scent is one of the first things I notice about any product.  </li>
            <li>The product comes in family size and in my opinion is pretty affordable.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li>This Suave 2 in 1 shampoo is very convenient but not quite right for my hair.</li>
            <li>The Suave Naturals 2 IN 1 is extremely affordable, it smells wonderful, and it leaves my hair feeling clean, soft and voluminous, not greasy, sticky and limp.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a very pleasant scent, it just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t linger long, leaving me wanting more rather than weeping with irritated eyes like their floral scents.</li>
            <li>With an ever growing number of bottles in the shower, sometimes it&#x27;s nice to par things down and hurry things along by using 2 in 1 products.  </li>
            <li>But for preteens or if you are washing your hair daily it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often use conditioner but sometimes during certain seasons, my hair really needs it.</li>
            <li>sometimes skip a day between hair washings, and my hair looks clean and shiny on the second day as well as the first.  </li>
            <li>Suave really outdid themselves this time with the sexiest smell on the east coast.</li>
            <li>Those with very oily hair should look for another product.</li>
            <li>and I was really eager to try this product.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling fully conditioned and tangle free.</li>
            <li>This products blends both very well.</li>
            <li>No frizz and my hair is very frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair after washed was left free of tangles</li>
            <li>They are very affordable and are as effective as the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always in a rush to get ready for work and don&#x27;t have time to use separate bottles of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I likes it much.  </li>
            <li>On my criteria for a shampoo/conditioner, it scored pretty well on frizz control (better than average), softness, and shine.</li>
            <li>Subtle and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised her hair brushed so easily.</li>
            <li>One wash (none of that wash and repeat stuff) leaves my hair squeaky clean but doesn&#x27;t seem drying, and I didn&#x27;t need any extra</li>
            <li>It left my hair clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>This is a decent shampoo, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li>This one left my hair smooth and soft with no flyaways which can be an issue if it&#x27;s not conditioned well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I have such a big bottle of it, I decided to try using it as a body wash, and I love the results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would like something a little more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The almond-verbena scent is pleasant and mild -- not overpoweringly fragrant as I was afraid it might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been so weird to start giving Suave products great reviews.</li>
            <li>Verbena is a lemon scented herb, so it&#x27;s a gentle refreshing note when paired secondary to almond and not a bracingly sour citrus as many products can be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall recommended for normal hair.</li>
            <li>I rarely use two-in-one conditioners because I have enough hair for two people</li>
            <li>It is very reminiscent of a rocha flavoring for coffee, or fresh marzipan.  </li>
            <li>hypoallergenic factor won me over right away since I personally as well as others in my family tend to sensitive skin when it comes to certain bath and beauty products.</li>
            <li>Possibly if you had fine hair this stuff wouldn&#x27;t add enough body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Suave has always been, in my opinion, a bargain-basement type product, but is coming out with new products all the time.  </li>
            <li>NEW Look!]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I use it, my hair definitely feels silky and not weighed down, but the top layer still gets the slight frizziness and static</li>
            <li>Suave is a brand that I return to because for a low price, my hair comes out pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Sounds weird for a hair product, but it is nice!  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and tangle free, but it just felt weighed down</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it over the other Suave hair products, yet I think it is a true 2 in</li>
            <li>ia almond followed by a soft verbena.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it very thoroughly the second time and the heaviness was still there.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is neither masculine nor feminine in appearance.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to grip and hold; however, children with small hands may have some difficulty.  </li>
            <li>His hair was left soft and much more manageable than usual, which I think doesn&#x27;t often happen with a combined shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of a subtle coconut scent.</li>
            <li>In the past when I&#x27;ve used 2 in 1 products, I&#x27;ve found that I still needed additional conditioner for my hair to be tangle free.</li>
            <li>I also lost some vomue and, while combing out my hair wasn&#x27;t hard, it wasn&#x27;t as smooth or easy as usual</li>
            <li>Gentle to my hair (combination, oil scalp, dry ends).</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not able to use this for more than one day in a row without some dry, frizziness.</li>
            <li>have oily hair and have to be careful not to use certain conditioners.</li>
            <li>I generally like Suave products, but I&#x27;ve never cared for this combo formula and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any improvement on the formula.  </li>
            <li>I have waist length hair and generally prefer a shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like about it is that it does not leave my hair soft like I would like it to.</li>
            <li>It definitely helped speed up my mornings as I can wash and condition my hair in one go without having to sit around with conditioner on my head to get soft manageable hair.  </li>
            <li>These 2-in-1 products give only a light conditioning, so I use them if my hair is building up residue from heavy conditioners and needs a break to spring back.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick wavy hair and it needs more conditioning than this can provide.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as soft as it is with a conditioner, but it&#x27;s not nearly as dry as it is with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells fantastic, my teenage daughter loves it for her short, thick layers.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike other brands of 2 IN 1 Shampoo + Conditioner, this one lathers very well with only a tiny smudge squirted into my palm.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and on the dry side lately.</li>

            <li> But at the end of the day, this is a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner formula that just doesn&#x27;t do a heck of a great job on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This creamy 2-in-1 shampoo works just great for my non-permed, non-color treated hear.  </li>
            <li> Suave Naturals 2 in 1 is one of the great ones.</li>
            <li> So, I was happy to have the opportunity to try this 2-in-1 shampoo-conditioner product.</li>
            <li> the smell is also very nice and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> A very nice experience.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It has a mild but delightful sent and my hair looks great after using it.  </li>
            <li> She says it smells good, and it is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> Cleans our hair well and leaves it with a good scent.  </li>
            <li> In 1 Almond Verbena Shampoo is a good low-priced shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> But I have tried some that are just as good as things</li>
            <li> Good value shampoo.  </li>
            <li> For those times, a good combined shampoo is a blessing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for your hair to switch around the types of products that you use in order to stop any sort of product build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fair as well for wave and curl retention, body, and comb-out.</li>
            <li> This is a good compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And I like their conditioners because they are good an affordable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily which is good.</li>
            <li> Good stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> love Suave 2 in 1 products like this because they are great for travel and when in cramped spaces (like the camper).  </li>
            <li> This would save me more money and would be great for taking on trips.  </li>
            <li> This would save me more money and would be great for taking on trips.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes a good lather.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much better!</li>
            <li> I like it, and as I said, it is pleasant, but I just don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Still likes the smell and for its use it is effective.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> When I tried this, I liked the lather, and found I liked the way my hair felt a lot after using it.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an effective surfactant; it lowers the surface tension of the liquid to help it get evenly distributed in one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to try the Suave Naturals 2 IN 1 Shampoo + Conditioner Almond Verbena.  </li>
            <li> All the conditioning intended for hair softens up my skin quite nicely.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> In 1 products for my own hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product and will most certainly be nabbing another bottle when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> However, I think that, as two-in-ones go, this was surprisingly good, smelled pleasant, and is economical.</li>
            <li> used the product on my oily hair and my hair came out full of body and not just looking but feeling great too.</li>
            <li> (he doesn&#x27;t mind the scent, it isn&#x27;t very strong).</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and mild and the shampoo and conditioner are both effective.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that tends toward dryness, but I can keep it looking silky with excellent conditioners.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very light though.</li>
            <li> Pleasant and not overly powerful almond-verbena scent.  </li>
            <li> I have never thoroughly enjoyed one scent more than this.</li>
            <li> I actually tried it myself and it was awesome!</li>
            <li> The top note and most dominant note</li>
            <li> Shampooing twice uses more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one is just okay.</li>
            <li> I was paying much more for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this smell.</li>
            <li> have tried several 2 in 1 shampoos over the years and not been impressed</li>
            <li> I think this product is better suited for my kids or husbands hair</li>
            <li> I love the smell of verbena.  </li>
            <li> She and I both enjoying using the Bath and Body Works Signature Collection Coconut Lime Verbena Anti Bacterial Foaming Hand Soap ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It can be enjoyed by every member of the family.  </li>
            <li> 3 in 1, citrus rush, 28oz]]), that I would love to use on a trial basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3 in 1, citrus rush, 28oz]]), that I would love to use on a trial basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
            <li> However, this Almond Verbena Shampoo does better than some.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this on the days when I want to speed things along in the shower, but stick to separate shampoo and conditioner most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> While I love the smell, he doesn&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve used another, more conditioning shampoo the day before this works fine</li>
            <li> The fragrance is more sweet almond than verbena, but it&#x27;s pleasant enough and produces a good lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li> The scent is quite nice and the price was right for the size.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up easily, and I put on my bath gloves and scrub away.</li>
            <li> liquid is nice and thick and lathers up wonderfully.</li>
            <li> how &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; the product may be - if the scent is too strong</li>
            <li> The scent works for me, though it is too strong in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> So, my wife says this is fine in a pinch</li>
            <li> This works fine as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> It worked for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine once on the hair, and that&#x27;s what matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a value shampoo that doesn&#x27;t overclean your hair and has some conditioning power, this Suave product is just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the cheapest brands on the market and it works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised and sometimes impressed by Suave&#x27;s new line of shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a prestigious brand, and no one is going to be impressed by how expensive a shampoo you buy, but for good results, this one works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Rinsing was easy and my hair felt clean.</li>
            <li> and it sure it an economical deal.  </li>
            <li> It is a great daily shampoo with built in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Results into shiny and smooth to touch hair.  </li>
            <li> They are also easily available in any store.</li>
            <li> My recommendation would be to use this for people that don&#x27;t need a strong conditioner and prefer the stronger sweet scent.</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly rich and moist.</li>
            <li> It is gender and age friendly.  </li>
            <li> I was able to comb it out and my curls sprang up nicely like they do when they are properly</li>
            <li> Hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> I like their shampoos because it leaves my hair clean and extends the time between washes.</li>
            <li> I find 2 in 1 products don&#x27;t clean as thoroughly as shampoo alone or soften/moisturize as well as a stand alone conditioners.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean and won&#x27;t make you pay and arm and a leg for the experience.</li>
            <li> my S.O. did mention that my hair was very soft and asked what I had changed-that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I would not use this everyday because of my hair length and amount, I think it would be absolutely ideal for someone with shorter hair or a great choice for kids who have long hair and don&#x27;t want to condition.</li>
            <li> I have a special needs daughter who can&#x27;t handle a separate step for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> That said, the time saved using this 2 in 1 is significant,  and I will continue using this shampoo as a quick &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; type shampoo for those mornings I don&#x27;t have time to linger in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and I generally need something more potent to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> I have an obsession with sweet almond oil scented anything</li>
            <li> I really like most Suave products</li>
            <li> As a total package and for value, it&#x27;s as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how effectively this one product both shampooed and conditioned my hair.</li>
            <li> you want a true full-spectrum salon-level conditioner, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work okay with him, but he doesn&#x27;t condition very often anyways.  </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and smells of sweet almonds, and the feel of my hair after use is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I got this item for a great discount due to a coupon and subscribe and save 15% discount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for 2 weeks and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Works well with my very fine thin hair (which tangles with great ease)</li>
            <li> shampoo has quite a nice fragrance, although it&#x27;s a bit strong when I&#x27;m in the shower and while my hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> I bought one bottle at $1.50/22.5 ozs and love it so much that I came back for two more bottles.  </li>
            <li> They also have a lot of fun scents.  </li>
            <li> Of all that I have tried, this surprised me by being my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I love this product.  </li>
            <li> However, I would definitely buy more of this same 2-in-1 product if I found it in a scent I loved.</li>
            <li> , Usually they don&#x27;t feel like they are doing a great job cleaning or conditioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of shampoo and conditioner in the formula really makes this product deliver well!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just sweet enough to be interesting and the whole aroma sits well with me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Suave always have very reasonable prices and that is why we have their shampoos all the time.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most cheap shampoos, it is gentle on my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> After working out my scalp is extra sweaty and I find that shampooing twice feels more clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This manages to still smell like cookies with no weird chemically vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> For me scent is one of the first things I notice about any product.  </li>
            <li> The product comes in family size and in my opinion is pretty affordable.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li> This Suave 2 in 1 shampoo is very convenient but not quite right for my hair.</li>
            <li> The Suave Naturals 2 IN 1 is extremely affordable, it smells wonderful, and it leaves my hair feeling clean, soft and voluminous, not greasy, sticky and limp.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a very pleasant scent, it just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t linger long, leaving me wanting more rather than weeping with irritated eyes like their floral scents.</li>
            <li> With an ever growing number of bottles in the shower, sometimes it&#x27;s nice to par things down and hurry things along by using 2 in 1 products.  </li>
            <li> But for preteens or if you are washing your hair daily it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often use conditioner but sometimes during certain seasons, my hair really needs it.</li>
            <li> sometimes skip a day between hair washings, and my hair looks clean and shiny on the second day as well as the first.  </li>
            <li> Suave really outdid themselves this time with the sexiest smell on the east coast.</li>
            <li> Those with very oily hair should look for another product.</li>
            <li> and I was really eager to try this product.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling fully conditioned and tangle free.</li>
            <li> This products blends both very well.</li>
            <li> No frizz and my hair is very frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair after washed was left free of tangles</li>
            <li> They are very affordable and are as effective as the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in a rush to get ready for work and don&#x27;t have time to use separate bottles of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I likes it much.  </li>
            <li> On my criteria for a shampoo/conditioner, it scored pretty well on frizz control (better than average), softness, and shine.</li>
            <li> Subtle and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised her hair brushed so easily.</li>
            <li> One wash (none of that wash and repeat stuff) leaves my hair squeaky clean but doesn&#x27;t seem drying, and I didn&#x27;t need any extra</li>
            <li> It left my hair clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> This one left my hair smooth and soft with no flyaways which can be an issue if it&#x27;s not conditioned well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I have such a big bottle of it, I decided to try using it as a body wash, and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would like something a little more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The almond-verbena scent is pleasant and mild -- not overpoweringly fragrant as I was afraid it might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been so weird to start giving Suave products great reviews.</li>
            <li> Verbena is a lemon scented herb, so it&#x27;s a gentle refreshing note when paired secondary to almond and not a bracingly sour citrus as many products can be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall recommended for normal hair.</li>
            <li> I rarely use two-in-one conditioners because I have enough hair for two people</li>
            <li> It is very reminiscent of a rocha flavoring for coffee, or fresh marzipan.  </li>
            <li> hypoallergenic factor won me over right away since I personally as well as others in my family tend to sensitive skin when it comes to certain bath and beauty products.</li>
            <li> Possibly if you had fine hair this stuff wouldn&#x27;t add enough body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Suave has always been, in my opinion, a bargain-basement type product, but is coming out with new products all the time.  </li>
            <li> NEW Look!]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use it, my hair definitely feels silky and not weighed down, but the top layer still gets the slight frizziness and static</li>
            <li> Suave is a brand that I return to because for a low price, my hair comes out pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Sounds weird for a hair product, but it is nice!  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft and tangle free, but it just felt weighed down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it over the other Suave hair products, yet I think it is a true 2 in</li>
            <li> ia almond followed by a soft verbena.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it very thoroughly the second time and the heaviness was still there.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is neither masculine nor feminine in appearance.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to grip and hold; however, children with small hands may have some difficulty.  </li>
            <li> His hair was left soft and much more manageable than usual, which I think doesn&#x27;t often happen with a combined shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more of a subtle coconut scent.</li>
            <li> In the past when I&#x27;ve used 2 in 1 products, I&#x27;ve found that I still needed additional conditioner for my hair to be tangle free.</li>
            <li> I also lost some vomue and, while combing out my hair wasn&#x27;t hard, it wasn&#x27;t as smooth or easy as usual</li>
            <li> Gentle to my hair (combination, oil scalp, dry ends).</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not able to use this for more than one day in a row without some dry, frizziness.</li>
            <li> have oily hair and have to be careful not to use certain conditioners.</li>
            <li> I generally like Suave products, but I&#x27;ve never cared for this combo formula and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any improvement on the formula.  </li>
            <li> I have waist length hair and generally prefer a shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like about it is that it does not leave my hair soft like I would like it to.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped speed up my mornings as I can wash and condition my hair in one go without having to sit around with conditioner on my head to get soft manageable hair.  </li>
            <li> These 2-in-1 products give only a light conditioning, so I use them if my hair is building up residue from heavy conditioners and needs a break to spring back.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair and it needs more conditioning than this can provide.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as soft as it is with a conditioner, but it&#x27;s not nearly as dry as it is with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells fantastic, my teenage daughter loves it for her short, thick layers.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike other brands of 2 IN 1 Shampoo + Conditioner, this one lathers very well with only a tiny smudge squirted into my palm.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and on the dry side lately.</li>
            <li> After my hair is dry, there&#x27;s very little fragrance left, and only when I put my hair right up to my nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big family size bottle, so will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I have plenty of coarser grey hairs mixed in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t necessarily convinced that this was going to work for something like me who has extremely long, thick hair, but it did the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> I liked that it&#x27;s not a noticeably &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; shampoo, as my sons want me not to get them &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; shampoos, but the &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; brands can be very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Does not strip the oils off the ends and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair near the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other, more expensive, brands of 2 IN 1 Shampoo + Conditioner and</li>
            <li> Actually, I have yet to meet a 2 in 1 product that actually works both as a shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair comb-able without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Still, I can use this every day and it doesn&#x27;t overly dry my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> use 2 in 1s when I&#x27;m in a rush because my hair will air dry quicker using them compared to using a shampoo and conditioner, and they are convenient.</li>
            <li> hair is on the dry side</li>
            <li> However, sometimes, I&#x27;m tired or in a hurry and would really like to skip the extra step of conditioning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just conditioning enough without weighing down the layers</li>
            <li> My son is very picky about shampoos for his very thick and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t been late to work</li>
            <li> So, my hair is cleansed and softened well enough, but not to the extent of a separate Suave shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels ever so limp.  </li>
            <li> After I washed and rinsed my hair, it felt like it had heavy film on it, as if I hadn&#x27;t rinsed my hair properly.</li>
            <li> and I had to be careful not to pull or damage it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner smells very delicious. The only thing I do not like about it is that it does not leave my hair soft like I would like it to.</li>
            <li> I would like something a little more moisturizing.  The scent is quite nice and the price was right for the size.  If I&#x27;ve used another, more conditioning shampoo the day before this works fine but I&#x27;m not able to use this for more than one day in a row without some dry, frizziness.</li>
            <li> I have never thoroughly enjoyed one scent more than this. Suave really outdid themselves this time with the sexiest smell on the east coast.</li>
            <li> I have a special needs daughter who can&#x27;t handle a separate step for shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;m always skeptical of two in one shampoos because they never condition your hair well. This one did. I was very surprised her hair brushed so easily. I actually tried it myself and it was awesome! the smell is also very nice and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> To begin, I am a big fan of the almond verbena smell. It&#x27;s a great &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; fragrance that&#x27;s just sweet enough to be interesting and the whole aroma sits well with me.  But at the end of the day, this is a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner formula that just doesn&#x27;t do a heck of a great job on my hair.  I generally like Suave products, but I&#x27;ve never cared for this combo formula and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any improvement on the formula.  So, my hair is cleansed and softened well enough, but not to the extent of a separate Suave shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels ever so limp.  Nothing horrible, mind you, but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised and sometimes impressed by Suave&#x27;s new line of shampoos and conditioners.  This 2-in-1 shampoo is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Pleasant and not overly powerful almond-verbena scent.  The top note and most dominant note ia almond followed by a soft verbena. Verbena is a lemon scented herb, so it&#x27;s a gentle refreshing note when paired secondary to almond and not a bracingly sour citrus as many products can be.&lt;br /&gt;+ Gentle to my hair (combination, oil scalp, dry ends). Does not strip the oils off the ends and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair near the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- After working out my scalp is extra sweaty and I find that shampooing twice feels more clean.&lt;br /&gt;- Shampooing twice uses more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall recommended for normal hair. Those with dryer hair can additional use a conditioner of their choice (but then what is the point of 2-in-1?) Those with very oily hair should look for another product.</li>
            <li> got me in deep kimchee with my wife. She didn&#x27;t notice this was a shampoo/conditioner so she used it after as a conditioner. Ah, well. She says it smells good, and it is a good conditioner. Shampoo part will be next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 03/06/14: So, my wife says this is fine in a pinch but she favors separate shampoo &amp; conditioner. Still likes the smell and for its use it is effective.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  Cleans our hair well and leaves it with a good scent.  Our hair is less tangled after we use this.  For us, it&#x27;s a little on the watery side.  We wish it was a little thicker.  But, it works well for the cost.  It&#x27;s a big family size bottle, so will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Suave Naturals 2 In 1 Almond Verbena Shampoo is a good low-priced shampoo/conditioner. Unlike most cheap shampoos, it is gentle on my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. The conditioner is very light though. Users with damaged hair will probably want to use a separate stronger conditioner. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering. For those looking for a low cost 2 in 1 shampoo, I recommend Suave Naturals 2 In 1 Almond Verbena Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have an obsession with sweet almond oil scented anything and I was really eager to try this product. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t smell like almond at all, it&#x27;s more of a subtle coconut scent. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a very pleasant scent, it just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. After I washed and rinsed my hair, it felt like it had heavy film on it, as if I hadn&#x27;t rinsed my hair properly. I rinsed it very thoroughly the second time and the heaviness was still there. I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s the conditioner part of the product because it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 shampoo. In the past when I&#x27;ve used 2 in 1 products, I&#x27;ve found that I still needed additional conditioner for my hair to be tangle free. That definitely wasn&#x27;t the case with this product. My hair was soft and tangle free, but it just felt weighed down and I didn&#x27;t care for that. This is a decent shampoo, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> Suave has always been, in my opinion, a bargain-basement type product, but is coming out with new products all the time.  This creamy 2-in-1 shampoo works just great for my non-permed, non-color treated hear.  One wash (none of that wash and repeat stuff) leaves my hair squeaky clean but doesn&#x27;t seem drying, and I didn&#x27;t need any extra conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes skip a day between hair washings, and my hair looks clean and shiny on the second day as well as the first.  (Except for the bedhead effect, and the shampoo has nothing to do with that.)  Still, I can use this every day and it doesn&#x27;t overly dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The almond-verbena scent is pleasant and mild -- not overpoweringly fragrant as I was afraid it might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a prestigious brand, and no one is going to be impressed by how expensive a shampoo you buy, but for good results, this one works just fine.  And maybe people will be impressed with your budgeting abilities if not with your champagne tastes.</li>
            <li> I really like most Suave products but this one is just okay. My hair is fine and on the dry side lately. This works fine as a shampoo. The fragrance is more sweet almond than verbena, but it&#x27;s pleasant enough and produces a good lather. But after rinsing and toweling my hair, it was impossibly tangled and I had to use a leave-in conditioner to comb it through. So I&#x27;ll use this product as a shampoo along with a conditioner like Suave Moroccan Infusion but I won&#x27;t use it as a 2 in 1. Actually, I have yet to meet a 2 in 1 product that actually works both as a shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair comb-able without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It has been so weird to start giving Suave products great reviews. I always thought they were just awful. But I have tried some that are just as good as things I was paying much more for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave Naturals 2 in 1 is one of the great ones. It is surprisingly rich and moist. It left my hair feeling fully conditioned and tangle free. I was able to comb it out and my curls sprang up nicely like they do when they are properly moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is how great is smells. I love this smell. I am not a big fan of vanilla scents. This manages to still smell like cookies with no weird chemically vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> Good value shampoo.  Smells nice and makes a good lather.  Hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> I rarely use two-in-one conditioners because I have enough hair for two people and I generally need something more potent to keep it under control. However, sometimes, I&#x27;m tired or in a hurry and would really like to skip the extra step of conditioning. For those times, a good combined shampoo is a blessing. It&#x27;s also good for your hair to switch around the types of products that you use in order to stop any sort of product build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t necessarily convinced that this was going to work for something like me who has extremely long, thick hair, but it did the job pretty well. On my criteria for a shampoo/conditioner, it scored pretty well on frizz control (better than average), softness, and shine. It didn&#x27;t fair as well for wave and curl retention, body, and comb-out. My hair is naturally wavy and I lost some wave. I also lost some vomue and, while combing out my hair wasn&#x27;t hard, it wasn&#x27;t as smooth or easy as usual and I had to be careful not to pull or damage it. However, I think that, as two-in-ones go, this was surprisingly good, smelled pleasant, and is economical. As a total package and for value, it&#x27;s as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I would not use this everyday because of my hair length and amount, I think it would be absolutely ideal for someone with shorter hair or a great choice for kids who have long hair and don&#x27;t want to condition. I also would keep it around as part of my hair care product rotation.</li>
            <li> With an ever growing number of bottles in the shower, sometimes it&#x27;s nice to par things down and hurry things along by using 2 in 1 products.  Suave Naturals 2 in 1 Almond Verbena shampoo/conditioner is a solid 2 in 1.  It definitely helped speed up my mornings as I can wash and condition my hair in one go without having to sit around with conditioner on my head to get soft manageable hair.  The scent is subtle and smells of sweet almonds, and the feel of my hair after use is wonderful.  While it does get my hair manageable, it&#x27;s definitely cannot compare to using a separate shampoo and conditioner.  That said, the time saved using this 2 in 1 is significant,  and I will continue using this shampoo as a quick &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; type shampoo for those mornings I don&#x27;t have time to linger in the shower.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I know this is supposed to be almond verbena but I only could catch the almond scent, unlike the deodorant that had a definite floral odor along with the almonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several 2 in 1 shampoos over the years and not been impressed, Usually they don&#x27;t feel like they are doing a great job cleaning or conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid is nice and thick and lathers up wonderfully. Rinsing was easy and my hair felt clean. I didn&#x27;t condition it and it&#x27;s not as soft as it is with a conditioner, but it&#x27;s not nearly as dry as it is with regular shampoo. A very nice experience.</li>
            <li> I do like the scent of this product.  It is not strong nor does it linger.  For me scent is one of the first things I notice about any product.  No mater how &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; the product may be - if the scent is too strong it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Suave 2 in 1 products like this because they are great for travel and when in cramped spaces (like the camper).  Works well with my very fine thin hair (which tangles with great ease)</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair and generally prefer a shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I use 2 in 1s when I&#x27;m in a rush because my hair will air dry quicker using them compared to using a shampoo and conditioner, and they are convenient. This one left my hair smooth and soft with no flyaways which can be an issue if it&#x27;s not conditioned well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells fantastic, my teenage daughter loves it for her short, thick layers. It&#x27;s just conditioning enough without weighing down the layers so she has lots of volume and body.</li>
            <li> My son is very picky about shampoos for his very thick and curly hair.  He loves this!  His hair was left soft and much more manageable than usual, which I think doesn&#x27;t often happen with a combined shampoo/conditioner.  The scent is nice---you can smell the almond.  I liked that it&#x27;s not a noticeably &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; shampoo, as my sons want me not to get them &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; shampoos, but the &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; brands can be very expensive.  When I tried this, I liked the lather, and found I liked the way my hair felt a lot after using it.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much better!</li>
            <li> UPDATE 3/24/2014&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have been using this for a few weeks now and noticed that I started getting a flaky scalp. This is may not happen to everyone though. I have to subtract 1 star due to this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;I have oily hair and have to be careful not to use certain conditioners. But, I still need a little bit of it. This is a good compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Suave products for a while and I like them. I like their shampoos because it leaves my hair clean and extends the time between washes. And I like their conditioners because they are good an affordable. This products blends both very well. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily which is good. It doesn&#x27;t give a lot of volume thought. It left my hair clean and manageable. No frizz and my hair is very frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. I think is works for several hair types. It worked for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought one bottle at $1.50/22.5 ozs and love it so much that I came back for two more bottles.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Suave is a brand that I return to because for a low price, my hair comes out pretty well.  They also have a lot of fun scents.  These 2-in-1 products give only a light conditioning, so I use them if my hair is building up residue from heavy conditioners and needs a break to spring back.  Of all that I have tried, this surprised me by being my favorite scent.  It is very reminiscent of a rocha flavoring for coffee, or fresh marzipan.  Sounds weird for a hair product, but it is nice!  It also doesn&#x27;t linger long, leaving me wanting more rather than weeping with irritated eyes like their floral scents.</li>
            <li> The Suave Naturals 2 In 1 Almond Verbena Shampoo smells delicious! The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it&#x27;s subtle enough to be used by either a guy or girl. The product comes in family size and in my opinion is pretty affordable. Also since it&#x27;s 2-1, it&#x27;ll reduce the amount of space taken up in your bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product on my oily hair and my hair came out full of body and not just looking but feeling great too. I don&#x27;t often use conditioner but sometimes during certain seasons, my hair really needs it. This combo didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling overly greasy after. Just the right amount of shampoo and conditioner in the formula really makes this product deliver well! My hair after washed was left free of tangles too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hypoallergenic factor won me over right away since I personally as well as others in my family tend to sensitive skin when it comes to certain bath and beauty products. I&#x27;ve had no issues whatsoever using this product to cleanse my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product and will most certainly be nabbing another bottle when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> This shampoo - conditioner 2 in 1 saves time and it sure it an economical deal.  I don&#x27;t recommend it over the other Suave hair products, yet I think it is a true 2 in 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include cocamide MEA.  This is produced from acids in coconut oil and it&#x27;s a foaming agent.  It&#x27;s often used in more expensive brands such as Paul Mitchell.  Another ingredient is TEA-dodecylbenzenesulfonate.  That&#x27;s an effective surfactant; it lowers the surface tension of the liquid to help it get evenly distributed in one&#x27;s hair.  I was surprised at how effectively this one product both shampooed and conditioned my hair.</li>
            <li> This Suave 2 in 1 shampoo is very convenient but not quite right for my hair. I have long thick wavy hair and it needs more conditioning than this can provide. I have found that also using a separate conditioner helps but I still prefer the Suave Professionals line. I think this product is better suited for my kids or husbands hair (he doesn&#x27;t mind the scent, it isn&#x27;t very strong).</li>
            <li> those who have read or watched on TV the Little House on the Prarie series of novels will understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic shampoo + conditioner in one.  I find 2 in 1 products don&#x27;t clean as thoroughly as shampoo alone or soften/moisturize as well as a stand alone conditioners. But for preteens or if you are washing your hair daily it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I got this item for a great discount due to a coupon and subscribe and save 15% discount. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I love this product.  It is a great daily shampoo with built in conditioner.  It has a mild but delightful sent and my hair looks great after using it.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Suave is a name I trust; I purchase their products, especially their body lotions, on a regular basis.  They are very affordable and are as effective as the more expensive brands.  I was thrilled to try the Suave Naturals 2 IN 1 Shampoo + Conditioner Almond Verbena.  I love the smell of verbena.  My best friend, Sue, introduced it to me.  She and I both enjoying using the Bath and Body Works Signature Collection Coconut Lime Verbena Anti Bacterial Foaming Hand Soap ([[ASIN:B0035CH2P6 Bath and Body Works Signature Collection Coconut Lime Verbena Anti Bacterial Foaming Hand Soap! NEW Look!]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m always in a rush to get ready for work and don&#x27;t have time to use separate bottles of shampoo and conditioner.  I prefer to use them together.  Also, I must use conditioner on a daily basis or I will get dandruff.  I&#x27;ve used other, more expensive, brands of 2 IN 1 Shampoo + Conditioner and they worked well; however, they were very expensive.  The Suave Naturals 2 IN 1 is extremely affordable, it smells wonderful, and it leaves my hair feeling clean, soft and voluminous, not greasy, sticky and limp.  The only harmful side effect is that I don&#x27;t want to leave the shower.  So far I haven&#x27;t been late to work but I&#x27;ve come close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The almond verbena scent disappears rapidly after blow drying my hair.  I never notice it during the day.  Also, unlike other brands of 2 IN 1 Shampoo + Conditioner, this one lathers very well with only a tiny smudge squirted into my palm.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions.  It hasn&#x27;t stung my eyes or tortured my sinuses.  Also, the 22.5 ounce bottle that I received from Amazon is labeled as Family Size.  It should last a long time.  It can be enjoyed by every member of the family.  It is gender and age friendly.  The bottle itself is neither masculine nor feminine in appearance.  It is easy to grip and hold; however, children with small hands may have some difficulty.  They would have an easier time holding a 12 ounce bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend that Suave make a 3 IN 1 Shampoo, Conditioner + Body Wash Almond Verbena.  That would be totally awesome.  This would save me more money and would be great for taking on trips.  Suave has already manufactured a Naturals Body Wash, Almond Verbena ([[ASIN:B00HSNWZFA Suave Naturals Body Wash, Almond Verbena, 12 Ounce]]); therefore, it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to create a 3 IN 1 Shampoo, Conditioner + Body Wash Almond Verbena.  Furthermore, there is a Suave Professionals Mens, Shampoo/Conditioner/Body Wash, 3 IN 1, Citrus Rush ([[ASIN:B006N9LWWW Suave Professionals mens, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, 3 in 1, citrus rush, 28oz]]), that I would love to use on a trial basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyosty.  They would have an easier time holding a 12 ounce bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend that Suave make a 3 IN 1 Shampoo, Conditioner + Body Wash Almond Verbena.  That would be totally awesome.  This would save me more money and would be great for taking on trips.  Suave has already manufactured a Naturals Body Wash, Almond Verbena ([[ASIN:B00HSNWZFA Suave Naturals Body Wash, Almond Verbena, 12 Ounce]]); therefore, it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to create a 3 IN 1 Shampoo, Conditioner + Body Wash Almond Verbena.

Hoyos</li>
            <li> Subtle and pleasant scent.  Results into shiny and smooth to touch hair.  My wife and I likes it much.  It is not as difficult to rinse as other shampoo and conditioner combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave always have very reasonable prices and that is why we have their shampoos all the time.  They are also easily available in any store.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that tends toward dryness, but I can keep it looking silky with excellent conditioners. I don&#x27;t usually use 2-in-1 hair products because they don&#x27;t give me the conditioning I need. However, this Almond Verbena Shampoo does better than some. When I use it, my hair definitely feels silky and not weighed down, but the top layer still gets the slight frizziness and static I can prevent with stand-alone conditioners. I will continue to use this on the days when I want to speed things along in the shower, but stick to separate shampoo and conditioner most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has quite a nice fragrance, although it&#x27;s a bit strong when I&#x27;m in the shower and while my hair is still wet. After my hair is dry, there&#x27;s very little fragrance left, and only when I put my hair right up to my nose. Since I have such a big bottle of it, I decided to try using it as a body wash, and I love the results. It lathers up easily, and I put on my bath gloves and scrub away. All the conditioning intended for hair softens up my skin quite nicely. So I guess that makes it a 3-in-1 product.</li>
            <li> Suave is known for value, and this 2 in 1 shampoo / conditioner provides that.  The scent works for me, though it is too strong in the bottle.  It&#x27;s fine once on the hair, and that&#x27;s what matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is on the dry side and I have plenty of coarser grey hairs mixed in.  This product has just enough conditioning to tamp down the grey hairs, without making my hair limp.  Possibly if you had fine hair this stuff wouldn&#x27;t add enough body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a true full-spectrum salon-level conditioner, look elsewhere.  If you want a value shampoo that doesn&#x27;t overclean your hair and has some conditioning power, this Suave product is just fine.</li>
            <li> The ladies are all over me when they get a whiff. Good stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used conditioner in years, not since I started wearing my hair short. But, after I started highlighting my hair, I felt like I should start using a conditioner. So, I was happy to have the opportunity to try this 2-in-1 shampoo-conditioner product. I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for 2 weeks and have been very pleased with it. The scent is pleasant and mild and the shampoo and conditioner are both effective. I like the way my hair feels and looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn&#x27;t love the scent. I like it, and as I said, it is pleasant, but I just don&#x27;t love it. However, I would definitely buy more of this same 2-in-1 product if I found it in a scent I loved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a big fan of Suave shampoo. It&#x27;s one of the cheapest brands on the market and it works fine. What&#x27;s not to love? This version doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It leaves my hair feeling clean and won&#x27;t make you pay and arm and a leg for the experience. It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I tend to stay away from 2 In 1 products for my own hair.  I&#x27;ve realized that they never condition well enough to give my hair the moisture it needs.  I got this on accident and decided that I would use it with my daughter.  It doesn&#x27;t work for her thicker hair.  Her hair was dry and difficult to comb through, even with the added detangler.  She cried even after I was down brushing.  So, I decided that this would go into my husband&#x27;s rotation of products.  While I love the smell, he doesn&#x27;t care for it.  It seems to work okay with him, but he doesn&#x27;t condition very often anyways.  He just doesn&#x27;t care for the scent and would prefer me not to get it again.  My recommendation would be to use this for people that don&#x27;t need a strong conditioner and prefer the stronger sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Suave Naturals 2-in-1 Almond Verbena Shampoo/Conditioner smells wonderful.  It reminds me of coco butter or cookies baking in the oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a combination Shampoo with Conditioner it works okay but I still had to add leave in conditioner into my hair to keep the frizz away.  It cleans well and my S.O. did mention that my hair was very soft and asked what I had changed-that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> This smells like the products the salons use.  For the price, it&#x27;s great!</li>
