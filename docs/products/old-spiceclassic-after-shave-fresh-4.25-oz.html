            <li>Great aftershave.</li>
            <li>great way to Christmas shop..</li>
            <li>dearly departed husband would be so proud of his son and maybe a bit insulted, which amuses me.  </li>
            <li>A joy for old-timers.</li>
            <li>Smells great and found for a good price on amazon</li>
            <li>The product was delivered within two days of my order and at a good price.  </li>
            <li>it still has that reassuring sting after a good shave, that cooling sensation on the skin, and the soothing results.  </li>
            <li>but I love the stuff and am happy I found it here.</li>
            <li>I love this product and my son smells great. .</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for many years, so I know how it should smell!)  </li>
            <li>The dollar store brand is better than this!</li>
            <li>I desire Amazon to check their inventory, find two good bttles and forward them to me, and I would be glad to return my two unacceptable bottles.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of like Afta aftershave balm.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why P&amp;G discontinued this popular stuff.</li>
            <li>Still an excellent aftershave with a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>.which leads me to wonder, why is smelling good so important now?</li>
            <li>Here it is at Amazon, my favorite place to shop.</li>
            <li>I love amazon they aloways</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I could find it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>what more is there to say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are those out there</li>
            <li>I am glad I can get it off of Amazon.</li>
            <li>Both the Cologne and After Shave products are frauds compared to the scent that made these products famous more than fifty years ago.  </li>
            <li>and I love the scent and its performance.</li>
            <li>love the smellllllll it reminds me of my grandpa&#x27;s bathroom.....</li>
            <li>The scent is not the original &amp;#34;Fresh.&amp;#34; But it was packaged nicely as described.</li>
            <li>The good news it wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of money!  </li>
            <li>Those are pretty good</li>
            <li>The good thing is it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>And it smells so much better than the original scent.  </li>
            <li>I am shaking the bottle every day trying to set free the lime portion, but it is still unsatisfactory.     </li>
            <li>and this is a cheap substitute.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the Fresh scent.</li>
            <li>feel free to pay upwards of $100 on ebay if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re dead-set on.  </li>
            <li>After Shave and I was excited to find it.</li>
            <li>Seems to smell like the original.</li>
            <li>I have the original in my collection</li>
            <li>Great for after shave, and have used for a very long time.</li>
            <li>The scent is initially pretty strong, as is the alcohol, both of which die off after a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li>This smell is horrid and does not smell anything like the Fresh body wash or deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice Fresh is my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li>It the same kind that my Dad all used</li>
            <li>He loves the fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s reclaimed it&#x27;s place as my favorite AS, even if it is different from the original Fresh Scent.</li>
            <li>All that is available now is Original, Gillette Cool Wave &amp; Adidias Dynamic Pulse.</li>
            <li>Good product doesn&#x27;t smell like the original not sure why.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Fresh Scent used to be available at pharmacies and supermarkets but that is no longer the case.  </li>
            <li>The Fresh aftershave sells on eBay for large amounts of money.</li>
            <li>, this stuff really burns!</li>
            <li>And the service was fast!</li>
            <li>but it is pretty darn close to what I remember.</li>
            <li>at first i was very upset, refused to purchase any more products from proctor &amp; gamble, wrote them an email demanding my money back, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they started selling this in stores again and went back to the clear glass bottles.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice that made this fragrance special has been modified beyond recognition.  </li>
            <li>For a while they even had a Pure Sport aftershave.</li>
            <li>I just won the lotto and started using Old Spice fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Fresh for thirty years.</li>
            <li>Received 6 bottles of the Old Spice Fresh Scent after shave from OTCRX4U.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice after shave lotion, Fresh scent for 50 years and now  I can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a cheap Brute or English Leather.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t save much in spite of buying in bulk, but I still prefer it to anything else on the market.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re willing to try out the new smell, give this a go.  </li>
            <li>What I got is a product that cost twice as much as a regular bottle (with the unconscionable shipping charge--separate for each bottle!!), and a product which appears to be a concoction passed off as the original (I still had some of the original left, so I could compare the fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid of its vintage status - this is the perfect manly smell with old school charm!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve grown to really like the new smell.  </li>
            <li>classic..</li>
            <li>Just my opinion, but I will not be using this AS again, sticking with the classic scent.</li>
            <li>I had a very old bottle of Old Spice Fresh AS, i think it was my first aftershave ever, and it seemed to last forever.  </li>
            <li>I was very unsatisfied about it, but life was busy.</li>
            <li>This situation makes me very disatisfied with Old Spice, and unless Amazon performs as desired and requested, I will need to take my business elsewhere.    </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care about the Canadian Old Spice odor.</li>
            <li>a little spicier than it used to be, sortof-kindof more along the lines of the old-spice Original scent, rather than the fresh scent, but not overwhelmingly spice-ridden like the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing of the classic old spice scent here though!</li>
            <li>new plastic bottle look just like the glass ones.</li>
            <li>Even after P&amp;G reformulated the Old Spice products and scents, the fresh still seems to be very similar to the one of years ago.  </li>
            <li>Must be the Old Spice!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s in a Old Spice bottle!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for this to be exactly the same as it used to be, it&#x27;s not, and it never will be again.  </li>
            <li>In late August I gave Old Spice another chance hoping the results would be better.</li>
            <li>Thanks for everything I will be back.....</li>
            <li>The bottles of Old Spice \\&quot;Fresh\\</li>
            <li>I was looking for the Old Spice after shave lotion,I can not find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>Is there a way to exchange the Canadian Old Spice for the U.S.?    </li>
            <li>My dad specifically requested Old Spice Lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Old Spice,</li>
            <li>I cannot find this version of Old Spice on the shelves of any store around my house.  </li>
            <li>This product smells nothing like Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Old Spice stop making this years ago.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son wrote on his Christmas list: &amp;#34;After shave like dad use to wear...cheap drugstore stuff...</li>
            <li>Old Spice...</li>
            <li>Old time user of Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Amazon is about the only place that has it online at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I Have Used Old Spice</li>
            <li>Shipping was not bad either, it was less than $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a user of Old Spice Classic Aftershave almost daily</li>
            <li>&quot; I just purchased from Amazon have a different smell than the previous bottles I have bought locally over these many years.  </li>
            <li>Initially I did not like the new product but eventually got used to it.  </li>
            <li>Smells similar but not exactly the same as the original &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent from years ago.</li>
            <li>I started buying it on Amazon a few years ago and it was the same as I had purchased originally.  </li>
            <li>I am just sorry that the original fresh scent is no longer made.</li>
            <li>tan glass bottle with a blue sailboat, grey stopper, the whole 9 yards.  </li>
            <li>It used to come in a clear bottle and was a blue colored aftershave.</li>
            <li>but I always wanted to go back to the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; of Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the smell of the Old Spice I purchased from Amazon had a different odor than the ones I purchased at a local store.</li>
            <li>purchased this newer one at my local rite-aid (though haven&#x27;t seen it on the shelves since) and noticed it definitely smells different from the old formula.  </li>

            <li> Having used Old Spice Fresh AS for a number of years, I was disappointed when it stopped appearing on Wal-Mart and other store shelves . . .</li>
            <li> Opened the first and put it on--and something was horribly wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> After browsing the Old Spice website I saw that there are a few other scents of AS the OS makes and these are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Real man after shave....not some foo-foo spray from Needless Markup.</li>
            <li> This is on the heavy side for an aftershave, so if that turns you off that is not for you.  </li>
            <li> Not available in stores in my area any longer.</li>
            <li> A few years ago it disappeared from store shelves everywhere.</li>
            <li> I almost dry heaved, the bottle has clearly gone bad.</li>
            <li> However, it is impossible to find at my local supermarkets, drug stores, or the \\&quot;big box\\&quot; retailers (Walmart, Target, or Sam&#x27;s Club).  </li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon came through with flying colors.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand why it is so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding it as of late</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the old one, but hey, change isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know after shave could go bad, but this obviously had somehow.  </li>
            <li> This time it was even worse.</li>
            <li> Compared to the classic scent, this is terrible.</li>
            <li> All had the same awful stench.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> The aroma is 99.9% alcohol and just a faint aroma of lime.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this item, which is advertised as lotion, is not.  </li>
            <li> It smells of faint lime and lots of alcohol.</li>
            <li> Thought it must have just been a bad bottle, so tried a couple of others.  </li>
            <li> You will be horribly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hate.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst after shave I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item and it smelled like it had gone bad!!  </li>

            <li> What&#x27;s to review.  Real man after shave....not some foo-foo spray from Needless Markup.</li>
            <li> This smell is horrid and does not smell anything like the Fresh body wash or deodorant.  I almost dry heaved, the bottle has clearly gone bad.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Fresh is my favorite aftershave.  However, it is impossible to find at my local supermarkets, drug stores, or the \\&quot;big box\\&quot; retailers (Walmart, Target, or Sam&#x27;s Club).  My only source is Amazon.com and their affiliated merchants.      As usual, Amazon came through with flying colors.  The product was delivered within two days of my order and at a good price.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just won the lotto and started using Old Spice fresh. Women are constantly after me now. Must be the Old Spice!  Well there both lies. I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Fresh for thirty years. I have had a hard time finding it as of late so I bought another 30 year supply.</li>
            <li> This item has been discontinued in the store !!!! WHY I have no idea but I love the stuff and am happy I found it here.Thanks for everything I will be back.....</li>
            <li> This is just what my husband wanted, but it is the smaller version.  In the future, I will order the larger one, rather than this one.</li>
            <li> The bottles of Old Spice \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; I just purchased from Amazon have a different smell than the previous bottles I have bought locally over these many years.  Maybe they were manufactured at a different facility?</li>
            <li> Received 6 bottles of the Old Spice Fresh Scent after shave from OTCRX4U.  Opened the first and put it on--and something was horribly wrong with it.  Had a foul chemical smell.  (I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for many years, so I know how it should smell!)  Thought it must have just been a bad bottle, so tried a couple of others.  All had the same awful stench.  I didn&#x27;t know after shave could go bad, but this obviously had somehow.  Notified the seller, and they told me it wasn&#x27;t their problem, and sent me a link to the Proctor &amp; Gamble Q&amp;A website.  Seriously.  Wow--thanks for that brush-off.  Not impressed.  Don&#x27;t buy this product from this seller!!!</li>
            <li> The scent is not the original &amp;#34;Fresh.&amp;#34; But it was packaged nicely as described.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the Old Spice after shave lotion,I can not find it in the stores., this stuff really burns!</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles of Old Spice Fresh aftershave in late Winter/early Spring, and it had a heavy alcohol/minimal lime aroma about it. I was very unsatisfied about it, but life was busy. In late August I gave Old Spice another chance hoping the results would be better. This time it was even worse. The aroma is 99.9% alcohol and just a faint aroma of lime. The box got thrown away before I could get back to it, or I would have returned it. I am shaking the bottle every day trying to set free the lime portion, but it is still unsatisfactory.     I desire Amazon to check their inventory, find two good bttles and forward them to me, and I would be glad to return my two unacceptable bottles. This situation makes me very disatisfied with Old Spice, and unless Amazon performs as desired and requested, I will need to take my business elsewhere.    Amazon, I look forward to hearing from you---Jerry!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; scent Old Spice is hard to find in stores. Here it is at Amazon, my favorite place to shop. Came on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the smell of the Old Spice I purchased from Amazon had a different odor than the ones I purchased at a local store. After a little research I noticed that the Amazon Old Spice was manufactured in Canada and the local purchase was manufactured in the U.S. I really don&#x27;t care about the Canadian Old Spice odor. Why the difference? Is there a way to exchange the Canadian Old Spice for the U.S.?    Thank You,    Junius Smith</li>
            <li> Having used Old Spice Fresh AS for a number of years, I was disappointed when it stopped appearing on Wal-Mart and other store shelves . . . so I went looking online.  What I got is a product that cost twice as much as a regular bottle (with the unconscionable shipping charge--separate for each bottle!!), and a product which appears to be a concoction passed off as the original (I still had some of the original left, so I could compare the fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, I feel I&#x27;ve been had.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this anywhere at any store and amazon has it..I love amazon they aloways have everything you need and at great prices</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice after shave lotion, Fresh scent for 50 years and now  I can&#x27;t find it in stores. I&#x27;m glad I could find it on Amazon.com.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My dad specifically requested Old Spice Lotion After Shave and I was excited to find it. Unfortunately, this item, which is advertised as lotion, is not.  It is plain old aftershave.  Turns out you can only purchase the lotion in Europe.  So, if you are looking for lotion, search elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hate.  Even after P&amp;G reformulated the Old Spice products and scents, the fresh still seems to be very similar to the one of years ago.  Just like it says on the back of some of the boxes &amp;#34;If your grandfather didn&#x27;t use this, you wouldn&#x27;t be here.&amp;#34;  This is on the heavy side for an aftershave, so if that turns you off that is not for you.  The scent is initially pretty strong, as is the alcohol, both of which die off after a couple of minutes.  The scent lingers for maybe an hour and then can&#x27;t even notice it all.  Great aftershave.</li>
            <li> We finally found the frangrance we have used for 50 years.....it is the best...Don&#x27;t change it!!! And the service was fast!</li>
            <li> Because I like this aftershave. It the same kind that my Dad all used &amp; I guess that might the same reason that I use it. I also like the feel &amp; smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Old Spice, what more is there to say. I have been using these products for over 50 years and I hope to continue.</li>
            <li> Seems to smell like the original. Thought I might get a break on shipping and get a bunch but they still gouge you on the shipping and handling...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find after shave in the stores.. Bought this after shave for me at Christmas.. great way to Christmas shop..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are those out there that will like this stuff - you can have it for the cost of shipping! Smells kind of like Afta aftershave balm. Nothing of the classic old spice scent here though! My advice - stay away!</li>
            <li> For whatever reason I have yet to fathom I cannot find this version of Old Spice on the shelves of any store around my house.  I am glad I can get it off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the same to me.  I think they changed the formula</li>
            <li> classic..&lt;br /&gt;manly...&lt;br /&gt;not for teens...&lt;br /&gt;this is not axe...&lt;br /&gt;this is for men.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in Plastic bottle, not glass...oh well.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this since I started shaving. It&#x27;s the de-facto manly scent. The good thing is it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Both the Cologne and After Shave products are frauds compared to the scent that made these products famous more than fifty years ago.  The Old Spice that made this fragrance special has been modified beyond recognition.  Do not buy this product from Amazon, or a drug store, or any retailer.  You will be horribly disappointed.  My One Star rating is also a fraud.  This product deserves a ZERO.</li>
            <li> This is the worst after shave I have ever purchased. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s in a Old Spice bottle! The dollar store brand is better than this!</li>
            <li> Smells great and found for a good price on amazon</li>
            <li> Purchased this item and it smelled like it had gone bad!!  The good news it wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of money!  This stuff should have a shelf life!</li>
            <li> This product smells nothing like Old Spice. Old Spice stop making this years ago. It reminds me of a cheap Brute or English Leather. It has a blue tint to it. I have the original in my collection and this is a cheap substitute.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son wrote on his Christmas list: &amp;#34;After shave like dad use to wear...cheap drugstore stuff...Old Spice...I think.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;My dearly departed husband would be so proud of his son and maybe a bit insulted, which amuses me.  I love this product and my son smells great. . .which leads me to wonder, why is smelling good so important now? I wonder. . .</li>
            <li> I am a user of Old Spice Classic Aftershave almost daily and I love the scent and its performance. After browsing the Old Spice website I saw that there are a few other scents of AS the OS makes and these are hard to find in stores. I have never smelled the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent, but I did not care for this scent at all. It smells of faint lime and lots of alcohol. Compared to the classic scent, this is terrible. Just my opinion, but I will not be using this AS again, sticking with the classic scent.</li>
            <li> love the smellllllll it reminds me of my grandpa&#x27;s bathroom.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the new plastic bottle look just like the glass ones.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Fresh Scent used to be available at pharmacies and supermarkets but that is no longer the case.  I started buying it on Amazon a few years ago and it was the same as I had purchased originally.  However, that is no longer the case as it is now manufactured in Canada and is a bit different.  Initially I did not like the new product but eventually got used to it.  I use it daily and will continue to purchase it.  I am just sorry that the original fresh scent is no longer made.</li>
            <li> Good product doesn&#x27;t smell like the original not sure why.</li>
            <li> Product was not the fragrance that it should have been</li>
            <li> Old time user of Old Spice. Love the smell of the Fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I had a very old bottle of Old Spice Fresh AS, i think it was my first aftershave ever, and it seemed to last forever.  tan glass bottle with a blue sailboat, grey stopper, the whole 9 yards.  purchased this newer one at my local rite-aid (though haven&#x27;t seen it on the shelves since) and noticed it definitely smells different from the old formula.  at first i was very upset, refused to purchase any more products from proctor &amp; gamble, wrote them an email demanding my money back, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But rather than returning it, i hung onto it and used it.  it still has that reassuring sting after a good shave, that cooling sensation on the skin, and the soothing results.  i&#x27;ve grown to really like the new smell.  it&#x27;s not the old one, but hey, change isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing.  a little spicier than it used to be, sortof-kindof more along the lines of the old-spice Original scent, rather than the fresh scent, but not overwhelmingly spice-ridden like the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re looking for this to be exactly the same as it used to be, it&#x27;s not, and it never will be again.  feel free to pay upwards of $100 on ebay if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re dead-set on.  if you&#x27;re willing to try out the new smell, give this a go.  it&#x27;s reclaimed it&#x27;s place as my favorite AS, even if it is different from the original Fresh Scent.</li>
            <li> Smells similar but not exactly the same as the original &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent from years ago. Still an excellent aftershave with a clean fresh scent. Not available in stores in my area any longer.</li>
            <li> What I like to call &amp;#34;Ole Blue&amp;#34;. It used to come in a clear bottle and was a blue colored aftershave. A few years ago it disappeared from store shelves everywhere. All that is available now is Original, Gillette Cool Wave &amp; Adidias Dynamic Pulse. Those are pretty good but I always wanted to go back to the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; of Old Spice. For a while they even had a Pure Sport aftershave. It too is gone. I don&#x27;t understand why P&amp;G discontinued this popular stuff. The Fresh aftershave sells on eBay for large amounts of money. Amazon is about the only place that has it online at a reasonable price. Shipping was not bad either, it was less than $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the aftershave itself, the bottle seems to be much smaller and is now a plastic bottle instead of a glass bottle. I can&#x27;t tell if the scent is the same or not but it is pretty darn close to what I remember. Would be nice if they started selling this in stores again and went back to the clear glass bottles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of its vintage status - this is the perfect manly smell with old school charm! Impresses the ladies!</li>
            <li> I Have Used Old Spice After Shave Lotion, For Years,&lt;br /&gt;It The Onely One For Me,&lt;br /&gt;I Would Reat this Product To All My Friends,</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore, but found it here. Great for after shave, and have used for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t save much in spite of buying in bulk, but I still prefer it to anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> Bought for my father.  He loves the fresh scent.  And it smells so much better than the original scent.  I just don&#x27;t understand why it is so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> A joy for old-timers.</li>
