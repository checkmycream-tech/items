            <li>Not true, but Amazon is by far the best deal.</li>
            <li>It is worth evry penny.</li>
            <li>After two days of use, the bumps are almost clear and he isn&#x27;t feeling any more pain.</li>

            <li>great especially for long car trips and also for overnight diapers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product  and for several dollars a tube more at a minimum.</li>
            <li>It really seals out the wetness!</li>
            <li>And since using this product, her butt is TOTALLY clear!!!!</li>
            <li>good, but not magical.</li>
            <li>I have to use this on my baby and it keep her nice without diaper rash, will use this while she is little.</li>

            <li>Thanks for offering this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because I do prefer the clear Critic Aid best, since it is even less of a mess.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I even use this as she gets older and has those times when her privates get irritated from not wiping very well.  </li>
            <li>I heard some people paid as high $40</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend using this cream on anyone who has an incontenace problem.</li>
            <li>Even though this product is not all that messy compared to many of the diaper creams.</li>
            <li>both my girls have eczema, so their bottoms are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>He has had very sensitive skin since the day he was born.</li>
            <li>About to buy my 2nd tube, this stuff really works !  </li>
            <li>When he peed, the paste pilled up as if it absorbed the moisture leaving him dry.</li>
            <li>I always use the vendor who offers the prime shipping, both for the speed of&lt;br /&gt;shipping</li>
            <li>It has the same active ingredient as most of the well known creams (zinc oxide) but it only has 3 inactive ingredients, whereas Desitin has like 12-15 inactive ingredients that are unpronounceable.</li>
            <li>All were a little effective in the beginning but in the end it didn&#x27;t keep him dry enough and the rash persisted.</li>
            <li>Apparently the hospitals use the same thing.</li>
            <li>Ever since the first time my child&#x27;s diaper rash became raw.</li>
            <li>My 1 month old had developed severe case of diaper rash where he had open sores on his little bottom.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> both my girls have eczema, so their bottoms are very sensitive. great especially for long car trips and also for overnight diapers.</li>
            <li> Our son had a bad diaper rash with broken skin. We kept him home from daycare since our plan of attack was to give it lots of TLC and change him as soon as he #2. We used, individually and in combination, Boudreaux&#x27;s butt paste, petroleum jelly, desitin, and anti-fungal (OTC and prescribed by the doctor). All were a little effective in the beginning but in the end it didn&#x27;t keep him dry enough and the rash persisted. My wife found coloplast somewhere in the interwebs and ordered a tube. This product is great. It kept my son dry. When he peed, the paste pilled up as if it absorbed the moisture leaving him dry. His diaper rash healed very fast. We use it at least twice a day and definitely overnight.</li>
            <li> We Love this stuff!  This is by far my favorite diaper rash cream!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this to me... and I found this one is the best product I have used ever... This is the only one that cures my child&#x27;s diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Excellent !  About to buy my 2nd tube, this stuff really works !  I was blown away buy how good it works and the great price for it !</li>
            <li> Thank God for this miracle cream!  My Aunt is in a nursing home and her skin (bum) is constantly breaking down as she has to wear an adult diaper and is possibly not being changed often enough or not being changed properly.  This cream healed her skin quickly and painlessly.  It&#x27;s the only cream we use on her and are trying to get the nursing home to supply it.</li>
            <li> I am a RN on a GI floor at a children&#x27;s hospital! We use this on our patients that get severe diaper rash. It works wonders! I ordered it from Amazon for my newborn that was having problems and no creams were working! It is amazing and gentle!</li>
            <li> I have 2 special needs daughters. this stuff is a life saver for thier skin. I tried a lot of products before this.  this is it for us!</li>
            <li> Best diaper rash cream I&#x27;ve tried. Works extremely fast and is very smooth &amp; moist. Definitely recommend it! Already purchased two tubes and will continue to use/buy it until my baby will be out of diapers.</li>
            <li> This product does an excellent job of soothing the inflamed skin of the person I care for suffering from incontinence.</li>
            <li> This works amazing! My daughter only has a 1/3 of her colon due to Hirschprung&#x27;s Disease. And she needs a cream that will control a rash due to loose acidic stools (she has approx 6 per day). And since using this product, her butt is TOTALLY clear!!!! No rash whatsoever!! It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. And we have tried them all.. literally. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because I do prefer the clear Critic Aid best, since it is even less of a mess. Even though this product is not all that messy compared to many of the diaper creams. It also has NO scent to it. Which I Love since she needs to have this on every diaper change. I don&#x27;t like the smell of some of the diaper creams. If you are looking for a product to help your little one&#x27;s diaper rash and clear it up forever this is the product!!!</li>
            <li> Works very good on preventing diaper rash. We were sent home with a tube from the hospital after having our daughter. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a store.</li>
            <li> Absolute best diaper rash cream!!!!!  Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I have never used anything else that worked as well as this product.</li>
            <li> What a great deal on a hard to find product. Rite-Aid  said they could order it, but didn&#x27;t have on hand. The Kaiser Hospital pharmacy had it for $15.00. I got it for $14.50 total after shipping! Plus it really goes a long way if you just use a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;It looks and feels like baby powder when it is rubbed into the skin. Very waterproof as well. I heard some people paid as high $40&lt;br /&gt;for this!! Not true, but Amazon is by far the best deal.</li>
            <li> This product goes well with antifungal cream to eliminate any sores on the skin. You must use both skin paste and antifungal to be effective.</li>
            <li> Dr.told me to try it,what the heck,nothing was working,this cream was the best.I started to heal</li>
            <li> This product is essential for the prevention of skin breakdown in the elderly. My 90 year old mother uses it regularly and has had great success keeping her skin intact and healthy.</li>
            <li> I used it for several years.  A good product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ot having a colostomy bag anymore, I use this still due to a tempermental jpouch. A child&#x27;s diaper rash cream does not completely help with the itching and pIn, this product does.</li>
            <li> The immediate relief this gives my daughter is almost miraculous.  I have tried everything, EVERYTHING both otc and rx.  This is the best. It is worth evry penny.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has worked to treat and prevent diaper rash on my son. He has had very sensitive skin since the day he was born. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> My daughter was in the neo-natal intensive care unit at birth and this is the product they use and sent me home with.  It is REALLY good and I&#x27;ve used it ever since.  I even use this as she gets older and has those times when her privates get irritated from not wiping very well.  One thing new users should know is that it goes on thick (like zinc sun cream)and as it absorbs, it balls up into little chunks like tiny cottage cheese.  I know that sounds gross, but this occurance actually indicates that it&#x27;s doing its job and wicking off irritants.  Don&#x27;t let this scare you off, it does an amazing job of healing.</li>
            <li> This barrier cream is the best protectant I&#x27;ve ever used. My husband wears diapers because of an incontenace issue with his bowels. He recently broke out in a diaper rash that looked like red raised painful bumps on the inside of the rectal area. His doctor didn&#x27;t know what it was. an appointment has been set up with a dermatologist.  I saw the reviews for this barrier cream and decided to give it a try. After two days of use, the bumps are almost clear and he isn&#x27;t feeling any more pain. I highly reccomend using this cream on anyone who has an incontenace problem.</li>
            <li> This product has saved the day,months....after my grandson&#x27;s surgery. Don&#x27;t bother to try other less expensive&lt;br /&gt;products, this is expensive and worth the money. You can save a little by watching the prices and using&lt;br /&gt;amazon prime when available. I always use the vendor who offers the prime shipping, both for the speed of&lt;br /&gt;shipping and the cost of shipping (which otherwise is per tube and prohibitively expensive.) only a few speciality pharmacies carry&lt;br /&gt;this product  and for several dollars a tube more at a minimum. So save yourself the drive.i am extremely&lt;br /&gt;particular about what I buy for my grandson and this is my contribution to his recovery.</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this product. It was the only thing that worked on my babys diaper rash while in the nicu and I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores!</li>
            <li> This is great for someone who has to wear depends all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried formulas specifically designed to repair cracks in my heels, and it took days to work. With the moisture barrier paste, the pain stopped ASAP and it took only 2 days for the crack to heal !</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and I cant live without using it... The best cream I would ever recommend to anyone. I used it once and the baby but does not have any rush. I would recommend it definitely a life saver</li>
            <li> My baby had a horrible rush on his bottom. This helped him get better.</li>
            <li> For healing the skin, even when it is open, this paste is the best I ever used, cover the blister to give chance to the&lt;br /&gt;new skin to grow, I started ordering 1 now I winded up ordering 4, it is fantastic</li>
            <li> Worked within one day for my baby&#x27;s diaper rash!</li>
            <li> I have to use this on my baby and it keep her nice without diaper rash, will use this while she is little.</li>
            <li> My 1 month old had developed severe case of diaper rash where he had open sores on his little bottom.I&#x27;ve used everything.  the nurses at the hospital ICU  gave me a 6oz tube of this stuff to take.  Works awesome! ran out and just ordered 2 more tubes.  It really seals out the wetness! Diaper rash gone within the week.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this diaper cream! It has the same active ingredient as most of the well known creams (zinc oxide) but it only has 3 inactive ingredients, whereas Desitin has like 12-15 inactive ingredients that are unpronounceable. I have always had problems with Desitin making rashes way worse for my babies, but Critic-Aid has always taken care of rashes within a day. We discovered it while my youngest was in the NICU. The hospital used it. We switched and have never looked back!</li>
            <li> This is the best diaper cream ever. Ever since the first time my child&#x27;s diaper rash became raw. No matter what we used, including doctor&#x27;s recommendation which were hydrocortisone mix with any diaper cream. Nothing worked until we found this. Apparently the hospitals use the same thing. A little goes a long way and it literally works over night. We don&#x27;t leave the house without it.</li>
            <li> good, but not magical.</li>
            <li> Seems to work for my elder mother when nothing else does. Great to have it delivered to our door at a good price.</li>
            <li> Best diaper cream on the market!  Clears up diaper rash immediately.</li>
