            <li>I love the hair tie</li>
            <li>but it may work for a more manga-eren look</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This is a really great wig, like its comfortable and soft and quite easy to put on!</li>
            <li>I love how the wig came in so quickly!</li>
            <li>could be better, but not bad for what you paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks fine for cosplaying Eren,  but just note that it is not as ~brown~ as the picture.  </li>
            <li>It needs some trimming and a but if styling,but that perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Item as described and size is accurate.</li>
            <li>This wig arrived really fast which was nice.</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s very nice overall.</li>
            <li>Overall spectacular wig~!</li>
            <li>Like compared to some of my other wigs where I kind of have to fight with, I just hastily put on this wig with a pony tail on just for a quick look, and it was easy!!</li>
            <li>Came very fast!</li>
            <li>It is so soft, the color is nice, and it looks real!</li>
            <li>This wig is nice and full, however the color is little bit more reddish than in the picture.  </li>
            <li>The wig fits super well and the color is just right.</li>
            <li>I really love how early it came.</li>
            <li>I really love how soft it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, breathable, realistic, and nice looking.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>there are great layers and you honestly won&#x27;t have to do too much cutting.</li>
            <li>Well, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wig for first time cosplayers.</li>
            <li>:) The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is for the difference in color.</li>
            <li>way the wig is pre-styled is pretty on point</li>
            <li>a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so, so, so much!</li>
            <li>The wig was nice but the bangs were extremely long so if you are not one for styling I do not suggest this one also the wig is very shiny</li>
            <li>It came in super early.</li>
            <li>recieved it super early, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind doing a little styling on your own</li>
            <li>i really didn&#x27;t care too much for this wig.</li>
            <li>, VERY accurate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not one to write reviews, but this wig is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>FAST delivery.</li>
            <li>and o haven&#x27;t really styled it much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, to people who want to Cosplay as Eren Jaeger from Attack on Titans!</li>
            <li>It looked great and only needed a small trim</li>
            <li>overall, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I tried talking decent pictures</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit thin, but overall a good product!</li>
            <li>I just wish it would be a little more darker.</li>
            <li>Other than all, that, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>the fact that i have to style it, and cut it a little sucks, but other then that it is a great wig :3</li>
            <li>The back is perfect, the front is what needs some trimming, styling and or cutting.</li>
            <li>Oh and it came two weeks early!</li>
            <li>It came in so early!</li>
            <li>The back is a little long but the front is styled perfectly, I know they probably made the back long</li>
            <li>And like the other reviews, yeah it was a bit long, in the bangs and back for me - but it only needs a trim :) Also its pretty much styled like  </li>
            <li>but the back is a little longer than it should be, which is okay because you can fix it with styling</li>
            <li>Although, the wig itself is soft, silky but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and doesnt rub anywhere.</li>
            <li>It really made my stress be less.</li>

            <li> the back is a bit long</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a little patch of fuzzy hair on the top of the wig [a very common thing to have with cosplay wigs]</li>
            <li> downside though is that it was long like..</li>
            <li> a tad long- but nothing a pair of scissors could fix!</li>
            <li> Only thing is its a little darker in the pic but its overall PERFECTION!</li>
            <li> Only it is a little snug, but it works.</li>
            <li> The one I received was a bit thin, no way to really style it without showing the cap, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it if you know how to trim carefully.</li>
            <li> The expected delivery was July 30-August 15.</li>
            <li> A lot faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s supposed to be expected</li>
            <li> Also, the hair pieces framing the face is a little long too, so</li>
            <li> the inside has the usual &amp;#34;bra strap&amp;#34; adjuster to make it smaller.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as dark as the photo</li>
            <li> I trimmed the front and styled it a little, from other reviews I read that no matter what you should trim the front.</li>
            <li> : I have messaged around with it, only cutting a tiny bit of it at long areas.</li>
            <li> I straightened a little. . .</li>
            <li> the front is a little poofy and dense, so if thats not to your taste you will have to take some time to cut it.</li>
            <li> It sheds a little</li>
            <li> I hoped this helped a few people out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me though I have really short hair</li>
            <li> But the wig is extremely thin!</li>
            <li> Unless they have //somewhat of a skill with cutting.</li>
            <li> and the hairs were sticking up crazy.</li>
            <li> I am displeased with this :(  </li>

            <li> the fact that i have to style it, and cut it a little sucks, but other then that it is a great wig :3</li>
            <li> i really didn&#x27;t care too much for this wig. The one I received was a bit thin, no way to really style it without showing the cap, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Quality materials and workmanship. Item as described and size is accurate. Very pleased with purchase Would recommend to family and friends..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, wig is amazing!! Perfect price.</li>
            <li> Well, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wig for first time cosplayers. Unless they have //somewhat of a skill with cutting. The back is perfect, the front is what needs some trimming, styling and or cutting. For me, the wig came way earlier than the suspected delivery date. Ordered: Jan 15 Arrived January 25th! Although, the wig itself is soft, silky but the top I straightened a little. . . Overall spectacular wig~!</li>
            <li> This wig arrived really fast which was nice. But the wig is extremely thin! ESPECIALLY the bag of the wig. You can totally see the wig meeting through the hairs. and the hairs were sticking up crazy. I am displeased with this :(  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This wig is nice and full, however the color is little bit more reddish than in the picture.  It looks fine for cosplaying Eren,  but just note that it is not as ~brown~ as the picture.  It is (of course) longer than in the picture but that gives you the room to style it just the way you want! :) The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is for the difference in color.</li>
            <li> Came very fast! The wig is good for people who have upcoming conventions and who don&#x27;t have time to wait months to receive their items.&lt;br /&gt;The way the wig is pre-styled is pretty on point but the back is a little longer than it should be, which is okay because you can fix it with styling no problem--&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit thin, but overall a good product!</li>
            <li> recieved it super early, fast shipping. it&#x27;s soft and doesnt rub anywhere. the inside has the usual &amp;#34;bra strap&amp;#34; adjuster to make it smaller. the front is a little poofy and dense, so if thats not to your taste you will have to take some time to cut it. after that though, its perefction!!</li>
            <li> I love how the wig came in so quickly! It was supposed to come in like June, but it came in May 12! But the wig seems lighter then in the picture, but mehhh, it must be lighting. I just wish it would be a little more darker. Also, the hair pieces framing the face is a little long too, so I recommend it if you know how to trim carefully. Other than all, that, it&#x27;s fine. Can&#x27;t wait to cosplay as Eren!!</li>
            <li> This is a really great wig, like its comfortable and soft and quite easy to put on! Like compared to some of my other wigs where I kind of have to fight with, I just hastily put on this wig with a pony tail on just for a quick look, and it was easy!! And like the other reviews, yeah it was a bit long, in the bangs and back for me - but it only needs a trim :) Also its pretty much styled like  the picture, like not as spiked but if you fix it then it&#x27;ll look like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice thickness and the colour is like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The downside though is that it was long like.. LONG&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t mind styling, so overall it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;P.S I love the hair tie i use it all the time!</li>
            <li> PERFECTION!!!&lt;br /&gt;SUPER soft!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived two days after I ordered it!&lt;br /&gt;Very, VERY accurate.&lt;br /&gt;All I need to do is trim the bangs a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so, so, so much!</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing! It is so soft, the color is nice, and it looks real! They even put a hair tie in the package! Unfortunately for me though I have really short hair so I can&#x27;t use it but I do have a friend that would love it! I will defiantly be buying from here again. Oh and it came two weeks early!</li>
            <li> I Just got the wig in last week and I&#x27;m in love! It came in super early. The wig fits super well and the color is just right. It is a tad long- but nothing a pair of scissors could fix! I highly recommend this wig, its perfect!!</li>
            <li> I loved the wig, it looks just like erens hair and it is so comfy to put on! It is amazing</li>
            <li> The wig was great with my sons cosplays he just needs to style it but it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> It got here a lot sooner than I was told...It looked great and only needed a small trim</li>
            <li> I really love how early it came. The expected delivery was July 30-August 15. I recieved it July 16 and I was extremly happy. It took about 2 weeks? A lot faster than I expected. I really love how soft it is. Its not the SAME brown as the picture,but I don&#x27;t mind. It needs some trimming and a but if styling,but that perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as dark as the photo and there&#x27;s a little patch of fuzzy hair on the top of the wig [a very common thing to have with cosplay wigs] the back is a bit long but it may work for a more manga-eren look i guess? there are great layers and you honestly won&#x27;t have to do too much cutting. just a trim on the back and some customizing on the face because everyone&#x27;s different. overall, it&#x27;s not bad. could be better, but not bad for what you paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, i ordered this product on the 14th of november and just got it on the 24th of november so that was really really great.</li>
            <li> I love this wig. It&#x27;s perfect for Eren and I am also using it for another cosplay. Only it is a little snug, but it works.</li>
            <li> This wig is really nice. The back is a little long but the front is styled perfectly, I know they probably made the back long so you could cut it yourself but It&#x27;s very nice overall. If you don&#x27;t mind doing a little styling on your own it&#x27;s great. :)</li>
            <li> Not one to write reviews, but this wig is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bangs on the sides of my face are a tad longer than the characters, but who buys a wig and doesn&#x27;t alter it after purchase, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars. Great product. FAST delivery.</li>
            <li> Great item! Will be ordering again soon!</li>
            <li> It came in so early! It really made my stress be less. It is the perfect color in my opinion. There is also a lot of hair, but if you which you can style!! :) I trimmed the front and styled it a little, from other reviews I read that no matter what you should trim the front. It&#x27;s working well and I can&#x27;t wait to use it at youmacon!</li>
            <li> Great wig! it came on time and its is a perfect fit! Only thing is its a little darker in the pic but its overall PERFECTION!</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s soft, breathable, realistic, and nice looking.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrives its in a yellow package. Inside the package, you&#x27;ll find a plastic bag which contains the wig and the wig cap. Shown in picture #1.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have messaged around with it, only cutting a tiny bit of it at long areas. But all in all, it&#x27;s a nice wig. It sheds a little but that&#x27;s supposed to be expected, I haven&#x27;t washed it yet and o haven&#x27;t really styled it much. So what you see is basically what you get. I tried talking decent pictures but it was actually some what of a challenge, since it looks a lot nicer on heads then on my hand hah!! But the last picture is of me wearing the wig. It&#x27;s just the right height and the perfect style and color for Eren!! I highly recommend it, to people who want to Cosplay as Eren Jaeger from Attack on Titans! I hoped this helped a few people out. Byeee.</li>
            <li> The wig was nice but the bangs were extremely long so if you are not one for styling I do not suggest this one also the wig is very shiny so if you do but it put some baby powder omit to get rid of the shine</li>
