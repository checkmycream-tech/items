            <li>Very good product!</li>
            <li>Worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Great sun protection!  </li>
            <li>Ordered three bottles of this before a vacation to Mexico and LOVED IT!</li>
            <li>I would still buy it again, because it performs beautifully, but I hope L&#x27;oreal makes some changes to their spray can.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen for those with fragrance and preservative (i.e. parabens &amp; propylene glycol) allergies.</li>
            <li>It has no added fragrance and a great feel on the skin as well.</li>
            <li>I just love this sunscreen!!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Great product easy to use.</li>
            <li>it was great and worked fine.</li>
            <li>The formula of this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to use it any more.</li>
            <li>I love the formula and somehow after using this, I feel that my skin has gotten smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I started the trip with 3 cans.  </li>
            <li>Got a lovely tan without burning.</li>
            <li>I spray it on my arms and legs and use my hands to get a more even application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find a sunscreen that works with all my allergies.</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail today, and while it&#x27;s not sunny out, I am impressed simply by the texture and feeling of it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is spf 50.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use (spray mechanism bottle).</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky, nor does it have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and auburn hair, so I burn easily, and my skin is sensitive to chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be accurate for both water and sweat resistance.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen was gentle and effective in and out of the water.  </li>
            <li>Sprays badly, not even at all</li>
            <li>Super convenient to just spray all over and head out to the beach.</li>
            <li>It sprays on as a clear mist, but still needs to be spread more evenly by hand.</li>
            <li>Arrived very carefully packaged which was nice and came super quick.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert, so a good sunblock is essential.  </li>
            <li>The entire line is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I only wish there was more sunscreen per container.</li>
            <li>Was able to get a tiny bit to dribble out</li>
            <li>Works good, a little shiny on the skin if you spray too much on.</li>
            <li>Bottle was full but completely out of propellant when it arrived.</li>
            <li>The can is easy to hold and operate, but I am giving only 4 stars because it ran out of gas before it ran out of juice.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the few fragrance free spray chemical sunscreens available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply and while it&#x27;s a little bit greasy the smell and ease of application make it worth it.</li>
            <li>It is literary sunscreen + lotion in a spraycan, it left my legs smooth and soft for hours!</li>
            <li>If it looks too shiny, can reduce the shine by passing gently over dthe skin with a soft cotton towel.</li>
            <li>Guess I just have to pay the few bucks more and be picky about where I buy it from.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no sunscreen \\&quot;odor\\&quot;, no white residue, no staining of clothing, furniture or pool floats, lasts ALL day long (EVEN after swimming) with NO burning (I am fair-skinned)!</li>
            <li>The quality of the sunscreen far surpasses the quality of the delivery system.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend, will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>Also, distance to spray is important for you to control how much and how hard you spray!</li>
            <li>Strong chemical smell, and son broke out in what looked like extreme sunburn (it wasn&#x27;t - outside only briefly)</li>
            <li>(I was in a pinch and really needed sunscreen right there and now) after pressing the button VERY hard, but it will no longer even dribble.</li>
            <li>But, if you spray in your eyes it will irritate a little and you will have to clean around the eyes to get it off with a wet cloth.</li>

            <li> but that&#x27;s a small inconvenience really.</li>
            <li> I just spent a week camping and water skiing - out on the boat or in the water from early morning to almost dark - without any sunburned bits.  </li>
            <li> As long as this does the job at preventing sunburn, I am sold on this for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> But not greasy or wet.</li>
            <li> Unlike Neutrogena &amp; other sunscreens which I have used in past, this neither leaves a white residue nor makes your skin sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li> It was dented and was half empty when I got it -_-</li>
            <li> I wish it sprayed upside down though.</li>
            <li> just oozes out.&lt;br /&gt;went</li>
            <li> on top of the eyes, because a trace of it can go down close to your eyes and can be annoying!</li>
            <li> no more.</li>
            <li> I have skin that breaks out like crazy over just about every other sunscreen, this is one of the very few I can use.</li>
            <li> It is oily and I feel bad with the heavy alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it leaves an oily film on the skin which never soaks in.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s now in the trash.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen from L&#x27;oreal was very painful &amp; burned my eyes and nose as you can see in the pictures.</li>

            <li> Very good product! However, when applying to face, you need to cover your eyes a relatively big area esp. on top of the eyes, because a trace of it can go down close to your eyes and can be annoying! Also, distance to spray is important for you to control how much and how hard you spray!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no sunscreen \\&quot;odor\\&quot;, no white residue, no staining of clothing, furniture or pool floats, lasts ALL day long (EVEN after swimming) with NO burning (I am fair-skinned)! LOVE this stuff! The entire line is fantastic! Your skin feels soft and silky insteady of sticky and tacky (like with other sunscreens). We used to use the high-end Neutrogena line...no more. Only Sublime!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few fragrance free spray chemical sunscreens available. Unfortunately it leaves an oily film on the skin which never soaks in.</li>
            <li> The formula of this product is amazing. There is no residue leftover, no sticky feeling, etc. It is literary sunscreen + lotion in a spraycan, it left my legs smooth and soft for hours! There is an issue with the packaging though.</li>
            <li> It is oily and I feel bad with the heavy alcohol smell. I don&#x27;t want to use it any more.</li>
            <li> Strong chemical smell, and son broke out in what looked like extreme sunburn (it wasn&#x27;t - outside only briefly) within 12 hours of using.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s now in the trash.</li>
            <li> Works good, a little shiny on the skin if you spray too much on. But not greasy or wet. If it looks too shiny, can reduce the shine by passing gently over dthe skin with a soft cotton towel. But, if you spray in your eyes it will irritate a little and you will have to clean around the eyes to get it off with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li> It was dented and was half empty when I got it -_-</li>

            <li> I just spent a week camping and water skiing - out on the boat or in the water from early morning to almost dark - without any sunburned bits.  I have fair skin and auburn hair, so I burn easily, and my skin is sensitive to chemicals.  This sunscreen was gentle and effective in and out of the water.  It sprays on as a clear mist, but still needs to be spread more evenly by hand. It didn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky, nor does it have a strong scent.  I am the only one in our party who used this sunscreen, and the only one who walked away with no sunburn. The can is easy to hold and operate, but I am giving only 4 stars because it ran out of gas before it ran out of juice.  Despite vigorous shaking before every use, I can hear the sunscreen liquid when I shake the can, but nothing comes out.  I&#x27;m glad I started the trip with 3 cans.  The quality of the sunscreen far surpasses the quality of the delivery system.  I would still buy it again, because it performs beautifully, but I hope L&#x27;oreal makes some changes to their spray can.</li>
            <li> Got a lovely tan without burning.Great product easy to use.Nice smell. Embellished the skin.This is a great product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sprays badly, not even at all</li>
            <li> [...]    [...]    [...]  The sunscreen from L&#x27;oreal was very painful &amp; burned my eyes and nose as you can see in the pictures. I tried a skin healing ointment but I am still in pain and now require a dermatologist to recover the damage caused.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen for those with fragrance and preservative (i.e. parabens &amp; propylene glycol) allergies. I spray it on my arms and legs and use my hands to get a more even application. I use a separate sunscreen for my face and neck so I haven&#x27;t had the problem others have had with stinging eyes. I only wish there was more sunscreen per container. I&#x27;m so glad to find a sunscreen that works with all my allergies.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert, so a good sunblock is essential.  I got this in the mail today, and while it&#x27;s not sunny out, I am impressed simply by the texture and feeling of it on my skin.  NOT greasy AT ALL, not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on my skin.  As long as this does the job at preventing sunburn, I am sold on this for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> sprayer is broke.&lt;br /&gt;liquid just oozes out.&lt;br /&gt;went into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;wasted money. will never buy again.&lt;br /&gt;they got one sale out of me.  won&#x27;t get another !</li>
            <li> Bottle was full but completely out of propellant when it arrived. Was able to get a tiny bit to dribble out (I was in a pinch and really needed sunscreen right there and now) after pressing the button VERY hard, but it will no longer even dribble. I have skin that breaks out like crazy over just about every other sunscreen, this is one of the very few I can use. It has no added fragrance and a great feel on the skin as well. When I bought it at Target it was great and worked fine. Guess I just have to pay the few bucks more and be picky about where I buy it from.</li>
            <li> I love that this is spf 50. It&#x27;s really easy to apply and while it&#x27;s a little bit greasy the smell and ease of application make it worth it. I wish it sprayed upside down though. Every time I flip the bottle around to do the back of my legs it stops working though, but that&#x27;s a small inconvenience really.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Non-greasy, goes on evenly.  Great sun protection!  Seems to be accurate for both water and sweat resistance.</li>
            <li> I took this all the way to Cancun Mexico with me only to find out that it would not spray.</li>
