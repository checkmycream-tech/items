            <li>Pretty good bundle and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Shipment arrived much sooner than I expected and in excellent choice condition!</li>
            <li>great selection, a bit surprised at the small sizes but all in all great.</li>
            <li>I have rosaeca and was told this product would be great for it, I found it to be extremely drying though ;(</li>
            <li>This is a great collection, as I&#x27;ve bought a few of them.</li>
            <li>anyways, i&#x27;ve already opened and used part of two of the bottles and gave one to a friend and honestly I don&#x27;t want to pay shipping to send it back so just letting it go</li>
            <li>very much recommend this selection.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty though and exactly as pictured</li>
            <li>the seller should have been more specific in the description on the product&lt;br</li>
            <li>be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>so her polish would probably be through first one I wear.</li>
            <li>thought the lighter one was more grey</li>
            <li>I think this was due to my negligence but the bottles are super tiny (sample size ) and will only last 2 polishes at best.  </li>
            <li>Polish came fast.</li>
            <li>I got these to try out the colors, and I&#x27;ll definitely have to buy the full size of any ones I like.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but honestly i thought it was more black red than black brown when i ordered</li>
            <li>The polish lasts long and is very pretty when applied.</li>
            <li>it is khaki and the darker one looks black to most eyes, but upon closer look is a dark dark brown nice for autumn</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell because the color was completely hardened.)</li>
            <li>I love the smaller bottles so that I don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li>The glitter is cool, very dark silver/gun</li>
            <li>Stays on nails long and drys fast.</li>
            <li>contaced by seller with offer to return item and have new one shipped, though what&#x27;s the point of that if it&#x27;s the same item...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I feel duped because they were teeny tiny bottles. I should have read the description closer, but didn&#x27;t realize nail polish came in such small sizes. But, it is good quality polish.</li>
            <li> one of the enamels came dry</li>
            <li> My sister loved the colors!</li>
            <li> Loves these colors but they were smaller then I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> All the colors are great, they shine and on some one coat is enough and the glitter polish is super easy to take off. Which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. The polish lasts long and is very pretty when applied. I love the smaller bottles so that I don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li> great selection, a bit surprised at the small sizes but all in all great. good for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;I very much recommend this selection.</li>
            <li> I have rosaeca and was told this product would be great for it, I found it to be extremely drying though ;(</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize it until you&#x27;re holding it, but it is extremely small. I got these to try out the colors, and I&#x27;ll definitely have to buy the full size of any ones I like. I&#x27;ve applied two coats on both hands once, and the bottle is halfway used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they just didn&#x27;t check it before they sent it or if they played kick-the-can one day but were missing the can and so used the box of nail polish but one of the bottles was broken. (Up at the top and the wand was snapped in half or missing - I can&#x27;t tell because the color was completely hardened.) For as much as these cost for the tiny bottles - it was disappointing.</li>

            <li> Colors are excellent, price point is great for the quality and I love the shiny sheen that lasted days after putting it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sample product so it is only enough to paint both hands one time.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, love the quality, love everything about it! As soon as I run out I am def ordering it again!</li>
            <li> Polish came fast. I think this was due to my negligence but the bottles are super tiny (sample size ) and will only last 2 polishes at best.  The colors are pretty though and exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> way smaller than i thought. i like the color but its not enough if i wanted to use it again</li>
            <li> when i read the description and saw .5fl oz i though it was per bottle like every other nail polish out there, how disappointed i was that it was the total volume and nowhere in the details does it mention that they&#x27;re sample size bottles. very sad and disappointed about this. the seller should have been more specific in the description on the product&lt;br /&gt;.... update 4/22/13&lt;br /&gt;was contaced by seller with offer to return item and have new one shipped, though what&#x27;s the point of that if it&#x27;s the same item... anyways, i&#x27;ve already opened and used part of two of the bottles and gave one to a friend and honestly I don&#x27;t want to pay shipping to send it back so just letting it go</li>
            <li> This is a great collection, as I&#x27;ve bought a few of them. The color went on easy and lasted a week without chipping. I loved this!!!</li>
            <li> 。☆。。☆ 。&lt;br /&gt;★。＼\｜/／。★&lt;br /&gt;  I used this for my nail Spa. customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;★。／/｜\＼。★&lt;br /&gt;。☆。。☆</li>
            <li> The glitter is cool, very dark silver/gun metal.&lt;br /&gt;The turquoise looks streaky until you apply a third coat, and that coat makes it look black unless in sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;The other two colors are browns.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the lighter one was more grey it is khaki and the darker one looks black to most eyes, but upon closer look is a dark dark brown nice for autumn but honestly i thought it was more black red than black brown when i ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;Opi Nicole also doesnt last as long as regular opi as far as chipping goes.</li>
            <li> LOVE THOSE KARDASHIANS AND THEIR AMAZING COLORS :) AND THESE ARE AWESOME...PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME FANTASTIC... WILL DEF ORDER AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors except follow me on glitter. I can&#x27;t wait until my next pedicure. I love me some Khloe so her polish would probably be through first one I wear.</li>
            <li> All the colors are great, they shine and on some one coat is enough and the glitter polish is super easy to take off. Which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived much sooner than I expected and in excellent choice condition! Pretty good bundle and reasonably priced. I underestimated the size of each bottle, but my niece had no complaints. Great buying experience without a doubt.</li>
