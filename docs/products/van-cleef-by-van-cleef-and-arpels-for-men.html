            <li>excellent product&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered this awesome cologne years ago while living in Miami, but was told (in error)</li>
            <li>that is ALL that is needed), lasts all day, has excellent sillage, and makes me smell like a King.  </li>
            <li>He loved the cologne!!</li>
            <li>It seems to be ideal for evening events.</li>
            <li>The leather, spice, and powdery rose come together perfectly, and make for an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Amazon stood by there guarantee of great customer service.</li>
            <li>A men&#x27;s cologne with a great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>all still around, all smell great, though maybe not quite as good as they used to.</li>
            <li>I consider this &amp;#34; for me &amp;#34; to be the best of the best for sure in the top 3 colognes for men.</li>
            <li>Used to use this many years ago and decided to get this for a change, my faviort is bijan for men but this is a nice change !!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good to wear here-and-there in the workplace, I think,</li>
            <li>So happy this is easy to get now!</li>
            <li>Great product very good price fast shipment</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not the best choice for a first date, I&#x27;ll say that.</li>
            <li>We were happy with the cologne, happy with the price and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It settles in quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice is that Van Cleef PH lasts all day, just put it on in the morning before work (3-4 sprays max) and you&#x27;ll smell it an inch to the skin after five.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Timeless classic with awesome smell!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initial thoughts after reading most of the reviews was that this must be a brilliant cologne if everyone is writing such great reviews for it.</li>
            <li>Always my favorite</li>
            <li>and he love it.</li>
            <li>this once smell better and has been reformulated?</li>
            <li>I love how it smells</li>
            <li>and I love how it smells on him.  </li>
            <li>WE LOVE</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li>and I am sure you will be returning for more.</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying Tsar, which smells much better.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite and I am glad to see it can still be purchased at Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>so make sure this is the type of smell you&#x27;re going for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>husband and sons just love this item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>would buy it again over and over many times.</li>
            <li>For a sophisticated scent, this is tops.</li>
            <li>Many compliments on this.</li>
            <li>Love love love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Most women like it.</li>
            <li>but I have gotten interesting reactions from co-workers, men and women alike.</li>
            <li>My favorite , since I was 18&#x27;  .</li>
            <li>I use this cologne for the last 25 years and I love it!!!</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li>This one is 100% original and the delivery was very quick!</li>
            <li>While no fragrance is good for everyone, this is a favorite of persons wanting a classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent can be best described as exotic and clean with light use will last all day or night.</li>
            <li>This fragrance has sort of a spicy, woodsy scent to it that is smooth, refreshing and just, hhhhmmmmm............</li>
            <li>Always a  pleasant classic.</li>
            <li>HE SMELLS SEXY AND EXCITING!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy (one shot to each side of my neck,</li>
            <li>SIMPLE you want to smell great and get a ton of comments</li>
            <li>and I will live with that and make sure that if I ever order any more from you all That</li>
            <li>the plus side, Tsar is certainly workplace friendly, as no one will smell it on you unless you are giving them a piggyback ride or are lying on top of them, both of which circumstances are uncommon enough in the workplace so as to preclude their likelihood of occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PERFUME FOR MAN OLD 35 YEARS , REALLY LIKE SCENT ,YOUR SMELL REMAINS ALL DAY</li>
            <li>, the one good thing was Amazon credited me back all my money.</li>
            <li>I used this a lot many years ago and have started to reuse it again, I still really like the scent, but it seems like someone is/was tinkering with the fixative component of this,</li>
            <li>I have used this as an aftershave very sparingly of course, for many years.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, non-oily fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Bottle is a classic glass great overall value.</li>
            <li>Great to get it this way, delivered and for MUCH less....</li>
            <li>Eminent projection and sileage, and great longevity, rather like a dirty nuclear bomb in effect and duration, and about as pleasant for those caught in the radius of effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the realms of literature or classical music, I cannot easily select favorite works.  </li>
            <li>Very pleasant scent although not so long lasting.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied with this product it smells like cheap soap not even close to what its supposed to smell</li>
            <li>If this sounds like your idea of fragrant fun, have at it.</li>
            <li>Since the first time my brother used it, years ago, he is loyal to the smell.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line: unless this falls in price to the level of Nausea Voyage, there are many better options for less money.</li>
            <li>Great smell as always, though hard to find.</li>
            <li>Tsar certainly won&#x27;t appeal to most young modern male fragrance buyers who love calone, seaweed, and apple.</li>
            <li>A real ladies killer!</li>
            <li>Classy scent, manly but not hip or too cool.</li>
            <li>Even Grey Flannel, which is currently much cheaper than Tsar, smells much better and still has some of its cojones attached.</li>
            <li>Supposedly this is a leather and rose chypre, full of complexity and nuances, with an intricate scent pyramid and a complex development over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray is quite massive, and the strength of the cologne is strong - 2 sprays max will do you in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  strong enough to be cologne.</li>
            <li>but I liked it so much I find myself using it everyday after my gym workout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about that.  </li>
            <li>this Christmas was a real surprise.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 54 ,,,thanks</li>
            <li>Many of the old vintage powerhouses have not been reformulated into the same decreptitude that Tsar has; Azzarro Pour Homme, Lapidus, Aramis, Havana, Tuscany, Yatagan:</li>
            <li>I bought this only to use for special occasions</li>
            <li>This original Van Cleef &amp; Arpels men&#x27;s fragrance is my absolute unchallenged favorite of all time since I began using it in the late 1970s or early 1980s.  </li>
            <li>I bought one bottle, but will likely buy another just in case the rumor comes true.</li>
            <li>Get Azzarro PH or Lapidus for less money and have more fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend it for everyone; and my wife likes it. .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clean and refreshing like Acqua or Chanel Bleau</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m way beyond returning the two bottles of this radioactive waste.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and triggers many responses like, &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think in the future I&#x27;ll just stick to ones that I have actually tested on myself because it seems as good as it is for other people it didn&#x27;t quite suit me.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>Love this scent from year past.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for giving this classic back.</li>
            <li>BUT NOT RECOMMEND FOR DAILY USE ONLY SPECIAL OCCASIONS</li>
            <li>A fantastic long lasting gentleman&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Way too strong and heavy..</li>
            <li>This product smelled old.</li>
            <li>At best I can narrow down such lists to a few items, but they change constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And even weak Tsar smells better than many modern fragrances, alas, but that&#x27;s beyond the point.</li>
            <li>This smells like an older scent, but definitely one I like.  </li>
            <li>I personally stock one dark and one light smell in my cologne spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those who have smelled it seem mildly disconcerted and slightly defensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really has the quality of a much more expensive fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, overall, it was a good blind buy.  </li>
            <li>This cologne has always been my dad&#x27;s favorite, but I&#x27;ve had the inconvenience of buying before from other websites and the product is not original.</li>
            <li>Smells classy and expensive but perhaps better if never worn</li>
            <li>that it was should give it its ability to be long lasting, it does last as long as I remember it lasting, still very much like it and will buy it again</li>
            <li>And if your tastes are for more refined \\&quot;older\\&quot; stuff, the dull ghostwater found in bottles of Tsar holds little appeal at the current price point.</li>

            <li> At best I can narrow down such lists to a few items, but they change constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And even weak Tsar smells better than many modern fragrances, alas, but that&#x27;s beyond the point.</li>
            <li> This smells like an older scent, but definitely one I like.  </li>
            <li> I personally stock one dark and one light smell in my cologne spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those who have smelled it seem mildly disconcerted and slightly defensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really has the quality of a much more expensive fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, overall, it was a good blind buy.  </li>
            <li> This cologne has always been my dad&#x27;s favorite, but I&#x27;ve had the inconvenience of buying before from other websites and the product is not original.</li>
            <li> Smells classy and expensive but perhaps better if never worn</li>
            <li> that it was should give it its ability to be long lasting, it does last as long as I remember it lasting, still very much like it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> And if your tastes are for more refined \\&quot;older\\&quot; stuff, the dull ghostwater found in bottles of Tsar holds little appeal at the current price point.</li>
            <li> Will last a long time and could be used as a daily scent.</li>
            <li> find myself, however, drawn to the &#x27;older&#x27; scents like Polo Green.  </li>
            <li> He said &amp;#34;Good price and long lasting fragrance&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> FAKE AND CHEAP SMELLING</li>
            <li> Genuine and not a copy or fake.</li>
            <li> Simply put - if you like spicy, masculine fragrances then there is no better than this.  </li>
            <li> My husband had been looking for this cologne for a long time.</li>
            <li> Had been trying to find this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other exhibits in the realm of the Former Powerhouse Roll of Dishonor are worse than Tsar: the current Halston Z14, Ungaro III, and Paco Rabanne all have been even more neglected / manhandled into smelling weak / unpleasant/ or both.</li>
            <li> The smell is ponderous and unpleasant, not floral, or sharp or sweet or spicy, just sort of blunt and very noticeable.</li>
            <li> It says, \\&quot;Listen to me, don&#x27;t trust me\\&quot; in a single whiff.</li>
            <li> Being in a hurry at the time to replenish my supply, I ordered this swill, thinking it was what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not attempt to describe the fragrance, as other information is already posted here about it..</li>
            <li> Never uses other eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> Dark, spicy, semi-musky smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a suave, dark side here.</li>
            <li> a previous one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is subtle and lasts almost the entire day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not true for men&#x27;s fragrances.  </li>
            <li> To me, it starts out with a burst of bergamot (sour citrus) and juniper, and then within 5 minutes, it smells like soap, and then stays that way for a few hours thereafter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a cheap chemically smelling fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong item (same container as another product).  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> It became hard to get in the US for years, so I would buy 2 or 3 bottles</li>
            <li> IT WAS HARD TO FIND IN THE STORE.</li>
            <li> Not a good smell, first product from Amazon that was terrible,  waste of money...</li>
            <li> I thought I would try it anyway, not good.  </li>
            <li> It arrived broken, it was not what I thought it was , as I have used Tsar for 20 years</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a heavy base note of amber and musk, and some resinous notes in there, and that&#x27;s what I get for the rest of the day afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t quite work out that way for</li>
            <li> I bought this product &amp; was totally unhappy.</li>
            <li> Yes, I was an idiot.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hard to find. Always my favorite</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne in Paris 30 years ago and have been wearing ever since. It became hard to get in the US for years, so I would buy 2 or 3 bottles everytime I was in Europe! So happy this is easy to get now! I love it!</li>
            <li> MY FATHER ABSOUTELY LOVES THIS COLOGNE. I COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT ANYWHERE BUT HERE. AND THE PRICE INCREDIBLE&lt;br /&gt;NOW I KNOW WHERE I CAN PURCHASE IT AND FOR A GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> Always a  pleasant classic.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied with this product it smells like cheap soap not even close to what its supposed to smell</li>
            <li> He said &amp;#34;Good price and long lasting fragrance&amp;#34; . This is the second time we bought it and he love it.</li>
            <li> Came before Christmas as promised!</li>
            <li> My husband had been looking for this cologne for a long time. We were happy with the cologne, happy with the price and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not a good smell, first product from Amazon that was terrible,  waste of money...</li>
            <li> Not what I thought I was ordering, but I kept it</li>
            <li> Yes, I was an idiot.  I was looking for Tsar, a product in *VERY SIMILAR* packaging.  Being in a hurry at the time to replenish my supply, I ordered this swill, thinking it was what I wanted.  Nope.  I didn&#x27;t figure it out until I sprayed myself with this bilge water and noticed the fragrance was off.  Now I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m way beyond returning the two bottles of this radioactive waste.  How about packaging this just differently enough so that people zipping through will see the difference?</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong item (same container as another product).  I thought I would try it anyway, not good.  Called to see if I it could be returned, no it can not.  Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I bought this product &amp; was totally unhappy. It arrived broken, it was not what I thought it was , as I have used Tsar for 20 years, the one good thing was Amazon credited me back all my money. Amazon stood by there guarantee of great customer service. I feel very happy about continuing to order from them.</li>
            <li> Supposedly this is a leather and rose chypre, full of complexity and nuances, with an intricate scent pyramid and a complex development over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get none of that. To me, it starts out with a burst of bergamot (sour citrus) and juniper, and then within 5 minutes, it smells like soap, and then stays that way for a few hours thereafter. There&#x27;s a heavy base note of amber and musk, and some resinous notes in there, and that&#x27;s what I get for the rest of the day afterwards. The smell is ponderous and unpleasant, not floral, or sharp or sweet or spicy, just sort of blunt and very noticeable. Eminent projection and sileage, and great longevity, rather like a dirty nuclear bomb in effect and duration, and about as pleasant for those caught in the radius of effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Basenotes, there&#x27;s supposed to be another dozen elements in the scent mix, including leather, vetiver, carnation, orris, jasmine, etc. To me, the soapy mix overpowers whatever else is in here, and it smells like Irish Spring on steroids forever. If this sounds like your idea of fragrant fun, have at it. but for me, this is a big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did this once smell better and has been reformulated? Did I get a skunky bottle? Couldn&#x27;t say, but I am not risking buying another bottle to check. This one has been kicking around since 1978, so someone must like this, but I am not joining the fan club.re. Many of the old vintage powerhouses have not been reformulated into the same decreptitude that Tsar has; Azzarro Pour Homme, Lapidus, Aramis, Havana, Tuscany, Yatagan: all still around, all smell great, though maybe not quite as good as they used to. Even Grey Flannel, which is currently much cheaper than Tsar, smells much better and still has some of its cojones attached. So if you want to see what the 80s (or earlier!) smelled like, you have a lot of options. Tsar certainly won&#x27;t appeal to most young modern male fragrance buyers who love calone, seaweed, and apple. And if your tastes are for more refined \\&quot;older\\&quot; stuff, the dull ghostwater found in bottles of Tsar holds little appeal at the current price point. Get Azzarro PH or Lapidus for less money and have more fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, Tsar is certainly workplace friendly, as no one will smell it on you unless you are giving them a piggyback ride or are lying on top of them, both of which circumstances are uncommon enough in the workplace so as to preclude their likelihood of occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other exhibits in the realm of the Former Powerhouse Roll of Dishonor are worse than Tsar: the current Halston Z14, Ungaro III, and Paco Rabanne all have been even more neglected / manhandled into smelling weak / unpleasant/ or both. And even weak Tsar smells better than many modern fragrances, alas, but that&#x27;s beyond the point. Bottom line: unless this falls in price to the level of Nausea Voyage, there are many better options for less money.</li>
            <li> I received as described the Van Cleef and Arpels perfume which I purchased for my spouse.  I love how it smells and I love how it smells on him.  Thank you Amazon for continuing to have such an oldie but still a GOODIE!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT PERFUME FOR MAN OLD 35 YEARS , REALLY LIKE SCENT ,YOUR SMELL REMAINS ALL DAY BUT NOT RECOMMEND FOR DAILY USE ONLY SPECIAL OCCASIONS</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT VALUE AND QUALITY. IT WAS HARD TO FIND IN THE STORE. MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN WEARING THIS FOR SOMETIME. HE SMELLS SEXY AND EXCITING! WE LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SANDRA PHL</li>
            <li> This was not what I ordered and so I got stuck with it and I will live with that and make sure that if I ever order any more from you all That It Don&#x27;t Happen Again!&lt;br /&gt; The person selling it needs to mark the advertisement correct because it is not what he says</li>
            <li> This is the best price for this anywhere.  I used to pay $50+ at Bloomingdales but they don&#x27;t carry it any more. Great to get it this way, delivered and for MUCH less....</li>
            <li> A men&#x27;s cologne with a great fragrance.  Long lasting and triggers many responses like, &amp;#34;what is that wonderful cologne aroma that you are using?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This cologne has always been my dad&#x27;s favorite, but I&#x27;ve had the inconvenience of buying before from other websites and the product is not original. This one is 100% original and the delivery was very quick! Great!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t meant to order this product.  I went to order Van Cleef By Van Cleef and Arpels TSAR for men. I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;the smell of this fragrance....</li>
            <li> SIMPLE you want to smell great and get a ton of comments give this a shot and I am sure you will be returning for more. I have used this sent for over 35 years. I consider this &amp;#34; for me &amp;#34; to be the best of the best for sure in the top 3 colognes for men.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong product. I thought I was buying Tsar, which smells much better.</li>
            <li> Great smell as always, though hard to find. The scent can be best described as exotic and clean with light use will last all day or night. Bottle is a classic glass great overall value.</li>
            <li> This product smelled old. Just terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Nice scam as you cannot send liquid back.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you!</li>
            <li> This fragrance has sort of a spicy, woodsy scent to it that is smooth, refreshing and just, hhhhmmmmm............nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really has the quality of a much more expensive fragrance. (EDT).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a cheap chemically smelling fragrance at all.  I&#x27;m very picky about that.  This smells like a much more expensive fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A fantastic long lasting gentleman&#x27;s fragrance.  While no fragrance is good for everyone, this is a favorite of persons wanting a classic fragrance. Once again Amazon came through.</li>
            <li> Love this scent from year past.  It is my favorite and I am glad to see it can still be purchased at Amazon.com.  Smells wonderful and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> FAKE AND CHEAP SMELLING</li>
            <li> Way too strong and heavy.. Smells classy and expensive but perhaps better if never worn</li>
            <li> Great product very good price fast shipment I recommend</li>
            <li> Had been trying to find this for a long time.  I was so excited when I found it on Amazon.  Great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid-twenties boss, I need a mid-twenties boss cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself, however, drawn to the &#x27;older&#x27; scents like Polo Green.  I think this was formulated in 1986 or something.  This smells like an older scent, but definitely one I like.  The spray is quite massive, and the strength of the cologne is strong - 2 sprays max will do you in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It settles in quite nicely.  Dark, spicy, semi-musky smell.  It&#x27;s not clean and refreshing like Acqua or Chanel Bleau so make sure this is the type of smell you&#x27;re going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I personally stock one dark and one light smell in my cologne spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, overall, it was a good blind buy.  Will last a long time and could be used as a daily scent.</li>
            <li> excellent product&lt;br /&gt;trhnaks&lt;br /&gt;important the time to receive&lt;br /&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> In the realms of literature or classical music, I cannot easily select favorite works.  At best I can narrow down such lists to a few items, but they change constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not true for men&#x27;s fragrances.  This original Van Cleef &amp; Arpels men&#x27;s fragrance is my absolute unchallenged favorite of all time since I began using it in the late 1970s or early 1980s.  As its popularity declined over the years, it became more scarce and expensive (at one point, I received a bottle as a gift and my understanding is that the giver paid almost $70 for it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers here have touted this low price here on Amazon, and I wholeheartedly second that!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not attempt to describe the fragrance, as other information is already posted here about it.. but I will suggest that readers of these reviews try out this fragrance if they haven&#x27;t already done so.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> I came across this cologne through Amazon recommendations after I&#x27;d bought a previous one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial thoughts after reading most of the reviews was that this must be a brilliant cologne if everyone is writing such great reviews for it. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t quite work out that way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think in the future I&#x27;ll just stick to ones that I have actually tested on myself because it seems as good as it is for other people it didn&#x27;t quite suit me.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh, non-oily fragrance that lasts all day. I highly reccommend it for everyone; and my wife likes it. .</li>
            <li> Used to use this many years ago and decided to get this for a change, my faviort is bijan for men but this is a nice change !!</li>
            <li> Since the first time my brother used it, years ago, he is loyal to the smell.  Never uses other eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> I used this a lot many years ago and have started to reuse it again, I still really like the scent, but it seems like someone is/was tinkering with the fixative component of this, that it was should give it its ability to be long lasting, it does last as long as I remember it lasting, still very much like it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;My husband and sons just love this item.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again over and over many times.</li>
            <li> I discovered this awesome cologne years ago while living in Miami, but was told (in error) it was no longer being produced. To find it online this Christmas was a real surprise. I bought one bottle, but will likely buy another just in case the rumor comes true. Classy scent, manly but not hip or too cool. For a sophisticated scent, this is tops.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a good price. Get lots of compliments on the aroma. A real ladies killer! Even at my age!</li>
            <li> Many compliments on this.</li>
            <li> Love love love this fragrance. Always have and always will. Genuine and not a copy or fake. Thanks for giving this classic back.</li>
            <li> I have used this as an aftershave very sparingly of course, for many years. It&#x27;s  strong enough to be cologne. Has a nice fragrance. Don&#x27;t use too much. Most women like it.</li>
            <li> I use this cologne for the last 25 years and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This scent has been my go-to scent since 2009.  It goes on easy (one shot to each side of my neck, that is ALL that is needed), lasts all day, has excellent sillage, and makes me smell like a King.  The leather, spice, and powdery rose come together perfectly, and make for an excellent product.  Simply put - if you like spicy, masculine fragrances then there is no better than this.  Period.</li>
            <li> I bought this only to use for special occasions but I liked it so much I find myself using it everyday after my gym workout. It is subtle and lasts almost the entire day.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant scent although not so long lasting. It seems to be ideal for evening events. I truly recommend it</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a good-looking musk with a beer belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a suave, dark side here. What&#x27;s nice is that Van Cleef PH lasts all day, just put it on in the morning before work (3-4 sprays max) and you&#x27;ll smell it an inch to the skin after five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to wear here-and-there in the workplace, I think, but I have gotten interesting reactions from co-workers, men and women alike. Those who have smelled it seem mildly disconcerted and slightly defensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best choice for a first date, I&#x27;ll say that. This is what I call an \\&quot;explorative\\&quot; cologne. It says, \\&quot;Listen to me, don&#x27;t trust me\\&quot; in a single whiff.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to a friend. He loved the cologne!!</li>
            <li> My favorite , since I was 18&#x27;  . I&#x27;m now 54 ,,,thanks</li>
            <li> Timeless classic with awesome smell!</li>
