            <li>This is a great product!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>One if the very best products for good looking skin.</li>
            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>After reading the great reviews I decided I&#x27;d start with this one.</li>
            <li>Good for my skin</li>
            <li>and I had nice glow to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I tried the 20% first and it works great.</li>
            <li>TOO WEAK..GET 50% OR BETTER</li>
            <li>after MANY COATS</li>
            <li>Maybe I will try this in winter age spots will be here more in summer.</li>
            <li>The jury is still out on that one, and I will update this review as needed, but here are a couple of interesting things</li>
            <li>Not so many acne scars or oil on the face after 1 month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>My skin is lighter and brighter and looks more like it did when I was 15 or 16 (am now 26).</li>
            <li>so I could use it more than once a week.  </li>
            <li>I looked up a utube demonstration on how to use this product safely.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The results equalled brighter more even toned skin.</li>
            <li>I love this peel.</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with Lactic Acid.</li>
            <li>I think the quality is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a medium brown complexed AA woman and this was my first time doing my own peel at home.</li>
            <li>Perfect for someone with a little hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
            <li>I felt comfortable with this one.....</li>
            <li>, maybe the thread wasn&#x27;t clean or something.</li>
            <li>Great product does what it says just follow the instructions and be very careful also</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d stayed strong a whole week before the peel</li>
            <li>Lactic acid is supposed to have a syrupy texture (and to be yellowish most of the time); this is completely clear and watery</li>
            <li>If you are careful and gentle with your skin, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>fantastic light, no down time peel.</li>
            <li>Great start off peel if your not ready to try something in a high dose</li>
            <li>I use the peel on my clients, great on sensitive skin, smooth the skin, kills bacteria, dissolve dead cell skin.</li>
            <li>this was my first experience with a peel.  </li>
            <li>if you dont notice an improvement the first day or second throughout the week your skin becomes better.</li>
            <li>I struggled to keep it on my face for two whole minutes!</li>
            <li>I got the 20% peel, but diluted it 50/50 with water since it was my first peel.  </li>
            <li>I have never done home chemical peels, but watched a video on youtube and figured it looked easy enough.  </li>
            <li>As with the 10%, this seems to be fading the few scars I have left (the 10% faded almost all my acne scars), does not seem to be very effective at removing blackheads, and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>That is the only &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; I get, but that&#x27;s fine with me because I still saw results.</li>
            <li>The pictures you see must be from a real Dr.s office.</li>
            <li>It stings just a tiny bit but helps exfoliate my skin and keep it smooth.  </li>
            <li>Plus it is much cheaper than going to a medi-spa.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never done this before, and my skin is not that sensitive, so I went for the 20% fearing that 10% would not be strong enough.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for new peelers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Lactic Acid peels</li>
            <li>highly recommend for professional use.</li>
            <li>and it is not for very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using other products similar but the quality of this one is better</li>
            <li>My first day of trying it I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect that day,but the next day I noticed that literally all of the small bumps were gone</li>
            <li>Anyway, the next day after my peel all of the tiny bumps were completely gone!!!!!</li>
            <li>It does wonders for a clear and youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I knew what to expect as far as discomfort was concerned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>I like that it didnt seem like some other peels I have purchased which have cheap bottles and labels and would lead someone to believe they are being mixed up in someones home.</li>
            <li>I am super careful with sunscreen because during the summer months especially it&#x27;s critical to protect your skin after a peel.</li>
            <li>but after just one peel my entire eyebrow area was clear!</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t peel after direct use of this, but my skin gets flakey in the following days after use.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d try 10% or less first.</li>
            <li>and it got very red and dry and started to peel in a way I wouldn&#x27;t want to go out in public if my whole face looked like that.</li>
            <li>I had my eyebrows treaded for the first time a week before the peel and the threading caused a ton of teeny tiny little bumps to form where the hair was removed??</li>
            <li>The ony way to reverse discoloration and dark spots without the high price of microdermoabrasion at a beauty spa.</li>

            <li> I was very careful with my face for several days before doing the peel in an effort to not cause any agitation.</li>

            <li> But do be careful and follow directions.</li>
            <li> so I just cleanse before with Cetaphil, do the peel, rinse with LOTS of very cold water, and then leave my face bare for a day or two, and I use Coppertone Sensitive Faces 50SPF waterproof UVA/UVB broad spectrum zinc oxide if I go outside (face &amp; neck).</li>
            <li> I assume this is due to the fact that the skin on my knee is thicker/tougher than the skin on my face.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 4 or 5 times and have noticed a little difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> leave products on for a few minutes each then wash off.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Exfoliating, but not too harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why....</li>
            <li> , just asure you can use it in your skin at least once a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the expensive ones and I&#x27;ve been duped with imitation products too.  </li>
            <li> ,I had these weird breakout that left me withsmall bumps and weird welts over my face,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think the quality is pretty good. worked well for me, no complaints.......I like that it didnt seem like some other peels I have purchased which have cheap bottles and labels and would lead someone to believe they are being mixed up in someones home. I felt comfortable with this one.....</li>
            <li> TOO WEAK..GET 50% OR BETTER</li>
            <li> Ive used this and keep thinking it has to work. Well it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve had peels done before and I have sensitive skin. So I bought the 20%. Well nothing.... Made my face a dry (didn&#x27;t peel) after MANY COATS.. But did break it out. Do not like it at all. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. The pictures you see must be from a real Dr.s office. It&#x27;s def not from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done this before, and my skin is not that sensitive, so I went for the 20% fearing that 10% would not be strong enough. I spot tested a dark spot I had on my nose and it got very red and dry and started to peel in a way I wouldn&#x27;t want to go out in public if my whole face looked like that. I think I&#x27;d try 10% or less first.</li>
            <li> The instructions meke you think u should leave this to a doctor! Maybe I will try this in winter age spots will be here more in summer.</li>
            <li> I use the peel on my clients, great on sensitive skin, smooth the skin, kills bacteria, dissolve dead cell skin. fantastic light, no down time peel. highly recommend for professional use.</li>
            <li> Good for my skin I have been using other products similar but the quality of this one is better, just asure you can use it in your skin at least once a week</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on that one, and I will update this review as needed, but here are a couple of interesting things I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This came with no box, no instructions whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;2) Lactic acid is supposed to have a syrupy texture (and to be yellowish most of the time); this is completely clear and watery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Lactic Acid peels so I tried the 20% first and it works great. Great results. Face is improving. Not so many acne scars or oil on the face after 1 month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Well, I have had this for a few months now, and my hyper-pigmentation and scars have almost totally faded and that is with inconsistent use. I wish I took before and after pictures. My face doesn&#x27;t peel after direct use of this, but my skin gets flakey in the following days after use. That is the only &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; I get, but that&#x27;s fine with me because I still saw results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I am very familiar with Lactic Acid. I&#x27;ve bought the expensive ones and I&#x27;ve been duped with imitation products too.  This is the one I will stick with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been doing the 10% lactic (also by Dermalure) for a few months (15 peels), and after the 10% no longer made my face tingle because my skin wasn&#x27;t as sensitive, I moved up to this...as with the 10% I&#x27;m starting slow (2 mins 1st time, then 3 mins 4 days later, etc.) As with the 10%, this seems to be fading the few scars I have left (the 10% faded almost all my acne scars), does not seem to be very effective at removing blackheads, and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Using alcohol or witch hazel seems to make the tingling stronger, and baking soda gives me temporary red spots and burns (I&#x27;m allergic to aluminum I think), so I just cleanse before with Cetaphil, do the peel, rinse with LOTS of very cold water, and then leave my face bare for a day or two, and I use Coppertone Sensitive Faces 50SPF waterproof UVA/UVB broad spectrum zinc oxide if I go outside (face &amp; neck). At night I use a humidifier in my room, and Cetaphil moisturizing lotion for all skin types on my face and neck. This peel makes my pimples disappear, but can be drying if you don&#x27;t moisturize. I tried using a hyalauronic acid serum under the moisturizer at night but it gave me milia and irritated my skin. My skin is lighter and brighter and looks more like it did when I was 15 or 16 (am now 26). I had lines on my forehead that seem to be thinner and less noticeable now, and my skin is a bit tighter/firmer. If you are careful and gentle with your skin, this is a great product. I don&#x27;t do any scrubbing/exfoliating or pulling at my skin, this peel does all the work.</li>
            <li> this was my first experience with a peel.  I chose the mildest form so I could use it more than once a week.  I&#x27;ve used it about 4 or 5 times and have noticed a little difference in my skin.  It stings just a tiny bit but helps exfoliate my skin and keep it smooth.  Hopefully with regular use, some of my age spots will totally go away.</li>
            <li> One if the very best products for good looking skin. But you have to follow directions carefully and it is not for very sensitive skin.  I looked up a utube demonstration on how to use this product safely. It does wonders for a clear and youthful looking skin.But do be careful and follow directions.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work burn the skin</li>
            <li> Great product. Perfect for someone with a little hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions and apply carefully.&lt;br /&gt;Only leave products on for a few minutes each then wash off.&lt;br /&gt;This did lighten the skin that darkened die to acne spots</li>
            <li> The ony way to reverse discoloration and dark spots without the high price of microdermoabrasion at a beauty spa. Use every&lt;br /&gt;three days along with neautralizer.</li>
            <li> Great start off peel if your not ready to try something in a high dose,I had these weird breakout that left me withsmall bumps and weird welts over my face,My first day of trying it I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect that day,but the next day I noticed that literally all of the small bumps were gone and I had nice glow to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I cant wait to try my next peel to see the results I see that my face has brighten and the texture and overall appearance has become alot better.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you dont notice an improvement the first day or second throughout the week your skin becomes better.</li>
            <li> Great product does what it says just follow the instructions and be very careful also a tip I use is that I cover my upper lip area with some Vaseline prior to applying to the rest of my face</li>
            <li> Great product! Exfoliating, but not too harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium brown complexed AA woman and this was my first time doing my own peel at home. I have had two professional peels in the past so I knew what to expect as far as discomfort was concerned. After reading the great reviews I decided I&#x27;d start with this one. As a tester I tried it first on a small dark spot I have on my knee.I only planned to leave it on two minutes but after I felt no tingle I left it only for six!!! That&#x27;s alot I know, but that was four days ago and I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reaction to it. I assume this is due to the fact that the skin on my knee is thicker/tougher than the skin on my face. After I neutralized my knee I did my face and neck. The tingling discomfort was instant. I was very careful with my face for several days before doing the peel in an effort to not cause any agitation. I used natural black african soap and Cellbone glycolic toner. So I was suprised when the itchy nasty tingly sensation was almost instant. I struggled to keep it on my face for two whole minutes! But I&#x27;m glad I did. The results equalled brighter more even toned skin. I had my eyebrows treaded for the first time a week before the peel and the threading caused a ton of teeny tiny little bumps to form where the hair was removed??? I&#x27;m not really sure why....I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and I don&#x27;t have any acne, maybe the thread wasn&#x27;t clean or something. Anyway, the next day after my peel all of the tiny bumps were completely gone!!!!! They&#x27;d stayed strong a whole week before the peel but after just one peel my entire eyebrow area was clear! I love this peel. I plan to peel one a week. I am super careful with sunscreen because during the summer months especially it&#x27;s critical to protect your skin after a peel. I highly recommend this product for new peelers.</li>
            <li> I have never done home chemical peels, but watched a video on youtube and figured it looked easy enough.  Plus it is much cheaper than going to a medi-spa.  I got the 20% peel, but diluted it 50/50 with water since it was my first peel.  After continued use I will likely stop diluting it.  I felt it working instantly after applying.  Left it on for only 1.5 minutes, then rinsed with baking soda and water mix to neutralize acid.  My skin is much smoother after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product!</li>
