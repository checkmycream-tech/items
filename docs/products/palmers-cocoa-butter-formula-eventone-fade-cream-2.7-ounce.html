    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 this year and my skin looks great !</li>
            <li>Great result!!</li>
            <li>eventone fade cream is very good.</li>
            <li>Product smells great and feels wonderful on skin though no spots faded yet....</li>
            <li>Works beautifully and the price can&#x27;t be beat for the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product and I felt compelled to write a review because I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Palmer&#x27;s products but there must be some ingredient in this cream to which I am allergic.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much more confident!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there that can help with my skin discoloration and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve found thus far.</li>
            <li>time i couldn&#x27;t find this and settled with another brand, this delivers so much more moisture compared to the competition.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter and more youthful looking.  </li>
            <li>I will say this, the smell is much better than most products on the market</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other all, I like Ambi better, and I was hoping this would have a cocoa butter smell because I love the cocoa butter smell</li>
            <li>Regardless of the time, I am glad with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a dewey appearance on my skin since, having had oily skin a lot, I try to avoid.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing this again!:)</li>
            <li>Both of my hands look pretty good now.</li>
            <li>On the plus side this product smells good and is very soft and creamy, however the pro&#x27;s do not beat the cons in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m as light as i can get</li>
            <li>I really loving this product working really well for me.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t greasy which I enjoy.  </li>
            <li>This is basically a light concealer.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a fade cream for my hands which have light sun spots.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a guy 21 yrs old with fair skin</li>
            <li>At first I thought it caused some redness but not any more.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results for the most part so far.</li>
            <li>this is a true find.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product right away after my first trial.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product right away after my first trial.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised of the rating in Amazon because I would think it would get a better review considering what&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>I bought this in my local store and it was tinted, and I really liked that.  </li>
            <li>so i cant say that its worth my money</li>
            <li>This product worked wonderfully for my facial dark spots.</li>
            <li>I also came across information stating that Hydroquinone is banned in most countries, and the USA is only allowed to use up to 2.0% in products.</li>
            <li>This is a white cream,  which I wasn&#x27;t sure of at first</li>
            <li>but I love it just the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the results given the low price.</li>
            <li>It will take awhile for me to get use to this cream because it is the first time I am using it.</li>
            <li>At first I saw a difference in a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely purchase this again here because I have not seen this in stores.</li>
            <li>My discolorations were already pretty much gone, but this helps to keep them gone!</li>
            <li>but the cream is very greasy.</li>
            <li>The intense scratching lefted scars on my skin.</li>
            <li>This cream really worked to even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>, now it&#x27;s just too much perfume,</li>
            <li>Really like this cream.</li>
            <li>There are other product that are similar but not as good a price.</li>
            <li>Finding the best product to get rid of dark spots is hard, but this product shows promising results.  </li>
            <li>I was rather surprised that nothing really happened because Palmer&#x27;s usually has good products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>After purchasing this I wanted to do some research to find out exactly how this product (and similar ones) work.</li>
            <li>I thought this was like other Eventone items by palmers and was free of Hydroquinone, but I was surprised to read the label..  </li>
            <li>I use to keep my skin clear and even.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb completely even if you use sparingly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and so far i haven&#x27;t seen any difference.  </li>
            <li>I stuck with it though for 1.5 months so far because I feel like the tone of the skin on my face changed after giving birth.</li>
            <li>The spots on the backs of my hands are completely gone now.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>The trick is to use a scrub or exfoliation wash to clean oils, dead skin, dirt or makeup off</li>
            <li>I seen a major improvement!</li>
            <li>It has a funny smell and doesn&#x27;t blend well with moisturizers or other skin products.</li>
            <li>I usually love every Palmer&#x27;s product, but this one was just way too thick!  </li>
            <li>I had a considerable amount of discoloration on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>I saw as it was working: My right hand saw a little redness on the actual spots only, the skin got dry in those areas and peeled off in layers as the spot disappeared.</li>
            <li>Really for a little over $6</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s a small but effective secret.</li>
            <li> If you tanned as a teenager or spent time out of doors, and you begin to see dark spots, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just use on my less sensitive areas</li>
            <li> Also sun screen is recommend when/after using this product (and similar ones) due to re-darkening of the skin.</li>
            <li> Like tiny dabs due to the fact that it is Not like it sister cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely in the darkest end of the color pad and this still lightened dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin with very noticeable dark spots from acne, and this product hardly helped.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick and must be applied gently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 wks and guess I expected a miracle.</li>
            <li> The smell is toooooo perfume-y which is why my rating for this product is 1 star minus</li>
            <li> I hate the smell other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li> It does not have a bad smell, go on smooth, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark spots</li>
            <li> It has even helped fade spots that my other stuff missed!</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so thick, a little goes a long way so lasts a longer time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using PCBF Eventone Fade Cream because I have very sensitive skin, but I have not had any reactions.</li>
            <li> but this product leaves my skin a little greasy</li>
            <li> I just dust my face with a little powder, and put on some mascara</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using this product religiously for 3 months I failed to see much improvement.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice a day everyday.</li>
            <li> The cream is so hard and dry that I have a hard time spreading it on my skin.</li>
            <li> the formulation is extremely thick, I hate that it has sunscreen on it as I use it on my backside that never sees the light of day.  </li>
            <li> No more spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very heavy.</li>
            <li> My stupid mistake, I should have done my research first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;you will have a hard time finding this in stores, which is why i turned to amazon.&lt;br /&gt;last</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, even Walmart who carries the brand doesn&#x27;t keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> I had several age spots on  my face and hands from the sun that were impossible to cover with makeup products.  </li>
            <li> This cream has a thick consistency, but not too thick and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> There is a powdery floral fragrance that I despise.&lt;br /&gt;However it does work as well as can be expected, and the thickness and smell don&#x27;t drive me as crazy since I use it on my bum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed, was really hoping this would even out my skin tone :(</li>
            <li> Very thick, sticky, and waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible, it makes my face red, itchy, and little rash all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> If you didnt know me you&#x27;d suspect I&#x27;m an addict or worse.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this cream as the jar arrived broken and shards from the jar were embedded intone realm.</li>
            <li> its only made things worst.</li>
            <li> It smells weird.</li>
            <li> I usually like Palmer&#x27;s products, but this was awful.</li>
            <li> Also when I get a scratch or bruises, I apply this cream on and the marks are not visible, very faint to see.</li>
            <li> my face broke out from this product so badly about two days of using it..</li>
            <li> I hate this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, but it didn&#x27;t agree with me!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i have been using this product for a month and haven&#x27;t seen any results. The smell is horrible, it makes my face red, itchy, and little rash all over my face and neck. its only made things worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as light as i can get but i keep using lightening creams as a preventitive measure.&lt;br /&gt;you will have a hard time finding this in stores, which is why i turned to amazon.&lt;br /&gt;last time i couldn&#x27;t find this and settled with another brand, this delivers so much more moisture compared to the competition. porcelana cream just flakes off when you rub it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there that can help with my skin discoloration and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve found thus far. I&#x27;m actually surprised of the rating in Amazon because I would think it would get a better review considering what&#x27;s out there. I&#x27;m happy with this product and I felt compelled to write a review because I am so happy with it. I&#x27;m hoping I can help others out there to check this product out. I gave it a 4-star simply because I still have my skin discoloration but I&#x27;m finally seing a difference w/ this cream.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing I have seen a lot of improvement in my skin tone. I have a darker shade on the side of my face and the middle is lighter so this works wonders.I combine it with RX for brown skin.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this I wanted to do some research to find out exactly how this product (and similar ones) work. It turns out the Hydroquinone used in the ingredients can be linked to skin cancer. I also came across information stating that Hydroquinone is banned in most countries, and the USA is only allowed to use up to 2.0% in products. Also sun screen is recommend when/after using this product (and similar ones) due to re-darkening of the skin. My stupid mistake, I should have done my research first. Maybe this review will prevent someone else from making the mistake. On the plus side this product smells good and is very soft and creamy, however the pro&#x27;s do not beat the cons in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 this year and my skin looks great !</li>
            <li> The product was delivered as promised and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Product smells great and feels wonderful on skin though no spots faded yet....I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 wks and guess I expected a miracle.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product right away after my first trial. My skin color is even out, and brighter after using for about two weeks. Great result!!</li>
            <li> still waiting for it to work</li>
            <li> I  have seen no results with this cream at all.I have used several  weeks now and only thing I get isit makes my skin red and itchy</li>
            <li> It does what it claims I have been using for about two weeks and my acne scars are fading. I really loving this product working really well for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this in my local store and it was tinted, and I really liked that.  This is a white cream,  which I wasn&#x27;t sure of at first but I love it just the same.  I don&#x27;t have dark spots but I do have a skin condition that leaves my face red.  Since using this product,  the color tone of my face has balanced out and its not so red anymore.  I will order it again!</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims.  I had several age spots on  my face and hands from the sun that were impossible to cover with makeup products.  I purchased this on a whim and have never been happier.  After six weeks my spots are 90% gone.  I will tell everyone about this product!</li>
            <li> I applied the cream at the start of my work day and towards the end. As I was driving home I noticed pimples had emerged and my nose had flaked. I do like the smell but the cream is very greasy. It doesn&#x27;t absorb completely even if you use sparingly. I&#x27;ll try to keep using it for a month and hopefully get over the clogged pore issue.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonderfully for my facial dark spots. The trick is to use a scrub or exfoliation wash to clean oils, dead skin, dirt or makeup off so your skin can absorb the product.</li>
            <li> Spots fade but don&#x27;t disappear.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the results given the low price.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my face but this product leaves my skin a little greasy so I don&#x27;t use it enough to tell if it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;m now using it on my elbows and knees...still too soon to tell if it works.</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream two days ago. The consistency is very thick and must be applied gently. Like tiny dabs due to the fact that it is Not like it sister cocoa butter. After being bitten by &amp;#34;Chiggers/clover mites&amp;#34;. The intense scratching lefted scars on my skin. If you didnt know me you&#x27;d suspect I&#x27;m an addict or worse. If you have hypersensitive skin this should aid in reducing the appearance.</li>
            <li> I usually love every Palmer&#x27;s product, but this one was just way too thick!  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on, but it does feel like you&#x27;re wearing a mask-- it&#x27;s very heavy.</li>
            <li> This is my go to cream I use to keep my skin clear and even.Also when I get a scratch or bruises, I apply this cream on and the marks are not visible, very faint to see.I keep extra jars on hand.I use this cream on my children when the get a noticeable mark on their skin as well.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2-3 months. I have brown skin with very noticeable dark spots from acne, and this product hardly helped. It has a funny smell and doesn&#x27;t blend well with moisturizers or other skin products. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using PCBF Eventone Fade Cream because I have very sensitive skin, but I have not had any reactions. This product doesn&#x27;t lighten the skin; it even the complexion. I use it after the PCBF exfoliating facial scrub or facial cleanser/wash. I wear it as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely in the darkest end of the color pad and this still lightened dark spots on my face. Love it.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this cream as the jar arrived broken and shards from the jar were embedded intone realm. So I cannot rate it.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! my face broke out from this product so badly about two days of using it.. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, but it didn&#x27;t agree with me!! it might be different for someone else..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Palmer&#x27;s products but there must be some ingredient in this cream to which I am allergic.  My face broke out in a tiny itchy rash after 2 uses.  I&#x27;ll just use on my less sensitive areas but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This cream really worked to even out my skin tone.  I had some darkening of the skin on my upper lip and this cream got rid of it in a couple of weeks.  My skin is brighter and more youthful looking.  Really for a little over $6 this is a true find.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the cream on my face. It will take awhile for me to get use to this cream because it is the first time I am using it. I hate the smell other than that it is ok. I haven&#x27;t seen the result yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and so far i haven&#x27;t seen any difference.  I will say this, the smell is much better than most products on the market and it isn&#x27;t greasy which I enjoy.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed, was really hoping this would even out my skin tone :(</li>
            <li> It works some, and the texture is easier to apply than Nadinola&#x27;s fade cream. The smell is toooooo perfume-y which is why my rating for this product is 1 star minus...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other all, I like Ambi better, and I was hoping this would have a cocoa butter smell because I love the cocoa butter smell, now it&#x27;s just too much perfume, oh well.</li>
            <li> eventone fade cream is very good. I fell in love with this product right away after my first trial. My skin color is even out, and brighter after using for about one week.</li>
            <li> it might work for others but this product just didn&#x27;t work for me so i cant say that its worth my money</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using this product religiously for 3 months I failed to see much improvement. I was rather surprised that nothing really happened because Palmer&#x27;s usually has good products. I ended up purchasing a department store fade cream recently that is already showing results in just four days. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Taking time to work, but gradually I am seeing some changes. Regardless of the time, I am glad with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I hate this. It smells weird. My husband hates the smell and always comments on it when I have it on. The texture is alwful. Did I get a dud? The cream is so hard and dry that I have a hard time spreading it on my skin. Doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb at all, and forms a layer (white and noticeable like a mask) that you can flake off after it dries. Very thick, sticky, and waxy feeling. Yuck.  I stuck with it though for 1.5 months so far because I feel like the tone of the skin on my face changed after giving birth. But ..nothing. No results. I didn&#x27;t notice any lightening, evening, or tone change. I could put up with the smell and texture if it worked. But this is just TRASH. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  At first I saw a difference in a couple of weeks.  After several months there is still some improvement.  At first I thought it caused some redness but not any more.  I am on my second jar.  There are other product that are similar but not as good a price.</li>
            <li> If you tanned as a teenager or spent time out of doors, and you begin to see dark spots, I highly recommend this product. Hard to find in stores, even Walmart who carries the brand doesn&#x27;t keep it in stock. It&#x27;s a small but effective secret. Works beautifully and the price can&#x27;t be beat for the results. Always use sunscreen and NEVER tan your face!!</li>
            <li> the formulation is extremely thick, I hate that it has sunscreen on it as I use it on my backside that never sees the light of day.  There is a powdery floral fragrance that I despise.&lt;br /&gt;However it does work as well as can be expected, and the thickness and smell don&#x27;t drive me as crazy since I use it on my bum.  I would NEVER put this on my face.</li>
            <li> I ha a ba razor rash on my neck I picked at and it ended up marking my neck in 5 spots xp I used this as directed last night an I seen a major improvement! The marks were smaller and 40% lighter. So earlier today I figured why not try rubbing some in an leave some excess on covered with a bandaid all day. I took of the bandage and the marks were almost gone! Never in my life has anything worked this well for me! I highly recommend this. Idk if it matters but I&#x27;m a guy 21 yrs old with fair skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this product Palmers cocoa butter formula with vitamin E, Eventone Age spot hand cream) for about one month. I had a considerable amount of discoloration on the back of my hands. I used it twice a day everyday. The spots on the backs of my hands are completely gone now.&lt;br /&gt;What I saw as it was working: My right hand saw a little redness on the actual spots only, the skin got dry in those areas and peeled off in layers as the spot disappeared. My left hand was not as severe, so no redness, the disccolation just vanished over time, along with the redness. Both of my hands look pretty good now. I am not embarrassed for people to see them.No more spots.&lt;br /&gt;The spots on the backs of my hands was caused from UV sun damage. Melanin is the skins pigment, the sun damages the pigment, and this is what we see as spots on our skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try. I am pleased with the results for the most part so far. It does not have a bad smell, go on smooth, and is not greasy. I use it twice a day. My only concern is it may be clogging my pores a bit which I am closely monitoring because it may be something else. I do think some scars are fading. I will most likely purchase this again here because I have not seen this in stores.</li>
            <li> Really like this cream. I had been using a different product and then they decided to reduce the size to 1oz but keep the price the same so I switched. My discolorations were already pretty much gone, but this helps to keep them gone! It has even helped fade spots that my other stuff missed! This cream has a thick consistency, but not too thick and my skin loves it! I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a dewey appearance on my skin since, having had oily skin a lot, I try to avoid. Because it&#x27;s so thick, a little goes a long way so lasts a longer time. Since using this stuff, I can go without makeup on my skin if I want, yay! I just dust my face with a little powder, and put on some mascara and I&#x27;m much more confident! Will be purchasing this again!:)</li>
            <li> This does not fade marks.  This is basically a light concealer.  The lotion is sticky after application.  The &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; can be rubbed or washed away.  I usually like Palmer&#x27;s products, but this was awful.</li>
            <li> I thought this was like other Eventone items by palmers and was free of Hydroquinone, but I was surprised to read the label..  Last thing I need is a potential carcinogen.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fade cream for my hands which have light sun spots.  I have been using it for over a month and I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> Finding the best product to get rid of dark spots is hard, but this product shows promising results.  I have been using this for 2 weeks, and I see a big difference.  This is a keeper.</li>
