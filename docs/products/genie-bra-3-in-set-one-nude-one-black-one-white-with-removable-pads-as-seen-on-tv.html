    <ol>
            <li>No underwriters is a great feature.</li>
            <li>These were a good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>Nice texture though.</li>
            <li>perfect fit and comfortable, I would buy again.</li>
            <li>this is the best bra ever, so comfortable and perfect if you need to wear a bra for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love that there are pads in them.</li>
            <li>I love it, I will buy more soon</li>
            <li>I am SO pleased with these.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for smaller busts.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with them.  </li>
            <li>Love the fit.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable but more like a sports bra.</li>
            <li>- just buy some more and be comfortable every</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way these fit.</li>
            <li>With how much your body is changing during pregnancy, this bra is very comfortable without it being too restricting like a sports bra.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m at the stage of my life where comfort is by far more important to me than &amp;#34;staging.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are fitted without being uncomfortable on my scars, the pad provides adequate coverage and doesn&#x27;t show the size difference, they truly fit perfect!  </li>
            <li>I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I tried my size, and a size larger and neither fit!  </li>
            <li>They are hands down the most comfortable bra I&#x27;ve ever worn.  </li>
            <li>Getting it on isn&#x27;t always easy but it beats the back closures of others.</li>
            <li>so I had to have one on for 12 hours, not a single one I had felt comfortable the whole 12 hours like genie bra.</li>
            <li>The bras were fine but too big for me.  </li>
            <li>very comfortable, but still shows in tank tops and other shirts.</li>
            <li>The little pads inserted are nice but could have been designed a little better.</li>
            <li>I had surgery that left a scar across my right shoulder blade and back, and also had the  top portion of my breast on that same side removed.  </li>
            <li>I would plan the days I would wear my precious few.  </li>
            <li>Love them but were too small</li>
            <li>I suggest you order a size smaller than normal.  </li>

            <li> Eventually the back gets stretched, but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I never used my other regular bra sense I bought this ones</li>
            <li> Especially I cannot wear wire bras due to surgery.</li>
            <li> My size was way too small and the larger size was way too big.  </li>
            <li> I note that they seem to be a knock-off as they have thinner pads and seem to be a little bit smaller in the arm holes.</li>
            <li> I like the Genie Bras, but not happy with the removeable Pads hard to get back in right place and do not wash well.</li>
            <li> so they are hot in a muggy climate and show under some low cut items of clothing but for the comfort I will deal with the heat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand unless the sizes were marked wrong at the factory.  </li>
            <li> Sports bras were to tight and flattened me until I was uncomfortable or did not cover well enough in front.  </li>
            <li> will say they probably don&#x27;t &amp;#34;flaunt the girls&amp;#34; as well as some other (uncomfortable)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$ hard earned cash!!</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible time finding a bra to wear over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> Finally I decided that was stupid</li>
            <li> Too binding &amp; lousy shape.</li>
            <li> Brought this for a lift but tend to fold over maybe i bought the wrong size 38DD</li>
            <li> I tried Genie bras a year or so ago during one of my periodic phases where I desperately look for a bra that doesn&#x27;t drive me crazy by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I HATE it when a bra&#x27;s straps wont stay up.</li>
            <li> Bad quality!</li>

            <li> With how much your body is changing during pregnancy, this bra is very comfortable without it being too restricting like a sports bra.  I love that there are pads in them.</li>
            <li> I like the Genie Bras, but not happy with the removeable Pads hard to get back in right place and do not wash well.</li>
            <li> this is the best bra ever, so comfortable and perfect if you need to wear a bra for long periods of time. I work in law enforcement so I had to have one on for 12 hours, not a single one I had felt comfortable the whole 12 hours like genie bra. I love it, I will buy more soon</li>
            <li> I had surgery that left a scar across my right shoulder blade and back, and also had the  top portion of my breast on that same side removed.  I have had a terrible time finding a bra to wear over the last few years.  I had to wear front closure, enough padding that the size difference wasn&#x27;t obvious, and no razor back.  Sports bras were to tight and flattened me until I was uncomfortable or did not cover well enough in front.  I am SO pleased with these. They are fitted without being uncomfortable on my scars, the pad provides adequate coverage and doesn&#x27;t show the size difference, they truly fit perfect!  The only issue I have is they are a bit big so they are hot in a muggy climate and show under some low cut items of clothing but for the comfort I will deal with the heat.</li>
            <li> The bras were fine but too big for me.  I suggest you order a size smaller than normal.  Wish I had known this before I ordered because I was looking for comfort &amp; support.  I did get the comfy.</li>
            <li> These were a good product for the price.  I note that they seem to be a knock-off as they have thinner pads and seem to be a little bit smaller in the arm holes.</li>
            <li> No box, but I received 3 Genie bras, in spite of being worried about getting an off brand. The only bra I wear! Eventually the back gets stretched, but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Bad quality! Will not buy again! Don&#x27;t waste your $$ hard earned cash!!</li>
            <li> 3 for the price of two..love the product</li>
            <li> Comfort and excellence with no strap pain!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way these fit. Too binding &amp; lousy shape.</li>
            <li> very comfortable, but still shows in tank tops and other shirts.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend likes them.</li>
            <li> Changed my life! I HATE it when a bra&#x27;s straps wont stay up. No problems with that here, and no show through. They are perfect for smaller busts.</li>
            <li> I like the Genie bra. It is very comfortable. Getting it on isn&#x27;t always easy but it beats the back closures of others. No underwriters is a great feature. The little pads inserted are nice but could have been designed a little better. I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I tried my size, and a size larger and neither fit!  My size was way too small and the larger size was way too big.  I don&#x27;t understand unless the sizes were marked wrong at the factory.  I gave up.</li>
            <li> Love them but were too small</li>
            <li> Brought this for a lift but tend to fold over maybe i bought the wrong size 38DD Bought X-large. Nice texture though.</li>
            <li> perfect fit and comfortable, I would buy again. I never used my other regular bra sense I bought this ones</li>
            <li> Love the fit.  Especially I cannot wear wire bras due to surgery.</li>
            <li> Comfortable but more like a sports bra.</li>
            <li> I tried Genie bras a year or so ago during one of my periodic phases where I desperately look for a bra that doesn&#x27;t drive me crazy by the end of the day.  I fell in love with them.  I would plan the days I would wear my precious few.  Finally I decided that was stupid - just buy some more and be comfortable every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bras don&#x27;t ride up the side like another &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; style I have does. They don&#x27;t bind and pinch me like underwires. They don&#x27;t scratch like styles designed with a lot of lace can do.  They are hands down the most comfortable bra I&#x27;ve ever worn.  And they are now the only bra I wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say they probably don&#x27;t &amp;#34;flaunt the girls&amp;#34; as well as some other (uncomfortable) bras I&#x27;ve had, but I&#x27;m at the stage of my life where comfort is by far more important to me than &amp;#34;staging.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vendor was prompt with shipping &amp; kept me informed of the process - no complaints!</li>
