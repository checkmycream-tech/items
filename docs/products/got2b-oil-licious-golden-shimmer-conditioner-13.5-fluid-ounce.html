            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>often I do buy intense moisturing conditioners always</li>
            <li>Not that I was expecting any different, but the oil-licious hairspray was just so light in comparison.</li>
            <li>so your hair can feel oily if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>it is really</li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s harder and harder to find at my local Walmarts and Walgreens.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty fussy and some products make my hair feel worse.  </li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly, wavy, thick and dry and this product was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as other conditioners.</li>
            <li> They tell me it doesn&#x27;t sell as often as the other products...</li>
            <li> Save your money - not worth it.</li>
            <li> - she&#x27;s half Black half White and has extremely thick, curly, course hair</li>
            <li> When I used the product, I put the amount that I typically use.</li>
            <li> Wish I could just purchase a 70 gallon drum of this little miracle?  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I could not believe it my hair dried without a frizzy look.  </li>
            <li> It does as it says, is what it claims, but way to heavy even for my wavy, colored, &amp; blow dried hair.</li>
            <li> I use other Got2Be products and absolutely love them but the shampoo and conditioner are horrible.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to leave your hair shiny and tame your frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair winds up a matted mess!</li>
            <li> but it leaves my hair feeling very heavy and slippery.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> Like a combination of old nail polish and perfume that has went bad.</li>
            <li> but it was NOT good</li>
            <li> I have suffered my whole life with uber thick, wavy, frizzy, crazy dry, insanely course hair (think wire for hair).  </li>
            <li> The bad reviews on this may be from people who dont have dry, brittle, dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I used it on my daughters hair which is very thick and corkscrew curls.  </li>
            <li> Have a heavy dirty feeling of my hair within a day.</li>
            <li> I can see how this would not work for someone with thin or greasy hair...</li>
            <li> Just NOT for thin or Oily hair!!</li>
            <li> Also smells really bad.</li>
            <li> The conditioner also leaves a very dirty feeling to my hair.</li>
            <li> this conditioner I threw away because it had a very bad fragrance.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed in this product!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this line of product.  </li>

            <li> I really wanted to like this but I feel like it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as other conditioners. I do have dry damaged hair from coloring often I do buy intense moisturing conditioners always and this one just doesn&#x27;t perform as well as others it&#x27;s hard to explain but it doesn&#x27;t rinse out as easily and my hair looks flat at the roots after and dry on the ends still. It also doesn&#x27;t make detangling as easy as others.</li>
            <li> I love this and the shampoo.  My hair is pretty fussy and some products make my hair feel worse.  Not this.  For me it works.....</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this line of product.  Have a heavy dirty feeling of my hair within a day.</li>
            <li> Made my hair more course and less manageable. When you rinse the glitter out in the shower, let&#x27;s just say it puts glitter where you wouldn&#x27;t want it! No thanks. Donating to a local food pantry.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my very dry hair. This made my hair look really healthy but it does weight it down just a little bit.This smells really good and the scent last for a couple of day in my hair unlike most other conditioners I have used. This is also supposed to give your hair a golden shine but mine is already naturally that way. That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> this products smells great.works great with the same type shampoo or other brands. it doesnt make your hair oily but makes it feel smooth and detangles. i love it</li>
            <li> this conditioner I threw away because it had a very bad fragrance.  I couldnt figure out what the smell was but it was NOT good and I didnt want my hair to smell like that!</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this product!  It is supposed to leave your hair shiny and tame your frizz. This stuff made my hair more frizzy than it has ever been. I am so tired of products not even kind of living up to their claims. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

Just NOT for thin or Oily hair!!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. When I used the product, I put the amount that I typically use. I later felt my hair and not seeing a difference. So I added more conditioner. Finally, noticing the conditioner is not very thick and more liquidity. The conditioner also leaves a very dirty feeling to my hair. Finally, the scent is also very undesirable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even remotely live up to it&#x27;s claims. Left my hair a frizzy mess, usually I don&#x27;t have too much of a problem with frizz in the winter. Also smells really bad. Like a combination of old nail polish and perfume that has went bad. Going back to Shea Moisture for now.</li>
            <li> The bad reviews on this may be from people who dont have dry, brittle, dyed hair. My hair is very curly, wavy, thick and dry and this product was unbelievable. Makes my hair so silky soft and the smell is wonderful. If you have hair like mine, you will LOVE this product. - MARTHA</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. really gives your hair a summer shimmer!</li>
            <li> MY absolute favorite hair product....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously Oil-licious is THEE best shampoo/conditioner ever! &lt;3  I have suffered my whole life with uber thick, wavy, frizzy, crazy dry, insanely course hair (think wire for hair).  I have tried thousands of products promising me shiny smooth soft hair.  Never once has anything ever given me that until your product.  I cannot say enough about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s harder and harder to find at my local Walmarts and Walgreens. They tell me it doesn&#x27;t sell as often as the other products... WHAT ??? :O  That&#x27;s insanity!!  People must just not know about it.  So I&#x27;m making my quest to go online and review and write about it where ever I can.  I fear it will slip thru the cracks and be no longer available.  After not finding it at two Walmarts, the third Walmart had 5 left... guess who bought them all for my back up stash?  ME!  Wish I could just purchase a 70 gallon drum of this little miracle?  It&#x27;s my favorite beauty product of all times !!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this...soooooo hard to find. Always get compliments on my hair on days I use it. My hair is super dark brown.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my hair feeling very heavy and slippery. Not that I was expecting any different, but the oil-licious hairspray was just so light in comparison.</li>
            <li> even though it was broken when delivered - I used what little was left and its a pretty good conditioner and good for co-washing and no-poo hair.</li>
            <li> My husband saw this product on sale at Shoprite and thought I would like to try it.  My hair has been damaged from over coloring.  I used it and let my hair dry naturally ....I could not believe it my hair dried without a frizzy look.  The waves I naturally have came to life.  I used it on my daughters hair which is very thick and corkscrew curls.  It tamed her hair beautifully.  I love the smell of the product reminds me of the Summer and the beach.  There are really no negative aspects, there are oils in the product so your hair can feel oily if you use too much.  I would reccomend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a whim one time at another store. I ended up loving this conditioner but wasn&#x27;t able to ever find it in stock again until I checked Amazon. It makes your hair so soft and conditions so well, and it smells really nice. It also adds sparkle to your hair. I noticed it also leaves a shimmer on the rest of my skin which I actually like but others might not be so keen on.</li>
            <li> I smile when I find a little shimmer on my skin leftover from my conditioner. It&#x27;s like a body lotion and conditioner all in one. I use a lot of conditioner and it really makes a difference on my dry hair. It comes out fast, which works for me since I use a lot, but I love the smell, I love how shiny my hair looks after using it, and it detangles beautifully. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Great for my dry over colored hair wavy/curly hair. Will buy more! I can see how this would not work for someone with thin or greasy hair...</li>
            <li> wanted and needed what it pitched, -but apparently I didn&#x27;t need it as much as this!  It does as it says, is what it claims, but way to heavy even for my wavy, colored, &amp; blow dried hair.</li>
            <li> Save your money - not worth it. Doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s conditioning at all. My hair winds up a matted mess! I haven&#x27;t even noticed any of the gold shimmer and the smell is not that great. I use other Got2Be products and absolutely love them but the shampoo and conditioner are horrible. Going back to my Pantene.</li>
            <li> I am 61, with frizzy longish hair with highlights and I get alot of sun being a Snowbird.  Well, I had bought the 2B oil first, and liked that...then i got a $1.00 coupon to try this conditioner.  I bought it at WalMart and it was 3-4 bucks.  Well, I love it.  I have tried every kind of conditioner, cheap and expensive, this one is great.  I do use a de-tangler and a wee bit of the oil after rinsing.  My hair is still a little bit frizzy but it is HUMID here but after using my 2 inch hot curling iron , my hair looks great and stays SMOOTH even in the humidity. I put a touch of the oil in again when dry.  My hair is so nice to touch, soft but not fly-away.  Try this.. I am wanting people to buy it so it will stay on the market.  it is really good.&lt;br /&gt;PS Do leave it in for about 3-5 minutes, it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Used this all the time and gets lots of complements on my hair.</li>
