            <li>Need more time to decide on that.</li>

            <li>It is fine.  </li>
            <li>luckily I quit before I turned 35!</li>

            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was struggling to find good skincare products that benefit instead of harming my skin.</li>

            <li>This is the brand to buy, gals...works great for those homemade facial serums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway everyone, I am on day three of using this fantastic serum I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>it is very cost effective.</li>
            <li>of propylene glycol (available here on Amazon, just search) and put it in an amber glass bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 59, fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Super fine, easily dissolves in my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I can now mix my own vitamin C serum or cream without the high end cost of the leading brands.</li>
            <li>I know some of you are rich, but if you are why are you shopping on amazon?</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is why it is important to make sure you are getting PURE L-ASCORBIC ACID</li>
            <li>Mix very well and the powder is very fine..</li>
            <li>Pour into clean Amber bottle</li>
            <li>Shake &amp; apply with clean hands/fingers (</li>
            <li>Pour into clean Amber bottle</li>
            <li>Shake &amp; apply with clean hands/fingers (</li>
            <li>It is not gritty or sandy like most, and the resuts you get are amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this with my moisturizer every night after I clean my face with my Erisonic.  </li>
            <li>allows me to know what is in my serum, that it is fresh, and I control how strong it will be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to prevent the signs of aging, if you do it every single day.</li>
            <li>So make cosmetics in small quantities and use quickly before it turns colors for the best results.</li>
            <li>Decided on this particular brand as it is ground very finely</li>
            <li>Wait til it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li>i cannot use a full batch before it becomes neutral</li>
            <li>but my skin looks better and better and I will do everything in my power to prevent as many wrinkles as possible as I get older!</li>
            <li>Rather than spend hundreds on a serum from department store , make your own , it stays fresh as you only make enough for 3-4 days at a time -great</li>
            <li>Excited to use this serum morning and night, making fresh serum every 3 to 4 days.  </li>
            <li>(you don&#x27;t want the C powder in a warm container)&lt;br /&gt;The amber or cobalt blue shields &amp; protects the serum from light, which can break serum down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I add a few drops of hyaluronic acid and it makes a wonderful and very inexpensive serum.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, and item as described.</li>
            <li>It dissolves quickly in water and mixes well.</li>
            <li>Helps lighten dark age spots and is great to put on when you go out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>This works exactly as well as the Murad Vit C product and this is oh so cheap.</li>
            <li>This powder is pure, mixes easily and is helps preserve the serum.</li>
            <li>Super easy and fast to make.  </li>
            <li>Super easy and fast to make.  </li>
            <li>My skin has a more even tone, my pores are smaller &amp; my fine lines are smoothing out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with how fine the powder is; it dissolves quickly enough.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased Vitamin C powder by Making Cosmetics , to make a powerful Vitamin C serum for my face, neck and  decloteie (chest).I am loving this vitamin C powder.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit of warm water will dissolve the crystals.</li>
            <li>and now I can make my own VC facial mask</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fresh and moisted for days, even after washing it.</li>
            <li>I had good skin before but this took it to a whole different level.</li>
            <li>I mix a fresh solution of this with Hyaluronic Acid and DMAE Powder which I ordered at Amazon..</li>
            <li>So very simple to make your own vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>I know I had to figure out a way to make it myself and keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>I am now at a 15% solution and reaping the benefits of using fresh vitamin C on my skin.</li>
            <li>Dissolves pretty quickly with room temp water</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re kidding right. @</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and get rashes easily, even from hypoallergenic products.</li>
            <li>my only wish is that it was just a tad more finely milled as it takes a little more time to dissolve into creams and lotions, but dissolves in serums just fine.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed, priced right and shipped promptly.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped super fast</li>
            <li>mixed in glycerin for topical application great</li>
            <li>I use it to make my own vitamin C serum and save big bucks over buying ready made brands.</li>
            <li>Make a fresh batch using distilled/rosewater, glycerin/aloe vera and use as a serum/toner or just take a tiny amount in your hand and add in favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Recevied very fast.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on DIY serums, but this powder just doesn&#x27;t dissolve well no matter what technique I use which leaves any serums I make very, very grainy.  </li>
            <li>The powder came very fast.</li>
            <li>(Beginner might want to start with 5% or 10% strength for first week):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sterilize in boiling water first.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more items from Making</li>
            <li>Sorry no such thing as miracles, but this is the best I&#x27;ve found at maintaining a youthful appearance, just make sure</li>
            <li>Topical Vitamin C has been shown to be much better for skin than ingested (swallowed)</li>
            <li>This not only works better, its a million times cheaper.</li>
            <li>It really brightens my skin!</li>
            <li>This is why you must first use the distilled water to absorb it.</li>
            <li>I used a formula I found on a trusted skincare blog and followed it exactly.</li>
            <li>I first made my serums with this powder, distilled water and aloe gel but the consistency was a bit watery.</li>
            <li>and I did not realize that the &amp;#34;powder pure&amp;#34; was exactly that &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product, already purchased a 2nd bag.</li>
            <li>Fine lines and pores were 80% better within the first few days.  </li>
            <li>but using this along with eating a vegan plant based diet and drinking 3 liters of water daily, hopefully my skin will age much slower than most ;)</li>
            <li>particular product may not be the ultimate of it&#x27;s genre, but I&#x27;ve no need to look further because it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This seller shipped the item very quickly and the powder is in a small screw top plastic container inside a sealed ziplock style bag.</li>
            <li>I believe I already see a positive effect on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ascorbic acid is made from GMO corn and I&#x27;ve forgotten what else, but heated, from what I understand pretty intensely.  </li>
            <li>So I pretty much gave up on using it completely.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that this company did this for normal people to purchase the same ingredients as the cosmetic companies sell, I now have purity at my fingertips.</li>
            <li>(and fair pricing - will last long time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once stirred &amp; dissolved, add glycerine.  </li>
            <li>(and fair pricing - will last long time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once stirred &amp; dissolved, add glycerine.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for this pure powder for awhile</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried mixing this with pure glycerin.</li>
            <li>for example, my 20% vitamin c toners consist of 1 tsp of pure LAA and 4 tsp of water (this sometimes includes 1 tsp of an optional ingredient.</li>
            <li>OK... so I&#x27;m new to this DIY Vit C facial (&amp; hand, etc.) serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done so much research on the Vit C</li>
            <li>/&gt;After much research online, and shopping at Whole Foods, Sprouts, etc.</li>
            <li>CamuCamu very pricey tho</li>
            <li>minutes.iner)&lt;br /&gt;The amber or cobalt blue shields &amp; protects the serum from light, which can break serum</li>
            <li>fast shipping and just as described.  </li>
            <li>this is absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbs very well without the grits.</li>
            <li>Ladies, this really works with glycerin &amp; water!&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp distilled water&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I really thought it would work well on wrinkles but did not.</li>
            <li>I now add a bit every morning to my tretinoin crem, it blends fast and well and gives me an unparalleled glow.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying it already made</li>
            <li>When you buy serum it may have already oxidized too much.  </li>
            <li>Packaged well and fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much</li>
            <li>I *never* write reviews based on customer service, but this one really deserves it.</li>
            <li>The vitamin C powder was just what I was looking for, however, I think I was a bit hasty as I have since found that I could have purchased it at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>this comes very well packaged and the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>YOU REALLY NEED TO BLEND THIS INTO YOUR LOTION/SERUM ETC</li>
            <li>AND REALLY RUB IT IN</li>
            <li>I just really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I make my own serum and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Go to Youtube and other blogs as well to find many recipes.</li>
            <li>The only down side to making your own C serum is that you have to make a fresh batch every 3-5 days.</li>
            <li>Came earlier than expected, very pleased.</li>
            <li>but so far I would have to say that this exactly what you want if you are going to be using it for cosmetic purposes.</li>
            <li>Dextro-Ascorbic acid actually has far more cons than pros and does not occur naturally.</li>
            <li>Please start out on a gentle amount when you&#x27;re new to Vit C skincare.</li>
            <li>Smoother, less wrinkles, and more even toned skin.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied and spending a lot less.</li>
            <li>Vit C serum video that was updated specifically to suggest THIS PARTICULAR POWDER out of all the powders she has used and</li>
            <li>I use it all over my body now, particularly face, neck, chest, hands and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I stopped buying the 130.00 high end serum.</li>
            <li>I will not buy anymore high priced vitamin c serums.</li>
            <li>Start out too high of a concentration</li>
            <li>First off, one thing I love about this powder, other than it definitely being an ultra-fine powder, is the fact that it is SPECIFICALLY L-ascorbic acid powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how making that serum works so fast on my skin, and I&#x27;m 70 years old</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipment was fast and all products from the seller were professional wrapped.</li>
            <li>&quot; I say this because ascorbic acid consists of two molescules: L (Levo meaning left) and D (Dextro meaning right)</li>
            <li>Or preferably make new serum every 2-4 days.  </li>
            <li>Or preferably make new serum every 2-4 days.  </li>
            <li>A batch lasts about a week, then you should make a new one.</li>
            <li>is the new fountain of youth</li>
            <li>I notice changes everyday, and use it on my stomach and thighs to firm these areas as well, it is working great.  </li>
            <li>Previous brands that I have purchased, (which are twice to three times the cost of this specific product) were very finely milled.  </li>
            <li>I actually made it to be more of a toner than a serum so that I can use it on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li>so I worried that it might be a little strong but used 1/8 teaspoon in jenniraincloud vitamin c serum and no issues.  </li>
            <li>I mixed a 1/4 teaspoon Vit C with 3/4 teaspoons water, DAILY and put it on a clean face.</li>
            <li>I use to be one of those naive people that purchase a high end vitamin C serum thinking I was buying something of good quality and thanks to all of the research about how vitamin c was unstable and doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>I am 45 with a little sun damage and some fine lines.</li>
            <li>I used to throw my batch away every week to make a fresh one but found vitamin c, when properly sealed and hidden from light can last 2-3 weeks!</li>
            <li>Philosophy (cosmetics company) sells the same exact vitamin C in a much smaller bottle at an exorbitantly high price.  </li>
            <li>I use the following recipe, which is highly recommended (it might be a little strong for beginners - for people who haven&#x27;t used glycolic acid, Retin A, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>stays grainy regardless of what I do to try to get it to dissolve completely.</li>
            <li>Stir until powder COMPLETELY dissolved.  </li>
            <li>pat gently on face, neck &amp; chest and back of hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stir until powder COMPLETELY dissolved.  </li>
            <li>pat gently on face, neck &amp; chest and back of hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely alter your appearance but it does help.</li>
            <li>The powder/serum really transforms the texture of my skin instantly.</li>
            <li>I mix it in the palm of my hand until it&#x27;s completely dissolved, then apply to my face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I, for some reason, had it in my mind that ascorbic acid was a natural form of vitamin c.  </li>
            <li>It has made my skin visibly brighter and softer, and faded old acne scars.</li>
            <li>and I can see a marked improvement in wrinkles around my eyes and on my neck.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Just completely ignored the fact that the information they have up is misleading.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used L-ascorbic acid powder in my moisturizer for several years and have felt it to be very beneficial.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read you can refigerate once you&#x27;ve made serum, or just place in a cool, dark closet/</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read you can refigerate once you&#x27;ve made serum, or just place in a cool, dark closet/</li>
            <li>I read that it actually can take as long as six months to see full results and for the collagen to be restored</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve toned down the percentage of C, but no problem whatsoever with the C powder dissolving easily upon shaking prior to use.  </li>
            <li>Much better price than Vit-C serums in store, and does not have any other funky unknown ingredients.</li>
            <li>I did not have to wait to get the ascorbic acid, I will soon start my new trials of making the refined&lt;br /&gt; developer formula that I started 5 years ago to process Technical Pan,(Kodak), 70mm, and I can not&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mixed with vegetable gycerin and water and it mixed very well.</li>
            <li>The small box goes a long way - i&#x27;m sure it can go over a year.</li>
            <li>It took about a week before I noticed any major results.</li>
            <li>Should be clear not yellow.</li>
            <li>found you can use clear aloe vera gel with it and it doesn&#x27;t have that gritty feel</li>
            <li>it totally has restored my natural glow.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and I have been using this product for several months now, and I am please with the results.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery faster than expected.</li>
            <li>Wow,  I&#x27;ve only used for 3 days</li>
            <li>Amazing results, one week in and the spots are clearly fading and the rest of my skin is looking fresh and vibrant, really shocking to look in the mirror each morning.</li>
            <li>Pure - 1.8oz / 50g Vitamin c begins breaking down once it is made.</li>
            <li>I use this during the day for the simple reason that I sleep on my stomach and generally fall asleep with my face on my hands.  </li>
            <li>mixed this with pure hyaluronic acid made into gel, and my face is looking younger and smoother with less redness.  </li>
            <li>Will take a little time to see if it works but much cheaper than the products they were selling.  </li>

            <li> http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1lfm47/diy_vitamin_c_serum_a_really_full_explanation/  as it gave a good explanation as to why you needed the ratios they suggest.</li>

            <li> ; I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> i love the Vitamin C Powder (L-ascorbic acid)</li>
            <li> I mix it in my generic Cetaphil-clone, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> but sure don&#x27;t look it.  </li>
            <li> They indicate that yes, it does work to increase skin turnover and give a youthful appearance in most cases.</li>
            <li> :) It is quite lightening.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, this is a POTENT &#x27;STUFF&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It is potent stuff</li>
            <li> Need more time to decide on that.</li>
            <li> but it seems that it may not absorb into the skin as well as a more refined serum.</li>
            <li> For now I will continue to use it and research it more.</li>
            <li> Will definatly buy more when I run out,which could take awhile,</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Have used it on my hands for sun spots and they are looking better as well.  </li>

            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Skin feels lovely in the morning.</li>
            <li> It maintains its integrity as opposed to vitamin c products in liquid form, because this form if vitamin c is more stable and it is contained in an opaque sealed container.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, fast delivery time.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it.  </li>

            <li> Fast delivery and fair price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice fresh powder...mixes well with Hyaluronic Acid.  </li>

            <li> and you can control how strong you want it.</li>
            <li> Super fine!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this seller to anyone interested making his or her own cosmetics.</li>
            <li> it is fine or not -</li>
            <li> It is fine.  </li>
            <li> luckily I quit before I turned 35!</li>
            <li> It works at healing my teens acne bumps more quickly as well</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was struggling to find good skincare products that benefit instead of harming my skin.</li>
            <li> This comes in a fine powder form, and I have never had a problem mixing my formula up in a brown bottle that keeps light out.  </li>
            <li> I always use it FRESH right after mixing so it doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s magic when putting it all over my face!</li>
            <li> Helps brighten and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> If not gradually mix light amounts and get used to it.</li>
            <li> I use this with glycerin for a homemade Vitamin C serum mask, works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I finally found it and am soooo happy...</li>
            <li> This is the brand to buy, gals...works great for those homemade facial serums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway everyone, I am on day three of using this fantastic serum I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> it is very cost effective.</li>
            <li> of propylene glycol (available here on Amazon, just search) and put it in an amber glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 59, fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Super fine, easily dissolves in my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can now mix my own vitamin C serum or cream without the high end cost of the leading brands.</li>
            <li> I know some of you are rich, but if you are why are you shopping on amazon?</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is why it is important to make sure you are getting PURE L-ASCORBIC ACID</li>
            <li> Mix very well and the powder is very fine..</li>
            <li> Pour into clean Amber bottle</li>
            <li> Shake &amp; apply with clean hands/fingers (</li>
            <li> Pour into clean Amber bottle</li>
            <li> Shake &amp; apply with clean hands/fingers (</li>
            <li> It is not gritty or sandy like most, and the resuts you get are amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with my moisturizer every night after I clean my face with my Erisonic.  </li>
            <li> allows me to know what is in my serum, that it is fresh, and I control how strong it will be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way to prevent the signs of aging, if you do it every single day.</li>
            <li> So make cosmetics in small quantities and use quickly before it turns colors for the best results.</li>
            <li> Decided on this particular brand as it is ground very finely</li>
            <li> Wait til it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li> i cannot use a full batch before it becomes neutral</li>
            <li> but my skin looks better and better and I will do everything in my power to prevent as many wrinkles as possible as I get older!</li>
            <li> Rather than spend hundreds on a serum from department store , make your own , it stays fresh as you only make enough for 3-4 days at a time -great</li>
            <li> Excited to use this serum morning and night, making fresh serum every 3 to 4 days.  </li>
            <li> (you don&#x27;t want the C powder in a warm container)&lt;br /&gt;The amber or cobalt blue shields &amp; protects the serum from light, which can break serum down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of hyaluronic acid and it makes a wonderful and very inexpensive serum.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping, and item as described.</li>
            <li> It dissolves quickly in water and mixes well.</li>
            <li> Helps lighten dark age spots and is great to put on when you go out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> This works exactly as well as the Murad Vit C product and this is oh so cheap.</li>
            <li> This powder is pure, mixes easily and is helps preserve the serum.</li>
            <li> Super easy and fast to make.  </li>
            <li> Super easy and fast to make.  </li>
            <li> My skin has a more even tone, my pores are smaller &amp; my fine lines are smoothing out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with how fine the powder is; it dissolves quickly enough.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased Vitamin C powder by Making Cosmetics , to make a powerful Vitamin C serum for my face, neck and  decloteie (chest).I am loving this vitamin C powder.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit of warm water will dissolve the crystals.</li>
            <li> and now I can make my own VC facial mask</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fresh and moisted for days, even after washing it.</li>
            <li> I had good skin before but this took it to a whole different level.</li>
            <li> I mix a fresh solution of this with Hyaluronic Acid and DMAE Powder which I ordered at Amazon..</li>
            <li> So very simple to make your own vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> I know I had to figure out a way to make it myself and keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> I am now at a 15% solution and reaping the benefits of using fresh vitamin C on my skin.</li>
            <li> Dissolves pretty quickly with room temp water</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re kidding right. @</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and get rashes easily, even from hypoallergenic products.</li>
            <li> my only wish is that it was just a tad more finely milled as it takes a little more time to dissolve into creams and lotions, but dissolves in serums just fine.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed, priced right and shipped promptly.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped super fast</li>
            <li> mixed in glycerin for topical application great</li>
            <li> I use it to make my own vitamin C serum and save big bucks over buying ready made brands.</li>
            <li> Make a fresh batch using distilled/rosewater, glycerin/aloe vera and use as a serum/toner or just take a tiny amount in your hand and add in favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Recevied very fast.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on DIY serums, but this powder just doesn&#x27;t dissolve well no matter what technique I use which leaves any serums I make very, very grainy.  </li>
            <li> The powder came very fast.</li>
            <li> (Beginner might want to start with 5% or 10% strength for first week):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sterilize in boiling water first.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more items from Making</li>
            <li> Sorry no such thing as miracles, but this is the best I&#x27;ve found at maintaining a youthful appearance, just make sure</li>
            <li> Topical Vitamin C has been shown to be much better for skin than ingested (swallowed)</li>
            <li> This not only works better, its a million times cheaper.</li>
            <li> It really brightens my skin!</li>
            <li> This is why you must first use the distilled water to absorb it.</li>
            <li> I used a formula I found on a trusted skincare blog and followed it exactly.</li>
            <li> I first made my serums with this powder, distilled water and aloe gel but the consistency was a bit watery.</li>
            <li> and I did not realize that the &amp;#34;powder pure&amp;#34; was exactly that &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the product, already purchased a 2nd bag.</li>
            <li> Fine lines and pores were 80% better within the first few days.  </li>
            <li> but using this along with eating a vegan plant based diet and drinking 3 liters of water daily, hopefully my skin will age much slower than most ;)</li>
            <li> particular product may not be the ultimate of it&#x27;s genre, but I&#x27;ve no need to look further because it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This seller shipped the item very quickly and the powder is in a small screw top plastic container inside a sealed ziplock style bag.</li>
            <li> I believe I already see a positive effect on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ascorbic acid is made from GMO corn and I&#x27;ve forgotten what else, but heated, from what I understand pretty intensely.  </li>
            <li> So I pretty much gave up on using it completely.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that this company did this for normal people to purchase the same ingredients as the cosmetic companies sell, I now have purity at my fingertips.</li>
            <li> (and fair pricing - will last long time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once stirred &amp; dissolved, add glycerine.  </li>
            <li> (and fair pricing - will last long time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once stirred &amp; dissolved, add glycerine.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for this pure powder for awhile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried mixing this with pure glycerin.</li>
            <li> for example, my 20% vitamin c toners consist of 1 tsp of pure LAA and 4 tsp of water (this sometimes includes 1 tsp of an optional ingredient.</li>
            <li> OK... so I&#x27;m new to this DIY Vit C facial (&amp; hand, etc.) serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done so much research on the Vit C</li>
            <li> /&gt;After much research online, and shopping at Whole Foods, Sprouts, etc.</li>
            <li> CamuCamu very pricey tho</li>
            <li> minutes.iner)&lt;br /&gt;The amber or cobalt blue shields &amp; protects the serum from light, which can break serum</li>
            <li> fast shipping and just as described.  </li>
            <li> this is absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very well without the grits.</li>
            <li> Ladies, this really works with glycerin &amp; water!&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp distilled water&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I really thought it would work well on wrinkles but did not.</li>
            <li> I now add a bit every morning to my tretinoin crem, it blends fast and well and gives me an unparalleled glow.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying it already made</li>
            <li> When you buy serum it may have already oxidized too much.  </li>
            <li> Packaged well and fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I *never* write reviews based on customer service, but this one really deserves it.</li>
            <li> The vitamin C powder was just what I was looking for, however, I think I was a bit hasty as I have since found that I could have purchased it at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> this comes very well packaged and the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> YOU REALLY NEED TO BLEND THIS INTO YOUR LOTION/SERUM ETC</li>
            <li> AND REALLY RUB IT IN</li>
            <li> I just really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I make my own serum and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Go to Youtube and other blogs as well to find many recipes.</li>
            <li> The only down side to making your own C serum is that you have to make a fresh batch every 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected, very pleased.</li>
            <li> but so far I would have to say that this exactly what you want if you are going to be using it for cosmetic purposes.</li>
            <li> Dextro-Ascorbic acid actually has far more cons than pros and does not occur naturally.</li>
            <li> Please start out on a gentle amount when you&#x27;re new to Vit C skincare.</li>
            <li> Smoother, less wrinkles, and more even toned skin.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied and spending a lot less.</li>
            <li> Vit C serum video that was updated specifically to suggest THIS PARTICULAR POWDER out of all the powders she has used and</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body now, particularly face, neck, chest, hands and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stopped buying the 130.00 high end serum.</li>
            <li> I will not buy anymore high priced vitamin c serums.</li>
            <li> Start out too high of a concentration</li>
            <li> First off, one thing I love about this powder, other than it definitely being an ultra-fine powder, is the fact that it is SPECIFICALLY L-ascorbic acid powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how making that serum works so fast on my skin, and I&#x27;m 70 years old</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipment was fast and all products from the seller were professional wrapped.</li>
            <li> &quot; I say this because ascorbic acid consists of two molescules: L (Levo meaning left) and D (Dextro meaning right)</li>
            <li> Or preferably make new serum every 2-4 days.  </li>
            <li> Or preferably make new serum every 2-4 days.  </li>
            <li> A batch lasts about a week, then you should make a new one.</li>
            <li> is the new fountain of youth</li>
            <li> I notice changes everyday, and use it on my stomach and thighs to firm these areas as well, it is working great.  </li>
            <li> Previous brands that I have purchased, (which are twice to three times the cost of this specific product) were very finely milled.  </li>
            <li> I actually made it to be more of a toner than a serum so that I can use it on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> so I worried that it might be a little strong but used 1/8 teaspoon in jenniraincloud vitamin c serum and no issues.  </li>
            <li> I mixed a 1/4 teaspoon Vit C with 3/4 teaspoons water, DAILY and put it on a clean face.</li>
            <li> I use to be one of those naive people that purchase a high end vitamin C serum thinking I was buying something of good quality and thanks to all of the research about how vitamin c was unstable and doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I am 45 with a little sun damage and some fine lines.</li>
            <li> I used to throw my batch away every week to make a fresh one but found vitamin c, when properly sealed and hidden from light can last 2-3 weeks!</li>
            <li> Philosophy (cosmetics company) sells the same exact vitamin C in a much smaller bottle at an exorbitantly high price.  </li>
            <li> I use the following recipe, which is highly recommended (it might be a little strong for beginners - for people who haven&#x27;t used glycolic acid, Retin A, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> stays grainy regardless of what I do to try to get it to dissolve completely.</li>
            <li> Stir until powder COMPLETELY dissolved.  </li>
            <li> pat gently on face, neck &amp; chest and back of hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stir until powder COMPLETELY dissolved.  </li>
            <li> pat gently on face, neck &amp; chest and back of hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely alter your appearance but it does help.</li>
            <li> The powder/serum really transforms the texture of my skin instantly.</li>
            <li> I mix it in the palm of my hand until it&#x27;s completely dissolved, then apply to my face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I, for some reason, had it in my mind that ascorbic acid was a natural form of vitamin c.  </li>
            <li> It has made my skin visibly brighter and softer, and faded old acne scars.</li>
            <li> and I can see a marked improvement in wrinkles around my eyes and on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Just completely ignored the fact that the information they have up is misleading.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used L-ascorbic acid powder in my moisturizer for several years and have felt it to be very beneficial.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read you can refigerate once you&#x27;ve made serum, or just place in a cool, dark closet/</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read you can refigerate once you&#x27;ve made serum, or just place in a cool, dark closet/</li>
            <li> I read that it actually can take as long as six months to see full results and for the collagen to be restored</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve toned down the percentage of C, but no problem whatsoever with the C powder dissolving easily upon shaking prior to use.  </li>
            <li> Much better price than Vit-C serums in store, and does not have any other funky unknown ingredients.</li>
            <li> I did not have to wait to get the ascorbic acid, I will soon start my new trials of making the refined&lt;br /&gt; developer formula that I started 5 years ago to process Technical Pan,(Kodak), 70mm, and I can not&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mixed with vegetable gycerin and water and it mixed very well.</li>
            <li> The small box goes a long way - i&#x27;m sure it can go over a year.</li>
            <li> It took about a week before I noticed any major results.</li>
            <li> Should be clear not yellow.</li>
            <li> found you can use clear aloe vera gel with it and it doesn&#x27;t have that gritty feel</li>
            <li> it totally has restored my natural glow.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and I have been using this product for several months now, and I am please with the results.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Wow,  I&#x27;ve only used for 3 days</li>
            <li> Amazing results, one week in and the spots are clearly fading and the rest of my skin is looking fresh and vibrant, really shocking to look in the mirror each morning.</li>
            <li> Pure - 1.8oz / 50g Vitamin c begins breaking down once it is made.</li>
            <li> I use this during the day for the simple reason that I sleep on my stomach and generally fall asleep with my face on my hands.  </li>
            <li> mixed this with pure hyaluronic acid made into gel, and my face is looking younger and smoother with less redness.  </li>
            <li> Will take a little time to see if it works but much cheaper than the products they were selling.  </li>
            <li> since I only mix a tiny amount,it wil last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s making that much difference.</li>
            <li> I think this 1.8 oz size will actually last me a long time  - or a lot of batches.</li>
            <li> to make the serum, so it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> desperate to remove some long standing sun spots that were only looking worse as I age (45), I decided to try and mix my own fresh serum each day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was also in the same price range as similar items from other seller on amazon.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve applied it when i had little cuts or irritations at one week old and it still stings</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again, though I expect this one to last quite a while, since only a little in needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I actually like to use a percent calculator to make mixtures that are just enough for my container of choice, which is currently and permanently now a little 1oz bottle (I used to use jars.)</li>
            <li> I put all the ingredients in a sterilized amber dropper bottle, and my results have far exceeded anything from the high end serums I&#x27;ve wasted money on for the past decade.  </li>
            <li> I made a few so far.</li>
            <li> I guess the only downside is that it&#x27;s harder to keep a tan on your face.</li>
            <li> I hope this company keeps selling it for that long.</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than expected and was packaged with care.</li>
            <li> I replaced my years long relationship with Philosophy&#x27;s vitamin C powder and serum with this.</li>
            <li> STOP BUYING VITAMIN C SERUMS/CREAMS, you don&#x27;t know how long that product have been on the shelf</li>
            <li> My experiments are still ongoing, and my current formula uses a mix of the C powder, distilled water, glycerin, vitamin E oil and a few other all natural and organic oils and extracts.  </li>
            <li> I use this mixed with a little bit of distilled water daily!!</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t take supplements, as I&#x27;d rather get what I need from food, but sometimes, when I need a little help, I&#x27;ll go toward a supplement, but when I do, it&#x27;s from a food source...</li>
            <li> I finally became disgusted with high priced skin serums and creams from (I won&#x27;t name them, but they&#x27;re considered top line/best ever, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I used approximately 1/5 vitamin C powder with 1/5 distilled water (hot enough to dissolve this powder) and 3/5 of other ingredients including Squalene Oil, PCA and a little Argan oil.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C powder works wonders as a serum mixed with a little water and glycerin.  </li>
            <li> It truly leaves my face plump and my  pores closed.</li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> I used this, a few drops of skinsosoft plant therapy essential oil, vegetable glycerin and water and WAHLAH the softest skin of my life!</li>
            <li> have used for a while now and not seeing the results expected.</li>
            <li> Will order this again, but probable won&#x27;t need to for a while due to the generous amount in this jar.</li>
            <li> Am using every other day.  </li>
            <li> In spite of a couple of other reviewers&#x27; complaints of not mixing well or graininess, I don&#x27;t find this to be the case at all, given my mix of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The jar is small, but I only need 1/4 tsp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other blogs where people state</li>
            <li> Same if not better effect than store brought Vit C products that promise brightening, lightening &amp; tightening</li>
            <li> I could not get this powder to mix into the other ingredients throughly.</li>
            <li> I had been using premixed vitamin C serums with little noticeable difference and ended up having an allergic reaction that would give me little red bumps all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Philosophy charges a small fortune for a tiny vial of this stuff.</li>
            <li> You can buy other Vitamin C powder in larger jars for a little less money, but those are bigger crystals and hard to dissolve.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful when applying under eye area.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing vitamin c powder from online because it&#x27;s hard to tell if they are the genuine article</li>
            <li> I did think when I used the product my face looked \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; and felt stretched out a bit and tight, hence less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I keep the powder in a dark jar, and mix mix with a homemade hyaluronic acid serum in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> On the negative side though, I did get red at times and it burned a bit, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I had dark spots that have cleared up.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make the wrinkles starting around my eyes slow down in their formation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;GO NO HIGHER THAN 20%!</li>
            <li> My personal tip in making these serums is to MAKE SMALL and MAKE OFTEN!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gal had previously suggested the CamuCamu Vit C powder and another brand (</li>
            <li> $12 including shipping for less than 2 ounces of this stuff?</li>
            <li> you wrinkles aren&#x27;t gone but noticeably less defined.  </li>
            <li> so i mix it in half doses and that lasts me about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to purchase the right one, but christ they&#x27;re expensive and vitamin c is so unstable!</li>
            <li> It arrives tightly sealed &amp; protected.</li>
            <li> Keep C powder tightly sealed in darkened area.  </li>
            <li> your serum in a tight, dark-coloured glass spritz bottle and spritz it on your face every night and rub it in.</li>
            <li> It stings a little (tingling), but should not burn.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little bit</li>
            <li> A little product goes along way.</li>
            <li> I add a small amount with my moisturizer every other day</li>
            <li> I would also advise to use the lowest dosage to start with, and see how one&#x27;s skin reacts to it, then increase little by little.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d like a little recipe table for concentrations,&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take some time to dissolve but if a little Vodka is added to it, it dissolves easily.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> (I received this product a few days ago</li>
            <li> I never have trouble with grittiness.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Store in the fridge and use within a few days since there is no preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> try and make it everyday..</li>
            <li> You can make a 10% 1oz serum by using half a tspof LAA with 4.5 tsp of water!</li>
            <li> I had been using a high end, very expensive philosophy product that cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I made the serum in a small glass amber dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the serum I made made relatively no difference.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is a way to grind it even finer, or if it will still work weather</li>
            <li> However, when the item arrived, it tuned out it was only 1.8oz, which makes it insanely expensive.</li>
            <li> 1 happens to be 20% of 5 making this small amount still a whopping</li>
            <li> Just ordinary powder.</li>
            <li> You add a small amount of  this vitamin C powder to your lotion, serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well and feel grainy when I apply it on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin just sucks up the serum</li>
            <li> you Google instructions for use and start off slowly.</li>
            <li> Anything higher than 20% is bad!</li>
            <li> (I dont have any yet-even after being a past smoker for 11 years!</li>
            <li> Just add a very small amount and mix well.</li>
            <li> The thing about our bodies and the asymmetry of molecules is that if we can use one hand of a molecule in a beneficial manner, its opposite-hand molecule is likely to do badly for our physiology.</li>
            <li> So take it slow!</li>
            <li> (ie I&#x27;m always tired and should look like hell)</li>
            <li> Seriously appreciate it!</li>
            <li> When you have a compound that has BOTH hands of a molecule, your body will either reject the incompatible handed molecule as waste, both hand-molecules will cancel each other out making the benefits of the compound null, or your body will just react terribly to the bad-hand molecule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product</li>
            <li> The vitamin c will stain your nails a nasty yellow if it comes in contact with them.  </li>
            <li> Vague ol&#x27; \\&quot;ascorbic powder.\\</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> stays grainy regardless of what I do to try to get it to dissolve completely. Won&#x27;t dissolve so it doesn&#x27;t do a lot of good when trying to use it on skin. You can&#x27;t get grainy material into skin pores so unless one can get it dissolved completely with no graininess left, not much to use in skin products.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I been using it mixed in glycerin and water and it has made a difference in the look of my skin. Easy to mix no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I&#x27;m making my own Vitamin C serum and this works great.  Dissolves pretty quickly with room temp water and I have had no issues with it turning bad.</li>
            <li> OK... so I&#x27;m new to this DIY Vit C facial (&amp; hand, etc.) serum.  I refuse to continue to buy pre-made Vit C serum  manufactured by someone else, spending $24 to $40 per 2 oz bottle!  Never again.  I&#x27;ve done so much research on the Vit C, what powders, what \\&quot;type\\&quot; of C is most effective, how to preserve the efficacy of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research online, and shopping at Whole Foods, Sprouts, etc., I decided to go forward with this Making Cosmetics L-Ascorbic powder.  Very glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had watched many YouTube videos on this.  (I received this product a few days ago so don&#x27;t have a lot of experience or results to offer.  I know that I made THE best decision in powder though).  Anyway, today I watched an updated YouTube video from a woman (probably in her 50&#x27;s - looks great!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gal had previously suggested the CamuCamu Vit C powder and another brand (CamuCamu very pricey tho but it&#x27;s probably good stuff) but what thrilled me was her updated (4 months ago) Vit C serum video that was updated specifically to suggest THIS PARTICULAR POWDER out of all the powders she has used and researched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dissolves easily.  It arrives tightly sealed &amp; protected. And has rave reviews.  Very glad I chose this.  Excited to use this serum morning and night, making fresh serum every 3 to 4 days.  I use the following recipe, which is highly recommended (it might be a little strong for beginners - for people who haven&#x27;t used glycolic acid, Retin A, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is the 20% Vit C Serum recipe Fairly strong.  (Beginner might want to start with 5% or 10% strength for first week):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp Vit C powder&lt;br /&gt;2  tsp Distilled Water&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp to 1 tsp Vegie Glycerine (stabilizes the C, so it is necessary.  Use either this or Aloe Vera GEL.  Either is fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get an amber or cobalt blue 2 or 4 oz dropper bottle.  Sterilize in boiling water first.  Wait til it&#x27;s cool (you don&#x27;t want the C powder in a warm container)&lt;br /&gt;The amber or cobalt blue shields &amp; protects the serum from light, which can break serum down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read you can refigerate once you&#x27;ve made serum, or just place in a cool, dark closet/cupboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pour Distilled Water in sterilized measuring cup (or whatever), add Vit C powder.  Stir until powder COMPLETELY dissolved.  And this particular product is perfect!  Can&#x27;t go wrong!  (and fair pricing - will last long time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once stirred &amp; dissolved, add glycerine.  Pour into clean Amber bottle w/dropper lid.  Shake &amp; apply with clean hands/fingers (pat gently on face, neck &amp; chest and back of hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very clean, effective and stable C serum.  You gotta use it up within 1 week tho.  Or preferably make new serum every 2-4 days.  Super easy and fast to make.  Literally take 2 to 3 minutes.iner)&lt;br /&gt;The amber or cobalt blue shields &amp; protects the serum from light, which can break serum down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read you can refigerate once you&#x27;ve made serum, or just place in a cool, dark closet/cupboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pour Distilled Water in sterilized measuring cup (or whatever), add Vit C powder.

            <li> I bought this after reading all the reviews here. I followed the recipe/guidelines from this website  http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1lfm47/diy_vitamin_c_serum_a_really_full_explanation/  as it gave a good explanation as to why you needed the ratios they suggest. This product is very fine &amp; dissolves very easily. I&#x27;ve been using the 5% solution for about 3 weeks &amp; am pretty impressed with the results. I apply it every night after washing my face &amp; doing a simple aspirin mask*. It took about a week before I noticed any major results. My skin has a more even tone, my pores are smaller &amp; my fine lines are smoothing out. I will definitely be purchasing more items from Making Cosmetics Inc. I&#x27;d like to say thank you to the people here who have left helpful reviews. Seriously appreciate it!</li>
            <li> fast shipping and just as described.  my only wish is that it was just a tad more finely milled as it takes a little more time to dissolve into creams and lotions, but dissolves in serums just fine.  Otherwise great deal.</li>
            <li> Great for making vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> Great product. I mix it with Vitamin C and Argan oil as a moisturizer before bedtime. Helps brighten and smooth skin. Just add a very small amount and mix well.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m in heading into my mid 30&#x27;s and have 3 kids (ie I&#x27;m always tired and should look like hell) and i still get carded when ordering drinks. This stuff truly brightens, plumps and evens your complextion. It doesn&#x27;t completely alter your appearance but it does help. Sorry no such thing as miracles, but this is the best I&#x27;ve found at maintaining a youthful appearance, just make sure you Google instructions for use and start off slowly. I mix with distilled water in a sterilized glass bottle and apply after i wash my face. It stings a little (tingling), but should not burn. And make sure you&#x27;re keeping all your supplies clean this is absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li> I like the powder but there was no instruction on how to make it into a cosmetic. So I have had to try and figure it out.</li>
            <li> Good quality vitamin c powder,you do have to be very precise with the measurement because it can break you out.still a good quality product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I love it! It was shipped super fast and I use it to make my own vitamin c serum and it&#x27;s great just like everyone else says! :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Absorbs very well without the grits.</li>
            <li> Followed a recipe using this and glycerin and water. I add a few drops of hyaluronic acid and it makes a wonderful and very inexpensive serum.  My skin loves it.  Every bit as good as the ones I was paying a lot more for.</li>
            <li> Not as thrilled with this as I was at finding it. It&#x27;s way more grainy than the Philosophy Vitamin C powder.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Vitamin C Powder. When I can, I formulate products from home and I did make a nice Vit. C serum from this. I made a few so far. I think this 1.8 oz size will actually last me a long time  - or a lot of batches. I made the serum in a small glass amber dropper bottle. I used approximately 1/5 vitamin C powder with 1/5 distilled water (hot enough to dissolve this powder) and 3/5 of other ingredients including Squalene Oil, PCA and a little Argan oil. The powder/serum really transforms the texture of my skin instantly. It tingles a little bit but I like it. My skin is brighter and more even after using this. I love it and think MakingCosmetics has a lot of incredible products you can use to formulate your own skincare products.</li>
            <li> $12 including shipping for less than 2 ounces of this stuff? you&#x27;re kidding right. @ $8 for 2 oz&#x27;s that&#x27;s $64 a pound..helloooo, why are you people paying more than $64 a pound for this stuff? I know some of you are rich, but if you are why are you shopping on amazon? Did I miss something?</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Thank u</li>
            <li> This product very good. I can now mix my own vitamin C serum or cream without the high end cost of the leading brands. The power C mixes well. I stopped buying the 130.00 high end serum. This product excellent!  You can go online and look at various C recipes. I would only use this product if you have been using Vit C serum on your face on a regular basis. If not gradually mix light amounts and get used to it.</li>
            <li> Super fine, easily dissolves in my moisturizer. Much better value than the vitamin C powder that I found at Sephora. Will order this again, but probable won&#x27;t need to for a while due to the generous amount in this jar.</li>
            <li> Great for making vit C serum , resolves . Makes a great serum , saves much $$$ . Rather than spend hundreds on a serum from department store , make your own , it stays fresh as you only make enough for 3-4 days at a time -great for the skin ( I use 4 tspns distiller water , 1/4-1/2 tspn vit c powder, mix well then add 2 tspns aloe Vera gel - get the organic one with no carrageenan if possible- you can also add 1tspn veg glycerine &amp; 1 tspn aloe Vera gel instead of two tspns aloe Vera gel) &amp;#60; place in Amber or blue glass bottle .</li>
            <li> I make my own vitamin C serum with this powder and I love it.I mix this powder with glycerine, water and apply it every morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a &amp;#34;make your own&amp;#34; face cream.  It works!  It mixes well and delivery was pleasant my fast.</li>
            <li> Ladies, this really works with glycerin &amp; water!&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp distilled water&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp glycerin&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp powder&lt;br /&gt;Mix in brown bottle with eye dropper &amp; refrigerate&lt;br /&gt;Make only 1 week at a time</li>
            <li> Perfect package, this is the vitamin you need for the skin , because is not just ascorbic acid is L-ascorbic acid.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work.wasnt what I thought  I really thought it would work well on wrinkles but did not.</li>
            <li> The lady giving a facial (xmas present) said they use Vitamin C products to protect skin.  I have been making my own lotion so decided to add Vitamin C to the lotion.  Will take a little time to see if it works but much cheaper than the products they were selling.  Of course if it doesn&#x27;t work it is not the product ..  it is the bad advice.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, and item as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use L-ascorbic acid in cosmetics. Vitamin C is an excellent anti aging ingredient for facial serums and lotions. This powder is pure, mixes easily and is helps preserve the serum. However, vitamin c in cosmetics will turn yellow and then orange as it ages. So make cosmetics in small quantities and use quickly before it turns colors for the best results.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Vitamin C powder by Making Cosmetics , to make a powerful Vitamin C serum for my face, neck and  decloteie (chest).I am loving this vitamin C powder.It is not gritty or sandy like most, and the resuts you get are amazing. Smoother, less wrinkles, and more even toned skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because a reviewer had indicated that it was comparable with philosophy&#x27;s turbo booster c powder. Well, that&#x27;s a stretch!</li>
            <li> Mix very well and the powder is very fine..</li>
            <li> I use this with glycerin for a homemade Vitamin C serum mask, works fantastic. My skin glows afterward. A little product goes along way. I will not buy anymore high priced vitamin c serums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a real, actual improvement in skin texture and wrinkles.  Am using every other day.  Mix with moisturizing cream, apply over serum.  Be very careful when applying under eye area.  Keep C powder tightly sealed in darkened area.  I keep in drawer of vanity.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have looked all over for it will order again I used it and it is just what I was looking for thankyou</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but I totally notice a difference with my skin and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks. As an Esthetician and an RN I can say that this equals the commercially made serums. I found no grittiness as I mixed the powder in a Kiehl&#x27;s moisturizer. I plan on making a serum next with glycerin and distilled water. Also going to try mixing in with aloe vera gel. I&#x27;ve been using topical Vit C for about 15 years...this is the best product I&#x27;ve come across. For those who see no results...give it time.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT BEST PRICE FAST SHIPPING. Buy it already... your welcome;)</li>
            <li> WOW!&amp;#34; I love this stuff. I make it with vitamin e and distilled water and put on in the morning only. When it dries I use evco after. My face looks amazing it totally has restored my natural glow. I&#x27;m trying to limit the use of products and chemicals for the face. I read that it actually can take as long as six months to see full results and for the collagen to be restored but I sware it&#x27;s already working.</li>
            <li> Great to mix with moisturizer! Feels great on skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a vitamin C serum that I saw I could make myself on DR OZ. The vitamin C Powder here was perfect and as far as I know just as described. Unfortunately the serum I made made relatively no difference.  LOL</li>
            <li> This stuff mixes well.  I mixed with vegetable gycerin and water and it mixed very well. Recevied very fast.  Have had no reaction putting it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this pure powder for awhile and I have had no luck...  I finally found it and am soooo happy...</li>
            <li> Mixes really well with my everyday lotions.</li>
            <li> i love the Vitamin C Powder (L-ascorbic acid) Pure - 1.8oz / 50g Vitamin c begins breaking down once it is made. With this powder i can mix up just enough for a daily facial application one week at a time. Store the mix in the fridge in an amber bottle to help it last longer. Just a tiny bit of warm water will dissolve the crystals.</li>
            <li> Dissolves well into all of my skin care product, greay buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the service anf and product, definitely recommended  great  quality what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Maggie</li>
            <li> very good and now I can make my own VC facial mask</li>
            <li> Delighted to have discovered making cosmetics and their vitamin C powder. I now add a bit every morning to my tretinoin crem, it blends fast and well and gives me an unparalleled glow.</li>
            <li> Topical Vitamin C has been shown to be much better for skin than ingested (swallowed) Vitamin C.  I mix it in my generic Cetaphil-clone, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  I&#x27;m satisfied with how fine the powder is; it dissolves quickly enough.  Good stuff -- good price.</li>
            <li> This is the second order of this vitamin C powder that my wife has ordered and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I mix this with water and glycerin and use it on my face, neck and chest.  I cannot believe how making that serum works so fast on my skin, and I&#x27;m 70 years old but sure don&#x27;t look it.  This comes in a fine powder form, and I have never had a problem mixing my formula up in a brown bottle that keeps light out.  This is the brand to buy, gals...works great for those homemade facial serums.</li>
            <li> Love this Vitamin C powder! I use it twice a day on my face. Much better price than Vit-C serums in store, and does not have any other funky unknown ingredients. and you can control how strong you want it. I keep the powder in a dark jar, and mix mix with a homemade hyaluronic acid serum in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried mixing this with pure glycerin. I&#x27;m disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well and feel grainy when I apply it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in my vitamin c serums. It has a bit of a gritty feel on the face, but it seems to be working. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I have been using vitamin C powder on my face for years. I am 45 with a little sun damage and some fine lines. I had been using a high end, very expensive philosophy product that cost an arm and a leg. This not only works better, its a million times cheaper. It really brightens my skin! I recently had someone asked me if I&#x27;d been tanning. I don&#x27;t, but my face just has a sun-kissed glow. I mix it with a water-based hyaluronic acid serum. I mix it in the palm of my hand until it&#x27;s completely dissolved, then apply to my face. I never have trouble with grittiness. It&#x27;s a good idea to wash your hands after applying, however. If the serum with vitamin C settles into the corners of your fingernails, it will turn them orange.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that this was a cream.  It didn&#x27;t say anywhere that it was a powder.  Now I have to figure out how to make it into a cream.</li>
            <li> I finally became disgusted with high priced skin serums and creams from (I won&#x27;t name them, but they&#x27;re considered top line/best ever, etc.).  So I put a lot of time and energy into research, research, and more research toward finding the best ingredients for optimal and amazing skin care results, and if you&#x27;re reading this, you already know Vitamin C is one of the the numerous &amp;#34;best things&amp;#34; you can do for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product may not be the ultimate of it&#x27;s genre, but I&#x27;ve no need to look further because it&#x27;s amazing! and so fairly priced.  In spite of a couple of other reviewers&#x27; complaints of not mixing well or graininess, I don&#x27;t find this to be the case at all, given my mix of ingredients.  My experiments are still ongoing, and my current formula uses a mix of the C powder, distilled water, glycerin, vitamin E oil and a few other all natural and organic oils and extracts.  I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;ve toned down the percentage of C, but no problem whatsoever with the C powder dissolving easily upon shaking prior to use.  I put all the ingredients in a sterilized amber dropper bottle, and my results have far exceeded anything from the high end serums I&#x27;ve wasted money on for the past decade.  I&#x27;m 59, fair and sensitive skin.  Thrilled with the results of using this product in my formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, in my opinion, buy this with confidence.</li>
            <li> I was stupid to purchase this without checking on it.  I, for some reason, had it in my mind that ascorbic acid was a natural form of vitamin c.  I could not have been more wrong.  After I purchased it, and to my horror, used it for about two weeks, something made me check on it.  Ascorbic acid is made from GMO corn and I&#x27;ve forgotten what else, but heated, from what I understand pretty intensely.  Not what I want to put in my body.  I will not make that mistake again. I generally don&#x27;t take supplements, as I&#x27;d rather get what I need from food, but sometimes, when I need a little help, I&#x27;ll go toward a supplement, but when I do, it&#x27;s from a food source... except for this purchase.  In my mind, anything manufactured like this should not be in our bodies.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and I have been using this product for several months now, and I am please with the results.  I add a small amount with my moisturizer every other day and I have seen great results.</li>
            <li> I chose this powder as a brightening agent because of recommendations on reddit. It has made my skin visibly brighter and softer, and faded old acne scars. Basically, there are a lot of studies surrounding the effectiveness of vit. C on skin. They indicate that yes, it does work to increase skin turnover and give a youthful appearance in most cases. I guess the only downside is that it&#x27;s harder to keep a tan on your face. :) It is quite lightening. But I can tell you, this will be in my skin arsenal probably for the rest of my life. I hope this company keeps selling it for that long.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, this is a POTENT &#x27;STUFF&#x27;. I am used to AHA, non-prescription Retinol, but nothing compares to the feeling left after using this. I would also advise to use the lowest dosage to start with, and see how one&#x27;s skin reacts to it, then increase little by little. It truly leaves my face plump and my  pores closed. I use it as a toner, twice a day.</li>
            <li> Ordered this so I could make my own Vitamin C serum.  Decided on this particular brand as it is ground very finely; it dissolves very quickly and thoroughly.  The jar is small, but I only need 1/4 tsp. to make the serum, so it should last a long time.  You can buy other Vitamin C powder in larger jars for a little less money, but those are bigger crystals and hard to dissolve.  I&#x27;ve seen other blogs where people state they have to put the crystals in a coffee grinder to get it into powder form.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C powder works wonders as a serum mixed with a little water and glycerin.  I use this during the day for the simple reason that I sleep on my stomach and generally fall asleep with my face on my hands.  The vitamin c will stain your nails a nasty yellow if it comes in contact with them.  Mix the serum and apply with a brush or sponge to avoid getting it on your nails.  Having said that, it did make my skin tone more even and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just an fyi.  L-ASORBIC acid is water soluble and will not absorb in oils, moisturizers, or glycerine.  This is why you must first use the distilled water to absorb it. This will prevent it from being grainy and allow your skin to absorb it topically and reach your skin at a cellular level. The reviewer from 7 months ago has the perfect recipe and reccomendation on how to use it effectively.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I use this to make homemade vitamin C serum. Same if not better effect than store brought Vit C products that promise brightening, lightening &amp; tightening haha</li>
            <li> I use this to make my Vitamin C serum and it seems to do a good job.  My skin just sucks up the serum and it&#x27;s fresh and moisted for days, even after washing it.</li>
            <li> I love making my own Vit C serum. This product saves a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife, could be stronger dosage.  Works great</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own vitamin c serum.  It is potent stuff however I had to put it in my vitamix to make it finer.  As is, even though it is a powder, it was too grainy.  Once I whizzed it in the vitamix it was perfect</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with a little bit of distilled water daily!! I always use it FRESH right after mixing so it doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s magic when putting it all over my face! Stings just a tiny bit but my skin looks better and better and I will do everything in my power to prevent as many wrinkles as possible as I get older! (I dont have any yet-even after being a past smoker for 11 years! luckily I quit before I turned 35! LOL)..but using this along with eating a vegan plant based diet and drinking 3 liters of water daily, hopefully my skin will age much slower than most ;)</li>
            <li> Dissolves easy in water. Not sure if it&#x27;s making that much difference. Need more time to decide on that.</li>
            <li> Making my own face cream.  Turned out like it should.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fine powder for cosmetics - even used in baking!</li>
            <li> Comes in fine powder form, perfect for DIY vit C serum. I make enough and keep it in an amber dropper bottle and use it up in a week. Can see already my skin is clearer, brighter after just two weeks of twice a day application. Love it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend not only the item but also the seller. The product arrived earlier than expected and was packaged with care. I have started using the product as part of my skin care routine and it&#x27;s been only a week and I&#x27;m already seeing results. I was skeptical about purchasing vitamin c powder from online because it&#x27;s hard to tell if they are the genuine article but so far I would have to say that this exactly what you want if you are going to be using it for cosmetic purposes.</li>
            <li> The vit. C brightens your skin.  Helps lighten dark age spots and is great to put on when you go out in the sun.  You can use it alone or spritz it on over your make up.  I like it very much and the price is great!</li>
            <li> mixed in glycerin for topical application great</li>
            <li> Does just what it is supposed to....Thank You!</li>
            <li> Works as well as the $45 brand I was using.  I mix it with my Philosophy Hope In A Jar every a.m. and p.m.  can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t think of buying this before and saving a boatload of $$$ .</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> as expected. excellent product for those who make their own face serum. fast delivery faster than expected. great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Vitamin C powder to create my own &amp;#34;anti-aging serum&amp;#34;. I used a formula I found on a trusted skincare blog and followed it exactly. No matter what I did I could not get this powder to mix into the other ingredients throughly. It felt very gritty on the skin as if I was rubbing sand on my face. I am not sure if there is a way to grind it even finer, or if it will still work weather it is fine or not - but it seems that it may not absorb into the skin as well as a more refined serum. For now I will continue to use it and research it more. This seller shipped the item very quickly and the powder is in a small screw top plastic container inside a sealed ziplock style bag.</li>
            <li> I had been using premixed vitamin C serums with little noticeable difference and ended up having an allergic reaction that would give me little red bumps all over my face.  So I pretty much gave up on using it completely.&lt;br /&gt;But desperate to remove some long standing sun spots that were only looking worse as I age (45), I decided to try and mix my own fresh serum each day.&lt;br /&gt;And I am very pleased to report that the allergy is no longer a problem with this product.  I mix it per use, a tiny, tiny pinch with a dab of aloe vera in the palm of my hand.  Amazing results, one week in and the spots are clearly fading and the rest of my skin is looking fresh and vibrant, really shocking to look in the mirror each morning. So I am very happy with it!  As a moisturizing balance, I am using a couple drops of argan oil after the vitamin c has soaked in.  Really happy with it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. It works at healing my teens acne bumps more quickly as well</li>
            <li> I use this with distilled water and glycerine to make vitamin C serum.  Much cheaper than buying it already made and you are sure it is good.  When you buy serum it may have already oxidized too much.  Should be clear not yellow.</li>
            <li> Why on earth ever pay $120 for 20% vitamin C when you can make your own? This is a generously portioned bag of l-ascorbic acid and there are tons of tutorials on the internet instructing people how to make their own serums that range in potency from 5%-20%. I first made my serums with this powder, distilled water and aloe gel but the consistency was a bit watery. Then I stopped with the aloe gel and now use Now brand glycerin and it&#x27;s perfect. If you want radiant skin Vit C serum is a must. I use it all over my body now, particularly face, neck, chest, hands and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> The best vitamin c on the market</li>
            <li> I use this in my sunscreen to enhance the effects. I love it ! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Wow,  I&#x27;ve only used for 3 days and I can see a marked improvement in wrinkles around my eyes and on my neck.  I have sensitive skin so I worried that it might be a little strong but used 1/8 teaspoon in jenniraincloud vitamin c serum and no issues.  I could feel a tingle but nothing that was unbearable.  Mind you wrinkles aren&#x27;t gone but noticeably less defined.  I&#x27;ll take that.  Wish I had found sooner!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for making serum, adding to cleansing products, and aloe.  Fast delivery and fair price. Will be buying again and do recommend this product and the comapny who sells it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dissolve well</li>
            <li> I replaced my years long relationship with Philosophy&#x27;s vitamin C powder and serum with this. I am completely satisfied and spending a lot less.</li>
            <li> Great vitamin c have been using for two months now. Packaged well and fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I make the serum every 3rd or 4th day and it has done wonders for my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and get rashes easily, even from hypoallergenic products. I bought this to make the wrinkles starting around my eyes slow down in their formation. I mixed a 1/4 teaspoon Vit C with 3/4 teaspoons water, DAILY and put it on a clean face. I also used it on stretch marks, but did not see a difference in my stretch marks.    I did think when I used the product my face looked \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; and felt stretched out a bit and tight, hence less wrinkles. On the negative side though, I did get red at times and it burned a bit, so I stopped using it. Also this leaves a grainy texture on my face that I have to wash off later.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting, arrived quickly and is a great price</li>
            <li> this powder is great,very easy to mix with jo jo oil,cant beat the price either.Will definatly buy more when I run out,which could take awhile,since I only mix a tiny amount,it wil last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great powder, mixes well. love it</li>
            <li> Great product for making your own Vitamin C serum. It dissolves quickly in water and mixes well. It&#x27;s so easy and cheap to make your own highly-effective Vitamin C serum that I think everyone should do it! It&#x27;s a great way to prevent the signs of aging, if you do it every single day. Here&#x27;s the recipe guide I used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5%&lt;br /&gt;  Dissolve 1/2 tsp LAA in 8 1/2 tsp distilled water&lt;br /&gt;  Once fully dissolved, add 1 tsp glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10%&lt;br /&gt;  Dissolve 1 tsp LAA in 8 tsp distilled water&lt;br /&gt;  Once fully dissolved, add 1 tsp glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15%&lt;br /&gt;  Dissolve 1.5 tsp LAA in 7 1/2 tsp distilled water&lt;br /&gt;  Once fully dissolved, add 1 tsp glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20%&lt;br /&gt;  Dissolve 2 tsp LAA in 7 tsp distilled water&lt;br /&gt;  Once fully dissolved, add 1 tsp glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your serum in a tight, dark-coloured glass spritz bottle and spritz it on your face every night and rub it in. A batch lasts about a week, then you should make a new one. Start at 5%, then after two weeks, move up to 10% and so forth. 20% is the most effective percentage for anti-aging, but your skin needs time to work up to that level. So take it slow! You will see results.</li>
            <li> Well priced, good product.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as well as the Murad Vit C product and this is oh so cheap. Not always easy to dissolve but still fun to make my own serum.</li>
            <li> I *never* write reviews based on customer service, but this one really deserves it. The image of the item says 8oz, and I thought that is the item I was ordering. It was also in the same price range as similar items from other seller on amazon. However, when the item arrived, it tuned out it was only 1.8oz, which makes it insanely expensive. I requested a return, and got a response that they don&#x27;t do returns, without any explanation, apology, or anything similar. Just completely ignored the fact that the information they have up is misleading.</li>
            <li> This product is downright amazing. I had good skin before but this took it to a whole different level. I did a lot of research before and it said add it to glycerine etc etc. But laziness took over and i simply add it to my facial moisturizer (a tiny,tiny amount). My skin is glowing and i have not had any adverse reactions at all. Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> Now making my own vitamin C serum for about $5.00 per bottle. Used to pay $100 per bottle - sweet!</li>
            <li> Saw instant results. Fine lines and pores were 80% better within the first few days.  Have used it on my hands for sun spots and they are looking better as well.  Will be reorder.</li>
            <li> Bought that powder to make DIY vit C serum.  The powder don&#x27;t dissolve and it is staying on your skin.</li>
            <li> I did not have to wait to get the ascorbic acid, I will soon start my new trials of making the refined&lt;br /&gt; developer formula that I started 5 years ago to process Technical Pan,(Kodak), 70mm, and I can not&lt;br /&gt;wait any longer to start working with my 300 rolls of 70mm film stored in my freezer, I will continue&lt;br /&gt;buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> Very fine powder allows for making a great Vitamin C serum.  You don&#x27;t have to shake it for 30 minutes. Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this Vitamin C powder to be an additive in a moisturizer.  It dissolved perfectly and performed well.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Super fine! Dissolves great!</li>
            <li> Love this! I make my own serum and use it everyday. I love that it comes from Washington and that it is L-ascorbic acid!</li>
            <li> The vitamin C powder was just what I was looking for, however, I think I was a bit hasty as I have since found that I could have purchased it at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> This is great product and company. You can go to their website and get recipes to conjure up what you need. I am so glad that this company did this for normal people to purchase the same ingredients as the cosmetic companies sell, I now have purity at my fingertips. Go to Youtube and other blogs as well to find many recipes. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I made my own Vitamin C serum and let me tell you it is a miracle in a bottle!!! I used this, a few drops of skinsosoft plant therapy essential oil, vegetable glycerin and water and WAHLAH the softest skin of my life! Totally affordable and a life saver! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I  make my own vit. C serum for my face. For pennies you can make a wonderful serum for your complexion.</li>
            <li> Great product works on skin</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I mix a fresh solution of this with Hyaluronic Acid and DMAE Powder which I ordered at Amazon..My skin is radiant.</li>
            <li> Seriously awesome product! Will definitely buy again, though I expect this one to last quite a while, since only a little in needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with my moisturizer every night after I clean my face with my Erisonic.  My skin looks great. :)</li>
            <li> good packaging. Good product exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally making my own vitamin c serums!! I&#x27;m so happy! I&#x27;ve been looking to purchase the right one, but christ they&#x27;re expensive and vitamin c is so unstable! First off, one thing I love about this powder, other than it definitely being an ultra-fine powder, is the fact that it is SPECIFICALLY L-ascorbic acid powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve noticed about a lot of ascorbic acid powders on Amazon, it&#x27;s the fact that they are Ascorbic powders. That&#x27;s it. Vague ol&#x27; \\&quot;ascorbic powder.\\&quot; I say this because ascorbic acid consists of two molescules: L (Levo meaning left) and D (Dextro meaning right) L-Ascorbic acid is the superior molecule thanks to being more beneficial to our skin! Dextro-Ascorbic acid actually has far more cons than pros and does not occur naturally. The thing about our bodies and the asymmetry of molecules is that if we can use one hand of a molecule in a beneficial manner, its opposite-hand molecule is likely to do badly for our physiology. So while L-Ascorbic acid is awesome, D-Ascorbic is not.  When you have a compound that has BOTH hands of a molecule, your body will either reject the incompatible handed molecule as waste, both hand-molecules will cancel each other out making the benefits of the compound null, or your body will just react terribly to the bad-hand molecule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why it is important to make sure you are getting PURE L-ASCORBIC ACID and this is why I cannot trust products that won&#x27;t specify what molecule of the ascorbic acid you&#x27;re getting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway everyone, I am on day three of using this fantastic serum I&#x27;ve made. I actually made it to be more of a toner than a serum so that I can use it on other parts of my body. Please start out on a gentle amount when you&#x27;re new to Vit C skincare. Ascorbic acid is an acid after all! Start out too high of a concentration and you&#x27;ll get some stinging discomfort. 5% vitamin C is a great concentration to start at. Ramp up your concentration by 5% every two weeks so by week 2, you&#x27;re moving from 5% to 10%, week 4 from 10% to 15%, week 6 15% to 20% and STOP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GO NO HIGHER THAN 20%! Anything higher than 20% is bad! Even the famed L-Ascorbic acid has its limits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like a little recipe table for concentrations,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 5% potency, mix 1/2 tsp. of your liquid base (preferably some water to dissolve the powder and add whatever) with 9 tsp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10%: 1 tsp. vitamin C powder + 9 tsp. of base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15%: 1.5 tsp. vitamin C powder + 8.5 tsp. of base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20%: 2 tsp. vitamin C powder + 8 tsp. of base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 3/11/14: So now that I&#x27;ve worked my way up to a 20% vitamin c tolerance, I&#x27;ve found you don&#x27;t have to follow a table and make the same amount every time. My personal tip in making these serums is to MAKE SMALL and MAKE OFTEN! I have a 1oz amber glass bottle that is just enough for my face to last two weeks. I used to throw my batch away every week to make a fresh one but found vitamin c, when properly sealed and hidden from light can last 2-3 weeks! But if that mixture changes color in any way, THROW IT AWAY, IT HAS OXIDIZED. Oxidized vitamin c is TERRIBLE for your skin; don&#x27;t try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I actually like to use a percent calculator to make mixtures that are just enough for my container of choice, which is currently and permanently now a little 1oz bottle (I used to use jars.) I measure my mixtures by teaspoons. Since there are six teaspoons in an ounce, I work to make my mixtures accommodate that limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like for example, my 20% vitamin c toners consist of 1 tsp of pure LAA and 4 tsp of water (this sometimes includes 1 tsp of an optional ingredient. All depends on what I feel like putting) giving a total of 5 tsp. 1 happens to be 20% of 5 making this small amount still a whopping 20%!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Play with percentages if you need to change the amount of toner/serum/lotion you make! You can make a 10% 1oz serum by using half a tspof LAA with 4.5 tsp of water! A 5% by using a quarter of a teaspoon of LAA and using 4.75 tsp of water! Too difficult to measure? Change your total amount!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make your epidermis happy. :Dof LAA with 4.5 tsp of water! A 5% by using a quarter of a teaspoon of LAA and using 4.75 tsp of water! Too difficult to measure? Change your total amount!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make your epidermis happy. :D</li>
            <li> I have been mixing little scoops of this with rose water/witch hazel in my hand every morning and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> Very good. ..will recommend</li>
            <li> i bought this after seeing a low cost serum being used on youtube. it is very cost effective. i think it makes my skin look better. i use it on my arms and neck and decolletage as well as my face. i cannot use a full batch before it becomes neutral so i mix it in half doses and that lasts me about a week. i&#x27;ve applied it when i had little cuts or irritations at one week old and it still stings so i believe it retains it&#x27;s effectiveness for a week. i don&#x27;t go beyond that however.</li>
            <li> I make my own vitamin c mask!</li>
            <li> The product is outstanding and disolves well for making at home c serums. Very fresh and potent not to mention i recieved it within 3 days of my order. Already know I&#x27;ll be purchasing many more products from this company. Thank uou.</li>
            <li> have used for a while now and not seeing the results expected. but otherwise, product arrived fast.&lt;br /&gt;maybe could come with better mixing guidelines</li>
            <li> This is great it! I had dark spots that have cleared up.</li>
            <li> This is packages up really nice.  I have added it to some of my creams for added benefits.</li>
            <li> I started to make my own vitamin C serum and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;This allows me to know what is in my serum, that it is fresh, and I control how strong it will be.&lt;br /&gt;This is the new fountain of youth</li>
            <li> I got this thinking that I would find it an easy product to use.  I did not find any instructions as to how to apply it, or mix it and I did not realize that the &amp;#34;powder pure&amp;#34; was exactly that &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness I have not used the product so my rating is only my frustration as to what to do with it now.</li>
            <li> Just ordinary powder. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I love it. So very simple to make your own vitamin c serum. Takes 2 minutes to make 20% vitamin c serum. When made at home you are assured it is stable and works. Just make enough for about one week.</li>
            <li> It is fine.  Just wish it had an expiration date on it.</li>
            <li> on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. You can not beat the quality for the price. I use to make a facial serum with distilled water and glycerin. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this. Notice a difference on my face after a couple of months of use.</li>
            <li> Perfect add-in, using just a pinch in evening moisturizer for a nice antioxidant boost. Skin feels lovely in the morning. Also nice on its own, made into a paste with some water, as a 10-minute mask. Philosophy charges a small fortune for a tiny vial of this stuff. Crazy! Buy this instead.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to save money on buying my own vitamin c serum.  I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on DIY serums, but this powder just doesn&#x27;t dissolve well no matter what technique I use which leaves any serums I make very, very grainy.  So far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before and it lasted forever. I use it to make my own vitamin C serum and save big bucks over buying ready made brands. My skin loves me and my wallet loves me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a 10% serum, I dissolve 1/2 tsp. in 4 tsp. of water, and add 1/2 tsp. of propylene glycol (available here on Amazon, just search) and put it in an amber glass bottle. I use it lavishly over the next 2-3 days. Store in the fridge and use within a few days since there is no preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Make my own vitamin c serum with distilled water and vegetable glycerin and makes a difference in the clarity of my skin</li>
            <li> I use this to remove chemicals from my hair after swimming, chlorine removal shampoos just don&#x27;t seem to work but this works great!</li>
            <li> Love the product, already purchased a 2nd bag. I use to be one of those naive people that purchase a high end vitamin C serum thinking I was buying something of good quality and thanks to all of the research about how vitamin c was unstable and doesn&#x27;t last very long I know I had to figure out a way to make it myself and keep it fresh. I am now at a 15% solution and reaping the benefits of using fresh vitamin C on my skin. STOP BUYING VITAMIN C SERUMS/CREAMS, you don&#x27;t know how long that product have been on the shelf and once you get it home the potency of vitamin c may be gone. Make a fresh batch using distilled/rosewater, glycerin/aloe vera and use as a serum/toner or just take a tiny amount in your hand and add in favorite moisturizer. The only down side to making your own C serum is that you have to make a fresh batch every 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> Had read an article about making your own Vitamin C serum.  This was exactly what I needed, priced right and shipped promptly.  Thank you</li>
            <li> IT was great dealing with this seller. I bought this product after i decided to make my own serum. this comes very well packaged and the shipping is fast. The small box goes a long way - i&#x27;m sure it can go over a year. I would definitely recommend this seller and this product from him.</li>
            <li> Philosophy (cosmetics company) sells the same exact vitamin C in a much smaller bottle at an exorbitantly high price.  You add a small amount of  this vitamin C powder to your lotion, serum.  It brightens and refines your skin and helps fade hyperpigmentation.  It maintains its integrity as opposed to vitamin c products in liquid form, because this form if vitamin c is more stable and it is contained in an opaque sealed container.  YOU REALLY NEED TO BLEND THIS INTO YOUR LOTION/SERUM ETC AND REALLY RUB IT IN SO THAT IT DOES NOT LEAVE. A GRITTY FEEL-</li>
            <li> I have used L-ascorbic acid powder in my moisturizer for several years and have felt it to be very beneficial.  I ordered this brand, basically because of the price.  It has basically one issue that would cause me not to recommend it or to reorder it.  Previous brands that I have purchased, (which are twice to three times the cost of this specific product) were very finely milled.  This brand is quite grainy and neither disolves in moisturizer or liquid.  It&#x27;s like ground up vitimin c tablets.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever! I love it!👍</li>
            <li> mixed this with pure hyaluronic acid made into gel, and my face is looking younger and smoother with less redness.  I notice changes everyday, and use it on my stomach and thighs to firm these areas as well, it is working great.  No issues with the company and product is great without the department store prices and possibility of rancid product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, fast delivery time. I use this for a face serum. Great packaging. I am re ordering this product today because it works so well. Its a great price. I use it to make a Vitamin C face serum.   When I run out, I will re order again!!  No one asked me to write a review or offered me anything to write this. I just really do recommend this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> Will review in about two months.</li>
            <li> AWESOME - GREAT FACIAL SCRUB</li>
            <li> I purchased my product from MakingCosmentics.. very fine and dissolves quickly! No crystals.&lt;br /&gt;I keep IT stored in the plastic pouch it came in.. should i put in a jar?&lt;br /&gt;I try and make it everyday.. 1tsp of distilled water and a pinch of the powder then spray on my face as toner!&lt;br /&gt;Skin will be glowing within days!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I have very sensitive skin and was struggling to find good skincare products that benefit instead of harming my skin. This product works very well for me. I mixed it with water and glycerin and apply it to my face and body twice a day. My skin loves this homemade toner! I believe I already see a positive effect on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was fast and all products from the seller were professional wrapped. I would recommend this seller to anyone interested making his or her own cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The product was received in a timely manner and was as described. My only negative&lt;br /&gt;comment would be that I wish it came sealed in a tamper proof container to insure&lt;br /&gt;purity. IT came in a zip lock bag that was tinted to avoid sun degradation.</li>
            <li> The powder came very fast. I used it to make a vitamin C serum for my face, and it&#x27;s been nothing but amazing. I&#x27;ve seen improvement already in my complexion. This will be a must have item for me in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for homemade DIY Vitamin C facial serum.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it.  It does take some time to dissolve but if a little Vodka is added to it, it dissolves easily.&lt;br /&gt;Also found you can use clear aloe vera gel with it and it doesn&#x27;t have that gritty feel when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I will definately purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this and will continue to re-purchase.  The price and quality are very good.</li>
            <li> This is a nice fresh powder...mixes well with Hyaluronic Acid.  Vitamin C will lighten your  skin though if you are a tanner.</li>
            <li> very good service &amp; product</li>
