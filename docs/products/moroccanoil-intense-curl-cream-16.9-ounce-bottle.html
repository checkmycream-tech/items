            <li>I LOVE MOROCCANOIL!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I really liked the moroccan oil, and the curl cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING but otherwise way overpriced and doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular for my curls.  </li>
            <li>The Intense Curl Cream is excellent for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Received this as a gift from a friend and bought one of my own.</li>
            <li>It tames the sparks and makes him smell nice.</li>
            <li>MoroccanOil and Intense Curl is wonderful for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Awesome product highly recommended</li>
            <li>Great product straight from Israel!!</li>
            <li>and I must say that the combination of the two is truly a perfect prescription for shiny, bouncy, natural curls.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I just love Moroccanoil, is by far the best product in the market.</li>
            <li>Even when I never touched my hair with bleach or heat or anything, my hair didn&#x27;t look this healthy.  </li>
            <li>So, do I want healthy looking hair, or healthy looking skin?  </li>
            <li>Finally a product that is perfect for curly curly curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve truly had better results with Garnier products purchased for 5.00 at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>so you really get a great use of your buck.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and before using this product i was using 5 products in my hair to make sure it didn&#x27;t frizz up.</li>
            <li>I love this hair product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and smells great too.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it.</li>
            <li>I know that argan oil is pricey, but what mostly comprises this product is water, mineral oil, petrolatum, and dimethicone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it has that lovely Moroccan Oil scent</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>My curls are better defined without a &#x27;tacky-sticky&#x27; feel, and there is softness...and that lovely scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Cantu products (curl activator, curl cream) as they do great things for my hair and are really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it : )</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The top wouldnt work.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair now.</li>
            <li>Pretty good curl cream for me.</li>
            <li>Great to smooth very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have a 6 y/o grandaughter with natural curly hair and it leaves her hair soft, shiny, smelling wonderful and none greasy love it!</li>
            <li>They are not cheap but you don&#x27;t need to use more than a dime-size for most of Moroccan Oil&#x27;s products to see magnificent results.</li>
            <li>Great for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>SUPER SERVICE!</li>
            <li>Each curly haired person has their own unique hair, but this stuff is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a useful, good product, pleasant even, but be careful of quantity.</li>
            <li>and I still have plenty left and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Smells like cheap soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I&#x27;ve used this for several years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found for defining curls without making your hair too stiff and crunchy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in part due to many raving reviews, and after using the oil with great results.  </li>
            <li>Love this product smells great and gives my curls natural look an soft bounce.</li>
            <li>And one more thing, this product is really</li>
            <li>he is very spoiled:)</li>
            <li>Seller was quick.</li>
            <li>I will keep on buying the oil treatment, because it&#x27;s worth the money, but will not be spending my money on the curl cream again.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this leaves your curls.  </li>
            <li>So I think the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I use it right after showering on damp hair.  </li>
            <li>It gives good definition, without weighing it down or making it greasy.    </li>
            <li>so probaly those good reviews are from people living in less humid areas.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many many products including some really super expensive stuff in salons.</li>
            <li>I have used every single kind of curl cream known to man.  </li>
            <li>and it does do a very nice job of giving form to natural curls without adding sticky-stiffness, like some other \\&quot;curly hair\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous, I put it on and my hair air dries beautifully, soft curls.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and light.</li>
            <li>I even use it occasionally on my Bouvier des Flandres&#x27;s curly, static winter coat.</li>
            <li>I think I have about 3 months more left in the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried it</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Really does curl your hair!</li>
            <li>In looking for the perfect product that would not leave my hair stiff, I spent lots of $$$$$$$.  </li>
            <li>and I use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li>&quot; it smells something like the patchouli oils that my friends who thought they were cool would buy from vendors on NYC streets when we were in our teens and early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder lenght, medium texture, not so full, dyed and highlighted with soft curls.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair super soft and shiny, also, helps create curls.</li>
            <li>I order a bottle of PURE argan oil (not morocanoil brand) and now I mix two pumps of the cream with 10 drops of the oil</li>
            <li>I have been using the Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream for about three years now.</li>
            <li>It really acts as a moisturizer, so</li>
            <li>I really like the Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream.  </li>
            <li>Nothing worked for me, until my hair dresser used Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream.</li>
            <li>This works really well on curly hair.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this is priced really high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It doesnt take much to keep my whole head in line.</li>
            <li>really work either.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Got it working really well.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Now i only use Moroccan Oil and honestly all those products together cost about the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells good, it is thick, but will not leave your hair crunchy or</li>
            <li>I am satisfied the product arrived on time and also the price is reasonable among of the other suppliers.</li>
            <li>like so many other curl defining products.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product is not only how easy and fast it is to wear my curls naturally, but also that the end result (once your hair is dry) is soft and shiny NOT hard and crunchy</li>
            <li>The product is fine - the expiration date for such a big bottle was OK for a professional hair dresser, not a single customer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and use it daily mixed with AG fast food leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>In addition, add the Moroccan hair oil as needed to my hair, particularly the ends.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone with curly hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SUPPLIER.</li>
            <li>keep the old pump until you know the new on is working!!</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly and before it was due.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping with continued use of this product, along with the intense hydrating masque from Moroccan Oil, that eventually my frizz will be completely controlled.   </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and use basically two fingertips worth and it&#x27;s better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used and no small (which I appreciate.)  </li>
            <li>I am however more sensitive than the average person, so if you are a very sensitive skin person, use with caution.</li>
            <li>I use it right after i take a shower and pay extra attention to my ends.</li>
            <li>The plain Moroccan oil is a much better product.  </li>
            <li>I love how my hair just plain behaves when I use it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and curly, no frizz at all!</li>
            <li>Lost my first one so promptly bought a second.</li>
            <li>My gray is starting to come in and its still curly but with the gray hairs, more wiry and less tame-able.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich leave in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>and if I applied more it looked greasy and dull.</li>
            <li>REALLY well, and the next day, it looks like I didn&#x27;t put any product on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Drug store, professional - you name it.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly-wavy hair that is prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li>The product does bring out some of your natural curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my curly hair soft and prevents frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use it, my hair kinda poofs out and gets frizzy and wild looking.</li>
            <li>I have had the bottle for 6 months so far</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/frizzy hair and Moroccanoil</li>
            <li>Intense Curl Cream is the only thing I have found that can control my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a good hair styling cream that I have been using for a long time; however, there are not many places where carry larger size in market until I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>It is hard to get the right amount on your hair to get the right curls.</li>
            <li>I, like so many of you, have spent a small fortune on hair products that don&#x27;t really do what they say they will do.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, in fact, this entire line of products.  </li>
            <li>So many other products have let me down.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a bit more shine, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li>However, it holds pretty well if I diffuse my hair dry, giving it extra</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, especial if you have fine textured hair like mine.</li>
            <li>However, I have sensitive skin, and if I get it on my face or scalp or ears, it gives me a topical skin burn.</li>
            <li>I have spent way too much money during my lifetime on anti-frizz hair products.  </li>
            <li>It is the ONLY one of those products that keeps my hair looking and feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Love how it works to keep my thin hair curly.  </li>
            <li>My naturally wavy/curly hair is more tame, soft and shiny rather than course, frizzy and dull.  </li>
            <li>I have natural African American hair.</li>
            <li>I use this while my hair is wet to scrunch into more controlled curls and then after it is dry to tame frizzies.</li>
            <li>My hair normally is VERY VERY curly and tends to frizz, so I need stuff to tame it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still soft to the touch when dry.  </li>
            <li>Common hair products that are found in many other hair products for styling curls will contain similar and do similar.</li>
            <li>I have a short style and it really makes my hair curl in tight curls.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is very dry and can be frizzy some days.</li>
            <li>I use a few pumps right out of the shower, and let things air dry.  </li>

            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it.</li>
            <li> I know that argan oil is pricey, but what mostly comprises this product is water, mineral oil, petrolatum, and dimethicone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, it has that lovely Moroccan Oil scent</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> My curls are better defined without a &#x27;tacky-sticky&#x27; feel, and there is softness...and that lovely scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Cantu products (curl activator, curl cream) as they do great things for my hair and are really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it : )</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The top wouldnt work.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair now.</li>
            <li> Pretty good curl cream for me.</li>
            <li> Great to smooth very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have a 6 y/o grandaughter with natural curly hair and it leaves her hair soft, shiny, smelling wonderful and none greasy love it!</li>
            <li> They are not cheap but you don&#x27;t need to use more than a dime-size for most of Moroccan Oil&#x27;s products to see magnificent results.</li>
            <li> Great for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> SUPER SERVICE!</li>
            <li> Each curly haired person has their own unique hair, but this stuff is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a useful, good product, pleasant even, but be careful of quantity.</li>
            <li> and I still have plenty left and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ve used this for several years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found for defining curls without making your hair too stiff and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in part due to many raving reviews, and after using the oil with great results.  </li>
            <li> Love this product smells great and gives my curls natural look an soft bounce.</li>
            <li> And one more thing, this product is really</li>
            <li> he is very spoiled:)</li>
            <li> Seller was quick.</li>
            <li> I will keep on buying the oil treatment, because it&#x27;s worth the money, but will not be spending my money on the curl cream again.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this leaves your curls.  </li>
            <li> So I think the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I use it right after showering on damp hair.  </li>
            <li> It gives good definition, without weighing it down or making it greasy.    </li>
            <li> so probaly those good reviews are from people living in less humid areas.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many many products including some really super expensive stuff in salons.</li>
            <li> I have used every single kind of curl cream known to man.  </li>
            <li> and it does do a very nice job of giving form to natural curls without adding sticky-stiffness, like some other \\&quot;curly hair\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous, I put it on and my hair air dries beautifully, soft curls.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and light.</li>
            <li> I even use it occasionally on my Bouvier des Flandres&#x27;s curly, static winter coat.</li>
            <li> I think I have about 3 months more left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried it</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> Really does curl your hair!</li>
            <li> In looking for the perfect product that would not leave my hair stiff, I spent lots of $$$$$$$.  </li>
            <li> and I use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li> &quot; it smells something like the patchouli oils that my friends who thought they were cool would buy from vendors on NYC streets when we were in our teens and early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder lenght, medium texture, not so full, dyed and highlighted with soft curls.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair super soft and shiny, also, helps create curls.</li>
            <li> I order a bottle of PURE argan oil (not morocanoil brand) and now I mix two pumps of the cream with 10 drops of the oil</li>
            <li> I have been using the Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream for about three years now.</li>
            <li> It really acts as a moisturizer, so</li>
            <li> I really like the Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream.  </li>
            <li> Nothing worked for me, until my hair dresser used Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream.</li>
            <li> This works really well on curly hair.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this is priced really high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> It doesnt take much to keep my whole head in line.</li>
            <li> really work either.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Got it working really well.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Now i only use Moroccan Oil and honestly all those products together cost about the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells good, it is thick, but will not leave your hair crunchy or</li>
            <li> I am satisfied the product arrived on time and also the price is reasonable among of the other suppliers.</li>
            <li> like so many other curl defining products.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is not only how easy and fast it is to wear my curls naturally, but also that the end result (once your hair is dry) is soft and shiny NOT hard and crunchy</li>
            <li> The product is fine - the expiration date for such a big bottle was OK for a professional hair dresser, not a single customer.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily mixed with AG fast food leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> In addition, add the Moroccan hair oil as needed to my hair, particularly the ends.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone with curly hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SUPPLIER.</li>
            <li> keep the old pump until you know the new on is working!!</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly and before it was due.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping with continued use of this product, along with the intense hydrating masque from Moroccan Oil, that eventually my frizz will be completely controlled.   </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and use basically two fingertips worth and it&#x27;s better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used and no small (which I appreciate.)  </li>
            <li> I am however more sensitive than the average person, so if you are a very sensitive skin person, use with caution.</li>
            <li> I use it right after i take a shower and pay extra attention to my ends.</li>
            <li> The plain Moroccan oil is a much better product.  </li>
            <li> I love how my hair just plain behaves when I use it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and curly, no frizz at all!</li>
            <li> Lost my first one so promptly bought a second.</li>
            <li> My gray is starting to come in and its still curly but with the gray hairs, more wiry and less tame-able.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich leave in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> and if I applied more it looked greasy and dull.</li>
            <li> REALLY well, and the next day, it looks like I didn&#x27;t put any product on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Drug store, professional - you name it.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly-wavy hair that is prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li> The product does bring out some of your natural curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my curly hair soft and prevents frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use it, my hair kinda poofs out and gets frizzy and wild looking.</li>
            <li> I have had the bottle for 6 months so far</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/frizzy hair and Moroccanoil</li>
            <li> Intense Curl Cream is the only thing I have found that can control my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a good hair styling cream that I have been using for a long time; however, there are not many places where carry larger size in market until I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get the right amount on your hair to get the right curls.</li>
            <li> I, like so many of you, have spent a small fortune on hair products that don&#x27;t really do what they say they will do.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, in fact, this entire line of products.  </li>
            <li> So many other products have let me down.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a bit more shine, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> However, it holds pretty well if I diffuse my hair dry, giving it extra</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, especial if you have fine textured hair like mine.</li>
            <li> However, I have sensitive skin, and if I get it on my face or scalp or ears, it gives me a topical skin burn.</li>
            <li> I have spent way too much money during my lifetime on anti-frizz hair products.  </li>
            <li> It is the ONLY one of those products that keeps my hair looking and feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> Love how it works to keep my thin hair curly.  </li>
            <li> My naturally wavy/curly hair is more tame, soft and shiny rather than course, frizzy and dull.  </li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> I use this while my hair is wet to scrunch into more controlled curls and then after it is dry to tame frizzies.</li>
            <li> My hair normally is VERY VERY curly and tends to frizz, so I need stuff to tame it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still soft to the touch when dry.  </li>
            <li> Common hair products that are found in many other hair products for styling curls will contain similar and do similar.</li>
            <li> I have a short style and it really makes my hair curl in tight curls.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is very dry and can be frizzy some days.</li>
            <li> I use a few pumps right out of the shower, and let things air dry.  </li>
            <li> This cream really helps tame it and keep it moist and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I recently highlighted my hair, and as all curly girls know, curly hair looks dry to begin with, so after I highlighted it, it looked especially fried.  </li>
            <li> and although I still have a little bit of frizz, most of my usual unruly frizzy mess is no longer.  </li>
            <li> Read all the reviews and realized the biggest complaint seemed to be around people using too much of it.  </li>
            <li> so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If I want a bit of extra shine (my hair is about 20% gray so it is harder to get a shine)</li>
            <li> It get a strange odor if used after that time.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, heavy Asian hair so after a couple of hours my hair usually gets mostly straight-ish</li>
            <li> Oh, and you can definitely use it on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is hardly the main player here.</li>
            <li> It made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> The smell is also great,your hair will not look greasy or dry.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t dry sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Unless you have hair down to your waist, you probably don&#x27;t need a bottle this big.</li>
            <li> I tried this 2 times, once with wet hair and once with dry hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be used on wet or dry</li>
            <li> More than that is disastrous.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount to each strand for a long lasting curl.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks my stylist said it actually repaired my damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Very expensive, but worth the money.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> a little dab goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the other Moroccanoil products.</li>
            <li> This product does not give you that \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; which so many of us curly haired gals hate nor does it give you curls that appear to be frozen in time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if your hair lays on your face or neck in any places, you will break out - due to the fact that this is OIL.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was even Faster than expected!!</li>
            <li> The slightly heavier weight is just what I need to hold the curl in this shape and provide hydration.  </li>
            <li> Should use in less than six months.</li>
            <li> My curls look like they did when I was little kid before my hair was exposed to color, heat and environmental damage.</li>
            <li> I sometimes rub a little excess on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Too little</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble controlling my unruly, curly hair ever since i was a little girl.</li>
            <li> Too much and your hair will look dirty.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am missing something, but I feel like I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I am not in favor of the Moroccan oil Curl Cream because it is too heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li> didnt like the smell or how it felt in my hair once it dried.</li>
            <li> This can look messy.</li>
            <li> I experimented (semi-successfully) with various products, and in the end, I just end up blowdrying it straight, cause i hate the tangle of curls after a few days.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil products but am very disappointed that the pump on the bottle does not work...</li>
            <li> You use very little</li>
            <li> It takes very, very little to accomplish both tasks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet.</li>
            <li> I have bought the expensive salon brands and the cheaper brands you can get at regular stores</li>
            <li> and this is one of few products that will give me controlled curls without bushy frizz slowly reappearing throughout the day.</li>
            <li> A stylist pal suggested I try this and gave me a small sample bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product froze during shipping</li>
            <li> I am not sure what this product was supposed to do</li>
            <li> Additionally, my hair isn&#x27;t as dry and unhealthy ever since i started using this product because its sooo HYDRATING!</li>
            <li> But when I want to go curly (cause my hubby loves my curls), lately I&#x27;ve tried this cream with the argan oil for polishing.</li>
            <li> I  have thick, wavy hair and have been using this for years.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> but it arrived extremely thick, so thick it will not pump out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I avoid applying it to my hair above the base of my neck, because it can weigh that part of my hair down and make it look a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy hair made worse by South Florida humidity.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a small amount, yet my hair still felt dirty and oily.  </li>
            <li> i was a little doubtful about this product when i considering purchasing it because of the price tag....</li>
            <li> random - like one day it works</li>
            <li> Now it seem expensive to buy the cream and then the oil buy</li>
            <li> It is expensive, so I try to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is crazy!  </li>
            <li> I have to pull up each and every time I want a squirt...very inconvenient!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using the Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream for about three years now. I have naturally curly hair that is very dry and can be frizzy some days. This cream really helps tame it and keep it moist and conditioned. I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product highly recommended</li>
            <li> I had my hair done on vacation in Anchorage,Alaska the stylist use this product on my hair I&#x27;m hooked it made my hair look and feel unbeliveable. I have a 6 y/o grandaughter with natural curly hair and it leaves her hair soft, shiny, smelling wonderful and none greasy love it!</li>
            <li> I have colored curly hair, every product I ahave tried till this results in frizz. This is fabulous, I put it on and my hair air dries beautifully, soft curls. Highly recommend for anyone with curly hair</li>
            <li> The Intense Curl Cream is excellent for curly hair.  Don&#x27;t overdue it though or your hair will feel a bit greasy.  I use this in combination with Moroccan Oil.  This product is pricey, but it does last a while.</li>
            <li> Love how it works to keep my thin hair curly.  It works in all kinds of weather.  I use it right after showering on damp hair.  Keeps my curl in all day and doesn&#x27;t flatten out.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or look like there&#x27;s a ton of hair product on my hair.  Highly recommend it.  My sis who also has thicker curly hair loves it too.</li>
            <li> I ordered Moroccanoil Curl Cream and received Moroccanoil Hydrating Cream, in an envelope, without any paperwork or receipt. I will not order from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhere in between curly and wavy and is therefore a frizz magnet. I, like so many of you, have spent a small fortune on hair products that don&#x27;t really do what they say they will do.  Not so with this product.  It really acts as a moisturizer, so hair like mine that tends to soak in moisture from the air, remains sleak, curly and wavy without frizz.  It is so good, friends will notice.  The only negative is the fragrance.  Being \\&quot;moroccan\\&quot; it smells something like the patchouli oils that my friends who thought they were cool would buy from vendors on NYC streets when we were in our teens and early 20&#x27;s.  But, like everything else, you get used to it, so after a while you won&#x27;t notice it, but your hair will be looking good.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m still trying to decide if I like it.  I recently highlighted my hair, and as all curly girls know, curly hair looks dry to begin with, so after I highlighted it, it looked especially fried.  I was recommended Moroccanoil from my hair stylist and I purchased this, the glimmer spray, and the regular oil.  I have to say that my hair has never felt healthier.  It is crazy!  Even when I never touched my hair with bleach or heat or anything, my hair didn&#x27;t look this healthy.  My only complaint is that if your hair lays on your face or neck in any places, you will break out - due to the fact that this is OIL.  I have a chin length bob that touches my neck and forehead, and the minute I put this stuff on, I had pimples the next day.  So, do I want healthy looking hair, or healthy looking skin?  I am still trying to decide.  And one more thing, this product is really random - like one day it works REALLY well, and the next day, it looks like I didn&#x27;t put any product on my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure yet.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks my stylist said it actually repaired my damaged hair.  My hair is healthier than it has been in over 8 years.  And it takes away the frizz.  Oh, and you can definitely use it on wet or dry hair.  Finally a product that is perfect for curly curly curly hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with the Moroccan oil and I must say that the combination of the two is truly a perfect prescription for shiny, bouncy, natural curls. I have used this product twice and although I still have a little bit of frizz, most of my usual unruly frizzy mess is no longer.  My curls look like they did when I was little kid before my hair was exposed to color, heat and environmental damage. I am hoping with continued use of this product, along with the intense hydrating masque from Moroccan Oil, that eventually my frizz will be completely controlled.   My favorite thing about this product is not only how easy and fast it is to wear my curls naturally, but also that the end result (once your hair is dry) is soft and shiny NOT hard and crunchy like so many other curl defining products.  For someone with curly hair, I have never encountered a product as effective at bringing out the best in my curls. My hair looks like I woke up in the morning to naturally beautiful locks and walked out the door without the need to style my hair for hours.  This product does not give you that \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; which so many of us curly haired gals hate nor does it give you curls that appear to be frozen in time. I highly recommend this product, in fact, this entire line of products.  They are not cheap but you don&#x27;t need to use more than a dime-size for most of Moroccan Oil&#x27;s products to see magnificent results.</li>
            <li> I really like the Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream.  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found for defining curls without making your hair too stiff and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Product was excellent, exactly as described!  Shipping was even Faster than expected!! Great Seller!</li>
            <li> I have used every single kind of curl cream known to man.  Drug store, professional - you name it.  None of them did what I wanted out of a curl cream, until Moroccanoil.  It gives good definition, without weighing it down or making it greasy.    Each curly haired person has their own unique hair, but this stuff is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It leaves my hair soft and curly, no frizz at all! And keeps it that way for days! It smells so nice, almost reminds me of Coconut! However, I have sensitive skin, and if I get it on my face or scalp or ears, it gives me a topical skin burn. I am however more sensitive than the average person, so if you are a very sensitive skin person, use with caution. You will love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in part due to many raving reviews, and after using the oil with great results.  Maybe I am missing something, but I feel like I wasted my money.  I have naturally curly-wavy hair that is prone to frizz.  I tried this 2 times, once with wet hair and once with dry hair.  I used a small amount, yet my hair still felt dirty and oily.  My curls weren&#x27;t defined, but they were still frizzy.  I&#x27;ve truly had better results with Garnier products purchased for 5.00 at the drug store.  I will keep on buying the oil treatment, because it&#x27;s worth the money, but will not be spending my money on the curl cream again.</li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair. The product does bring out some of your natural curls. However, I am dissapointed it contains both mineral oil and petrolatuam.  It made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> i was a little doubtful about this product when i considering purchasing it because of the price tag....honestly though it was the best thing i could&#x27;ve done for my hair. I use it right after i take a shower and pay extra attention to my ends. its lasting me a couple months already, ive used about a fourth of the bottle in three months and i have hair up to my waist so you really get a great use of your buck. I wish i found out about this product sooner. I have always had trouble controlling my unruly, curly hair ever since i was a little girl. I have tried everything and before using this product i was using 5 products in my hair to make sure it didn&#x27;t frizz up. Now i only use Moroccan Oil and honestly all those products together cost about the same. Additionally, my hair isn&#x27;t as dry and unhealthy ever since i started using this product because its sooo HYDRATING! my hair does not get frizzy (even when i went to florida) and i had acquaintances and friends noticing a difference in the health and luster of my hair after one day without me saying anything! Get this product. You wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I  have thick, wavy hair and have been using this for years.So many other products have let me down.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I have used on my curly hair. It leaves hair soft and light. LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily mixed with AG fast food leave in conditioner. Keeps the friz at bay.</li>
            <li> I just love Moroccanoil, is by far the best product in the market.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my curly hair soft and prevents frizz.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used on wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have spent way too much money during my lifetime on anti-frizz hair products.  Nothing worked for me, until my hair dresser used Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream. Absolutely wonderful, smells nice, defines curls, and adds shine. A little goes a long way, especial if you have fine textured hair like mine. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I LOVE MOROCCANOIL!  I receive compliments on my hair now.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this leaves your curls.  After I curl my hair I apply a small amount to each strand for a long lasting curl.  :)</li>
            <li> I am not in favor of the Moroccan oil Curl Cream because it is too heavy on my hair. The plain Moroccan oil is a much better product.  I will use this product up, but will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy hair made worse by South Florida humidity.  Morroccan Oil Curl Cream has always done the trick.  The slightly heavier weight is just what I need to hold the curl in this shape and provide hydration.  I use a few pumps right out of the shower, and let things air dry.  Best of all it&#x27;s still soft to the touch when dry.  No stiffness or residue like gel and mouse.</li>
            <li> Loved the oil, but this is not for me...didnt like the smell or how it felt in my hair once it dried.</li>
            <li> I really liked the moroccan oil, and the curl cream is amazing. It leaves your hair super soft and shiny, also, helps create curls. The smell is also great,your hair will not look greasy or dry. I truly reccomend it. Amazon has the best deals!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Provides awesome curls.  Shipped very quickly and before it was due.  Would recommend ordering this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I have course curly hair.  In looking for the perfect product that would not leave my hair stiff, I spent lots of $$$$$$$.  A friend told me about Moroccan oil .  It is the best product out there.  You use very little so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This works really well on curly hair. It&#x27;s a rich leave in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. In addition, add the Moroccan hair oil as needed to my hair, particularly the ends.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift from a friend and bought one of my own. I have very fine, curly hair. I use this while my hair is wet to scrunch into more controlled curls and then after it is dry to tame frizzies. It takes very, very little to accomplish both tasks. I&#x27;ve been using my 16.9 ounce bottle for 2 years and I still have plenty left and it still works great. I sometimes rub a little excess on my cuticles. Very moisturizing and smells great too. I even use it occasionally on my Bouvier des Flandres&#x27;s curly, static winter coat. It tames the sparks and makes him smell nice. Why yes...he is very spoiled:)</li>
            <li> best thing I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair! a little dab goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s the perfect thing for my curly hair.  Three stars instead of five because the pump is not working.  Suggestion for future:  keep the old pump until you know the new on is working!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all, it didn&#x27;t controlled the frizz and if I applied more it looked greasy and dull. I order a bottle of PURE argan oil (not morocanoil brand) and now I mix two pumps of the cream with 10 drops of the oil and I love it. My frizziness started when I move to Miami from Mexico City so probaly those good reviews are from people living in less humid areas. My hair is shoulder lenght, medium texture, not so full, dyed and highlighted with soft curls. Now it seem expensive to buy the cream and then the oil buy I guess It will last a looong time. Hope it helps...</li>
            <li> Great product for curly or frizzy hair at a good price. Seller was quick. No hassels. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am 46 and have moderately curly hair. My gray is starting to come in and its still curly but with the gray hairs, more wiry and less tame-able. This can look messy. I have tried many many many products including some really super expensive stuff in salons. This is the best for my hair. I have a short style and it really makes my hair curl in tight curls. When I don&#x27;t use it, my hair kinda poofs out and gets frizzy and wild looking. I love the smell of it. I love the feel of it. I love how my hair just plain behaves when I use it. I bought this big bottle and I use one squirt on my hands. More than that is disastrous. I have had the bottle for 6 months so far and I use it pretty much every day. So I think the price is well worth it. I think I have about 3 months more left in the bottle. If I want a bit of extra shine (my hair is about 20% gray so it is harder to get a shine) I spray on the companion glimmer product. I will post a review of that product separately.</li>
            <li> I know that argan oil is pricey, but what mostly comprises this product is water, mineral oil, petrolatum, and dimethicone. Common hair products that are found in many other hair products for styling curls will contain similar and do similar. Argan oil is hardly the main player here. Nevertheless, this is priced really high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it has that lovely Moroccan Oil scent and it does do a very nice job of giving form to natural curls without adding sticky-stiffness, like some other \\&quot;curly hair\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve tried. My hair normally is VERY VERY curly and tends to frizz, so I need stuff to tame it. I experimented (semi-successfully) with various products, and in the end, I just end up blowdrying it straight, cause i hate the tangle of curls after a few days. But when I want to go curly (cause my hubby loves my curls), lately I&#x27;ve tried this cream with the argan oil for polishing. It works okay. My curls are better defined without a &#x27;tacky-sticky&#x27; feel, and there is softness...and that lovely scent I&#x27;m addicted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a useful, good product, pleasant even, but be careful of quantity. Too little and you won&#x27;t get good formation of curls and control of frizz. Too much and your hair will look dirty. Find your own balance and you will see good results. Frankly, it&#x27;s the price that&#x27;s indecent and made me take off stars.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews and realized the biggest complaint seemed to be around people using too much of it.  I have very long hair and use basically two fingertips worth and it&#x27;s better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used and no small (which I appreciate.)  I did find that when putting it on I have to wash my hands since it leaves a bit of residue on your hands after putting on hair.  But it doesn&#x27;t dry sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Purchased based on recommendation from a stylist.  Smells AMAZING but otherwise way overpriced and doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular for my curls.  I&#x27;ll stick with Cantu products (curl activator, curl cream) as they do great things for my hair and are really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Should use in less than six months. It get a strange odor if used after that time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/frizzy hair and Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream is the only thing I have found that can control my hair.  I have bought the expensive salon brands and the cheaper brands you can get at regular stores and I have found Moroccanol works the best for me.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing!  I have very curly hair and it helps reduce frizz and moisturize my hair.  Love it.  However- the pump DOES NOT WORK!! That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a 4 star.</li>
            <li> Great to smooth very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great product straight from Israel!!</li>
            <li> I have curly 3A ,3B African Hair and this products works well to define curls and eliminate frizz.  Provides just enough oil so that hiar feels silky and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is good once you try it a couple of times and learn how to use it! It is hard to get the right amount on your hair to get the right curls.</li>
            <li> It is a good hair styling cream that I have been using for a long time; however, there are not many places where carry larger size in market until I found it on amazon. I am satisfied the product arrived on time and also the price is reasonable among of the other suppliers.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I defines my curls without making them look greasy.  It is expensive, so I try to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and this is one of few products that will give me controlled curls without bushy frizz slowly reappearing throughout the day. It is the ONLY one of those products that keeps my hair looking and feeling soft.  It doesnt take much to keep my whole head in line.</li>
            <li> Buy it all the time. Great product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good curl cream for me. I love it : )</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the other Moroccanoil products. Smells like cheap soap.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really work either. This is the first time I have tried it so I don&#x27;t know if it is supposed to smell like it does.</li>
            <li> I use it on my permed hair (yes, I like to perm my hair!). I have long, thick, heavy Asian hair so after a couple of hours my hair usually gets mostly straight-ish and I was anticipating the similar for this product too. However, it holds pretty well if I diffuse my hair dry, giving it extra curliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, it is thick, but will not leave your hair crunchy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that others will experience the same issue as myself but I do find that this product isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough. I am currently using Garnier&#x27;s moisture whip leave in conditioner before applying the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive, but worth the money. (But it wouldn&#x27;t hurt if it was cheaper, eh?)</li>
            <li> Great product.  My naturally wavy/curly hair is more tame, soft and shiny rather than course, frizzy and dull.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great for my natural hair. Wish it had a bit more shine, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Unless you have hair down to your waist, you probably don&#x27;t need a bottle this big. A little goes a LONG way. I can&#x27;t say it does anything to enhance the curliness of my hair, but it does make my hair feel deeply moisturized. I avoid applying it to my hair above the base of my neck, because it can weigh that part of my hair down and make it look a bit greasy. But I feel like it&#x27;s great for the ends.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil products but am very disappointed that the pump on the bottle does not work...I have to pull up each and every time I want a squirt...very inconvenient!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ve used this for several years. Lost my first one so promptly bought a second.</li>
            <li> excellent product very fast delivery all perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched a lifetime for something to contain my chaotic wavy / curly / frizzy hair.  A stylist pal suggested I try this and gave me a small sample bottle.  Worked pretty well. Then I bought a bottle at her salon and kept experimenting.  Got it working really well.  And now I&#x27;ve found a much better price here!!  THANKS</li>
            <li> Love it!  The product gives great moisture; while remaining non-greasy!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The top wouldnt work. What s nightmare!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product froze during shipping but it arrived extremely thick, so thick it will not pump out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> MoroccanOil and Intense Curl is wonderful for my curly hair. I like the product and the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> The best for Curly hair</li>
            <li> Love this product smells great and gives my curls natural look an soft bounce. I get so many compliments on my hair now.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT...SUPER SERVICE! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SUPPLIER.</li>
            <li> Really does curl your hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff did not work at all. I received zero curl definition or moisture. I am not sure what this product was supposed to do but it didn&#x27;t work for my curls.</li>
            <li> The product is fine - the expiration date for such a big bottle was OK for a professional hair dresser, not a single customer.  The seller should have disclosed the expiration date on their advertisement.</li>
