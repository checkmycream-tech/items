    <ol>
            <li>Sooo happy with product!</li>
            <li>What does Tommy Bahama smell like:  The best smelling cologne avaiable.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the best Tommy Bahama Cologne today.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>This smells wonderful on my husband!!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let my description disuade you, this is very good.  </li>
            <li>Great product at a great price!  </li>
            <li>(I found that softening the Tommy Bahama with a trace of Woods yields an almost ideal fragrance for me.)</li>
            <li>The item is excellent and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>husband had been using it for years and loved it!</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>I believe TB has discontinued this great fragrance</li>
            <li>We are happy to have found this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A great price compared to what it is sold for in stores.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very nice .</li>
            <li>But, this has a wonderful scent and we may grow to love it too.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t like anything too strong, so this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Tommy Bahama did away with the mens cologne we had both loved;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s amazing).  </li>
            <li>SHAVE\\&quot; and in return policy says its in hazardous category</li>
            <li>When I sampled this scent I was attracted to the smokey wood tones, and it has been a nice addition to my collection.  </li>
            <li>liked this scent, too...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li>Maybe thats just people being nice, but maybe its the cologne.</li>
            <li>We received the replacement in hardly no time and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>available at all stores , but I&#x27;ve always found better deals online for them and this is a great price for it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was good and we received it very quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li>He loved it and it was delivered right on schedule!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gone for the all-too-common citrus scents, and I was glad to find this alternative.  </li>
            <li>like I&#x27;ve just walked out of a barbeque place if I apply more than a trace, hence the three stars.</li>
            <li>Women absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>Some more words to meet the 20 minimum word count for a review .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the scent is overpowering though - something that many colognes with musk are.  </li>
            <li>TB&#x27;s has all of these and more in a tropical blend that has a hint of citrus and coconut as well.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite colonge for my spouse.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and last all day.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne on my husband.  </li>
            <li>People who enjoy this are surely masochists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of my top 5 favorite colognes, though I am loathe to pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>It has a smell that is sweet but still manly and very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very uncommon combination of masculine scents; sandalwood, citrus and some others that don&#x27;t readily come to mind.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a strong flavor, favoring a lever 2000 soap smell.  </li>
            <li>It is very handsomely packaged in a heavy bottle with an etched palm tree and would make a very nice gift.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The important thing to note about this cologne is that Tommy Bahama reformulated the ingredients and introduced this in January of 2013.  </li>
            <li>This cologne however is such a great balance of scent that I find myself using it often.  </li>
            <li>My IT guy at work says I&#x27;ll never be free of them even though I diligently unsubscribe each time I get one.</li>
            <li>That is good enough for me, though I know some guys expect more staying power from a premium cologne.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a very clean, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion most men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s are too sweet smelling and powerful.  </li>
            <li>First, the price is slightly better here on Amazon than at the Tommy Bahama store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique and has an earthy feel.  </li>
            <li>Most of the positive reviews here refer to the original scent...</li>
            <li>The fragrance is warm and pleasant, however the fragrance fades quickly, as if it were a knock-off and not a genuine brand product.</li>
            <li>Although I have tried many different TB fragrance varieties, including this latest incarnation, nothing compares to the original for men...</li>
            <li>I just want to say thank you to the customer service representative I worked with over the phone, she was helpful, quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li>That said, it is a quality cologne and worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the original TB, but this new diamond shaped bottle is NOT the same fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is the first of TB</li>
            <li>None of their other fragrances are as appealing to me as the original.</li>
            <li>So when you read reviews that go back years about how good the scent is, the folks are reviewing a somewhat different product.  </li>
            <li>I understand from the Tommy Bahama store manager that this new formulation contains a bit more sandalwood and musk than the prior formula did.  </li>
            <li>(think they use a much stronger \\&quot;sample\\&quot; in&lt;br /&gt;stores!), but I still like it better than any other.</li>
            <li>Since it is  a spray colonge my spouse really likes it.</li>
            <li>So even though I really don&#x27;t care for the name, I think I&#x27;ve found my cologne.</li>
            <li>But because I enjoy having a variety of masculine scents to choose from, I am glad to have this around even though it is not at the top of my list alongside favorites like the discontinued Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Woods (for casual wear) or Roger &amp; Gallet&#x27;s L&#x27;Homme (for dress up).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for any seasoned mature man and I strongly urge TB to bring it back!  </li>
            <li>TB original cologne is a lot more subtle and understated yet it is so unique that it still acts like a magnet when you&#x27;re up close and personal.  </li>
            <li>It goes on strong and quickly become subtle, yet still evident.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;manly\\&quot; notes of sandalwood and musk are balanced with a light citrusy scent that remind me of watermelon and pink grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if science supports the notion that men who wear cologne are more appealing to women, but in the past few months I&#x27;ve been wearing this</li>
            <li>I called customer service, she apologized for the incovenience then offered to send out a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>This formulation is new in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>what about the new formula that&#x27;s being sold here?  </li>
            <li>This is the first cologn in a very long time that I really like,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten positive comments from 4 different women (complete strangers) in elevator, on a plane, sharing a cab and while standing in the express line at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy or perfume-y and will not knock you over.  </li>
            <li>love the scent but the variety get&#x27;s to confusing when purchasing as a gift for a man or woman</li>
            <li>this is a very pleasent and manly fragrance that will last all day with just one or two sprays.</li>
            <li>I bought some of this cologne during my last visit and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to find it heavily discounted, and suggest you look around for such a deal as well.</li>
            <li>I actually spent over $65 in the store on this fragrance and wish I would have found it on line first.</li>
            <li>This is the best smelling men&#x27;s cologne, but unfortunately it has become hard to find unless you go to a Tommy Bahama store.  </li>
            <li>Tommy Bahama might have come close to being one of my favorites, but while I like the masculine tone I feel little too much</li>
            <li>But after wearing it a few times my verdict is that the smokey/black pepper aroma is just a little too dominant and could have been softened a bit, maybe with a trace of jasmine or even light sandalwood.  </li>

            <li> If I would have known my work email address was going to be passed out to other marketers I would have used a telephone and called someone direct to order products from a store who ships merchandise.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like musty plywood sawdust mixed with black pepper.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of life in the Florida Keys, being on a wooden boat, or spending a lazy sunset at some quiet sea-side eatery.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why anyone would waste an extra 30 bucks when you can get it online at this price.</li>
            <li> may not last long once you spray since it&#x27;s meant to be subtle and not loud.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not such a bad side effect of wearing it! :-)  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s an odd habit, but I read Amazon reviews about products I buy just to learn what other people think.  </li>
            <li> Being marketed as the original and it is a new formula and just terrible.  </li>
            <li> Half off what you&#x27;d pay at a Tommy Bahama store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> little lacking</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like are the dozens of spam emails I get everyday.</li>
            <li> On my skin, it lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OVERPOWERING men&#x27;s fragrances that are usually all that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;available  these days.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find anymore....</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting, cheap scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully it&#x27;s a light scent that stays close to the skin so others won&#x27;t be disgusted by your odor.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne for my husband but it arrived with a broken sprayer.</li>
            <li> Bottle is made of poor quality glass with lots of bubbles in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this one blind while it was one sale.  </li>
            <li> Hubby &amp; I were very sorry</li>

            <li> Sooo happy with product! Bought a s a gift for my brother. It came with a leather case and a couple extra goodies! He loved it and it was delivered right on schedule!</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very clean, fresh scent.  It is not heavy or perfume-y and will not knock you over.  It has a hint of \\&quot;spice\\&quot; to it.  It is very handsomely packaged in a heavy bottle with an etched palm tree and would make a very nice gift.  This is a second purchase for my husband and he will buy it again. Buy the larger bottle for cost savings.  The price was good and we received it very quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li> This is the first of TB my husband tried, what got the attention is the patchouli, I like patchouli. This fragrance is a big hit at my house with herbal and fruit notes, while the scent focuses on sage, caraway, ginger root and patchouli...WOW!</li>
            <li> Totally upset about the product....here the website says that its \\&quot;COLOGNE SPRAY\\&quot; but they have shipped me \\&quot;AFTER SHAVE\\&quot; and in return policy says its in hazardous category and so I even can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> This is the first cologn in a very long time that I really like,&lt;br /&gt;and the Amazon service was terrific.  The cologn&#x27;s longevity is&lt;br /&gt;a little lacking (think they use a much stronger \\&quot;sample\\&quot; in&lt;br /&gt;stores!), but I still like it better than any other.</li>
            <li> I just want to say thank you to the customer service representative I worked with over the phone, she was helpful, quick and efficient.  I ordered this cologne for my husband but it arrived with a broken sprayer. I called customer service, she apologized for the incovenience then offered to send out a new bottle.  We received the replacement in hardly no time and it was perfect.  Thank you, Amazon... my husband loves his cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000YDI6YU Men&#x27;s Tommy Bahama by Tommy Bahama Cologne - 3.4 oz.]]</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!  Smells great and I have had a lot of complements.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> love the scent but the variety get&#x27;s to confusing when purchasing as a gift for a man or woman</li>
            <li> When I sampled this scent I was attracted to the smokey wood tones, and it has been a nice addition to my collection.  I&#x27;ve never gone for the all-too-common citrus scents, and I was glad to find this alternative.  But after wearing it a few times my verdict is that the smokey/black pepper aroma is just a little too dominant and could have been softened a bit, maybe with a trace of jasmine or even light sandalwood.  The pepper overtone reminds me a lot of Dolce &amp; Gabanna&#x27;s Pour Homme.  Tommy Bahama might have come close to being one of my favorites, but while I like the masculine tone I feel little too much like I&#x27;ve just walked out of a barbeque place if I apply more than a trace, hence the three stars. But because I enjoy having a variety of masculine scents to choose from, I am glad to have this around even though it is not at the top of my list alongside favorites like the discontinued Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Woods (for casual wear) or Roger &amp; Gallet&#x27;s L&#x27;Homme (for dress up).  (I found that softening the Tommy Bahama with a trace of Woods yields an almost ideal fragrance for me.)</li>
            <li> I believe TB has discontinued this great fragrance but I will say it is the ONLY fragrance I have worn in the last seven years.  Women absolutely love it.  Even men  comment on it.  It&#x27;s a very uncommon combination of masculine scents; sandalwood, citrus and some others that don&#x27;t readily come to mind.  In my opinion most men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s are too sweet smelling and powerful.  They almost smell just like women&#x27;s colognes!  TB original cologne is a lot more subtle and understated yet it is so unique that it still acts like a magnet when you&#x27;re up close and personal.  I highly recommend it for any seasoned mature man and I strongly urge TB to bring it back!  None of their other fragrances are as appealing to me as the original.</li>
            <li> My husband just sampled this fragrance at a department store.&lt;br /&gt;It was very nice . NOT TOO STRONG.&lt;br /&gt;He is 63 and does not like the normal&lt;br /&gt;OVERPOWERING men&#x27;s fragrances that are usually all that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;available  these days. We are happy to have found this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this scent, too...so am ordering it here for him.</li>
            <li> I bought this one blind while it was one sale.  This is my favorite cologne.  It&#x27;s got a strong flavor, favoring a lever 2000 soap smell.  Don&#x27;t let my description disuade you, this is very good.  I also like Chanel Egoiste Platinum for men.</li>
            <li> Hubby &amp; I were very sorry Tommy Bahama did away with the mens cologne we had both loved;  But, this has a wonderful scent and we may grow to love it too.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is warm and pleasant, however the fragrance fades quickly, as if it were a knock-off and not a genuine brand product.</li>
            <li> This will be a short review (for me that&#x27;s amazing).  What does Tommy Bahama smell like:  The best smelling cologne avaiable.  Why buy it from Amazon:  You can wear it to a moderate restaurant and pay for the meal with the savings.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like musty plywood sawdust mixed with black pepper. Absolutely disgusting, cheap scent. Bottle is made of poor quality glass with lots of bubbles in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repulsive, repugnant, vile fluid that follows you everywhere and sticks in your nostrils, causing headaches and closing up your throat. People who enjoy this are surely masochists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully it&#x27;s a light scent that stays close to the skin so others won&#x27;t be disgusted by your odor. It lingers even after scrubbing the areas to which it was applied with rubbing alcohol, laundry detergent and baby wipes. YUCK!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in the time that it was supposed to and I received what I signed up. Some more words to meet the 20 minimum word count for a review .</li>
            <li> I actually spent over $65 in the store on this fragrance and wish I would have found it on line first. this is a very pleasent and manly fragrance that will last all day with just one or two sprays.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best Tommy Bahama Cologne today.  It has a smell that is sweet but still manly and very light.</li>
            <li> The item is excellent and has a great smell. A great price compared to what it is sold for in stores.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the original TB, but this new diamond shaped bottle is NOT the same fragrance. Although I have tried many different TB fragrance varieties, including this latest incarnation, nothing compares to the original for men... BRING IT BACK TOMMY BAHAMA!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a Tommy Bahama store close to my home so I wander over there every month or two.  I bought some of this cologne during my last visit and really like it.  Maybe it&#x27;s an odd habit, but I read Amazon reviews about products I buy just to learn what other people think.  When I found this cologne here on Amazon and read the reviews, I thought it might be helpful to clarify something for people considering the purchase.  First, the price is slightly better here on Amazon than at the Tommy Bahama store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important thing to note about this cologne is that Tommy Bahama reformulated the ingredients and introduced this in January of 2013.  So when you read reviews that go back years about how good the scent is, the folks are reviewing a somewhat different product.  This formulation is new in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what about the new formula that&#x27;s being sold here?  It&#x27;s really nice.  I understand from the Tommy Bahama store manager that this new formulation contains a bit more sandalwood and musk than the prior formula did.  I don&#x27;t think the scent is overpowering though - something that many colognes with musk are.  The \\&quot;manly\\&quot; notes of sandalwood and musk are balanced with a light citrusy scent that remind me of watermelon and pink grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really a cologne guy, nearly all the products I use are unscented.  This cologne however is such a great balance of scent that I find myself using it often.  I don&#x27;t know if science supports the notion that men who wear cologne are more appealing to women, but in the past few months I&#x27;ve been wearing this I&#x27;ve gotten positive comments from 4 different women (complete strangers) in elevator, on a plane, sharing a cab and while standing in the express line at the grocery store.  That&#x27;s not such a bad side effect of wearing it! :-)  I&#x27;m definitely going to invest in another bottle of this in the future and will watch Amazon for a price that beats the Tommy Bahama store price.</li>
            <li> Being marketed as the original and it is a new formula and just terrible.  Most of the positive reviews here refer to the original scent... Don&#x27;t be suckered.</li>
            <li> I like the cologne Purchased from the website. What I don&#x27;t like are the dozens of spam emails I get everyday. If I would have known my work email address was going to be passed out to other marketers I would have used a telephone and called someone direct to order products from a store who ships merchandise. My IT guy at work says I&#x27;ll never be free of them even though I diligently unsubscribe each time I get one. That&#x27;s why I rate the security as poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T-</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and I have used it for years.  Half off what you&#x27;d pay at a Tommy Bahama store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why anyone would waste an extra 30 bucks when you can get it online at this price.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe that Tommy Bahama changed distributors and is no longer selling this item!&lt;br /&gt;My husband had been using it for years and loved it!</li>
            <li> This is hard to find anymore....bought it 1st time in Maui at, of course, a Tommy Bahama store.  Macy&#x27;s carried it for awhile.  It&#x27;s awesome to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have received multiple compliments on this scent.  Maybe thats just people being nice, but maybe its the cologne. ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent myself as well.  Not at all overpowering.  In my opinion it could be worn in multiple settings without seeming out of place in the slightest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of essential oils and scents like amber, sandalwood, vanilla, and patchouli. TB&#x27;s has all of these and more in a tropical blend that has a hint of citrus and coconut as well. It reminds me of life in the Florida Keys, being on a wooden boat, or spending a lazy sunset at some quiet sea-side eatery. This is one of my top 5 favorite colognes, though I am loathe to pay full price for it. I was able to find it heavily discounted, and suggest you look around for such a deal as well. That said, it is a quality cologne and worth what you pay for it. On my skin, it lasts a few hours. That is good enough for me, though I know some guys expect more staying power from a premium cologne. It goes on strong and quickly become subtle, yet still evident. It is a manly, earthy scent, spicy yet soothing. I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> This is my favorite colonge for my spouse. It smells wonderful and last all day. Since it is  a spray colonge my spouse really likes it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Tommy Bahama a while back and had never smelled anything quite like it.  It&#x27;s unique and has an earthy feel.  So even though I really don&#x27;t care for the name, I think I&#x27;ve found my cologne.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling men&#x27;s cologne, but unfortunately it has become hard to find unless you go to a Tommy Bahama store.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2006 and found it a charm !!! . Works since it smells like a man&#x27;s scent. You will never confuse it for a woman&#x27;s, like 99 % of all men&#x27;s colognes out there in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not available at all stores , but I&#x27;ve always found better deals online for them and this is a great price for it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not last long once you spray since it&#x27;s meant to be subtle and not loud. That is the only blemish one may find with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne on my husband.  He doesn&#x27;t like anything too strong, so this is perfect.  They don&#x27;t sell it in the stores anymore, so I had to order it online.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful on my husband!! I buy this online because I cannot find it to buy at the stores.</li>
