    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent product for the healing of irritations of the gums and mouth.  </li>
            <li>best thing I have ever found to heal mouth ulcers.</li>
            <li>My father shared this with us, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>There is nothing else as good as this product.</li>
            <li>Good product which was promptly delivered to me.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better!</li>
            <li>recommended makes the taste more like it was before.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s going off the market just like the original Amosn did.</li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for more than 60 years, first as Bocasan (overseas), then as Amosan when we came to the USA.  </li>
            <li>I was using Vince which has the same ingredient and is good tasting</li>
            <li>so we imagine it&#x27;s the same good product as before.</li>
            <li>I was very relieved to find that Amosan is now being produced elsewhere and is again available.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>So glad it&#x27;s back on the market!</li>
            <li>Also, it is not distasteful.</li>
            <li>Fast Service!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really helps with sores in the mouth!  </li>
            <li>This Amosan formula helps my adult brother&#x27;s mouth sores in a significant way.  </li>
            <li>it shouldn&#x27;t call itself same as the original formula!</li>
            <li>He always wants it on hand.</li>
            <li>Vintage Brand Amosan is not the same as original Oral-B</li>
            <li>Flavors which were definitely NOT in the original formula</li>
            <li>Have not yet tried this particular product</li>
            <li>but  shipping costs too high.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much more expensive than the original which was about 10$ for 20 pouches.</li>
            <li>Have used it frequently over the years.</li>
            <li>WE had run out of the old Amosan.</li>
            <li>As a 75 year old Type II diabetic with recurring gum and mouth irritations, I had used Amosan since 1974 when my dentist recommended it to me, until it was discontinued in recent years.  </li>

            <li> Vintage Brand Amosan is not the same as original Oral-B mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;It contains other ingredients eg. Flavors which were definitely NOT in the original formula and hence it&#x27;s efficacy cannot be the same- it shouldn&#x27;t call itself same as the original formula!</li>
            <li> So glad it&#x27;s back on the market!</li>
            <li> I have found that in the past I can use it to gargle and rinse my throat and mouth when I suspect a bad sore throat is coming on. It has&lt;br /&gt;always helped me.</li>
            <li> There is nothing else as good as this product. Which is probably why it is so expensive and we have to wait so long to get it -- my two main complaints about it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the healing of irritations of the gums and mouth.  We have used is for years.  It gives quick relief of the oral discomfort associated with dental work, cold sores, irritation from dentures, and other inflammations in the mouth.  Also, it is not distasteful.</li>
            <li> Good product which was promptly delivered to me.</li>
            <li> This Amosan formula helps my adult brother&#x27;s mouth sores in a significant way.  He always wants it on hand. It comes in powdered form and you mix it with water to make a healing solution.</li>
            <li> Very harsh taste because of the ginger and peppermint (and it smells bad, too), but using a little more than the 1 oz. recommended makes the taste more like it was before.  It&#x27;s also much more expensive than the original which was about 10$ for 20 pouches. I was using Vince which has the same ingredient and is good tasting but that&#x27;s going off the market just like the original Amosn did. Alcohol-based mouthwashes like Listerine are really the worst. The so-called alcohol-free Listerine tastes just like the alcohol version.</li>
            <li> Helped ease the soreness in my mouth</li>
            <li> the product worked as advertised</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  Have used it frequently over the years. but  shipping costs too high. to continue to order it.</li>
            <li> Fast Service! Quality Product A+++ seller! Will buy again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This should be in every store and pharmacy.  It works.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better!</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t have to send off to Canada to get this product that I used to buy in a local store!&lt;br /&gt;It really helps with sores in the mouth!  Keep some in my medicine cupboard just in case.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for more than 60 years, first as Bocasan (overseas), then as Amosan when we came to the USA.  I have been very disappointed that it disappeared off US shelves a few years ago but survived on &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; packs that I have kept.  I was very relieved to find that Amosan is now being produced elsewhere and is again available.  I bought a bunch in fear it would disappear again.  Nothing works like Amosan - nothing, and I have tried other stuff.</li>
            <li> As a 75 year old Type II diabetic with recurring gum and mouth irritations, I had used Amosan since 1974 when my dentist recommended it to me, until it was discontinued in recent years.  With twice daily rinses for two days, the sores dried up promptly. I have longed for the return of Amosan for several years. Now, I can hardly wait to receive a new supply.</li>
            <li> I had been using amosan 20+ years ago. My father shared this with us, it&#x27;s great. I thought I can only find this in the Philippines..Thank God for Amazon</li>
            <li> We like to have this product on hand in case we get a gum/ mouth infection. WE had run out of the old Amosan. Have not yet tried this particular product but it&#x27;s the same name so we imagine it&#x27;s the same good product as before.</li>
            <li> best thing I have ever found to heal mouth ulcers.</li>
