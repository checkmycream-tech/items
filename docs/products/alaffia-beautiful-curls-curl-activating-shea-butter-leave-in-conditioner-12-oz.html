            <li>She has used other products before but said the leave-in conditioner of the Beautiful Curls system works better than anything she has ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a shame because it&#x27;s got a great raspberry smell to it.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the reviews, I haven&#x27;t really seen much of what it does but am sure it will be good.</li>
            <li>I lightly mist my hair with water, then I use</li>

            <li>Best of all there is no junk and effective products that are also clean and safe are really hard to find!!!</li>
            <li>Buying on line, add long as I purchase it in advance is a great alternative</li>
            <li>It is super light, no residue, gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li>so you really need to make sure your hair is damp because it is not a creamy consistency</li>
            <li>I have to deal with super curly hair that tangles just by looking at it.</li>
            <li>a little over a quarter sized dollop of Beautiful curls in my hair.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is NOT water, so I didn&#x27;t feel that it was moisturizing at all!</li>
            <li>But this on the other hand, is so nice for my damaged, bleached hair!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth saying again:  </li>
            <li>The smell will make you not want to use it, but the result and price is worth it.</li>
            <li>I get gorgeous girls just by applying it to my wet hair.</li>
            <li>I have dry, bleached, fine curly hair and this stuff had made a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I wanted a leave in conditioner that was as chemical free as possible, and light, that would control frizz.</li>
            <li>I used it two more times differently.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find a daily leave in conditioner that tops this one!</li>
            <li>Has a funny smell but it keeps my hair condition.</li>
            <li>In Conditioner does exactly what its name says.</li>
            <li>My hair turns out soft, shiny, bouncy and frizz free.</li>
            <li>This product really brings out the curls in your hair.</li>
            <li>The product really does work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to moisturize my hair the best I can until I make it back home and have been looking for products that will really moisturize my hair, but won&#x27;t leave it extra greasy and limp.</li>
            <li>Whenever Shampoo and did a deep condition (no heat) of Giovanni Smooth as Silk Deeper Moisture Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I know my method seems like a lot, but it really makes my two strand twist well-defined</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well on my 4c hair.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>So, I put it in a spray bottle and added 2oz distilled water, 3 1/2oz aloe very juice and 1 tbsp veg glycerin.....</li>
            <li>I purchased this product from Whole Foods and since has informed the store of my experience with it.</li>
            <li>I rarely give out 5 stars, but I&#x27;ve found this leave-in conditioner to work WONDERS for my natural, kinky hair.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have dry, brittle, breaking or easily damaged hair (or even if not) check the ingredients on everything you put in your hair.</li>
            <li>and when I take my hair down in the morning I have lovely waves.</li>
            <li>But my hair could use just a little more moisture.</li>
            <li>This product line is very high quality and offers a variety of styling goods for all curly hair types.  </li>
            <li>The product really helps ease the detangling process (and I&#x27;ve found that it helps regardless of whether or not I deep condition with it first).  </li>
            <li>its a kind of thick.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida.</li>
            <li>And natural too?!</li>
            <li>Once I applied more oil underneath and them on the other time I applied a shea butter mix before going to bed and both times I got the same result.</li>
            <li>I have natural baby fine, low porosity hair that is 50% grey.</li>
            <li>So, with all of that said - this product definitely added a bit more moisture, without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>I tried this by itself to see how my hair liked it, but once my hair dried it felt dry.</li>
            <li>When I apply it on freshly washed hair, I do not know how to figure out whether I used too much or too little.  </li>
            <li>I use it in my 3 year old son&#x27;s hair and it keeps his curls intact.</li>
            <li>My hair feels like straw without it and with it makes my hair baby soft-</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and use this product after shampoo + conditioner.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair soft and works so well.</li>
            <li>My hair was freshly washed and still wet but not damp</li>
            <li>and I live in a different state than my hair stylist, so</li>
            <li>This stuff detangled his hair to my amazement, there was not a single ouch! !</li>
            <li>Whenever shampoo or homemade soap berry shampoo) and conditioning (Kiss my Face Big Body conditioner), I squeeze the extra water out of my hair with a t-shirt, then rake a very small amount (about 1/2 tsp for collarbone length) of Beautiful Curls leave-in through the bottom half my hair, scrunch, and air dry.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for is that the hold is pretty firm.</li>

            <li> Looking at her pics, she has very well defined curls and very little frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent leave in conditioner because my ends have been feeling a little dry</li>
            <li> this product encourages my naturally tight curls to fall into looser soft spirals.</li>
            <li> While my search for other hair products continues, I have to look no further for a leave-in-conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I usually two-strand twist my hair and use mostly natural products to style/wash.</li>
            <li> I advise applying oil or butter to your hair before styling for the day, so you won&#x27;t loose your curl pattern.</li>
            <li> I have very tight curly hair as an African American &amp;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t apply it dry hair because that was the point of buying it!</li>
            <li> Mag Sulfate does a great job of \\&quot;activating\\&quot; curl but, in the long run, It does nasty damage.. check this link [...]</li>
            <li> And is smells soooo gooooood (which is my main complaint about other brands).</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t put something in my hair after I get out to the shower, it flies around in a tornado of fluff for the rest of the day, (Which, as you can imagine, is NOT the look I am going for.)  </li>
            <li> I have given up all styling products and use this, along with a bit of the Alaffia hydrating curl oil, both applied to wet hair and</li>
            <li> It only thinned it out a little and now the consistency is milky, not watery!</li>
            <li> The conditioner has absolutely NO SLIP!</li>
            <li> I am glad it doesn&#x27;t have silicones or other synthetic crap because they give me acne.</li>
            <li> I usually just dry with a diffuser</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell that lingers and it took weeks to figure out what the smell reminds me of: incense...not in a bad way!</li>
            <li> BUT - after I sprayed each section with water, I applied a little bit of this leave in to each section I was about to twist!</li>
            <li> When I apply it on dry hair, it merely sits on my hair and slides down on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m still not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase another bottle once this one is used up.</li>
            <li> For me, this product is hard for me to use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also extremely thick and a combination of 3c/4a.</li>
            <li> This product works miracles where other products have failed.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter who has very thick hair.</li>
            <li> seriously!</li>
            <li> It really stinks to me.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE -</li>

            <li> This product really brings out the curls in your hair. I use it in my 3 year old son&#x27;s hair and it keeps his curls intact. Love it!.</li>
            <li> The product really does work. However, if you have dry, brittle, breaking or easily damaged hair (or even if not) check the ingredients on everything you put in your hair. This product contains Magnesium Sulfate. Mag Sulfate does a great job of \\&quot;activating\\&quot; curl but, in the long run, It does nasty damage.. check this link [...]</li>
            <li> I totally love this product.-Both shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for about 2 months and they revive my curls every time I use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> This is good for straight hair too and for over-dyed-dried hair. So AMAZING. My hair feels like straw without it and with it makes my hair baby soft- seriously! It is super light, no residue, gets rid of frizz. And is smells soooo gooooood (which is my main complaint about other brands). And natural too?! amazing.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and use this product after shampoo + conditioner. Works well for detangling and leaves a pleasant fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I like this product enough to try others from the Beautiful Curls line.  I do not use any curl activators and cannot speak to that use for the product, however on curlier/finer texture hair, a child&#x27;s hair, or thicker hair with use of a denman brush, this product would probably attain a curly look.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter who has very thick hair. She has used other products before but said the leave-in conditioner of the Beautiful Curls system works better than anything she has ever used. Looking at her pics, she has very well defined curls and very little frizz. Finally something that works...I&#x27;m ordering her another bottle.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a leave-in that can double as a styler, this one is very good for that. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for is that the hold is pretty firm. I advise applying oil or butter to your hair before styling for the day, so you won&#x27;t loose your curl pattern. The one that&#x27;s in the jar has an even stronger hold that the bottled type. After using the one in the jar I had to wash my hair and start over because my hair felt like it had cement on it, even after applying a butter mix. I used it two more times differently. Once I applied more oil underneath and them on the other time I applied a shea butter mix before going to bed and both times I got the same result. It&#x27;s such a shame because it&#x27;s got a great raspberry smell to it. But I just can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have 4a/b/c hair that is also porous.  For me, this product is hard for me to use.  When I apply it on freshly washed hair, I do not know how to figure out whether I used too much or too little.  When I apply it on dry hair, it merely sits on my hair and slides down on my forehead.  On the plus side, it smells nice.  I didn&#x27;t experience any curl activating properties but it is great to use when applying with gel.  I guess I will pass this along to family members.</li>
            <li> Packaged perfectly.  Nothing leaked.  The product is good.  I&#x27;ve been purchasing from a more expensive local distributor.  Buying on line, add long as I purchase it in advance is a great alternative</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve said it before and it&#x27;s worth saying again:  This product line is very high quality and offers a variety of styling goods for all curly hair types.  I have very tight curly hair as an African American &amp; this product encourages my naturally tight curls to fall into looser soft spirals. Cruelty free company against animal testing &amp; portions of your dollars are donated to charitable causes worth supporting.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product. The conditioner has absolutely NO SLIP! It&#x27;s like trying to rub playdoh in your hair! The first ingredient is NOT water, so I didn&#x27;t feel that it was moisturizing at all! I have used products that were a lot cheaper that did the job. This product just wasn&#x27;t suited for me. I don&#x27;t like any of the Beautiful Curls products.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s hair was matted into locks, haven&#x27;t been combed in 6 months. This stuff detangled his hair to my amazement, there was not a single ouch! !</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find a daily leave in conditioner that tops this one! I even started out using the one that wasn&#x27;t even for my hair type &amp; it still worked!  Lord bless the makers and workers of Beautiful Curls!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent leave in conditioner because my ends have been feeling a little dry and I live in a different state than my hair stylist, so I can&#x27;t see her as often as I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;ve been trying to moisturize my hair the best I can until I make it back home and have been looking for products that will really moisturize my hair, but won&#x27;t leave it extra greasy and limp. I usually two-strand twist my hair and use mostly natural products to style/wash. My hair is also extremely thick and a combination of 3c/4a. I tried this product yesterday and I loved it! But my hair could use just a little more moisture. I&#x27;m guessing I am in dire need of a trim. I washed my hair with Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo and did a deep condition (no heat) of Giovanni Smooth as Silk Deeper Moisture Conditioner. Then I used used the \\&quot;LOC\\&quot; method (Liquid, Oil, Cream) and sprayed each section with water,Coconut Oil, and then applied As I Am Twist Defining Cream. I then sealed with Castor Oil. BUT - after I sprayed each section with water, I applied a little bit of this leave in to each section I was about to twist! It made my hair smooth and frizz free! I know my method seems like a lot, but it really makes my two strand twist well-defined and I get tons of compliments! So, with all of that said - this product definitely added a bit more moisture, without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews, I haven&#x27;t really seen much of what it does but am sure it will be good. Only be used once.</li>
            <li> Has a funny smell but it keeps my hair condition. I also like that I am helping &amp;#34;Fair for Life&amp;#34; with the purchase. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to soften my hair a more.&lt;br /&gt;Not what I was expecting!!&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well on my 4c hair. I keep the bottle in my shower. I lightly mist my hair with water, then I use a little over a quarter sized dollop of Beautiful curls in my hair. Then I detangle(I&#x27;m still in the TWA stage) It works really well. It just smells like Robitussin. The smell will make you not want to use it, but the result and price is worth it. However, I&#x27;m still not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase another bottle once this one is used up. It really stinks to me.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair soft and works so well. I am glad it doesn&#x27;t have silicones or other synthetic crap because they give me acne. But this on the other hand, is so nice for my damaged, bleached hair!</li>
            <li> This product works miracles where other products have failed.  I have lots of fine, curly hair.  If I don&#x27;t put something in my hair after I get out to the shower, it flies around in a tornado of fluff for the rest of the day, (Which, as you can imagine, is NOT the look I am going for.)  This product has the perfect amount of oil for moisture without ever making my hair appear oily, and it is the perfect thickness to give my hair that weight it needs.  It is also paraben and silicone free, which is important for us curly girls.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell that lingers and it took weeks to figure out what the smell reminds me of: incense...not in a bad way! I actually like it. I tried this by itself to see how my hair liked it, but once my hair dried it felt dry. I don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t apply it dry hair because that was the point of buying it! It doesn&#x27;t have any water in it so you really need to make sure your hair is damp because it is not a creamy consistency its a kind of thick. My hair was freshly washed and still wet but not damp so I ended up using more product that I would have liked. So, I put it in a spray bottle and added 2oz distilled water, 3 1/2oz aloe very juice and 1 tbsp veg glycerin.....I love it. It only thinned it out a little and now the consistency is milky, not watery! You can&#x27;t always give up on a product, sometimes you have to fix it up! And on the note, I will repurchase and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE - it matted up 8 inches of my hair which I ultimately had to cut out . I purchased this product from Whole Foods and since has informed the store of my experience with it. IT CONTAINS MAG. SULFATE . . .. last ingredient listed - do no use ! ! ! !  I have a several textures of hair - WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANY HAIR TYPE</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have tried all kinds of conditioners for curly/kinky hair, but none of them worked. Beautiful Curls Leave-In Conditioner does exactly what its name says. I get gorgeous girls just by applying it to my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I rarely give out 5 stars, but I&#x27;ve found this leave-in conditioner to work WONDERS for my natural, kinky hair.  I love to deep condition with it by sitting under a plastic cap for 30 minutes after applying and the conditioner smells great.  The product really helps ease the detangling process (and I&#x27;ve found that it helps regardless of whether or not I deep condition with it first).  While my search for other hair products continues, I have to look no further for a leave-in-conditioner.  This one is truly the best...and affordable.</li>
            <li> I have dry, bleached, fine curly hair and this stuff had made a huge difference! I have given up all styling products and use this, along with a bit of the Alaffia hydrating curl oil, both applied to wet hair and the results are the best I have had in years! I usually just dry with a diffuser but sometimes I put all this in before bed, twist my hair up in a bun and when I take my hair down in the morning I have lovely waves. Best of all there is no junk and effective products that are also clean and safe are really hard to find!!!</li>
            <li> I have to deal with super curly hair that tangles just by looking at it. This is the stuff. It untangles, it softens and it smells great. Glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> I have natural baby fine, low porosity hair that is 50% grey. I live in Florida. I wanted a leave in conditioner that was as chemical free as possible, and light, that would control frizz. I tried Beautiful Curls leave-in and was very satisfied. After washing (either Kiss my Face Whenever shampoo or homemade soap berry shampoo) and conditioning (Kiss my Face Big Body conditioner), I squeeze the extra water out of my hair with a t-shirt, then rake a very small amount (about 1/2 tsp for collarbone length) of Beautiful Curls leave-in through the bottom half my hair, scrunch, and air dry. I don&#x27;t use any product. My hair turns out soft, shiny, bouncy and frizz free. It has a pH of 5.5 which is perfect for me. The smell is pleasant and not overpowering. (I wash my hair once every 4 days, just in case that plays into your estimation of whether this product will work for you.)</li>
