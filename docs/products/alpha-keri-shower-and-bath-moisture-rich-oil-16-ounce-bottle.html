            <li>wonderful for winter dry skin relief.</li>
            <li>Was pleased to find it available on amazon.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s like the old one prescribed by our dermatologist 50 years ago we will love it!!</li>
            <li>, i am a huge fan.</li>

            <li>Not greasy and fragrance is light.</li>

            <li>This product is excellent for sensitive dry skin and should be made readily available wherever skin products are sold!  </li>
            <li>for massage is grate, the best you can find, good absorption and not odor, some how expensive but worth it</li>
            <li>It is so wonderfully rich on my skin.</li>

            <li>My skin has improved dramatically and the itching associated with  dry skin has greatly been reduced.</li>
            <li>Great to use in the winter months when the air is so dry.</li>
            <li>Alpha Keri oil has been around for decades and it is far better in the shower than using advertised oatmeal oil!</li>
            <li>It is so much easier, faster, and better than using body lotion on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>It is a superior product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>For most effective skin moisturizing, apply to wet skin after a shower or bath and let it dry on its own.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday anyway and believes my skin benefits greatly from it.  </li>
            <li>It was a real relief for the itching and it made my skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>I tried a product that was supposedly &#x27;comparable to Keri Oil&#x27; but Keri Oil is far better.</li>
            <li>The product is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It practically rinses right off.</li>
            <li>tried and true old fashioned fabulous bath jul...</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in the stores now, so I am happy I found it here.</li>
            <li>Evidently they are still going to sell it.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for many years and all of a sudden can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores.  </li>
            <li>Started using Alpha Keri products when I had my first child and got samples in the hospital.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of this product since my first pregnancy, gained 55lbs, and not a stretch mark to show.</li>
            <li>that number is they weren&#x27;t willing to look into the problem.</li>
            <li>I used this product years ago,  I have never found anything better so I am back.</li>
            <li>Our whole family swears by it!</li>
            <li>I love this product, especially in winter for hydration</li>
            <li>First introduced to this product in hospital setting.</li>
            <li>We tried A+D, Balmex, desitin, eucerin, aquphor, airing out, medicated diaper cream from dr, vasoline, aveno, pampers vs huggies, looking for food alergies, non-scented wipes, and pretty much anything anyone would offer as a suggestion.    </li>
            <li>and i am able to towel dry and wear silk, no stains, no scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many thing with limited results.  </li>
            <li>Because you don&#x27;t use a large amount each time, a bottle lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li>Like the large bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be the best for dry skin, at least for mine.  </li>
            <li>It mixes with the bath water instead of floating on top and really takes care of dry, itchy winter skin.</li>
            <li>Real and visible change in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>This is another product I&#x27;ve been search for and could not find, it works really well, will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I called the number they provided in the cancellation email, they were very unhelpful and refused to even try to put me with a manager.</li>
            <li>This is one product that really helps me to manage the problem.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is fragrant and very healing for all sorts of skin disorders.  </li>
            <li>and it really is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>They just never seem to be the same as the original.</li>
            <li>My skin is always dry and flaky and just a cap full in a bath will do the trick for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never forgotten my dermatologist who recommended this - his 80-year old skin was smooth as silk from a daily combination of using soap that has lotion and Alpha Keri.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Since I am very scent sensitive, I cannot handle overly perfumed products.  </li>
            <li>Also, when you can shoot it into the water to make a little cloud--she and 5 yr old love it.  </li>
            <li>If you \\&quot;can&#x27;t live without it\\&quot; you might like to stock up on it wherever you can find it online.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li>I was ready tp claw my skin off, It helps dry winter skin so much, without leaving it greasy!</li>
            <li>2) after a couple baths she is 90% clear of any redness!  </li>
            <li>I love that it hydrates my skin without it feeling like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the Alpha Keri Oil for my West Higland Terriers on the advice of our Veterinarian as a final rinse when bathing them.</li>
            <li>We are willing to pay the extra price for Alpha Keri Bath Oil!</li>
            <li>This bath oil is not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>The oil makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>Within days my skin was showing marked improvement.</li>
            <li>your skin soft</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to alpha Keri for soft skin.</li>
            <li>Soft skin after shower</li>
            <li>I always get comments on how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li>Particularly useful during the Winter months when skin can be extra dry.</li>
            <li>It only takes a few seconds to smooth it over my skin, and it leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>The product arrived as expected and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal customer of the brand for a long, long time and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I literally cannot live without this oil, my dry skin condition is so severe that my skin starts cracking during the course of a normal workday.  </li>
            <li>husband uses this for his dry skin and has for years, really likes it</li>
            <li>I tend to have dry skin in the winter time, and this oil is very helpful.</li>
            <li>It used to be available everywhere, but lately I have to buy it on line.</li>
            <li>In the early 1960&#x27;s, a doctor prescribed it for a rash that suddenly appeared on my body.</li>
            <li>Alpha Keri&#x27;s scent is barely noticeable .</li>
            <li>and it was never dry.  </li>
            <li>Alpha Keri is the only thing that works for me - when the humidity is really low (like in the winter) - to soothe my dry, itchy skin; and, I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 10 years now.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Alpha Keri oil has been around for decades and it is far better in the shower than using advertised oatmeal oil!</li>
            <li> It is so much easier, faster, and better than using body lotion on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> It is a superior product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> For most effective skin moisturizing, apply to wet skin after a shower or bath and let it dry on its own.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday anyway and believes my skin benefits greatly from it.  </li>
            <li> It was a real relief for the itching and it made my skin feel smooth</li>
            <li> I tried a product that was supposedly &#x27;comparable to Keri Oil&#x27; but Keri Oil is far better.</li>
            <li> The product is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It practically rinses right off.</li>
            <li> tried and true old fashioned fabulous bath jul...</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in the stores now, so I am happy I found it here.</li>
            <li> Evidently they are still going to sell it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for many years and all of a sudden can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores.  </li>
            <li> Started using Alpha Keri products when I had my first child and got samples in the hospital.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this product since my first pregnancy, gained 55lbs, and not a stretch mark to show.</li>
            <li> that number is they weren&#x27;t willing to look into the problem.</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago,  I have never found anything better so I am back.</li>
            <li> Our whole family swears by it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially in winter for hydration</li>
            <li> First introduced to this product in hospital setting.</li>
            <li> We tried A+D, Balmex, desitin, eucerin, aquphor, airing out, medicated diaper cream from dr, vasoline, aveno, pampers vs huggies, looking for food alergies, non-scented wipes, and pretty much anything anyone would offer as a suggestion.    </li>
            <li> and i am able to towel dry and wear silk, no stains, no scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many thing with limited results.  </li>
            <li> Because you don&#x27;t use a large amount each time, a bottle lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> Like the large bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be the best for dry skin, at least for mine.  </li>
            <li> It mixes with the bath water instead of floating on top and really takes care of dry, itchy winter skin.</li>
            <li> Real and visible change in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This is another product I&#x27;ve been search for and could not find, it works really well, will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I called the number they provided in the cancellation email, they were very unhelpful and refused to even try to put me with a manager.</li>
            <li> This is one product that really helps me to manage the problem.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is fragrant and very healing for all sorts of skin disorders.  </li>
            <li> and it really is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> They just never seem to be the same as the original.</li>
            <li> My skin is always dry and flaky and just a cap full in a bath will do the trick for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never forgotten my dermatologist who recommended this - his 80-year old skin was smooth as silk from a daily combination of using soap that has lotion and Alpha Keri.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Since I am very scent sensitive, I cannot handle overly perfumed products.  </li>
            <li> Also, when you can shoot it into the water to make a little cloud--she and 5 yr old love it.  </li>
            <li> If you \\&quot;can&#x27;t live without it\\&quot; you might like to stock up on it wherever you can find it online.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li> I was ready tp claw my skin off, It helps dry winter skin so much, without leaving it greasy!</li>
            <li> 2) after a couple baths she is 90% clear of any redness!  </li>
            <li> I love that it hydrates my skin without it feeling like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the Alpha Keri Oil for my West Higland Terriers on the advice of our Veterinarian as a final rinse when bathing them.</li>
            <li> We are willing to pay the extra price for Alpha Keri Bath Oil!</li>
            <li> This bath oil is not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> The oil makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> Within days my skin was showing marked improvement.</li>
            <li> your skin soft</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to alpha Keri for soft skin.</li>
            <li> Soft skin after shower</li>
            <li> I always get comments on how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li> Particularly useful during the Winter months when skin can be extra dry.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds to smooth it over my skin, and it leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I have been a loyal customer of the brand for a long, long time and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I literally cannot live without this oil, my dry skin condition is so severe that my skin starts cracking during the course of a normal workday.  </li>
            <li> husband uses this for his dry skin and has for years, really likes it</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin in the winter time, and this oil is very helpful.</li>
            <li> It used to be available everywhere, but lately I have to buy it on line.</li>
            <li> In the early 1960&#x27;s, a doctor prescribed it for a rash that suddenly appeared on my body.</li>
            <li> Alpha Keri&#x27;s scent is barely noticeable .</li>
            <li> and it was never dry.  </li>
            <li> Alpha Keri is the only thing that works for me - when the humidity is really low (like in the winter) - to soothe my dry, itchy skin; and, I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 10 years now.</li>
            <li> I have a severe dry skin condition, and this remedy was suggested by my doctor several years ago.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend everyone who has dry skin (especially in the winter) to try this out.</li>
            <li> As a senior, I have the dreaded dry skin especially on my feet.  </li>
            <li> It is the only thing that helps my skin in the dry winter weather.  </li>
            <li> Only product that works for my Winter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is the only product you want.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and have recommended it to anyone who has mentioned they have dry itching skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only oil that I use for dry and itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, my skin has become very dry again and this is the only remedy I have found.</li>
            <li> I used to use it long time ago</li>
            <li> Been using it a long time.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s due to moving back north.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> They have dry skin problems on occasion due to their double coats.</li>
            <li> Physician recommended for me for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I recommend if you have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> The air is so dry that my skin was itchy, Alpha Keri is the solution.</li>
            <li> Just spread in on yourself after a shower and air or pat dry.</li>
            <li> We have been battling dry, chapped skin around my daughter&#x27;s mouth and leg/bottom for months.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t itch from dry skin.</li>
            <li> My father used Keri bath oils because of his dry skin.</li>
            <li> we always used it in the hospital along with the matching body lotion for bed baths for patients with dry skin....</li>
            <li> His pediatrician had recommended it for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used this Keri product in the past, and I have found the newest version does not create as much suds as the previous product.  </li>
            <li> Splash on after shower while still wet and watch dry skin issues disappear</li>
            <li> It turns milky white in the water an does not leave that greasy slick feeling like regular bath oils.</li>
            <li> After your bath, rub on skin while still wet, then pat dry.</li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> I introduced this oil to my husband when we met 23 years ago, and he still uses it exclusively for his very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and on the advice of my dermatologist, I started using Keri.</li>
            <li> Other than this, the product helped soothe my dry itchy skin, which is the reason I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well for dry skin in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find this old product</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find in local stores, so I am thankful that I can readily purchase from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Just use it while you&#x27;re still wet after you take your shower, then wipe off and that moisture lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It is not too smelly, but be careful when getting out of the tub.</li>
            <li> in on when you are wet.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have used other products,but none of them come close to it .</li>
            <li> I only learned about this product when I was admitted to the hospital and a small sample bottle was sitting on my bedside table.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed. :-)</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount--either in the bath or after showering.</li>
            <li> Not sure it I noticed a big difference</li>
            <li> I have used other bath oils but they don&#x27;t quite measure up to this one.  </li>
            <li> The winter months usually makes my skin very dry but with Keri, I have not had this problem.</li>
            <li> price was a little less than stores</li>
            <li> The caps weren&#x27;t tight and spilled in the box.  </li>
            <li> if you suffer from chronic dry skin or just winter time dryness , I encourage you to at least try this time tested product...</li>
            <li> I just ordered a few bottles for myself.  </li>
            <li> When pharmacies stopped carrying the line and I tried a few others.</li>
            <li> and I am a firm believer in bath oil after the shower and before toweling off.</li>
            <li> Lotions are heavy.</li>
            <li> As a result you can waste a lot of time going and looking to find out its not carried.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to my skin at the end of my shower and no more itching all day.</li>
            <li> I routinely order this product on line because it is so difficult to find it in a local retail.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is difficult to buy it in stores.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would make the tub slippery and dangerous for the girls, but it has been fine.</li>
            <li> Alpha Keri Oil is hard to find.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores and sometimes hard to find online.  </li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least they sent a cancellation email.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a sun worshiper and have used this product since the late 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick &amp; moisturizing as it used to be.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to find locally, and so I have begun ordering it from Amazon, as I am not able to get along without it.</li>
            <li> No more itchy winter skin!</li>
            <li> This is a much cheaper alternative to expensive cortisones (which are really bad for you skin when using long-term)</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find in local stores now.</li>
            <li> I along with members of my family have used Alpha Keri shower and bath oil for approximately 30 yrs.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with the way it is shipped.  </li>
            <li> The sad part is that it has been discontinued by the maker.</li>
            <li> I feel warmer when I get out of the tub on cold days.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it is impossible to find in any stores nearby.  </li>
            <li> If it has all the junk that the lotions has I will be disgusted.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Alpha Keri for decades.  It is what the doctor ordered for a dry-skin free winter.  I use it everyday anyway and believes my skin benefits greatly from it.  I&#x27;ve never forgotten my dermatologist who recommended this - his 80-year old skin was smooth as silk from a daily combination of using soap that has lotion and Alpha Keri.</li>
            <li> Great for babies eczema. Real and visible change in a couple of days. Get the lotion to go along with it.</li>
            <li> Lady friend loves this stuff, sure makes her skin feel great to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have a severe dry skin condition, and this remedy was suggested by my doctor several years ago.  It has gotten to the point where no pharmacies carry it anymore, so I had to go online to find it.  I literally cannot live without this oil, my dry skin condition is so severe that my skin starts cracking during the course of a normal workday.  Alpha-Keri lessens this condition by about 90%, and it has become a necessity for me.  Thank you for carrying this product!!!</li>
            <li> Great product will order again</li>
            <li> Physician recommended for me for dry skin.  Great product.</li>
            <li> husband uses this for his dry skin and has for years, really likes it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and was upset when it became unavailable last year. Evidently they are still going to sell it. Made my day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Alpha Keri for 20 years. It&#x27;s not as thick &amp; moisturizing as it used to be. It practically rinses right off. It&#x27;s watery compared to before.</li>
            <li> Alpha Keri is a superb body oil for bath and shower. In the early 1960&#x27;s, a doctor prescribed it for a rash that suddenly appeared on my body. It was a real relief for the itching and it made my skin feel smooth and it was never dry.  I&#x27;ve used it ever since and I highly recommend it.  The sad part is that it has been discontinued by the maker. If you \\&quot;can&#x27;t live without it\\&quot; you might like to stock up on it wherever you can find it online.  I just ordered a few bottles for myself.  This is \\&quot;good stuff\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Someone recommended this product for my Eczema and I love it! My skin is always dry and flaky and just a cap full in a bath will do the trick for me! I have used it before but ordered it online because of the deal.  I recommend if you have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great for my rosacea and exczema.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over 30 years and still do today</li>
            <li> This bath oil is great for dry skin problem.  The air is so dry that my skin was itchy, Alpha Keri is the solution.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite because it mixes with the water. A little goes a long way. I either soak in the tub with it or rub it on afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use it with every shower and does wonders for my skin. Moisturizes without feeling oily. I have been a loyal customer of the brand for a long, long time and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I along with members of my family have used Alpha Keri shower and bath oil for approximately 30 yrs.  It is a superior product for dry skin.  It also contains healing properties for chapped or chafed skin.  May it never go off the market as I don &#x27;t know what I would replace it with.</li>
            <li> I have used this Keri product in the past, and I have found the newest version does not create as much suds as the previous product.  This fact made it necessary to use a second product thus increasing the cost to the consumer. Other than this, the product helped soothe my dry itchy skin, which is the reason I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Splash on after shower while still wet and watch dry skin issues disappear</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years and its wonderful. Just use it while you&#x27;re still wet after you take your shower, then wipe off and that moisture lasts all day. I would recommend everyone who has dry skin (especially in the winter) to try this out.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  My husband and I both use it.  I was not happy with the way it is shipped.  The caps weren&#x27;t tight and spilled in the box.  It needs to have a protective seal.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product smooth transaction</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> Alpha Keri Oil is hard to find. Just spread in on yourself after a shower and air or pat dry. No more itchy winter skin!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this after-shower oil for years and can no longer find it in my area.  I&#x27;ve found it to be the best for dry skin, at least for mine.  Your price was good, too.</li>
            <li> I use Keri as an added bonus for the dogs I bathe for my customers. The ending results set me apart from my competitors. However, using this Keri on dogs must be used on a 5 to 1 ratio (5 parts water to one part Keri). Great importance to remember the ratio.</li>
            <li> Great price. Packaging all bent and damaged.  Great deal though.</li>
            <li> Great for people suffering with eczema</li>
            <li> Hard to find this old product but it is the best body moisutring bath oil ever&lt;br /&gt; As a senior, I have the dreaded dry skin especially on my feet.  This is a great product. It is not too smelly, but be careful when getting out of the tub. it can be slippery</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for many years and all of a sudden can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores.  Amazon had it at a good price.  Works extremely well for dry skin in the winter time.  Apply after showering.</li>
            <li> We have been battling dry, chapped skin around my daughter&#x27;s mouth and leg/bottom for months. Dr. thinks it is eczema that our just-turned 2-yr-old will grow out of. We tried A+D, Balmex, desitin, eucerin, aquphor, airing out, medicated diaper cream from dr, vasoline, aveno, pampers vs huggies, looking for food alergies, non-scented wipes, and pretty much anything anyone would offer as a suggestion.    I remembered having a sample of Alpha Keri from a hospital stay and my mom using it in the &#x27;80s.  We tried it... 1)I love the smell! 2) after a couple baths she is 90% clear of any redness!  If we do a couple baths without then the redness and scaly skin comes back.  Also, when you can shoot it into the water to make a little cloud--she and 5 yr old love it.  I was afraid it would make the tub slippery and dangerous for the girls, but it has been fine.</li>
            <li> I recently burned the back of my hand and with the use of alpha keri as a part of the rx. my skin is healing without scarring. Thank goodness I can find tihs product.</li>
            <li> Using Alpha Keri oil for over 40 years and would be lost without it after I shower. Started using Alpha Keri products when I had my first child and got samples in the hospital. Not greasy and fragrance is light. Miss the soap because it was non-irritating and obviously went with the oil. When pharmacies stopped carrying the line and I tried a few others. I threw them all out and started ordering online. No post bathing oil on the market competes. Not even baby oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been around for years and I am a firm believer in bath oil after the shower and before toweling off. It smells muchbetter than the Neutrogena product, although both feel good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love love this product ..have used other products,but none of them come close to it . The best product I have used  LOVE  LOVE it .</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere locally, so then I turned to Amazon and there were several sources.  The 2-pack I purchased was the best price for the volume, and it made a perfect Christmas gift for my sister.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for many years, and can not find a better one.  It is nearly impossible to find locally, and so I have begun ordering it from Amazon, as I am not able to get along without it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Alpha Keri oil has been around for decades and it is far better in the shower than using advertised oatmeal oil!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  It is the only thing that helps my skin in the dry winter weather.  I&#x27;ve tried many thing with limited results.  I apply it to my skin at the end of my shower and no more itching all day.</li>
            <li> Using it for over 40 years and can&#x27;t bathe without it.  My dermatologist recommended it to me when I was 24.</li>
            <li> I use it after every shower</li>
            <li> I feel warmer when I get out of the tub on cold days.  And I don&#x27;t itch from dry skin.</li>
            <li> This bath oil is not heavy or greasy.  It mixes with the water as opposed to floating on top like an oil spill.  I don&#x27;t know why, but it is impossible to find in any stores nearby.  I can only get it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this product since my first pregnancy, gained 55lbs, and not a stretch mark to show. Was turned onto this by a friend from Ireland.     This is the only oil (etc) I have ever used that rinses off and i am able to towel dry and wear silk, no stains, no scent, i am a huge fan.</li>
            <li> This is another product I&#x27;ve been search for and could not find, it works really well, will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time! And I love my product! I used to use it long time ago and now I&#x27;m trying to use it again because this is such a good moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> Only product that works for my Winter&#x27;s dry skin. It&#x27;s been around for a long time and is still the best.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to reduce dryness and itching of skin for many people.  It does not work for everyone equally.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times in the store and it is a great product. The customer service is not so great. They could not fulfill my order (which was only one order of 16-ounce bottles pack of 2)&lt;br /&gt;When I called the number they provided in the cancellation email, they were very unhelpful and refused to even try to put me with a manager. Only insisted repeatedly that I just call Amazon.com. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least they sent a cancellation email. I just don&#x27;t know why they gave me that number is they weren&#x27;t willing to look into the problem.</li>
            <li> I started using Alpha Keri Bath Oil 50 years ago per doctor&#x27;s orders. It is still the same wonderful product. Because you don&#x27;t use a large amount each time, a bottle lasts for weeks. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I routinely order this product on line because it is so difficult to find it in a local retail. I have very, very dry skin. Lotions are heavy. I need a daily moisturizer to prevent skin irritation. My father used Keri bath oils because of his dry skin. This is the best I have ever tried in 30 years.</li>
            <li> Was advised to use this by my dermatologist.  Works well, and has a pleasant scent.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful in the bath and great for winter skin.  It is really hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 30 years. I have very dry skin and eczema. This is one product that really helps me to manage the problem. The problem I have now is this is the only place I can seem to find it. I have tried \\&quot;store\\&quot; brands. They just never seem to be the same as the original.</li>
            <li> Wife uses in bath every night.</li>
            <li> I have been using Keri oil for many years.  I love that it hydrates my skin without it feeling like an oil slick.  My dermatologist is the one that suggested using this.</li>
            <li> Liked it:&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve used the oil for years.  Buying it through amazon is most convenient.  Not all dept stores carry it.  As a result you can waste a lot of time going and looking to find out its not carried.  Easier to look through the internet</li>
            <li> Great addition to a bath!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this bath/shower oil for years. It is especially good for combating the dry winter skin problems.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve always been a sun worshiper and have used this product since the late 70&#x27;s.  Leaves a healthy glow to my skin and helps with dryness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months. It makes my skin feel so smooth without feeling greasy. The winter months usually makes my skin very dry but with Keri, I have not had this problem. The price and quantity purchased from Amazon is excellent .</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly, good price</li>
            <li> could not find in stores anymore. price was a little less than stores and it was what we were use to using. Like the large bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil at the end of my shower since a dermatologist recommended it over 20 years ago. I use it at the end of each of my showers. It only takes a few seconds to smooth it over my skin, and it leaves my skin silky soft. It is so much easier, faster, and better than using body lotion on my arms and legs. I still use moisturizing lotion on my hands and face, but use this oil for everywhere else. I introduced this oil to my husband when we met 23 years ago, and he still uses it exclusively for his very dry skin. My 18 year-old daughter uses it to shave her legs. The only drawback is that it is difficult to buy it in stores. It used to be available everywhere, but lately I have to buy it on line.</li>
            <li> Very nice bath oil.  I use it in the shower.  The oil makes my skin feel so soft.  I tend to have dry skin in the winter time, and this oil is very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product at an excellent price.  The product arrived as expected and was exactly as described.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have used Alpha Keri bath oil for years and have never found another product that could compare with it.  It mixes with the bath water instead of floating on top and really takes care of dry, itchy winter skin.</li>
            <li> Within days my skin was showing marked improvement.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for sensitive dry skin and should be made readily available wherever skin products are sold!  I only learned about this product when I was admitted to the hospital and a small sample bottle was sitting on my bedside table. I have never been able to purchase it anywhere but thru Amazon! I tried a product that was supposedly &#x27;comparable to Keri Oil&#x27; but Keri Oil is far better.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Alpha Keri Oil for my West Higland Terriers on the advice of our Veterinarian as a final rinse when bathing them. They have dry skin problems on occasion due to their double coats. During heating season we all experience dryness to one degree or another. I am now at an age where my skin needs rehydrating on a regular basis, too.  The beauty of this oil is that it is \\&quot;water soluble\\&quot;. It turns milky white in the water an does not leave that greasy slick feeling like regular bath oils. I recommend it highly. The product is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I can remember. It is impossible to find in local stores now. Was very glad to find it on Amazon and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great for Dry Skin, Use once a week and it will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thy it  you will love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;makes your skin soft</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago,  I have never found anything better so I am back. Great after shower and smells good too</li>
            <li> It was a Godsend! I was ready tp claw my skin off, It helps dry winter skin so much, without leaving it greasy! I have used it for over 20yrs..</li>
            <li> This is a great shower oil. It lasts all day in the desert climate I live in and smells wonderful. It is hard to find in the stores now, so I am happy I found it here.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is the only product you want. There are no substitutes for Alpha Keri.</li>
            <li> As a retired nurse I can tell you this product has been around FOREVER!  we always used it in the hospital along with the matching body lotion for bed baths for patients with dry skin....and it always made a difference immediately!&lt;br /&gt;so if you suffer from chronic dry skin or just winter time dryness , I encourage you to at least try this time tested product...you won&#x27;t be disappointed. :-) kathy</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and have recommended it to anyone who has mentioned they have dry itching skin.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  Been using it a long time. wonderful for winter dry skin relief. Our whole family swears by it!</li>
            <li> for massage is grate, the best you can find, good absorption and not odor, some how expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially in winter for hydration</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the bottle!! If it has all the junk that the lotions has I will be disgusted. If it&#x27;s like the old one prescribed by our dermatologist 50 years ago we will love it!!</li>
            <li> Have used this wonderful product every day since I was given a free sample while a patient in the hospital 2-3 years ago.  Hope it will always be available on Amazon.  It is so wonderfully rich on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love Keri bath oil.  I use it after showering.  It keeps my skin moist all day without feeling greasy.  It has a light, pleasant fragrance, so it won&#x27;t clash with your perfume.  It only takes a small amount--either in the bath or after showering.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to alpha Keri for soft skin. First introduced to this product in hospital setting. Soft skin after shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 50 years.  &#x27;Nuf said.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  Love the non-greasy feeling after putting on when I get out of the shower.  It is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.  I have used it for years!</li>
            <li> Have gotten excellent results over the years Alpha Keri Oil.  Great aid for helping with dry skin conditions.  However, I have had difficulty finding it in local stores.  Was pleased to find it available on amazon.</li>
            <li> Really good if you skin is sensitive and itches.&lt;br /&gt;Put in on when you are wet. Just as you exit the shower.</li>
            <li> Alpha Keri moisture oil help my skin from the psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  It is fragrant and very healing for all sorts of skin disorders.  My husband keeps his psoriasis in check with daily moisturizing.  We are willing to pay the extra price for Alpha Keri Bath Oil!</li>
            <li> Not sure it I noticed a big difference but it seems li my skin isn&#x27;t so dry.&lt;br /&gt;x x x x x x</li>
            <li> This is a great product for Psoriasis.  I generously use I when I  bathe almost every night and it makes my skin feel great. The psoriasis is well hydrated and it relieves the itching and flakes. This is a much cheaper alternative to expensive cortisones (which are really bad for you skin when using long-term)</li>
            <li> Great for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product I have bought to a friend, but she has not told me if treatment did work or didn&#x27;t, I am waiting for her answers.</li>
            <li> Alpha Keri is the only thing that works for me - when the humidity is really low (like in the winter) - to soothe my dry, itchy skin; and, I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 10 years now.</li>
            <li> Our local stores don&#x27;t keep this oil continuously stocked....although I have no idea why....Have you used this stuff?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;The bonus, was finding a HUGE bottle at a great price!!! When the stores did stock it, the bottles were much smaller! My mother-in-law turned me on to this oil and it really is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;No more shopping the stores, we now get the oil we want, in the size we want at the price we want!!!</li>
            <li> Just as I remember it as a kid! Love it. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, my skin has become very dry again and this is the only remedy I have found. I think it&#x27;s due to moving back north.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> Very good response time! And excellent product, i love it!  What else I can ask?  This product is great for my skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have used it for years.  This is the only oil that I use for dry and itchy skin.  After your bath, rub on skin while still wet, then pat dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alpha Keri oil since my son was a toddler and he is now 35!  His pediatrician had recommended it for dry skin.  It worked so well that I started to use it in my bath.  It is difficult to find in local stores, so I am thankful that I can readily purchase from Amazon.  I always get comments on how soft my skin is.  Since I am very scent sensitive, I cannot handle overly perfumed products.  Alpha Keri&#x27;s scent is barely noticeable .</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and on the advice of my dermatologist, I started using Keri. My skin has improved dramatically and the itching associated with  dry skin has greatly been reduced.</li>
            <li> tried and true old fashioned fabulous bath jul...do not buy any of the generic versions in drug stores...they are not the same!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best bath oil I have found. I have used other bath oils but they don&#x27;t quite measure up to this one.  For most effective skin moisturizing, apply to wet skin after a shower or bath and let it dry on its own.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores and sometimes hard to find online.  Great to use in the winter months when the air is so dry.</li>
            <li> A stellar product that is the best moisturizing bath and shower product.  Particularly useful during the Winter months when skin can be extra dry.</li>
