            <li>Backwards design steps mar an otherwise good trimmer.</li>
            <li>but I cannot find a good way to do it.</li>

            <li>Price is good for the job that you want done.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, I feel this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>I replaced my T770 model after the battery died for good.  </li>
            <li>This unit does a good job on my beard.  </li>
            <li>and the battery holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good trimmer and</li>
            <li>Good battery life between chargings, too.</li>
            <li>hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it works good.</li>
            <li>This was a good purchase</li>
            <li>really good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly it worked.</li>
            <li>To get 5+ years out of one is an exceptional value.  </li>
            <li>This is very good in and smooth in use.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the price, delivery, and performance.  </li>
            <li>i was very pleased with my trimmer.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Norelco trimmer before and was very satisfied and so had no problems buying this one.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the trimmer and service.    </li>
            <li>Still just as pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer!  </li>
            <li>but this one is much better!</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, trimming is smooth, you don&#x27;t feel anything against the skin.</li>
            <li>The built-in guide depth selection is handy.</li>
            <li>and it uses a nice color scheme.    </li>
            <li>I wish it had some kind of stand</li>
            <li>I really liked the part that collects beard trimmings.</li>
            <li>This is a REALLY nice trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always trimmed my beard with scissors and had to clean up the hair that would fly every where.</li>
            <li>The length dial slips way too easily into a lower setting, and this can make a disaster of an otherwise good morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to adjust for the desired beard length, with no attachments to change, and unlike some reviewers I have never had a problem with it changing settings during use.  </li>
            <li>If anything, its good to shorten the length of your beard but is still patchy, and you need a manual razor to clean up your shave.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s cordless and the battery is very strong.</li>
            <li>Great price and the vacuum works great.</li>
            <li>Mostly good: the hair catcher is a GREAT idea--however only about 80% effective.</li>
            <li>It even feels good as it draws cool air through your beard.  </li>
            <li>It is very precise &lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>It is very precise and trims the hair effortlessly.    </li>
            <li>The variable setting feature is easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>It works quite well without the guard, although if you want to do very detailed trimming you might be better off with a trimmer designed for this.  </li>
            <li>Closer Cut without adjustment top on.    </li>
            <li>It cuts well and grabs most of the hair.</li>
            <li>Does catch most of them though.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Head and shoulders better than the Andis.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to shorten both my beard and mustache during the summer.</li>
            <li>The sink, though, fares much better.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic!   </li>
            <li>and this allows me to pull it out real quick to charge the couple of hours it needs</li>
            <li>I have that one to alot better works alot better to has the turbo on that one</li>
            <li>I love that you can change the length of the cut.</li>
            <li>I am sure this is the newer, updated model.  </li>
            <li>I am also impressed with the overall build quality and with the end result of what my stubble beard looks like after using it.</li>
            <li>It picks up 90% or more of your whiskers &lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike others, I did not feel the need to have a more precision tool to trim my mustache.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>most people don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I love this one too.</li>
            <li>This Philips Norelco T780 is an excellent value and performs quietly and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>It catches most of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to be able to trim my beard</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s better than a trimmer, with a vacum to prevent the hair from ending up on your counter and all over the place?</li>
            <li>but I am learning more how to do it and feel that it can work that out.  </li>
            <li>Much better than corded versions and</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Better than not having it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will improve this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better because sometimes I would drop it when I tried to get the hair out.</li>
            <li>The T780 works OK</li>
            <li>hair length selector is better designed to prevent accidental movement during use.  </li>
            <li>(As I said above \\&quot;perfectly trimmed\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>(Better to cause a gouge in chest hair then my beard)</li>
            <li>Also, it would be nice if there was a light to show you when it&#x27;s fully charged-</li>
            <li>I love the power and design but sometimes the comb level changer gets stuck</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer is an excellent trimmer; although using it to trim mustache at the lip line w/o the comb attachment in place does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li>However, when I went to use it, the trimmer worked well, and as I have not used a vacuum trimmer before, I was very impressed by this feature.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum makes this trimmer the best there is.</li>
            <li>and so far it works great - very simple, reliable and fits great in hand!  </li>
            <li>and the settings offer a pretty good range of trimming control.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s excellent and I&#x27;ll continue using it as long as my beard keeps growing!</li>
            <li>It is quiet and light and does an excellent trimming job.</li>
            <li>It fits into your hand well and is very easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Its also very easy to clean</li>
            <li>Also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This shaver does the job very quickly and very clean.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>I use this only to trim my full beard and mustache, which is its stated function, and it does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>The much hyped hair catcher doesn&#x27;t do a good job, which robs it of a star.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, the battery lasts forever, the vacuum works perfectly, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>But the vacuum is awesome, I have a full beard</li>
            <li>Third, yes it looks good on the picture, but not in reality!</li>
            <li>Cleans easily.</li>
            <li>The length adjustment also is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>No pulling or tugging on hairs and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has lots of height settings that are easily adjustable</li>
            <li>I find this trimmer worth every penny and has operated flawlessly for the last year.</li>
            <li>DECENT &amp; PROBABLE GOOD FOR TRAVELING</li>
            <li>It was priced right and trims perfectly with multiple settings.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine and is easy to use on my beard.  </li>
            <li>But this new one is rather wimpy in function...especially on a good length beard...</li>
            <li>In regards to durability, everything works fine</li>
            <li>It worked just fine</li>
            <li>but it still works just fine.]</li>
            <li>For shaving a beard, I imagine it would work fine.  </li>
            <li>I also found in my search for my replacement for the previous Norelco model that Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t well suited for fine trimming at the edge of the goatee.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I previously had another Norelco and very impressed with this one.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a fine trimmer, and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Battery life is more than adequate.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does a better than adequate job of trimming.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Norelco T7500 for my first trimmer that worked great, but this is even better.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works great and empties easily.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco T780 is attractive, light, fully adjustable and a solid trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li>The battery life is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Not anymore this trimmer works great, not only</li>
            <li>It may have been worth a buck or two to include a better charging circuit.</li>
            <li>It feels really cheap in one&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>I needed another trimmer for another location, and this one was the upgrade that was available.</li>
            <li>A $15 plug-in is worth more than this thing.</li>
            <li>A great gadget that actually works.</li>
            <li>This is the second Norelco I have had and it works great for the money.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for $25.00 on Amazon with free shipping and it sells at WalMart for $56.00.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product primarily to trim my mustache.  </li>
            <li>light says it&#x27;s charging</li>
            <li>All in all though it is a well designed trimmer that I enjoy using.</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase and the 3rd Norelco trimmer I have owned.</li>
            <li>, It trims precise and accurate.</li>
            <li>this puppy worked great for several years, but is nearing the end.</li>
            <li>So when I saw this one for sale with free shipping, it was a no brainer.  </li>
            <li>also it is light weight.</li>
            <li>and I dried it for like 2 days and charged it and works so very perfect !!</li>
            <li>It gives you a great look, it gives a nice even cut and I will be using this for a few years.    </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>The old one was really good</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Turns out the vacuum is a great feature</li>
            <li>The good: powerful motor and effective blades do the main job very well.</li>
            <li>Easy to see when it&#x27;s full dump in the rubbish and your off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had older models and different brands, Norelco is still the best for me in trimmers.</li>
            <li>Its works great and the vacuum keeps my sing area clean.</li>
            <li>My original Norelco never had that problem and I&#x27;m stumped why this product would be a step backward.</li>
            <li>Product keeps the sink clean.</li>
            <li>Powerful, easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 3 different trimmers, and by far this is the best</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no mess, batery life seems ok (only used it for a couple of weeks, the setting function works great...</li>
            <li>Ergonomics are improved, height granularity of 9 is an improvement over the old one, but the thing I like best is the vacuum.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this T780 does a great job now, and I am just as happy with it now as I was a few years back.  </li>
            <li>It is very efficient at getting most all the hairs in its path.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item June 2009 and gave it a full charge.</li>
            <li>This smaller trimmer head is good for trimming the hair around my ears, inside my ears and also to trim nose hair.</li>
            <li>I have only good things to say about the trimmer.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature works fairly well, but don&#x27;t expect perfection, as some hairs will sneak out.  </li>
            <li>Overall the Philips Norelco T780 has a very cheap build quality, but it does the job of trimming well, and the vacuum does a good job of retaining most of the hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first charge, about three weeks, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Its form is seemingly identical to the T860 and, besides the black/red color and the more grippable rubber coating on the handle, the only major changes seems to be a welcome battery upgrade from a NiCad to a NiMH.</li>
            <li>In fact, I still own it and it works just fine (although it now only holds a charge for about a week).</li>
            <li>It doesnt really get close enough to trim my face but works great</li>
            <li>The size adjustment is quick and doesn&#x27;t require separate attachments.  </li>
            <li>This model is much better at the main job which is trimming the beard.  </li>
            <li>when you use Super Saver Shipping, they sit on the order for a week before they ship, so don&#x27;t select it if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s made and laid out better then the older model.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum feature isn&#x27;t perfect but collects enough clippings to make cleanup a snap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would nice if the \\&quot;precision zoom lock\\&quot; adjustment locked a little more securely.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with what I got for $26 and placing repeat order for a gift.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the razor and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am comparing this with a T-980 I have owned for several years &amp; am very pleased with.  </li>
            <li>Since starting to use it, I am thrilled with his short-clipped and clean appearance.</li>
            <li>I just hope that the new one lasts more than 5 years given that I use</li>
            <li>I really like the easily adjustable depth comb.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver, never any mess</li>
            <li>It appears to be better constructed and with the exception of the vacuum collection tray, it is even better than the first.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t liked previous trimmers which left hair all over the sink, and I liked the Norelco T780 was able to retain about 90% of the hair.</li>
            <li>Regardless of this little issue I would happily buy the trimmer again and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>The important thing is that it works REALLY well..</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>The suction is a pretty cool feature since you can&#x27;t use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is really worth the price.</li>
            <li>Its powerful too.  </li>
            <li>Certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li>This Brand/Style Razor is far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is a nice idea</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is nice.</li>
            <li>I was perfectly happy with the other that worked great for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>This one was much cheaper than the original.  </li>
            <li>A HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT RIGHT</li>
            <li>WHEN MY NORELCO T770 QUIT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AFTER MANY MANY YEARS I WENT LOOKING FOR A NEW TRIMMER.   </li>
            <li>HUSBAND WAS NOT OVERLY THRILLED WITH THIS, GOOD FOR A QUICK TOUCH UP, BUT NOT EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li>It works well enough, but the trimmer is very large and may work better for someone with a full beard.  </li>
            <li>This new trimmer preforms just as good as the earlier model.</li>
            <li>Luckily my girl thought I looked cute with multiple length hairs sticking up in all directions.    </li>
            <li>The vacuum does a good job and picks up most hairs so there is minimal cleanup.</li>
            <li>Works great, but it does not vacuum every hair, so you still should use above a sink.  </li>
            <li>One problem is that if you break the comb part (which is easy to do and which I did with the old one) then you have a time finding a replacement part and when you do it will cost over $15.00.</li>
            <li>The performance of the Norelco T780 is adequate, but not as powerful as an older Norelco trimmer it replaced.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer because one of their earlier, humbler trimmer was great...</li>
            <li>I had an older version Norelco vacuum trimmer, and this one works much better!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for that special guy for the Holidays.</li>
            <li>This device is huge compared to most other trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li>I think other reviews peg the good quality of this trimmer very well.</li>
            <li>Works good on my beard but is a little bulky for my mustache trimming although it does get it done with some effort without the guard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since the first charge, and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.</li>
            <li>The door for the collection chamber is a pretty flimsy device.</li>
            <li>I love that it actually captures trimmed beard and, thus, I don&#x27;t have to bother with cleaning after my self.</li>
            <li>I chose this unit after unwisely paying more than list price for the higher model at a local retail chain store.</li>
            <li>First of all</li>
            <li>I love it for several reasons:</li>
            <li>Thanks Norelco!  </li>
            <li>Still, i&#x27;m unaware of better alternatives and would be interested to learn of any.</li>
            <li>With 9 settings, it can make your beard the exact length that you prefer.  </li>
            <li>Either way you can&#x27;t lose with this consistent product.</li>
            <li>It works okay, but if you cut your hair short, it will leave hair lines.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the reasons I have a beard in the first place.</li>
            <li>All these issues may not be a problem if you like to trim more regularly.</li>
            <li>and he destroyed the  first two.</li>
            <li>The unit is considerably larger than most competitors, and this is a bit of a disadvantage.  </li>
            <li>IT HAS MUCH MORE VACUUM POWER THAN THE T770 TRIMMER.   </li>
            <li>I never saw a vacuum trimmer before - glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>I basically like the trim it gives most of my beard, and the vacuum works well.</li>
            <li>The vacuum does pick up most of the hair, but when I grow my beard for a week, some of it does end up in the sink.</li>
            <li>It does work, but it will capture HALF of your cuttings while the rest don&#x27;t fly quite as far as without it.</li>
            <li>I replaced an older Norlelco (5 years old) with this one and this is a very similar model, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>While this is true, the vacuum&#x27;s tip is retractable so all i have to do is hold it so that one of my fingers can pull back the vacuum&#x27;s tip while i make the precision cuts (which is a lot more comfortable then it may sound).    </li>
            <li>no matter how long i charge it for it wont work for more than 5 seconds at time.  </li>
            <li>The top is also removable for a close trim or edge trimming of sideburns or a long mustache.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok for long hair.</li>
            <li>I leave it plugged in most of the time unlike my last trimmer (older model Norelco)</li>
            <li>As usual great service when buying directly from Amazon.    </li>
            <li>If you place a piece of cellophane tape on the retractable blue plastic protector, the trimmer blade is exposed making it easy to use for trimming your mustache</li>
            <li>The batteries last a good long while between recharges.</li>
            <li>Large size fits well in hand.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Great trimmer for trimming large areas or large amounts of hair i.e, winter to summer beard.</li>
            <li>Even though the vacuum power is not that strong, still it works.</li>
            <li>Once you master that though it is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li>large to get in to smaller areas or to use to do detailed trimming  &lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using simple (aka cheap) hair trimmers for a while.</li>
            <li>Amazon handled it very well</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>The holder attached does not allow you to trim when your hair are not too much grown.</li>
            <li>and it cuts really well.</li>
            <li>but I think this is really designed to cut hair etc.</li>
            <li>and I was having a real problem keeping it trimmed.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is powerful and has no trouble with my dense beard.</li>
            <li>the instructions were straight forward.</li>
            <li>--Charge indicator light does not flash when fully charged possibly leading to reduced battery life.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for looking.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works reasonably well.</li>
            <li>only downside it does not have a stand or stand on its own as my last one did</li>
            <li>I was surprised to read so many conflicting reviews, so I purchased it knowing I could send it back</li>
            <li>and I can trim the whole thing with minimal whiskers on the couter top.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum action get most (but not all) trimmings.</li>
            <li>And the retractable vacuum cover near the blades obscures the view and turns an agile row of blades into an unwieldy block of plastic.    </li>
            <li>the adjustable lengths keep the beard uniform and the vacuum keeps both my face, neck and the bathroom countertop free from the cut hairs.    </li>
            <li>It provides just the trimming size I wanted - but otherwise it there are 8 other lengths to suit many&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature of the trimer is fantastic compared to the older models which shot trimmings out all over the sink area.  </li>
            <li>vacuum feature of the trimer is fantastic compared to the older  models which shot trimmings out all over the sink area.</li>
            <li>SINCE IT IS SLEEK &amp; DOESN&#x27;T TAKE UP TOO MUCH ROOM, BUT WOULD NOT USE AS A MAIN RAZOR.</li>
            <li>It collects neatly in a little compartment-hey, my wife is happy no more hair to clean off the sink.</li>
            <li>And my razor doesn&#x27;t have a vacuum, so I&#x27;m going to have to clean up hairs anyway.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the quietest shaver because of the vacuum, but there&#x27;s no hair in the sink to clean up when done.  </li>
            <li>However, it seems that if you are going to have to clean up any hair why bother with a vacuum feature at all.  </li>
            <li>By far the two most useful features are the adjustable built in length dial which negates any separate length accessories, and the vacuum, which does seem to be stronger than the one on the earlier model.   </li>
            <li>Should easily last me a month as I have goatee and mustache versus a full beard.  </li>
            <li>You had better make sure you have enough juice in the battery to do the job before you start, or you will arrive either late or half-trimmed.</li>
            <li>not bad,       and sent it back.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure this will break one day) and the ability to use it when plugged in (if the battery runs down, you have to wait for it to charge-</li>
            <li>I thought the cool thing about this trimmer was the vacuum part...</li>
            <li>Also,  the vacuum does not get all clippings, so count of beard trimmings on your counter, in your sink, etc.; not bad but not up to advertising.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is very easily clogged when trimming, perhaps because I wait too long between uses, but that is how I use it.</li>
            <li>The previous one I had was a Norelco and it worked better.</li>
            <li>This is a decent product.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an older Norelco trimmer that I&#x27;ve been using for about five years.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an older version purchased 5 years ago...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this one and didn&#x27;t spring for the more expensive model, which I thought about doing.</li>
            <li>I used an older version of this trimmer for years.  </li>
            <li>Was doin decent job likeother Norelco.</li>
            <li>I bought the older model of this trimmer in 1999.</li>
            <li>My son-in-law was really pleased with all the extra features with this product: Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is a real plus (keeps hair out of the sink); it&#x27;s rechargeable; the container that catches the hair is very easy to remove and empty.</li>
            <li>Now it makes a sound like a piece of metal is floating loosely inside and grating against moving parts</li>
            <li>As usual with Amazon, the buying experience was smooth and quick as was delivery.</li>
            <li>The vacuum chamber doesn&#x27;t pick up everything (still get some little beard hairs on the sink) but honestly it works a lot better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE NORELCO T780</li>
            <li>Highly recommended after thirty days of use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a minor issue, but I think the removable trimming container was easier to clean.   </li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get the one up from this one.</li>
            <li>It actually still works, but the battery doesn&#x27;t hold as good a change, the blades are only a little dull and it&#x27;s been dropped over the years (still looks good though).</li>
            <li>I had a lesser Norelco previously and the vacuum addition is very nice.  </li>
            <li>The new on  does the same thing as the old one and so far it is operating fine.  </li>
            <li>While it does contain most of the trimmings, a few do escape.</li>
            <li>There are two other even more expensive models, one is the T1000, which has a liquid mimetic-adhesive liquid alloy skin and can shapeshift and replicate and kill the user it comes in contact with, the other is the the T980, which has an even fancier body and claimed to have \\&quot;turbo power\\&quot; for those who need the best gadget.</li>
            <li>it did a very nice job on my beard, but its performance falls a little short on a couple of key features.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco vacuum trimmers are the only ones of their kind that I know of, so if this sort of thing interests you, you&#x27;re looking at just about your only option.</li>
            <li>only draw back is no travel pouch is included like my older models, but it fit in the older model pouch which I did not throw out.</li>
            <li>I have found it to be better than the previous model in the fact that tht vacum feature allowes me to get completely dressed before shaving.</li>
            <li>So I am very pleased with the vacum feature and the fact that you can clean it (I use a small pant brush) after every few uses.  </li>
            <li>-Sharp blade gives a smooth, uniform cut with fewer strokes  </li>
            <li>It really does dramatically cut down on &#x27;clean up time&#x27; by vacuuming the hair.  </li>
            <li>and I have not charged it since new</li>
            <li>But the one from my T970 works with my new T780</li>
            <li>so I had to go with the new version.</li>
            <li>I had to order a new one.</li>
            <li>so needing a new one.    </li>
            <li>the vacuum gets in the way of Mustache trimming and general clean up.</li>
            <li>I bought this item as a gift for my 16 year old son who&#x27;s new found beard was looking a bit on the scraggly side!</li>
            <li>so you keep having to empty it out and then clean it.    </li>
            <li>The extra girth and the vacuum outlet near the blades means that, as much as I try to cram the thing up under my nose, the blades can&#x27;t reach the hairs at the top of my upper lip.</li>
            <li>These problems, combined with the fact that I really miss the smaller extendable moustache blade from my old trimmer (which was also nice for trimming around the ears), will lead me to not buy this, or any other vacuum-equippedtrimmer in the future.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought that it would be steel or some sort of a solid material, wroooong.</li>
            <li>Was delivered before time promised and it really does pick up most of the uck that wife complained about with old model.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is pretty solid.</li>
            <li>It actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good enough but its trimming adjustments are not fine enough.</li>
            <li>The battery life seems to last a long time, I used it twice a week for 2 months and it was going fine</li>
            <li>(the vacuum is the freakin&#x27; reason why I bought this thing in the first place)  </li>
            <li>the vacuum function really works!</li>
            <li>Now it still make the vacuuming sound, but it doesn&#x27;t suck up half of the hair being trimmed.  </li>
            <li>It cuts easily and predictably with the adjustable head.</li>
            <li>Thus, I face the same fate with this one but have not found another that collects the whiskers (mostly) and thereby minimizes the mess.</li>
            <li>and the vacuum is largely cosmetic.</li>
            <li>Personally I like a narrower head, but the Norelco&#x27;s size isn&#x27;t much of an issue.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone in the marked for a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li>I prefer a shorter trim and so far this trimmer seems to be giving me this on my beard.</li>
            <li>ON THE TRIMMER LIKE THE OLD T770.   </li>
            <li>I miss my old Norelco Trimmer for it&#x27;s REMOVABLE collection tray.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco beard trimmer&#x27;s battery gave up and I chose the T780 as replacement after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>I had an old norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li>but somehow my dog developed a taste for the trimming head</li>
            <li>It works OK on my beard, but the guard is too big for my mustache and it makes it really uneven.</li>
            <li>The vacuum to catch the clippings is an added bonus that is really convenient and works well.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum device works very well removing stubble and storing it in an easy-to-remove chamber.</li>
            <li>I also like the built-in vacuum, which really works quite well.</li>
            <li>The vacuum part catches about 90% of the clipping so it makes clean-up much easier.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the vacuum concept.    </li>
            <li>The vacuum part is a waste of time,there&#x27;s always hair all over the counter, other than that it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>The older one I had, had a removable chamber that was much easier to empty.</li>
            <li>Works fine for me I have had maybe 5 norelco trimmers in the past, this one by far is the fastest one I have owned, cuts even,and</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of the vacuum at first since I had a Braun trimmer where the vacuum feature wasn&#x27;t worth a damn, but this works a lot better.</li>
            <li>Both trimmers have the same experience (you will get the same results) but the T980 has the cool bells and whistles that you may crave (faster charge time, low battery indicator, travel case, etc.)  </li>
            <li>Overall I use this for a quick trim on an existing beard, but I still use my old plain \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; Norelco for making straight lines around the beard/ears etc.</li>
            <li>Overall I compared this to the higher end model that has the smaller trimmer attachment</li>
            <li>For you Moms looking for a similar type gift for your sons, I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>The vacuum part is decent, but nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li>Battery contains toxic materials and company does little to assure that people eventually dispose of it properly--Norelco  officially tells you somewhere in the literature to take the trimmer to a recycling place, but by the time anyone&#x27;s ready to replace the thing they won&#x27;t know where the literature is telling them that, and besides, Norelco doesn&#x27;t really provide any support for doing so:  no address or contact info, even.  </li>
            <li>Working like new, I&#x27;ve only charged it like 3 times and I am a hairy guy.</li>
            <li>So far there is nothing I would change on this product, but I am not a heavy user, only use it once or twice per week to keep body hair in check.</li>
            <li>It catches 90-95% of the trimmed hairs, even without the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; vacuum on more expensive models, and the trap is easy to empty.  </li>
            <li>Not having to hear the wife complain about the mess from the whiskers is worth the price of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>the trim was not easy, nor smooth, nor close enough.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t have the vacuum function it is small enough to work much better.</li>
            <li>It cuts down on the mess and is much easier to clean up after.</li>
            <li>-Vacuum is a complete joke!  </li>
            <li>I just received my Norelco T780 to replace a long used older Norelco model.  </li>
            <li>I have used other similar products in the past but this is the deluxe version.</li>
            <li>About the only thing that works decently is the vacuum feature.     </li>
            <li>I had an older Norelco trimmer prior to owning this one, which did not have the vacuum functionality.</li>
            <li>The actual blade can work as a trimmer for longer lines, but you can&#x27;t get the small, precise cuts with it.</li>
            <li>B002C741MM Philps Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer]] is apparently the upgrade to the Norelco T860, renamed to a \\&quot;stubble trimmer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The only limitation is my husband has difficulty in trimming near his nose.  </li>
            <li>Darn near the same price.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have so far is shaving around my nose with the vacum there.</li>
            <li>I sent this one back and bought my old one (T765).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only charged this once (used it about 5 times, so far).</li>
            <li>The only negitive I would say is that the company no longer provides a storage bag to keep it in, so I just switched it over from the old one (which I kept in case of emergency).</li>
            <li>In fact, I may end up just sending this one over to Goodwill in the near future.    </li>
            <li>The battery holds a charge for a long time, and the vacuum works very well.</li>
            <li>I hate that Norelco makes great trimmers that you can not replace the batteries yourself and thus have to throw them away and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Prior to my first use, I attempted to put extreme pressure on the guide while pressing it to my chest.</li>
            <li>The comb is made of cheap flimsy plastic, and the general appearance of the trimmer looks very basic, big, almost 1980&#x27;s in design, and in a way, amateur.    </li>
            <li>The T770 did a fair job of trimming and a terrible job of collecting the hair via the vacuum missing a good 30% of the hair.    </li>
            <li>like all the other ones, I&#x27;ve had, it would probably slip to a lower setting if too much pressure was applied</li>
            <li>There is a little double ended brush included that is useful for cleaning out the trap.</li>
            <li>I am starting to get used to it, is triming my mustache without the depth guide is challenging due to the little floating shield that helps the vacuum work so well.  </li>
            <li>Another problem, which is exacerbated by the need to frequently remove it, is the fact the the length adjuster does not fit easily and firmly in place.</li>
            <li>the old one finally broke after repeated uses on trimming my husband&#x27;s beard, but only after a couple of accidental drops.  </li>
            <li>the only reason I don&#x27;t give it full stars is because there is still a small amount of hair that doesn&#x27;t get sucked in.  </li>
            <li>This happens so often that there is rarely any hair in the receptacle because it all gets trapped in the vacuum orifice.    </li>
            <li>Firstly when I opened the box and looked at my new Philips Norelco T780, I could see instantly the build quality is not very good.</li>
            <li>Once the vacuum clogs, you must stop the trimmer, remove the length adjuster thingy, and clear all the hair from the sliding vacuum trap door thingy.</li>
            <li>Much like the other 1star reviews i have to say the following:  1)</li>
            <li>when I first got it (a few months ago) and the adjustable setting slips from one setting to another.....</li>
            <li>very disconcerting when it slips from a &#x27;3&#x27; or a &#x27;2&#x27; down to a &#x27;1&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, fancy hair vacuuming technology has arrived during my absence.</li>
            <li>The battery life if mediocre and the chamber gets full really easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It  really does minimize any mess.</li>
            <li>The extra size is apparently needed for the internal vacuum.</li>
            <li>Since there&#x27;s little help or encouragement taking care of the battery responsibly, I&#x27;m sure­</li>
            <li>It really works and prevents the proliferation of little whiskers all over the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>so my beard got a little longer than normal, the vacuum left some clippings on the sink, it didn&#x27;t do as well as it did using it the 2nd time ,I didn&#x27;t see any lil clippings after the 2nd trimming on the sink a few on my chest though I like the lil door that slides out so it will pickup the clippings when you pop the beard trimmer off and use the mustache trimmer I like the size my old one was too small for big hands to hold securely</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Backwards design steps mar an otherwise good trimmer.</li>
            <li> but I cannot find a good way to do it.</li>

            <li> Price is good for the job that you want done.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I feel this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> I replaced my T770 model after the battery died for good.  </li>
            <li> This unit does a good job on my beard.  </li>
            <li> and the battery holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good trimmer and</li>
            <li> Good battery life between chargings, too.</li>
            <li> hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it works good.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase</li>
            <li> really good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly it worked.</li>
            <li> To get 5+ years out of one is an exceptional value.  </li>
            <li> This is very good in and smooth in use.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the price, delivery, and performance.  </li>
            <li> i was very pleased with my trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco trimmer before and was very satisfied and so had no problems buying this one.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the trimmer and service.    </li>
            <li> Still just as pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer!  </li>
            <li> but this one is much better!</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, trimming is smooth, you don&#x27;t feel anything against the skin.</li>
            <li> The built-in guide depth selection is handy.</li>
            <li> and it uses a nice color scheme.    </li>
            <li> I wish it had some kind of stand</li>
            <li> I really liked the part that collects beard trimmings.</li>
            <li> This is a REALLY nice trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always trimmed my beard with scissors and had to clean up the hair that would fly every where.</li>
            <li> The length dial slips way too easily into a lower setting, and this can make a disaster of an otherwise good morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to adjust for the desired beard length, with no attachments to change, and unlike some reviewers I have never had a problem with it changing settings during use.  </li>
            <li> If anything, its good to shorten the length of your beard but is still patchy, and you need a manual razor to clean up your shave.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s cordless and the battery is very strong.</li>
            <li> Great price and the vacuum works great.</li>
            <li> Mostly good: the hair catcher is a GREAT idea--however only about 80% effective.</li>
            <li> It even feels good as it draws cool air through your beard.  </li>
            <li> It is very precise &lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> It is very precise and trims the hair effortlessly.    </li>
            <li> The variable setting feature is easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> It works quite well without the guard, although if you want to do very detailed trimming you might be better off with a trimmer designed for this.  </li>
            <li> Closer Cut without adjustment top on.    </li>
            <li> It cuts well and grabs most of the hair.</li>
            <li> Does catch most of them though.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Head and shoulders better than the Andis.  </li>
            <li> I like being able to shorten both my beard and mustache during the summer.</li>
            <li> The sink, though, fares much better.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic!   </li>
            <li> and this allows me to pull it out real quick to charge the couple of hours it needs</li>
            <li> I have that one to alot better works alot better to has the turbo on that one</li>
            <li> I love that you can change the length of the cut.</li>
            <li> I am sure this is the newer, updated model.  </li>
            <li> I am also impressed with the overall build quality and with the end result of what my stubble beard looks like after using it.</li>
            <li> It picks up 90% or more of your whiskers &lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike others, I did not feel the need to have a more precision tool to trim my mustache.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> most people don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I love this one too.</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco T780 is an excellent value and performs quietly and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> It catches most of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to be able to trim my beard</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s better than a trimmer, with a vacum to prevent the hair from ending up on your counter and all over the place?</li>
            <li> but I am learning more how to do it and feel that it can work that out.  </li>
            <li> Much better than corded versions and</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Better than not having it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they will improve this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better because sometimes I would drop it when I tried to get the hair out.</li>
            <li> The T780 works OK</li>
            <li> hair length selector is better designed to prevent accidental movement during use.  </li>
            <li> (As I said above \\&quot;perfectly trimmed\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> (Better to cause a gouge in chest hair then my beard)</li>
            <li> Also, it would be nice if there was a light to show you when it&#x27;s fully charged-</li>
            <li> I love the power and design but sometimes the comb level changer gets stuck</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer is an excellent trimmer; although using it to trim mustache at the lip line w/o the comb attachment in place does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> However, when I went to use it, the trimmer worked well, and as I have not used a vacuum trimmer before, I was very impressed by this feature.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum makes this trimmer the best there is.</li>
            <li> and so far it works great - very simple, reliable and fits great in hand!  </li>
            <li> and the settings offer a pretty good range of trimming control.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s excellent and I&#x27;ll continue using it as long as my beard keeps growing!</li>
            <li> It is quiet and light and does an excellent trimming job.</li>
            <li> It fits into your hand well and is very easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> Its also very easy to clean</li>
            <li> Also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This shaver does the job very quickly and very clean.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> I use this only to trim my full beard and mustache, which is its stated function, and it does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> The much hyped hair catcher doesn&#x27;t do a good job, which robs it of a star.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, the battery lasts forever, the vacuum works perfectly, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> But the vacuum is awesome, I have a full beard</li>
            <li> Third, yes it looks good on the picture, but not in reality!</li>
            <li> Cleans easily.</li>
            <li> The length adjustment also is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> No pulling or tugging on hairs and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has lots of height settings that are easily adjustable</li>
            <li> I find this trimmer worth every penny and has operated flawlessly for the last year.</li>
            <li> DECENT &amp; PROBABLE GOOD FOR TRAVELING</li>
            <li> It was priced right and trims perfectly with multiple settings.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine and is easy to use on my beard.  </li>
            <li> But this new one is rather wimpy in function...especially on a good length beard...</li>
            <li> In regards to durability, everything works fine</li>
            <li> It worked just fine</li>
            <li> but it still works just fine.]</li>
            <li> For shaving a beard, I imagine it would work fine.  </li>
            <li> I also found in my search for my replacement for the previous Norelco model that Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t well suited for fine trimming at the edge of the goatee.  </li>
            <li> This is a fine trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I previously had another Norelco and very impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a fine trimmer, and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Battery life is more than adequate.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a better than adequate job of trimming.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Norelco T7500 for my first trimmer that worked great, but this is even better.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works great and empties easily.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco T780 is attractive, light, fully adjustable and a solid trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li> The battery life is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Not anymore this trimmer works great, not only</li>
            <li> It may have been worth a buck or two to include a better charging circuit.</li>
            <li> It feels really cheap in one&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> I needed another trimmer for another location, and this one was the upgrade that was available.</li>
            <li> A $15 plug-in is worth more than this thing.</li>
            <li> A great gadget that actually works.</li>
            <li> This is the second Norelco I have had and it works great for the money.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for $25.00 on Amazon with free shipping and it sells at WalMart for $56.00.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily to trim my mustache.  </li>
            <li> light says it&#x27;s charging</li>
            <li> All in all though it is a well designed trimmer that I enjoy using.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase and the 3rd Norelco trimmer I have owned.</li>
            <li> , It trims precise and accurate.</li>
            <li> this puppy worked great for several years, but is nearing the end.</li>
            <li> So when I saw this one for sale with free shipping, it was a no brainer.  </li>
            <li> also it is light weight.</li>
            <li> and I dried it for like 2 days and charged it and works so very perfect !!</li>
            <li> It gives you a great look, it gives a nice even cut and I will be using this for a few years.    </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> The old one was really good</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Turns out the vacuum is a great feature</li>
            <li> The good: powerful motor and effective blades do the main job very well.</li>
            <li> Easy to see when it&#x27;s full dump in the rubbish and your off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had older models and different brands, Norelco is still the best for me in trimmers.</li>
            <li> Its works great and the vacuum keeps my sing area clean.</li>
            <li> My original Norelco never had that problem and I&#x27;m stumped why this product would be a step backward.</li>
            <li> Product keeps the sink clean.</li>
            <li> Powerful, easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 different trimmers, and by far this is the best</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no mess, batery life seems ok (only used it for a couple of weeks, the setting function works great...</li>
            <li> Ergonomics are improved, height granularity of 9 is an improvement over the old one, but the thing I like best is the vacuum.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this T780 does a great job now, and I am just as happy with it now as I was a few years back.  </li>
            <li> It is very efficient at getting most all the hairs in its path.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item June 2009 and gave it a full charge.</li>
            <li> This smaller trimmer head is good for trimming the hair around my ears, inside my ears and also to trim nose hair.</li>
            <li> I have only good things to say about the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works fairly well, but don&#x27;t expect perfection, as some hairs will sneak out.  </li>
            <li> Overall the Philips Norelco T780 has a very cheap build quality, but it does the job of trimming well, and the vacuum does a good job of retaining most of the hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on the first charge, about three weeks, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Its form is seemingly identical to the T860 and, besides the black/red color and the more grippable rubber coating on the handle, the only major changes seems to be a welcome battery upgrade from a NiCad to a NiMH.</li>
            <li> In fact, I still own it and it works just fine (although it now only holds a charge for about a week).</li>
            <li> It doesnt really get close enough to trim my face but works great</li>
            <li> The size adjustment is quick and doesn&#x27;t require separate attachments.  </li>
            <li> This model is much better at the main job which is trimming the beard.  </li>
            <li> when you use Super Saver Shipping, they sit on the order for a week before they ship, so don&#x27;t select it if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s made and laid out better then the older model.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature isn&#x27;t perfect but collects enough clippings to make cleanup a snap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would nice if the \\&quot;precision zoom lock\\&quot; adjustment locked a little more securely.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with what I got for $26 and placing repeat order for a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the razor and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am comparing this with a T-980 I have owned for several years &amp; am very pleased with.  </li>
            <li> Since starting to use it, I am thrilled with his short-clipped and clean appearance.</li>
            <li> I just hope that the new one lasts more than 5 years given that I use</li>
            <li> I really like the easily adjustable depth comb.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, never any mess</li>
            <li> It appears to be better constructed and with the exception of the vacuum collection tray, it is even better than the first.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t liked previous trimmers which left hair all over the sink, and I liked the Norelco T780 was able to retain about 90% of the hair.</li>
            <li> Regardless of this little issue I would happily buy the trimmer again and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The important thing is that it works REALLY well..</li>
            <li> Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> The suction is a pretty cool feature since you can&#x27;t use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> It is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> Its powerful too.  </li>
            <li> Certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> This Brand/Style Razor is far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is a nice idea</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is nice.</li>
            <li> I was perfectly happy with the other that worked great for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This one was much cheaper than the original.  </li>
            <li> A HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT RIGHT</li>
            <li> WHEN MY NORELCO T770 QUIT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AFTER MANY MANY YEARS I WENT LOOKING FOR A NEW TRIMMER.   </li>
            <li> HUSBAND WAS NOT OVERLY THRILLED WITH THIS, GOOD FOR A QUICK TOUCH UP, BUT NOT EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> It works well enough, but the trimmer is very large and may work better for someone with a full beard.  </li>
            <li> This new trimmer preforms just as good as the earlier model.</li>
            <li> Luckily my girl thought I looked cute with multiple length hairs sticking up in all directions.    </li>
            <li> The vacuum does a good job and picks up most hairs so there is minimal cleanup.</li>
            <li> Works great, but it does not vacuum every hair, so you still should use above a sink.  </li>
            <li> One problem is that if you break the comb part (which is easy to do and which I did with the old one) then you have a time finding a replacement part and when you do it will cost over $15.00.</li>
            <li> The performance of the Norelco T780 is adequate, but not as powerful as an older Norelco trimmer it replaced.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer because one of their earlier, humbler trimmer was great...</li>
            <li> I had an older version Norelco vacuum trimmer, and this one works much better!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for that special guy for the Holidays.</li>
            <li> This device is huge compared to most other trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li> I think other reviews peg the good quality of this trimmer very well.</li>
            <li> Works good on my beard but is a little bulky for my mustache trimming although it does get it done with some effort without the guard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since the first charge, and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.</li>
            <li> The door for the collection chamber is a pretty flimsy device.</li>
            <li> I love that it actually captures trimmed beard and, thus, I don&#x27;t have to bother with cleaning after my self.</li>
            <li> I chose this unit after unwisely paying more than list price for the higher model at a local retail chain store.</li>
            <li> First of all</li>
            <li> I love it for several reasons:</li>
            <li> Thanks Norelco!  </li>
            <li> Still, i&#x27;m unaware of better alternatives and would be interested to learn of any.</li>
            <li> With 9 settings, it can make your beard the exact length that you prefer.  </li>
            <li> Either way you can&#x27;t lose with this consistent product.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but if you cut your hair short, it will leave hair lines.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one of the reasons I have a beard in the first place.</li>
            <li> All these issues may not be a problem if you like to trim more regularly.</li>
            <li> and he destroyed the  first two.</li>
            <li> The unit is considerably larger than most competitors, and this is a bit of a disadvantage.  </li>
            <li> IT HAS MUCH MORE VACUUM POWER THAN THE T770 TRIMMER.   </li>
            <li> I never saw a vacuum trimmer before - glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> I basically like the trim it gives most of my beard, and the vacuum works well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum does pick up most of the hair, but when I grow my beard for a week, some of it does end up in the sink.</li>
            <li> It does work, but it will capture HALF of your cuttings while the rest don&#x27;t fly quite as far as without it.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older Norlelco (5 years old) with this one and this is a very similar model, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> While this is true, the vacuum&#x27;s tip is retractable so all i have to do is hold it so that one of my fingers can pull back the vacuum&#x27;s tip while i make the precision cuts (which is a lot more comfortable then it may sound).    </li>
            <li> no matter how long i charge it for it wont work for more than 5 seconds at time.  </li>
            <li> The top is also removable for a close trim or edge trimming of sideburns or a long mustache.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok for long hair.</li>
            <li> I leave it plugged in most of the time unlike my last trimmer (older model Norelco)</li>
            <li> As usual great service when buying directly from Amazon.    </li>
            <li> If you place a piece of cellophane tape on the retractable blue plastic protector, the trimmer blade is exposed making it easy to use for trimming your mustache</li>
            <li> The batteries last a good long while between recharges.</li>
            <li> Large size fits well in hand.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Great trimmer for trimming large areas or large amounts of hair i.e, winter to summer beard.</li>
            <li> Even though the vacuum power is not that strong, still it works.</li>
            <li> Once you master that though it is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> large to get in to smaller areas or to use to do detailed trimming  &lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using simple (aka cheap) hair trimmers for a while.</li>
            <li> Amazon handled it very well</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> The holder attached does not allow you to trim when your hair are not too much grown.</li>
            <li> and it cuts really well.</li>
            <li> but I think this is really designed to cut hair etc.</li>
            <li> and I was having a real problem keeping it trimmed.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is powerful and has no trouble with my dense beard.</li>
            <li> the instructions were straight forward.</li>
            <li> --Charge indicator light does not flash when fully charged possibly leading to reduced battery life.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for looking.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works reasonably well.</li>
            <li> only downside it does not have a stand or stand on its own as my last one did</li>
            <li> I was surprised to read so many conflicting reviews, so I purchased it knowing I could send it back</li>
            <li> and I can trim the whole thing with minimal whiskers on the couter top.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum action get most (but not all) trimmings.</li>
            <li> And the retractable vacuum cover near the blades obscures the view and turns an agile row of blades into an unwieldy block of plastic.    </li>
            <li> the adjustable lengths keep the beard uniform and the vacuum keeps both my face, neck and the bathroom countertop free from the cut hairs.    </li>
            <li> It provides just the trimming size I wanted - but otherwise it there are 8 other lengths to suit many&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature of the trimer is fantastic compared to the older models which shot trimmings out all over the sink area.  </li>
            <li> vacuum feature of the trimer is fantastic compared to the older  models which shot trimmings out all over the sink area.</li>
            <li> SINCE IT IS SLEEK &amp; DOESN&#x27;T TAKE UP TOO MUCH ROOM, BUT WOULD NOT USE AS A MAIN RAZOR.</li>
            <li> It collects neatly in a little compartment-hey, my wife is happy no more hair to clean off the sink.</li>
            <li> And my razor doesn&#x27;t have a vacuum, so I&#x27;m going to have to clean up hairs anyway.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the quietest shaver because of the vacuum, but there&#x27;s no hair in the sink to clean up when done.  </li>
            <li> However, it seems that if you are going to have to clean up any hair why bother with a vacuum feature at all.  </li>
            <li> By far the two most useful features are the adjustable built in length dial which negates any separate length accessories, and the vacuum, which does seem to be stronger than the one on the earlier model.   </li>
            <li> Should easily last me a month as I have goatee and mustache versus a full beard.  </li>
            <li> You had better make sure you have enough juice in the battery to do the job before you start, or you will arrive either late or half-trimmed.</li>
            <li> not bad,       and sent it back.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure this will break one day) and the ability to use it when plugged in (if the battery runs down, you have to wait for it to charge-</li>
            <li> I thought the cool thing about this trimmer was the vacuum part...</li>
            <li> Also,  the vacuum does not get all clippings, so count of beard trimmings on your counter, in your sink, etc.; not bad but not up to advertising.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is very easily clogged when trimming, perhaps because I wait too long between uses, but that is how I use it.</li>
            <li> The previous one I had was a Norelco and it worked better.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an older Norelco trimmer that I&#x27;ve been using for about five years.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older version purchased 5 years ago...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this one and didn&#x27;t spring for the more expensive model, which I thought about doing.</li>
            <li> I used an older version of this trimmer for years.  </li>
            <li> Was doin decent job likeother Norelco.</li>
            <li> I bought the older model of this trimmer in 1999.</li>
            <li> My son-in-law was really pleased with all the extra features with this product: Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a real plus (keeps hair out of the sink); it&#x27;s rechargeable; the container that catches the hair is very easy to remove and empty.</li>
            <li> Now it makes a sound like a piece of metal is floating loosely inside and grating against moving parts</li>
            <li> As usual with Amazon, the buying experience was smooth and quick as was delivery.</li>
            <li> The vacuum chamber doesn&#x27;t pick up everything (still get some little beard hairs on the sink) but honestly it works a lot better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE NORELCO T780</li>
            <li> Highly recommended after thirty days of use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a minor issue, but I think the removable trimming container was easier to clean.   </li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get the one up from this one.</li>
            <li> It actually still works, but the battery doesn&#x27;t hold as good a change, the blades are only a little dull and it&#x27;s been dropped over the years (still looks good though).</li>
            <li> I had a lesser Norelco previously and the vacuum addition is very nice.  </li>
            <li> The new on  does the same thing as the old one and so far it is operating fine.  </li>
            <li> While it does contain most of the trimmings, a few do escape.</li>
            <li> There are two other even more expensive models, one is the T1000, which has a liquid mimetic-adhesive liquid alloy skin and can shapeshift and replicate and kill the user it comes in contact with, the other is the the T980, which has an even fancier body and claimed to have \\&quot;turbo power\\&quot; for those who need the best gadget.</li>
            <li> it did a very nice job on my beard, but its performance falls a little short on a couple of key features.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco vacuum trimmers are the only ones of their kind that I know of, so if this sort of thing interests you, you&#x27;re looking at just about your only option.</li>
            <li> only draw back is no travel pouch is included like my older models, but it fit in the older model pouch which I did not throw out.</li>
            <li> I have found it to be better than the previous model in the fact that tht vacum feature allowes me to get completely dressed before shaving.</li>
            <li> So I am very pleased with the vacum feature and the fact that you can clean it (I use a small pant brush) after every few uses.  </li>
            <li> -Sharp blade gives a smooth, uniform cut with fewer strokes  </li>
            <li> It really does dramatically cut down on &#x27;clean up time&#x27; by vacuuming the hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have not charged it since new</li>
            <li> But the one from my T970 works with my new T780</li>
            <li> so I had to go with the new version.</li>
            <li> I had to order a new one.</li>
            <li> so needing a new one.    </li>
            <li> the vacuum gets in the way of Mustache trimming and general clean up.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my 16 year old son who&#x27;s new found beard was looking a bit on the scraggly side!</li>
            <li> so you keep having to empty it out and then clean it.    </li>
            <li> The extra girth and the vacuum outlet near the blades means that, as much as I try to cram the thing up under my nose, the blades can&#x27;t reach the hairs at the top of my upper lip.</li>
            <li> These problems, combined with the fact that I really miss the smaller extendable moustache blade from my old trimmer (which was also nice for trimming around the ears), will lead me to not buy this, or any other vacuum-equippedtrimmer in the future.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought that it would be steel or some sort of a solid material, wroooong.</li>
            <li> Was delivered before time promised and it really does pick up most of the uck that wife complained about with old model.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty solid.</li>
            <li> It actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good enough but its trimming adjustments are not fine enough.</li>
            <li> The battery life seems to last a long time, I used it twice a week for 2 months and it was going fine</li>
            <li> (the vacuum is the freakin&#x27; reason why I bought this thing in the first place)  </li>
            <li> the vacuum function really works!</li>
            <li> Now it still make the vacuuming sound, but it doesn&#x27;t suck up half of the hair being trimmed.  </li>
            <li> It cuts easily and predictably with the adjustable head.</li>
            <li> Thus, I face the same fate with this one but have not found another that collects the whiskers (mostly) and thereby minimizes the mess.</li>
            <li> and the vacuum is largely cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Personally I like a narrower head, but the Norelco&#x27;s size isn&#x27;t much of an issue.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone in the marked for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I prefer a shorter trim and so far this trimmer seems to be giving me this on my beard.</li>
            <li> ON THE TRIMMER LIKE THE OLD T770.   </li>
            <li> I miss my old Norelco Trimmer for it&#x27;s REMOVABLE collection tray.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco beard trimmer&#x27;s battery gave up and I chose the T780 as replacement after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> I had an old norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> but somehow my dog developed a taste for the trimming head</li>
            <li> It works OK on my beard, but the guard is too big for my mustache and it makes it really uneven.</li>
            <li> The vacuum to catch the clippings is an added bonus that is really convenient and works well.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum device works very well removing stubble and storing it in an easy-to-remove chamber.</li>
            <li> I also like the built-in vacuum, which really works quite well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum part catches about 90% of the clipping so it makes clean-up much easier.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the vacuum concept.    </li>
            <li> The vacuum part is a waste of time,there&#x27;s always hair all over the counter, other than that it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> The older one I had, had a removable chamber that was much easier to empty.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me I have had maybe 5 norelco trimmers in the past, this one by far is the fastest one I have owned, cuts even,and</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the vacuum at first since I had a Braun trimmer where the vacuum feature wasn&#x27;t worth a damn, but this works a lot better.</li>
            <li> Both trimmers have the same experience (you will get the same results) but the T980 has the cool bells and whistles that you may crave (faster charge time, low battery indicator, travel case, etc.)  </li>
            <li> Overall I use this for a quick trim on an existing beard, but I still use my old plain \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; Norelco for making straight lines around the beard/ears etc.</li>
            <li> Overall I compared this to the higher end model that has the smaller trimmer attachment</li>
            <li> For you Moms looking for a similar type gift for your sons, I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The vacuum part is decent, but nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li> Battery contains toxic materials and company does little to assure that people eventually dispose of it properly--Norelco  officially tells you somewhere in the literature to take the trimmer to a recycling place, but by the time anyone&#x27;s ready to replace the thing they won&#x27;t know where the literature is telling them that, and besides, Norelco doesn&#x27;t really provide any support for doing so:  no address or contact info, even.  </li>
            <li> Working like new, I&#x27;ve only charged it like 3 times and I am a hairy guy.</li>
            <li> So far there is nothing I would change on this product, but I am not a heavy user, only use it once or twice per week to keep body hair in check.</li>
            <li> It catches 90-95% of the trimmed hairs, even without the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; vacuum on more expensive models, and the trap is easy to empty.  </li>
            <li> Not having to hear the wife complain about the mess from the whiskers is worth the price of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> the trim was not easy, nor smooth, nor close enough.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t have the vacuum function it is small enough to work much better.</li>
            <li> It cuts down on the mess and is much easier to clean up after.</li>
            <li> -Vacuum is a complete joke!  </li>
            <li> I just received my Norelco T780 to replace a long used older Norelco model.  </li>
            <li> I have used other similar products in the past but this is the deluxe version.</li>
            <li> About the only thing that works decently is the vacuum feature.     </li>
            <li> I had an older Norelco trimmer prior to owning this one, which did not have the vacuum functionality.</li>
            <li> The actual blade can work as a trimmer for longer lines, but you can&#x27;t get the small, precise cuts with it.</li>
            <li> B002C741MM Philps Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer]] is apparently the upgrade to the Norelco T860, renamed to a \\&quot;stubble trimmer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The only limitation is my husband has difficulty in trimming near his nose.  </li>
            <li> Darn near the same price.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have so far is shaving around my nose with the vacum there.</li>
            <li> I sent this one back and bought my old one (T765).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only charged this once (used it about 5 times, so far).</li>
            <li> The only negitive I would say is that the company no longer provides a storage bag to keep it in, so I just switched it over from the old one (which I kept in case of emergency).</li>
            <li> In fact, I may end up just sending this one over to Goodwill in the near future.    </li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge for a long time, and the vacuum works very well.</li>
            <li> I hate that Norelco makes great trimmers that you can not replace the batteries yourself and thus have to throw them away and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Prior to my first use, I attempted to put extreme pressure on the guide while pressing it to my chest.</li>
            <li> The comb is made of cheap flimsy plastic, and the general appearance of the trimmer looks very basic, big, almost 1980&#x27;s in design, and in a way, amateur.    </li>
            <li> The T770 did a fair job of trimming and a terrible job of collecting the hair via the vacuum missing a good 30% of the hair.    </li>
            <li> like all the other ones, I&#x27;ve had, it would probably slip to a lower setting if too much pressure was applied</li>
            <li> There is a little double ended brush included that is useful for cleaning out the trap.</li>
            <li> I am starting to get used to it, is triming my mustache without the depth guide is challenging due to the little floating shield that helps the vacuum work so well.  </li>
            <li> Another problem, which is exacerbated by the need to frequently remove it, is the fact the the length adjuster does not fit easily and firmly in place.</li>
            <li> the old one finally broke after repeated uses on trimming my husband&#x27;s beard, but only after a couple of accidental drops.  </li>
            <li> the only reason I don&#x27;t give it full stars is because there is still a small amount of hair that doesn&#x27;t get sucked in.  </li>
            <li> This happens so often that there is rarely any hair in the receptacle because it all gets trapped in the vacuum orifice.    </li>
            <li> Firstly when I opened the box and looked at my new Philips Norelco T780, I could see instantly the build quality is not very good.</li>
            <li> Once the vacuum clogs, you must stop the trimmer, remove the length adjuster thingy, and clear all the hair from the sliding vacuum trap door thingy.</li>
            <li> Much like the other 1star reviews i have to say the following:  1)</li>
            <li> when I first got it (a few months ago) and the adjustable setting slips from one setting to another.....</li>
            <li> very disconcerting when it slips from a &#x27;3&#x27; or a &#x27;2&#x27; down to a &#x27;1&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, fancy hair vacuuming technology has arrived during my absence.</li>
            <li> The battery life if mediocre and the chamber gets full really easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It  really does minimize any mess.</li>
            <li> The extra size is apparently needed for the internal vacuum.</li>
            <li> Since there&#x27;s little help or encouragement taking care of the battery responsibly, I&#x27;m sure­</li>
            <li> It really works and prevents the proliferation of little whiskers all over the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> so my beard got a little longer than normal, the vacuum left some clippings on the sink, it didn&#x27;t do as well as it did using it the 2nd time ,I didn&#x27;t see any lil clippings after the 2nd trimming on the sink a few on my chest though I like the lil door that slides out so it will pickup the clippings when you pop the beard trimmer off and use the mustache trimmer I like the size my old one was too small for big hands to hold securely</li>
            <li> I have always used slight pressure using a trimmer, vacuum does a decent job</li>
            <li> And once you have a beard trimmer with a vacuum function, you will not want to go back to one without it.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is improved and only misses about 10% of the hair now.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t suck up everything, but it&#x27;s a big improvement over nothing!  </li>
            <li> The vacuum picks up about 70% of my hair, but maybe different for others.</li>
            <li> Since I have used this type of trimmer, then I couldn&#x27;t go back to using one without a vacuum.</li>
            <li> The vacuum in a bear trimmer is a must have.</li>
            <li> Vacuum&#x27;s cut hair.</li>
            <li> This vacuum \\&quot;works\\</li>
            <li> The vacuum also adds to the noise.</li>
            <li> The vacuum seems to work well</li>
            <li> The vacuum power is stronger on this one.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum lacks some</li>
            <li> The vacuum seems to suck up 90-95% of the hair which makes cleanup a breeze.    </li>
            <li> the vacuum kept getting clogged and there was still hair all over my sink.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t suck at all, all the hair gets stuck at the blade.</li>
            <li> The vacuum part of the trimmer catches all of the hair with no problem.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum system works well, making cleanup easier and keeping the trimmings from fouling the blades.  </li>
            <li> It does vacuum up the hairs well as advertised.</li>
            <li> However the vacuum no longer works as well as</li>
            <li> Well, the vacuum part worked for about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> One annoyance that I have is the plastic slide in front of the blade (which aids in funneling the hair into the vacuum)</li>
            <li> It has a neat adjustable height mechanism and the vacuum suction feature collects your hair trimmings.</li>
            <li> Conclusion: either the accumulator should be improved or get rid of the vacuum!  </li>
            <li> (I had purchased my other one nearly 5 years ago and this spring it just died.)  </li>
            <li> (I assume related to the vacuum) that makes it difficult to do close work, like trimming the moustache above the lip, or removing fine hairs on the upper cheek or side of the neck that you wouldn&#x27;t want to shave.</li>
            <li> charge lasts much longer, and has much better cutting ability with less pull...</li>
            <li> No more mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> I really wish it would have a small pop up trimmer, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see how long the batteries last before charging---10 trimmings and still going.</li>
            <li> I have no reason to believe that this one won&#x27;t last just as long.</li>
            <li> I have put off reveiuing this trimmer until I have had it long enough to make a qualified call.</li>
            <li> One charge last a long time.</li>
            <li> (clean the filter screen each use), especially if you use it everyday,  my old one was broken and I was waiting for this one</li>
            <li> It has the smooth cutting action of the T7500, but with the addition of the vacuum system.     </li>
            <li> The Battery lasts a long time, even with the vacuum</li>
            <li> It takes twice as long a others because the hair gets stuck in the vacuum</li>
            <li> If you drop it on a hard floor from a reasonable height, the flimsy plastic comb is likely to break.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that it seems that the guard pushes down some beard hairs around the back of my jaw line (near the hinge) and makes them harder to trim.  </li>
            <li> As several other reviewers have noted, the vacuum feature is only so-so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually its not possible to trim and vacumm each single</li>
            <li> It can get clogged when doing longer hair as the vacuum is smaller so either cut long hair in two steps or just keep cutting because it still cuts just fine even when the vacuum is clogged..    </li>
            <li> One complaint for this new version is that the plastic trimming collector for the vacuum cannot be removed as in the earlier model.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of a vacuum on a trimmer before this, and I thought, well that sounds allright, although I had already solved the problem of the mess by simply trimming outside with a handheld mirror.    </li>
            <li> When not using the guide it is difficult to use accurately because of the angle and the size.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the cutting performance and the feel in my hand are a lot better than with the Braun.     </li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time and haven&#x27;t had any problems with the length setttings.  </li>
            <li> Minor negatives</li>
            <li> If you are trying to do some precision cuts you need be extra careful.</li>
            <li> Works well and holds a charge a long time.  </li>
            <li> Two minor complaints:   1)</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> So I dried it for 3 Complete days.</li>
            <li> This review is mostly a comparison to old trimmers I have used such as one that charges on a base and one that runs off 2 AA batteries.    </li>
            <li> Died on me about a month and a half after buying,not sure what&#x27;s wrong with it...</li>
            <li> In fact, its shortest setting is very short; shorter than some other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> While the T860 was like a small South American banana, the T780 is like a big North American cucumber.</li>
            <li> Only difference is that the other one lasted a lot longer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does not lose cutting positions if you press against your face too hard, so that&#x27;s a good thing too.  </li>
            <li> , the blade became dull on them real fast or the rechargeable battery died in just a few months (despite charging it as per instructions).  </li>
            <li> The convenience, reliability (I had the earlier one for at least 3 years), and performance of this trimmer is far above the other brands.   </li>
            <li> The only thing to charge is that it doesn&#x27;t have any travel pouch and also does a little mess in sink although Phillips advertises NO MESS in sink...  </li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I was a bit doubtful about how well the vacuum was going to work.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to trim up every single week.</li>
            <li> I actually owned this trimmer a few years back, before  all the fancy chrome and other plastic embellishments on the body of the trimmer (which in turn gave Norelco an excuse to bump up the price by about $10).</li>
            <li> The first one i had was broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> it was drowned in water for long time which i didn&#x27;t notice.</li>
            <li> I often put it back on and start trimming, thinking it is in place, and it slides down, not from pressure, but because it wasn&#x27;t locked into the grooves to begin with, even though it felt like it was.</li>
            <li> and I can only get this to happen when i push really hard (hard enough that it felt like was going to break if i put any more oomph behind it).  </li>
            <li> This Norelco totally out performs the Conair trimmer I previously owned.</li>
            <li> : there&#x27;s no travel pouch, and the piece is larger than previous generations.</li>
            <li> This unit was half the price for basically the same unit.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be like my previous trimmer but have the vacuum</li>
            <li> (Avoid the deadly T1000, they went a little too far with the technology!)</li>
            <li> If Norelco makes something similar a little smaller, and with a little travel bag plus charger, then let me know.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these over the past 10 years and no other razor compares.</li>
            <li> The so called vacuum is loud and suction is weak.  </li>
            <li> Blades remain sharp, stays charged for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is a little loud.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other trimmer before (re)buying this one, but they either came with half a pound of extra accessories</li>
            <li> For the most part this isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> This is the only negative point for me, it only works on US voltage.</li>
            <li> It stays at the setting without slipping.</li>
            <li> I have to empty it</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t use it if the battery is empty</li>
            <li> it got totally wet</li>
            <li> but if you are careful with it, it may last you a few years.</li>
            <li> and it takes a whole lot of energy to run those blades, but philips guys decided to make a brake through and added a vacuum system that helps to kill that already poor battery!</li>
            <li> For those of you that complained you cannot use it to trim your mustache due to the blue plastic in front of the trimmer blade when you remove the head, there is a simple solution.</li>
            <li> They make lazy trimming far less annoying by vacuuming the majority of clippings into an easily-emptied chamber, and Philips Norelco appears to be making them more solid than previous incarnations.</li>
            <li> I was not happy to find that the prior one failed to hold a charge after a couple of years and the battery could not be easily replaced (not replacable per Norelco).</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older model that had broken (it lasted 5 years).  </li>
            <li> (as I read in other reviews)  </li>
            <li> Cuts hair without pulling and seems to still be as sharp as the day I got it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for past several months and there isn&#x27;t any problem i&#x27;ve faced.</li>
            <li> Not exactly girlfriend-won&#x27;t-notice-well, but</li>
            <li> Well I picked this trimmer based on other reviews and it&#x27;s turned out to be a goodie.  </li>
            <li> One other thing I might mention, is that this trimmer will not trim while it is plugged in.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works well and very little hair escapes it.</li>
            <li> The only thing it&#x27;s missing is a built-in mustache trimmer (the narrow trimmer head), and that&#x27;s the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Of course this is going to make it hard to create the proper suction and air exhaust to do the vacuuming.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that there&#x27;s no stand for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is about an average trimmer.</li>
            <li> and I would say get this plus a tiny Remington trimmer as I feel these are too fat for delicate work.    </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have, and</li>
            <li> The vacuum works well but makes it hard for  close trimming of Mustache.    </li>
            <li> Oh, and some people mentioned the vacuum&#x27;s tip (the part that extends to the blades) blocked the view of the blades which made precision cuts really hard.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that, as others have noted, it cannot be used while plugged in, and when its charge runs down it dies rapidly.</li>
            <li> the down side</li>
            <li> Usually I just blow on the head to get rid of loose hairs</li>
            <li> For years I owned a previous model, the Norelco T860.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a previous generation trimmer I had.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous model for years before the battery gave out.</li>
            <li> The previous iteration had a drawer in which the trimmings were collected.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one and half years ago.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t make a mess.    </li>
            <li> It helps reduce the mess i make whenever i use it</li>
            <li> I always make a mess when in the bathroom trimming.  </li>
            <li> but with a little trial and error, it can be done.  </li>
            <li> The vacumm part could be stronger, but cleaning up just little bit of hair out of the sink beats cleaninig a BUNCH of hair up.</li>
            <li> It may be a little on the bulky side for travel.</li>
            <li> It makes little difference cleaning up a little or a lot hair.</li>
            <li> if you are a little aggressive with pressure as you trim it can slip to a shorter setting and it is a little heavier</li>
            <li> The guide slips a little when using.  </li>
            <li> It will leve a little uneven hair in that area.</li>
            <li> This version has a door that opens and the trimmings fall out - a little messy.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it can be a bit tough to see what you&#x27;re doing because the guard is in front of the blades.  </li>
            <li> If you have very thick layer of beard than only you can use it otherwise you have to remove the holder and use it</li>
            <li> and/or cutting a straight line on the neckline of your beard.</li>
            <li> Those of you who have trouble with it</li>
            <li> I have this Phillips trimmer just one month and few weeks</li>
            <li> If your trimmer batteries are dead it still won&#x27;t run even when plugged in.</li>
            <li> before I simply misplaced it...</li>
            <li> If you have owned this trimmer for a few years, you are probably getting to the end of the life of your trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I charge it less than once a month and have been using this for years!</li>
            <li> No impossibly to clean little hairs all over the sink anymore!</li>
            <li> It is not perfect but it does make trimming facial hair a lot less messy.</li>
            <li> Very weak, only captures about half the cut hair, letting the rest just spill onto my hand and around my sink</li>
            <li> A new blade guard makes it impossible to trim one&#x27;s moustache or touch up other areas.</li>
            <li> but with a little practice it isn&#x27;t hard.  </li>
            <li> Worst instruction was not to charge the unit more than 24 hours neglecting that people forget and may leave it plugged in for days since this is not a unit you need to use every day.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> then some trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually use hair trimmers to trim my beard but tried the Norelco T780.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I&#x27;m merely guessing from one cut to the next.    </li>
            <li> if I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is not very good to trim your beard.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old shaver was as dull as a pencil eraser before I decided to buy another one - it also ate batteries like mad.</li>
            <li> I have to resort to using the (non-vacuuming) trimmer on my razor, or I&#x27;ll have two or three long, uncut hairs just under my nose.</li>
            <li> Philips/Norelco needs a user loop somewhere late in its design process.</li>
            <li> The guard is also designed in such a way that it is really difficult to get that patch under your nose (poor detail control).     </li>
            <li> I have the 770, but this issue would be common to all of these trimmers.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people complained about the trimmer jumping from one trimming length to another.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to attach different clip-on combs to the cutting head.</li>
            <li> --Does not come with smaller cutting blades for mustache trimming.  </li>
            <li> The T780 is not perfect but it does catch about 90% of those pesky little hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this trimmer is it very hard to trim under your nose.</li>
            <li> Also, I couldn&#x27;t get it to happen when I had it against my face because pushing that hard against my face hurt!    </li>
            <li> What if you are older or don&#x27;t see well...it would be impossible and dangerous.  </li>
            <li> Now, for the real complaint:  The plastic packaging was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> so travel pouch is not a great loss.</li>
            <li> I had to get heavy shears to break into it and risked cutting my hands on the shartp edges.</li>
            <li> This is not a great product.</li>
            <li> But I am not happy with vaccum</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace a Norelco trimmer that had failed after approximately 7 years of use.</li>
            <li> I personally hate bases as I have drawers and other storage</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS USELESS.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical before the purchase after I read the reviews</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> -Pathetic battery life: 10 HOURS of charging adds up to only 45 MINUTES of use</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s sort of difficult to trim my mustache under my nose</li>
            <li> The dial adjustment allows for everything from a mere stubble to a well-groomed longer beard or moustache.  </li>
            <li> The trim guides were useless unless you want a 1/4 inch beard or shorter, and had to go over area&#x27;s repeatedly to get this to cut anything.</li>
            <li> My wife always hated when I trimmed my beard because of all them little bitty hairs all over the sink.</li>
            <li> Adjustable cutting length.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.    </li>
            <li> i gave this as a gift to my father because he was in desperate need of a shave.</li>
            <li> The T770 did not let you do that which was inconvenient if it ran out of juice.</li>
            <li> The length of the guide comb makes it almost impossible to trim my mustache.  </li>
            <li> I do not mind this, as it would be nearly impossible for something of this size to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> The bad: this trimmer was designed by people who do not use a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was mostly disappointed with the charging system.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> and it is annoying to fix it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer I have ever bought.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think other reviews peg the good quality of this trimmer very well. The vacuum action get most (but not all) trimmings. The built-in guide depth selection is handy. It&#x27;s light-weight. The only thing it&#x27;s missing is a built-in mustache trimmer (the narrow trimmer head), and that&#x27;s the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The T780 trimmer is a good product. It is not perfect but it does make trimming facial hair a lot less messy. While it does contain most of the trimmings, a few do escape. I would estimate the efficiency of capturing the clippings to be about 90-95%. It cuts easily and predictably with the adjustable head. In fact, its shortest setting is very short; shorter than some other trimmers I&#x27;ve used. Personally I like a narrower head, but the Norelco&#x27;s size isn&#x27;t much of an issue. Battery life is more than adequate.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product. It does what it&#x27;s meant to do. The only thing I wish it did do:    Work with power Cord;   Closer Cut without adjustment top on.    The vacuum in a bear trimmer is a must have.</li>
            <li> I use this razor every 2 weeks. It cuts well and grabs most of the hair. Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Works great, but it does not vacuum every hair, so you still should use above a sink.  Does catch most of them though.  Charge lasts a long time and haven&#x27;t had any problems with the length setttings.  It stays at the setting without slipping. (as I read in other reviews)  Cuts hair without pulling and seems to still be as sharp as the day I got it.  It cuts down on the mess and is much easier to clean up after.</li>
            <li> I have been using simple (aka cheap) hair trimmers for a while. When the battery in my last unit gave up I searched around and found this. This is a great product, trimming is smooth, you don&#x27;t feel anything against the skin. The charger is convenient. The much hyped hair catcher doesn&#x27;t do a good job, which robs it of a star. I use these things at home so travel pouch is not a great loss. Overall I am very satisfied with what I got for $26 and placing repeat order for a gift.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer is a very good product.  I have used other similar products in the past but this is the deluxe version. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had an older version Norelco vacuum trimmer, and this one works much better! There are almost no hairs on the counter when I&#x27;m done trimming. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since the first charge, and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an Andis cordless trimmer that finally pooped out.  This trimmer is fantastic!  Head and shoulders better than the Andis.  The vacuum works great and empties easily.  It even feels good as it draws cool air through your beard.  It is very efficient at getting most all the hairs in its path.  My Andis would miss a lot.  The battery life is fantastic.  I use it every day and I&#x27;m still on the first charge, about three weeks, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer is an excellent trimmer; although using it to trim mustache at the lip line w/o the comb attachment in place does take some getting used to. The vacuum feature is well worth the money!!! My husband loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE PRICE AND GOOD REVIEWS.  THIS PRODUCT IS USELESS.  IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO.  IT SEEMS TO BE \\&quot;WORKING PROPERLY.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This Norelco totally out performs the Conair trimmer I previously owned. The vacuum feature isn&#x27;t perfect but collects enough clippings to make cleanup a snap. I also like the integrated adjustment feature. Only complaint is that there&#x27;s no stand for the trimmer. I&#x27;d suggest that Norelco integrate the charger into a stand.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of years ago. It works OK on my beard, but the guard is too big for my mustache and it makes it really uneven. I like being able to shorten both my beard and mustache during the summer. I&#x27;m going to replace it with another unit.</li>
            <li> Backwards design steps mar an otherwise good trimmer. The good: powerful motor and effective blades do the main job very well. The bad: this trimmer was designed by people who do not use a trimmer. A new blade guard makes it impossible to trim one&#x27;s moustache or touch up other areas. The length dial slips way too easily into a lower setting, and this can make a disaster of an otherwise good morning. Minor negatives: there&#x27;s no travel pouch, and the piece is larger than previous generations. Mostly good: the hair catcher is a GREAT idea--however only about 80% effective. One must still trim before dressing--or end up with hairs on one&#x27;s shirt. The sink, though, fares much better. Philips/Norelco needs a user loop somewhere late in its design process. Some of these problems are simple matters. Last example: the plastic door that holds the clippings inevitably breaks--and there is no replacement. Tape will have to do. Ugh.</li>
            <li> This is about an average trimmer. The previous one I had was a Norelco and it worked better. One problem is that if you break the comb part (which is easy to do and which I did with the old one) then you have a time finding a replacement part and when you do it will cost over $15.00. Those of you who have trouble with it vacuuming properly may be holding it so that your hand is covering the vent holes in the handle. Of course this is going to make it hard to create the proper suction and air exhaust to do the vacuuming. The door for the collection chamber is a pretty flimsy device. The older one I had, had a removable chamber that was much easier to empty.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Great price and the vacuum works great.</li>
            <li> I just received my Norelco T780 to replace a long used older Norelco model.  It took two people 25 minutes with multiple tools to open the double sized bubble packing.  What if you are older or don&#x27;t see well...it would be impossible and dangerous.  Norelco should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. I was a bit skeptical before the purchase after I read the reviews but the trimmer is very good. The issues with trim under nose is almost not an issue. I love that it actually captures trimmed beard and, thus, I don&#x27;t have to bother with cleaning after my self. It provides just the trimming size I wanted - but otherwise it there are 8 other lengths to suit many&#x27;s needs. In addition, to adjust the trimming size you just set it to length you want and don&#x27;t have to bother yourself with managing multiple clippers. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I do like this trimmer. The only bad thing about this trimmer is it very hard to trim under your nose. I tryed to make it work but I cannot find a good way to do it. It will leve a little uneven hair in that area.</li>
            <li> This is alright.   I thought it would be like my previous trimmer but have the vacuum so I don&#x27;t make a mess.    Turns out the vacuum is a great feature but it doesn&#x27;t cut as well as my  beard trimmer.    Overall I use this for a quick trim on an existing beard, but I still use my old plain \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; Norelco for making straight lines around the beard/ears etc.</li>
            <li> This is a very good timmer. Self sharpening blades. Vacuum&#x27;s cut hair. Long lasting charge. Adjustable cutting length. Large size fits well in hand. Cleans easily. Search on internet for the best price.</li>
            <li> HUSBAND WAS NOT OVERLY THRILLED WITH THIS, GOOD FOR A QUICK TOUCH UP, BUT NOT EXCELLENT. DECENT &amp; PROBABLE GOOD FOR TRAVELING SINCE IT IS SLEEK &amp; DOESN&#x27;T TAKE UP TOO MUCH ROOM, BUT WOULD NOT USE AS A MAIN RAZOR.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does what it is susposed to do - trim your beard.  It fits into your hand well and is very easy to use and clean.  The vacuum works well and very little hair escapes it. The length adjustment also is easy to use.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always trimmed my beard with scissors and had to clean up the hair that would fly every where. Not anymore this trimmer works great, not only does it trim my beard with ease it also catches the trimmings. No more mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed.  This thing doesn&#x27;t quite work as advertised.    Pros:  -Sharp blade gives a smooth, uniform cut with fewer strokes  -Convenient adjustable dial eliminates need for different trimmer heads    Cons:  -Vacuum is a complete joke!  Very weak, only captures about half the cut hair, letting the rest just spill onto my hand and around my sink (the vacuum is the freakin&#x27; reason why I bought this thing in the first place)  -Pathetic battery life: 10 HOURS of charging adds up to only 45 MINUTES of use</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an older Norelco trimmer that I&#x27;ve been using for about five years.  This model is a great improvement.  From the door on the hair compartment to the settings, this is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Norelco T780 is attractive, light, fully adjustable and a solid trimmer for the money. I chose this unit after unwisely paying more than list price for the higher model at a local retail chain store. This unit was half the price for basically the same unit. The vacuum feature is a nice idea but it is definitely oversold on this item. It does work, but it will capture HALF of your cuttings while the rest don&#x27;t fly quite as far as without it. You still may need to hold your head close to the wastebasket if you want to keep a spotless bathroom. There is a little double ended brush included that is useful for cleaning out the trap. I was mostly disappointed with the charging system. The unit has one indicator that is on when charging. It doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about if the unit is charged all the way or getting low. You are supposed to keep track of that yourself. Worst instruction was not to charge the unit more than 24 hours neglecting that people forget and may leave it plugged in for days since this is not a unit you need to use every day. It may have been worth a buck or two to include a better charging circuit. This is a decent trimmer. it did a very nice job on my beard, but its performance falls a little short on a couple of key features.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine and is easy to use on my beard.  The vacuum to catch the clippings is an added bonus that is really convenient and works well.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see how long the batteries last before charging---10 trimmings and still going.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for past several months and there isn&#x27;t any problem i&#x27;ve faced. The only issue is you can use this only for trimming i.e, you can&#x27;t trim to size 0.</li>
            <li> Firstly when I opened the box and looked at my new Philips Norelco T780, I could see instantly the build quality is not very good. The comb is made of cheap flimsy plastic, and the general appearance of the trimmer looks very basic, big, almost 1980&#x27;s in design, and in a way, amateur.    However, when I went to use it, the trimmer worked well, and as I have not used a vacuum trimmer before, I was very impressed by this feature.  I hadn&#x27;t liked previous trimmers which left hair all over the sink, and I liked the Norelco T780 was able to retain about 90% of the hair. For this reason I give it 4 stars.    Overall the Philips Norelco T780 has a very cheap build quality, but it does the job of trimming well, and the vacuum does a good job of retaining most of the hair.  If you drop it on a hard floor from a reasonable height, the flimsy plastic comb is likely to break. but if you are careful with it, it may last you a few years.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a joke!   First of all it&#x27;s cordless and it takes a whole lot of energy to run those blades, but philips guys decided to make a brake through and added a vacuum system that helps to kill that already poor battery! Conclusion: either the accumulator should be improved or get rid of the vacuum!  Second, one cannot get a close cut! Min. length that you can get is 2.5 mm , so think twice if it&#x27;s enough for you!  Third, yes it looks good on the picture, but not in reality! It feels really cheap in one&#x27;s hand. At first, I thought that it would be steel or some sort of a solid material, wroooong. Cheap plastic!   Hope it&#x27;s helpful!</li>
            <li> I have this Phillips trimmer just one month and few weeks and so far it works great - very simple, reliable and fits great in hand!  The only thing to charge is that it doesn&#x27;t have any travel pouch and also does a little mess in sink although Phillips advertises NO MESS in sink...  But anyway, great. I would recommend it to everyone who just simply needs to trimm his beard.</li>
            <li> I havent yet had any problems with this trimmer yet. Its works great and the vacuum keeps my sing area clean. It doesnt really get close enough to trim my face but works great every where else. Its also very easy to clean</li>
            <li> As usual great service when buying directly from Amazon.    This review is mostly a comparison to old trimmers I have used such as one that charges on a base and one that runs off 2 AA batteries.    Positives  1. The charger is just a cable that plugs into the bottom. I personally hate bases as I have drawers and other storage and this allows me to pull it out real quick to charge the couple of hours it needs and then I just bundle it up and put it away.  2. The Battery lasts a long time, even with the vacuum this thing just keeps going. Should easily last me a month as I have goatee and mustache versus a full beard.  3. The vacuum does a good job and picks up most hairs so there is minimal cleanup. Usually I just blow on the head to get rid of loose hairs so they don&#x27;t end up in my drawer.  4. The size adjustment is quick and doesn&#x27;t require separate attachments.  5. It gives you a great look, it gives a nice even cut and I will be using this for a few years.    Negatives  1. If your trimmer batteries are dead it still won&#x27;t run even when plugged in. The trimmer turns off the charging port when you press the on button. The more expensive model allows this so it&#x27;s just a up sell not a technical limitation.  2. This device is huge compared to most other trimmers I have tried. For the most part this isn&#x27;t too bad but it&#x27;s sort of difficult to trim my mustache under my nose but with a little practice it isn&#x27;t hard.  3. It can get clogged when doing longer hair as the vacuum is smaller so either cut long hair in two steps or just keep cutting because it still cuts just fine even when the vacuum is clogged..    Overall I compared this to the higher end model that has the smaller trimmer attachment and I would say get this plus a tiny Remington trimmer as I feel these are too fat for delicate work.    UPDATE: I purchased this item June 2009 and gave it a full charge. I trim my mustache and goatee regularly with this and I have not charged it since new and it performs perfectly. In regards to durability, everything works fine and I have no issues with it.  UPDATE (6/15/10): Working like new, I&#x27;ve only charged it like 3 times and I am a hairy guy. Trimming goatee, mustache, and keeping that scruffy look without issues.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older version purchased 5 years ago... the old one finally broke after repeated uses on trimming my husband&#x27;s beard, but only after a couple of accidental drops.  Still just as pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get the one up from this one. I have that one to alot better works alot better to has the turbo on that one last longer I think.</li>
            <li> For years I owned a previous model, the Norelco T860. In fact, I still own it and it works just fine (although it now only holds a charge for about a week). I needed another trimmer for another location, and this one was the upgrade that was available. What a disappointment.    For one thing, it&#x27;s really big. While the T860 was like a small South American banana, the T780 is like a big North American cucumber. Imagine trying to create an intricate drawing with a child&#x27;s crayola instead of a pencil.    The extra size is apparently needed for the internal vacuum. This vacuum \\&quot;works\\&quot; in that it doesn&#x27;t let hairs fall to the sink. But they become forever clogged inside the apparatus; you&#x27;re never going to get them cleaned out, even after opening the flimsy plastic cover. The vacuum also adds to the noise. And my razor doesn&#x27;t have a vacuum, so I&#x27;m going to have to clean up hairs anyway.    The extra girth and the vacuum outlet near the blades means that, as much as I try to cram the thing up under my nose, the blades can&#x27;t reach the hairs at the top of my upper lip. I have to resort to using the (non-vacuuming) trimmer on my razor, or I&#x27;ll have two or three long, uncut hairs just under my nose. And the retractable vacuum cover near the blades obscures the view and turns an agile row of blades into an unwieldy block of plastic.    The only benefit of this model is that the battery works well and it uses a nice color scheme.    I wish I knew where to buy another Norelco T860.    Update 2010-09-20: It turns out that the [[ASIN:B002C741MM Philps Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer]] is apparently the upgrade to the Norelco T860, renamed to a \\&quot;stubble trimmer\\&quot;. Its form is seemingly identical to the T860 and, besides the black/red color and the more grippable rubber coating on the handle, the only major changes seems to be a welcome battery upgrade from a NiCad to a NiMH. The QT4021 is just what I was looking for. I guess I&#x27;ll drop off the T780 at my parents&#x27; house to use as a backup.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, the battery lasts forever, the vacuum works perfectly, easy to clean. I&#x27;ve had older models and different brands, Norelco is still the best for me in trimmers.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I love that you can change the length of the cut. It does a great job of capturing the cut hairs in the receptacle. Also very easy to clean. Well priced too. I recommend this product to anyone in the marked for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Beard trimmer.  (I had purchased my other one nearly 5 years ago and this spring it just died.)  The new on  does the same thing as the old one and so far it is operating fine.  It is the only one that cleans up after you and that is why I got it.  I just hope that the new one lasts more than 5 years given that I use is only about 60 times per year.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this piece of junk twice and neither time did it even attempt to remove any hair. Just this morning I smashed it and threw away the pieces. Do not waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I prefer a shorter trim and so far this trimmer seems to be giving me this on my beard. No pulling or tugging on hairs and easy to use. The suction is a pretty cool feature since you can&#x27;t use it in the shower. A+</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older model that had broken (it lasted 5 years).  The vacuum seems to work well and the settings offer a pretty good range of trimming control.  The only problem I have with it is that it seems that the guard pushes down some beard hairs around the back of my jaw line (near the hinge) and makes them harder to trim.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s excellent and I&#x27;ll continue using it as long as my beard keeps growing!</li>
            <li> This trimmer was designed by someone without facial hair.     About the only thing that works decently is the vacuum feature.     As others have noted (and I foolishly ignored), the guard slips settings when only pressing with moderate force against your face. The only way to not accidently hack holes in your beard is to hang onto the adjustment ring when in use. The guard is also designed in such a way that it is really difficult to get that patch under your nose (poor detail control).     A $15 plug-in is worth more than this thing.</li>
            <li> No need to pay extra for the next step up.  This trimmer is a good value.  The only limitation is my husband has difficulty in trimming near his nose.  The attachment is a bit big for that but with a little trial and error, it can be done.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works well but makes it hard for  close trimming of Mustache.    Product keeps the sink clean.</li>
            <li> Its size takes some getting used to. If you are trying to do some precision cuts you need be extra careful. the blue guard get in the way sometimes and you can&#x27;t see the blades against your skin. Once you master that though it is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> The title says it all.  The vacumm part could be stronger, but cleaning up just little bit of hair out of the sink beats cleaninig a BUNCH of hair up.</li>
            <li> WHEN MY NORELCO T770 QUIT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AFTER MANY MANY YEARS I WENT LOOKING FOR A NEW TRIMMER.   ALL I COULD FIND LOCALLY WERE TRIMMERS THAT HAD ATTACHMENTS THAT YOU SNAP ON.   I WANTED ONE WITH THE DIAL A HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT RIGHT ON THE TRIMMER LIKE THE OLD T770.   SO I GOT ON LINE AND FOUND JUST WHAT I WANTED IN THE NORELCO T780 TRIMMER.   IT HAS MUCH MORE VACUUM POWER THAN THE T770 TRIMMER.   THERE ARE 9 HEIGHT SETTINGS,  I USE #6,7,8 AND 9 THE 4 LONGEST SETTINGS.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE NORELCO T780 IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT TRIMMER.           KEITH   IN FORT SMITH ARKANSAS</li>
            <li> I use this only to trim my full beard and mustache, which is its stated function, and it does an excellent job.  It&#x27;s very easy to adjust for the desired beard length, with no attachments to change, and unlike some reviewers I have never had a problem with it changing settings during use.  It catches 90-95% of the trimmed hairs, even without the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; vacuum on more expensive models, and the trap is easy to empty.  It works quite well without the guard, although if you want to do very detailed trimming you might be better off with a trimmer designed for this.  It holds a charge for about 40 minutes of use, as advertised.  My only complaint is that, as others have noted, it cannot be used while plugged in, and when its charge runs down it dies rapidly.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a previous generation trimmer I had.  I am sure this is the newer, updated model.  The form factor is about the same.  The vacuum power is stronger on this one.  I was perfectly happy with the other that worked great for at least 5 years.  Ultimately, it would no longer hold a charge.  I think these are the best trimmers I have encountered.  To get 5+ years out of one is an exceptional value.  I have no reason to believe that this one won&#x27;t last just as long. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This shaver does the job very quickly and very clean.  It&#x27;s not the quietest shaver because of the vacuum, but there&#x27;s no hair in the sink to clean up when done.  I really wish it would have a small pop up trimmer, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  The actual blade can work as a trimmer for longer lines, but you can&#x27;t get the small, precise cuts with it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the price, delivery, and performance.  I had a lesser Norelco previously and the vacuum addition is very nice.  Amazon handled it very well and I have since purchased an electric razor from Amazon!  Gary in Ohio.</li>
            <li> I just got this trimmer, charged it up and voila - trimmed my beard and my head in 5 minutes without and clippings in or on the sink, floor or me. I never saw a vacuum trimmer before - glad I found this one. A great gadget that actually works.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older Norlelco (5 years old) with this one and this is a very similar model, which is a good thing.  Works well and holds a charge a long time.  Price is good for the job that you want done.</li>
            <li> Hey, this beard trimmer works great. No impossibly to clean little hairs all over the sink anymore! I am also impressed with the overall build quality and with the end result of what my stubble beard looks like after using it. Without doubt the best trimmer I have ever owned.  I have had it about five weeks now and it is still running on it&#x27;s initial charge eventhough I use it 3 times a week.     Two minor complaints:   1) I wish it had some kind of stand so it would be neatly propped up on the vanity where I use it.  2) It may be a little on the bulky side for travel. If Norelco makes something similar a little smaller, and with a little travel bag plus charger, then let me know.</li>
            <li> I miss my old Norelco Trimmer for it&#x27;s REMOVABLE collection tray.  Otherwise, it works very well.  The tray swings open, but it is not detachable.  The trimmer does not lose cutting positions if you press against your face too hard, so that&#x27;s a good thing too.  For the price I paid, I feel this is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is the second Norelco I have had and it works great for the money.  Vacuum lacks some but I didn&#x27;t buy it because of that - that was a perk.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using the inexpensive Wahls for years.  I love it for several reasons: &lt;br /&gt;1) It cuts without pulling on your whiskers &lt;br /&gt;2) It is very precise &lt;br /&gt;3) It picks up 90% or more of your whiskers &lt;br /&gt;4) Not only do you not have the hair in the sink, but you no longer feel like it will take a shower to get all of the excess hair out of your beard, if there is any to speak of &lt;br /&gt;5) Unlike others, I did not feel the need to have a more precision tool to trim my mustache.  It worked just fine</li>
            <li> I have the 770, but this issue would be common to all of these trimmers.  Shaves okay.  Problem:  eco-unfriendly.  Battery contains toxic materials and company does little to assure that people eventually dispose of it properly--Norelco  officially tells you somewhere in the literature to take the trimmer to a recycling place, but by the time anyone&#x27;s ready to replace the thing they won&#x27;t know where the literature is telling them that, and besides, Norelco doesn&#x27;t really provide any support for doing so:  no address or contact info, even.  Since there&#x27;s little help or encouragement taking care of the battery responsibly, I&#x27;m sure­ most people don&#x27;t.  Thanks Norelco!  :(  Still, i&#x27;m unaware of better alternatives and would be interested to learn of any.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a replacement for my T970 because the T970&#x27;s rechargeable battery was no longer holding the charge. This is a great product for maintaining my beard. And once you have a beard trimmer with a vacuum function, you will not want to go back to one without it. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5*&#x27;s is because it did not come with the additional smaller trimmer head that came with my T970. But the one from my T970 works with my new T780 so I am happy. This smaller trimmer head is good for trimming the hair around my ears, inside my ears and also to trim nose hair.</li>
            <li> I had a previous model for years before the battery gave out. I loved it. That model was discontinued so I had to go with the new version. I love this one too. It is well constructed and has a built in container that catches the clippings, not a necessity but its there so I use it. Not a miracle product but does what its suppose to do and does it well. Lots of settings for closeness. If the battery holds and I get another 4-5 years out of this, then its a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Product two steps up from great grand child I used for 11 years!  Darn near the same price.  Was delivered before time promised and it really does pick up most of the uck that wife complained about with old model.  charge lasts much longer, and has much better cutting ability with less pull...</li>
            <li> A lot of people complained about the trimmer jumping from one trimming length to another.  I tested this out and I can only get this to happen when i push really hard (hard enough that it felt like was going to break if i put any more oomph behind it).  Also, I couldn&#x27;t get it to happen when I had it against my face because pushing that hard against my face hurt!    The vacuum seems to suck up 90-95% of the hair which makes cleanup a breeze.    Oh, and some people mentioned the vacuum&#x27;s tip (the part that extends to the blades) blocked the view of the blades which made precision cuts really hard.  While this is true, the vacuum&#x27;s tip is retractable so all i have to do is hold it so that one of my fingers can pull back the vacuum&#x27;s tip while i make the precision cuts (which is a lot more comfortable then it may sound).    So all in all I&#x27;m very pleased with the razor and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product looks good in picture but not the best when used. Battery life is good enough but its trimming adjustments are not fine enough. The holder attached does not allow you to trim when your hair are not too much grown. If you have very thick layer of beard than only you can use it otherwise you have to remove the holder and use it and in this case it will work as a shaver which some people does not like , like me.........</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my prior Norelco trimmer and works about as well. I was not happy to find that the prior one failed to hold a charge after a couple of years and the battery could not be easily replaced (not replacable per Norelco). Thus, I face the same fate with this one but have not found another that collects the whiskers (mostly) and thereby minimizes the mess. [Addendum to review two years later. Now it makes a sound like a piece of metal is floating loosely inside and grating against moving parts but it still works just fine.]</li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty solid. The vacuum chamber doesn&#x27;t pick up everything (still get some little beard hairs on the sink) but honestly it works a lot better than I expected it to. It has lots of height settings that are easily adjustable and it cuts really well. I&#x27;m glad I got this one and didn&#x27;t spring for the more expensive model, which I thought about doing.</li>
            <li> Much like the other 1star reviews i have to say the following:  1) it took ages to open the packaging and i tore my hands on the plastic while trying to do so.  2) the vacuum kept getting clogged and there was still hair all over my sink.  3) the trim was not easy, nor smooth, nor close enough.  4) the battery has died on me, no more than 2 months after first using it.  no matter how long i charge it for it wont work for more than 5 seconds at time.  and since it wont work while plugged in....    Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> I replaced my T770 model after the battery died for good.  The T770 did a fair job of trimming and a terrible job of collecting the hair via the vacuum missing a good 30% of the hair.    This model is much better at the main job which is trimming the beard.  It is very precise and trims the hair effortlessly.    The vacuum feature is improved and only misses about 10% of the hair now. However, it seems that if you are going to have to clean up any hair why bother with a vacuum feature at all.  Cleaning up is cleaning up. It makes little difference cleaning up a little or a lot hair.</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco T780 is an excellent value and performs quietly and effortlessly.  The vacuum device works very well removing stubble and storing it in an easy-to-remove chamber. The dial adjustment allows for everything from a mere stubble to a well-groomed longer beard or moustache.  I purchased this for $25.00 on Amazon with free shipping and it sells at WalMart for $56.00.  Highly recommended after thirty days of use.</li>
            <li> I really like the easily adjustable depth comb.  You don&#x27;t have to attach different clip-on combs to the cutting head. I also like the built-in vacuum, which really works quite well.</li>
            <li> This unit does a good job on my beard.  It catches most of the trimmings.  The length of the guide comb makes it almost impossible to trim my mustache.  Had I known, I would have sprung for the more expensive unit which includes a mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature of the trimer is fantastic compared to the older models which shot trimmings out all over the sink area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only draw backs are no travel pouch is included and no specialty mini trimmer included with the T780. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great trimmer for trimming large areas or large amounts of hair i.e, winter to summer beard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too large to get in to smaller areas or to use to do detailed trimming  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recommend the T980 which comes with the Mini trimmer and travel pouch if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> I basically like the trim it gives most of my beard, and the vacuum works well. However, there&#x27;s a plastic guard (I assume related to the vacuum) that makes it difficult to do close work, like trimming the moustache above the lip, or removing fine hairs on the upper cheek or side of the neck that you wouldn&#x27;t want to shave. So if you get it I would recommend a second device for those areas, or if you have hairy ears or a unibrow.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to be able to trim my beard but I think this is really designed to cut hair etc. The battery life if mediocre and the chamber gets full really easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is not very good to trim your beard. If anything, its good to shorten the length of your beard but is still patchy, and you need a manual razor to clean up your shave.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s better than a trimmer, with a vacum to prevent the hair from ending up on your counter and all over the place? Easy to see when it&#x27;s full dump in the rubbish and your off. Recomend you all get one!</li>
            <li> As several other reviewers have noted, the vacuum feature is only so-so. However, the trimmer works great and provides an excellent range of lengths to choose from. The top is also removable for a close trim or edge trimming of sideburns or a long mustache.</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer I have ever bought.  It takes twice as long a others because the hair gets stuck in the vacuum so you keep having to empty it out and then clean it.    DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.    Steve</li>
            <li> I grew my beard 7 months ago and I was having a real problem keeping it trimmed. I was using my Remington Trimmer, but I couldn&#x27;t keep the hair length uniform. I read the reviews for this trimmer and it works just as advertised - the adjustable lengths keep the beard uniform and the vacuum keeps both my face, neck and the bathroom countertop free from the cut hairs.    Additionally, as I am bald, I use it to keep remaining hair on my head trimmed. It is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily to trim my mustache.  It does not work well for that purpose.  The design of this unit with the vaccuum feature prevents you from seeing what you are trimming.  For shaving a beard, I imagine it would work fine.  I gave the razor to someone who uses it to shave their head and they like it.</li>
            <li> I used an older version of this trimmer for years.  This one was much cheaper than the original.  It appears to be better constructed and with the exception of the vacuum collection tray, it is even better than the first.  The previous iteration had a drawer in which the trimmings were collected.  This version has a door that opens and the trimmings fall out - a little messy.</li>
            <li> great trimmer. only downside it does not have a stand or stand on its own as my last one did</li>
            <li> i gave this as a gift to my father because he was in desperate need of a shave. He used it and then declared it was the best gift he got for christmas.</li>
            <li> It doesnt&#x27; work as well as it says. I have to empty it every couple of minutes cause hair gets stuck and doesn&#x27;t work. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t suck at all, all the hair gets stuck at the blade. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have put off reveiuing this trimmer until I have had it long enough to make a qualified call. I have found it to be better than the previous model in the fact that tht vacum feature allowes me to get completely dressed before shaving. and the battery holds a good charge. The only problem I have so far is shaving around my nose with the vacum there. but I am learning more how to do it and feel that it can work that out.  So I am very pleased with the vacum feature and the fact that you can clean it (I use a small pant brush) after every few uses.  Also the way it maintains it&#x27;s charge.  I also found in my search for my replacement for the previous Norelco model that Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps a good charge.  Much better than corded versions and the vacuum function really works!</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this trimmer.  It is of sturdy construction and excellent design.  One charge last a long time.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco vacuum trimmers are the only ones of their kind that I know of, so if this sort of thing interests you, you&#x27;re looking at just about your only option. They make lazy trimming far less annoying by vacuuming the majority of clippings into an easily-emptied chamber, and Philips Norelco appears to be making them more solid than previous incarnations.</li>
            <li> It really does dramatically cut down on &#x27;clean up time&#x27; by vacuuming the hair.  Its powerful too.  The only downside is that it can be a bit tough to see what you&#x27;re doing because the guard is in front of the blades.  Otherwise its great.</li>
            <li> This Norelco beard trimmer is really great. It is quiet and light and does an excellent trimming job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard for nine years now, and this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had yet. I had an old Norelco T7500 for my first trimmer that worked great, but this is even better. It has the smooth cutting action of the T7500, but with the addition of the vacuum system.     I was skeptical of the vacuum at first since I had a Braun trimmer where the vacuum feature wasn&#x27;t worth a damn, but this works a lot better. Plus, the cutting performance and the feel in my hand are a lot better than with the Braun.     Great trimmer, get it already!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer!  Works great.  The vacuum part of the trimmer catches all of the hair with no problem.  The only negative is that it is a little loud.  I would buy this trimmer again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Seems to be a good trimmer and the vacuum system works well, making cleanup easier and keeping the trimmings from fouling the blades.  Good battery life between chargings, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my 16 year old son who&#x27;s new found beard was looking a bit on the scraggly side! Since starting to use it, I am thrilled with his short-clipped and clean appearance. For you Moms looking for a similar type gift for your sons, I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old shaver was as dull as a pencil eraser before I decided to buy another one - it also ate batteries like mad. Apparently, fancy hair vacuuming technology has arrived during my absence. Go figure. It actually works pretty well. Not exactly girlfriend-won&#x27;t-notice-well, but it might help your sink not look like the floor of a mini-barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would nice if the \\&quot;precision zoom lock\\&quot; adjustment locked a little more securely.</li>
            <li> The performance of the Norelco T780 is adequate, but not as powerful as an older Norelco trimmer it replaced.  I must go over my beard several time to get a uniform trim.    Now, for the real complaint:  The plastic packaging was ridiculous.  I had to get heavy shears to break into it and risked cutting my hands on the shartp edges.</li>
            <li> I have a goatee and bought this trimmer to keep it groomed.  It works well enough, but the trimmer is very large and may work better for someone with a full beard.  It isn&#x27;t well suited for fine trimming at the edge of the goatee.  It does vacuum up the hairs well as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great performance while it works. Died on me about a month and a half after buying,not sure what&#x27;s wrong with it... light says it&#x27;s charging but nothing comes on when i turn it on. This is my second Norelco product and both now have done the same thing. Only difference is that the other one lasted a lot longer.</li>
            <li> stopped working after 3 month</li>
            <li> My old Norelco beard trimmer&#x27;s battery gave up and I chose the T780 as replacement after reading reviews. The old one was really good but this one is much better! Ergonomics are improved, height granularity of 9 is an improvement over the old one, but the thing I like best is the vacuum.It really works and prevents the proliferation of little whiskers all over the bathroom counter. As usual with Amazon, the buying experience was smooth and quick as was delivery.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the value of this product.  Blades remain sharp, stays charged for a very long time.  Looking forward to see how it holds up in the years to come.</li>
            <li> My wife always hated when I trimmed my beard because of all them little bitty hairs all over the sink. The T780 is not perfect but it does catch about 90% of those pesky little hairs. The trimmer is powerful and has no trouble with my dense beard. The batteries last a good long while between recharges. &lt;br /&gt;On the down side if you are a little aggressive with pressure as you trim it can slip to a shorter setting and it is a little heavier then some trimmers I have used in the past. All in all though it is a well designed trimmer that I enjoy using.</li>
            <li> Two things about this trimmer. I leave it plugged in most of the time unlike my last trimmer (older model Norelco) that had a holder/battery charger that teetered and fell over alot. The best feature is the nifty holder for the cut hair. It collects neatly in a little compartment-hey, my wife is happy no more hair to clean off the sink.</li>
            <li> I had an old norelco trimmer. Lost it in a car accident [no!! I wasn&#x27;t trimming anything (:p), I just lost my toiletry kit]. Anyway, now I use this one. So far it&#x27;s good. The vacuum feature is nice. Even though the vacuum power is not that strong, still it works. Better than not having it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer portion of this product is very good. The so called vacuum is loud and suction is weak.  For the noise it makes their shouldn&#x27;t be any hair in the sink. I&#x27;m sure they will improve this product.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me I have had maybe 5 norelco trimmers in the past, this one by far is the fastest one I have owned, cuts even,and like all the other ones, I&#x27;ve had, it would probably slip to a lower setting if too much pressure was applied but I figure it is my face why do I want to bush hog it, so I have always used slight pressure using a trimmer, vacuum does a decent job (clean the filter screen each use), especially if you use it everyday,  my old one was broken and I was waiting for this one so my beard got a little longer than normal, the vacuum left some clippings on the sink, it didn&#x27;t do as well as it did using it the 2nd time ,I didn&#x27;t see any lil clippings after the 2nd trimming on the sink a few on my chest though I like the lil door that slides out so it will pickup the clippings when you pop the beard trimmer off and use the mustache trimmer I like the size my old one was too small for big hands to hold securely this one fits my hand</li>
            <li> This is not a great product. The first one i had was broken on arrival. I had to order a new one. It&#x27;s not a good trimmer. it&#x27;s ok for long hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fine trimmer.  Powerful, easy to adjust.  The vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t suck up everything, but it&#x27;s a big improvement over nothing!  I previously had another Norelco and very impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is too big and bulky to work well.  The guide slips a little when using.  When not using the guide it is difficult to use accurately because of the angle and the size.  I sent this one back and bought my old one (T765).  Although it doesn&#x27;t have the vacuum function it is small enough to work much better.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace the \\&quot;Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer\\&quot; which died after about 6 or 7 years. not bad,       and sent it back.  the vacuum gets in the way of Mustache trimming and general clean up.I got another Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer. its cheaper and does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Was doin decent job likeother Norelco. But I am not happy with vaccum functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually its not possible to trim and vacumm each single hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it works good.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase and the 3rd Norelco trimmer I have owned. It was priced right and trims perfectly with multiple settings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The vacuum feature of the trimer is fantastic compared to the older  models which shot trimmings out all over the sink area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only draw back is no travel pouch is included like my older models, but it fit in the older model pouch which I did not throw out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 different trimmers, and by far this is the best, It trims precise and accurate. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I usually use hair trimmers to trim my beard but tried the Norelco T780.  The trim guides were useless unless you want a 1/4 inch beard or shorter, and had to go over area&#x27;s repeatedly to get this to cut anything.</li>
            <li> The vacuum part is a waste of time,there&#x27;s always hair all over the counter, other than that it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Norelco T780 is a great trimmer.  With 9 settings, it can make your beard the exact length that you prefer.  The vacuum feature works fairly well, but don&#x27;t expect perfection, as some hairs will sneak out.  It has all the basic features you would need in a trimmer, but if price is no object, consider the T980.  Both trimmers have the same experience (you will get the same results) but the T980 has the cool bells and whistles that you may crave (faster charge time, low battery indicator, travel case, etc.)  Either way you can&#x27;t lose with this consistent product.</li>
            <li> this puppy worked great for several years, but is nearing the end. I really liked the part that collects beard trimmings. It helps reduce the mess i make whenever i use it</li>
            <li> Works good on my beard but is a little bulky for my mustache trimming although it does get it done with some effort without the guard.  The vacuum part catches about 90% of the clipping so it makes clean-up much easier.  This was a good purchase so I&#x27;ll probably get one for my son-in-law as a Christmas gift.  The battery lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> I actually owned this trimmer a few years back, before  all the fancy chrome and other plastic embellishments on the body of the trimmer (which in turn gave Norelco an excuse to bump up the price by about $10). This new trimmer preforms just as good as the earlier model. By far the two most useful features are the adjustable built in length dial which negates any separate length accessories, and the vacuum, which does seem to be stronger than the one on the earlier model.   I have tried a couple of other trimmer before (re)buying this one, but they either came with half a pound of extra accessories, the blade became dull on them real fast or the rechargeable battery died in just a few months (despite charging it as per instructions).  One complaint for this new version is that the plastic trimming collector for the vacuum cannot be removed as in the earlier model. This is a minor issue, but I think the removable trimming container was easier to clean.   There are two other even more expensive models, one is the T1000, which has a liquid mimetic-adhesive liquid alloy skin and can shapeshift and replicate and kill the user it comes in contact with, the other is the the T980, which has an even fancier body and claimed to have \\&quot;turbo power\\&quot; for those who need the best gadget. In my opinion this T780 does a great job now, and I am just as happy with it now as I was a few years back.  The convenience, reliability (I had the earlier one for at least 3 years), and performance of this trimmer is far above the other brands.   (Avoid the deadly T1000, they went a little too far with the technology!)</li>
            <li> i was very pleased with my trimmer. the instructions were straight forward. it is easy to use and easy to keep clean. i reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but if you cut your hair short, it will leave hair lines.  The vacuum part is decent, but nothing to write home about.  The vacuum picks up about 70% of my hair, but maybe different for others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it&#x27;s predecessor (T770) for years and it has always worked great. This one has several improvements. The hair collection compartment swings out rather than having to take it out. It&#x27;s better because sometimes I would drop it when I tried to get the hair out. The biggest improvement is that you can now use it while it&#x27;s plugged in. The T770 did not let you do that which was inconvenient if it ran out of juice. The vacuum makes this trimmer the best there is. Since I have used this type of trimmer, then I couldn&#x27;t go back to using one without a vacuum. It&#x27;s a great product for any part of the body.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco trimmer for a number of years and was very happy with it. The T780 works OK and I really like the vacuum concept.    What I DON&#x27;T like is, the adjustment ring does not come with any marking to show the relative depth of cut. Thus, I&#x27;m merely guessing from one cut to the next.    Also note (and this is not part of my rating), when you use Super Saver Shipping, they sit on the order for a week before they ship, so don&#x27;t select it if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no mess, batery life seems ok (only used it for a couple of weeks, the setting function works great... So far there is nothing I would change on this product, but I am not a heavy user, only use it once or twice per week to keep body hair in check.</li>
            <li> I am comparing this with a T-980 I have owned for several years &amp; am very pleased with.  Pros:  --The on/off switch is a slider which will not turn on in your suitcase like the push button switch of the T-980.  --The hair length selector is better designed to prevent accidental movement during use.  --The charger is smaller/more compact.  Cons:  --Cannot be used with 110 charger when fully discharged (must be charged up, then used).  --Charge indicator light does not flash when fully charged possibly leading to reduced battery life.  --Does not come with smaller cutting blades for mustache trimming.  --Does not come with storage bag or lubricant.  --Does not have \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; function (which I never used anyway &amp; is unnecesary)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard since 1982.  I&#x27;ve always kept it perfectly trimmed.  I bought the older model of this trimmer in 1999. It actually still works, but the battery doesn&#x27;t hold as good a change, the blades are only a little dull and it&#x27;s been dropped over the years (still looks good though). I love the fact that it&#x27;s cordless and the battery is very strong. I trim my beard once a week and I&#x27;ve only charged this once (used it about 5 times, so far). So when I saw this one for sale with free shipping, it was a no brainer.  Performs perfectly and I highly recommend it. And it&#x27;s made and laid out better then the older model.  The only negitive I would say is that the company no longer provides a storage bag to keep it in, so I just switched it over from the old one (which I kept in case of emergency). You may ask yourself \\&quot;a beard emergency\\&quot; well, if I had to go out and forgot to charge the unit (As I said above \\&quot;perfectly trimmed\\&quot;). I don&#x27;t want to look like a bum ya know!!</li>
            <li> My son-in-law was really pleased with all the extra features with this product: Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer. The vacuum is a real plus (keeps hair out of the sink); it&#x27;s rechargeable; the container that catches the hair is very easy to remove and empty. He gives it a \\&quot;Thumbs Up\\&quot;. Highly recommend for that special guy for the Holidays.</li>
            <li> really good stuff.  the only reason I don&#x27;t give it full stars is because there is still a small amount of hair that doesn&#x27;t get sucked in.  it still kicks [...].</li>
            <li> This is very good in and smooth in use. dint feel to scratch the skin. also it is light weight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace a Norelco trimmer that had failed after approximately 7 years of use. I was surprised to read so many conflicting reviews, so I purchased it knowing I could send it back if I was not satisfied. I am very pleased with the product. Some people have reported the trimmer does not stay on the setting selected, causing it to gouge your beard. Prior to my first use, I attempted to put extreme pressure on the guide while pressing it to my chest. (Better to cause a gouge in chest hair then my beard) I am happy to report it works perfectly, with no problems. The battery holds a charge for a long time, and the vacuum works very well. For those of you that complained you cannot use it to trim your mustache due to the blue plastic in front of the trimmer blade when you remove the head, there is a simple solution. If you place a piece of cellophane tape on the retractable blue plastic protector, the trimmer blade is exposed making it easy to use for trimming your mustache and/or cutting a straight line on the neckline of your beard. I find this trimmer worth every penny and has operated flawlessly for the last year.</li>
            <li> Well I picked this trimmer based on other reviews and it&#x27;s turned out to be a goodie.  This is my first trimmer and I am very happy with it.  The battery life seems to last a long time, I used it twice a week for 2 months and it was going fine but I had to recharge it as I went overseas for 2 weeks.  This is the only negative point for me, it only works on US voltage.</li>
            <li> I bought this one and half years ago. Quality has been very good. It never gave me a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it was drowned in water for long time which i didn&#x27;t notice. I didn&#x27;t try to switch on cz I know it will blow off if i do that. So I dried it for 3 Complete days. Surprisingly it worked.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer because one of their earlier, humbler trimmer was great...I used that for about 8 years (4 in India) before I simply misplaced it...so needing a new one.    But this new one is rather wimpy in function...especially on a good length beard...and the vacuum is largely cosmetic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco trimmer before and was very satisfied and so had no problems buying this one.  However the vacuum no longer works as well as when I first got it (a few months ago) and the adjustable setting slips from one setting to another.....very disconcerting when it slips from a &#x27;3&#x27; or a &#x27;2&#x27; down to a &#x27;1&#x27;.  My original Norelco never had that problem and I&#x27;m stumped why this product would be a step backward.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I was a bit doubtful about how well the vacuum was going to work.  But the vacuum is awesome, I have a full beard and I can trim the whole thing with minimal whiskers on the couter top.  Not having to hear the wife complain about the mess from the whiskers is worth the price of this trimmer.  The only complaint I have, and I am starting to get used to it, is triming my mustache without the depth guide is challenging due to the little floating shield that helps the vacuum work so well.  Regardless of this little issue I would happily buy the trimmer again and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> So let me start off by telling you how I use this trimmer. I have very short hair, and about once a month, I will set the trimmer on the longest length setting and just trim my entire head: beard, moustache, hair, and even eyebrows.    I had never heard of a vacuum on a trimmer before this, and I thought, well that sounds allright, although I had already solved the problem of the mess by simply trimming outside with a handheld mirror.    The vacuum is very easily clogged when trimming, perhaps because I wait too long between uses, but that is how I use it. I don&#x27;t want to trim up every single week. That&#x27;s one of the reasons I have a beard in the first place. Once the vacuum clogs, you must stop the trimmer, remove the length adjuster thingy, and clear all the hair from the sliding vacuum trap door thingy. This happens so often that there is rarely any hair in the receptacle because it all gets trapped in the vacuum orifice.    Another problem, which is exacerbated by the need to frequently remove it, is the fact the the length adjuster does not fit easily and firmly in place. I often put it back on and start trimming, thinking it is in place, and it slides down, not from pressure, but because it wasn&#x27;t locked into the grooves to begin with, even though it felt like it was. So just about every time I use it, I end up with a patch of extra short hair somewhere on my head.    One other thing I might mention, is that this trimmer will not trim while it is plugged in. You had better make sure you have enough juice in the battery to do the job before you start, or you will arrive either late or half-trimmed. I discovered this fact on Valentine&#x27;s Day. Luckily my girl thought I looked cute with multiple length hairs sticking up in all directions.    These problems, combined with the fact that I really miss the smaller extendable moustache blade from my old trimmer (which was also nice for trimming around the ears), will lead me to not buy this, or any other vacuum-equippedtrimmer in the future. In fact, I may end up just sending this one over to Goodwill in the near future.    All these issues may not be a problem if you like to trim more regularly. But this model is not for me.</li>
            <li> I thought the cool thing about this trimmer was the vacuum part... I always make a mess when in the bathroom trimming.  Well, the vacuum part worked for about 2 weeks.  Now it still make the vacuuming sound, but it doesn&#x27;t suck up half of the hair being trimmed.  The unit also is fully metal&#x3D;looking plastic, so it probably will break sooner than later.</li>
            <li> I have only good things to say about the trimmer. It meets all of my needs. I am very satisfied with the trimmer and service.    Thank You</li>
            <li> This is the third,  of this product I have owned. The price is excellent,and the performance is very good but somehow my dog developed a taste for the trimming head and he destroyed the  first two.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a better than adequate job of trimming.  The variable setting feature is easy to use and effective.  The unit is considerably larger than most competitors, and this is a bit of a disadvantage.  Also,  the vacuum does not get all clippings, so count of beard trimmings on your counter, in your sink, etc.; not bad but not up to advertising.  Certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you have owned this trimmer for a few years, you are probably getting to the end of the life of your trimmer.  I hate that Norelco makes great trimmers that you can not replace the batteries yourself and thus have to throw them away and buy a new one.  If you have an AC adapter that you are no longer using, please sell or give it to me as my trimmer still works, but my charger has died.  Thanks for looking.  Please just comment on this review and I&#x27;ll contact you.    Cheers,  Jim</li>
            <li> This is a REALLY nice trimmer.  The only things I would change is the plastic on/off switch (I&#x27;m sure this will break one day) and the ability to use it when plugged in (if the battery runs down, you have to wait for it to charge- you can&#x27;t use it if the battery is empty and it&#x27;s plugged into the wall).  Also, it would be nice if there was a light to show you when it&#x27;s fully charged- but that&#x27;s not really critical.  The important thing is that it works REALLY well..</li>
            <li> I love the power and design but sometimes the comb level changer gets stuck and it is annoying to fix it. Overall - Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for over a month, and have no problems with it. It does what it&#x27;s meant to do: trims my beard. I had an older Norelco trimmer prior to owning this one, which did not have the vacuum functionality. The vacuum does pick up most of the hair, but when I grow my beard for a week, some of it does end up in the sink. I do not mind this, as it would be nearly impossible for something of this size to get all the hair. What I like is that it&#x27;s kept to a minimum. One annoyance that I have is the plastic slide in front of the blade (which aids in funneling the hair into the vacuum) sometimes disrupts longer hair from getting cut. So I tend to do a bit of back and forth with longer areas to trim them properly. Also, I do not believe you cannot trim while it&#x27;s charging. Not a bit deal though. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a fine trimmer, and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works reasonably well. It has a neat adjustable height mechanism and the vacuum suction feature collects your hair trimmings. It  really does minimize any mess.</li>
            <li> This Brand/Style Razor is far my favorite. I have had two of these over the past 10 years and no other razor compares. The charge it holds is unparalleled.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, never any mess and the battery lasts forever. I charge it less than once a month and have been using this for years!</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer !! its been 3 yrs and I never had a problem..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it got totally wet and I dried it for like 2 days and charged it and works so very perfect !!</li>
