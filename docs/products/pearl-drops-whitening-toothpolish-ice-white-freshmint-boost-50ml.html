            <li>My teeth don&#x27;t even feel smooth after I brush.</li>
            <li>and I prefer them to some of the currently available whitening toothpastes available to me.  </li>
            <li>i like this product because it makes your teeth so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was no longer available.  </li>

            <li>I really enjoy this&lt;</li>
            <li>Not as good as the old pearl drops I remember in the USA.</li>
            <li>I wish it was the original, where can I get it from?</li>

            <li>I have used pearl drops since a teen and always received great compliments on my smile...</li>
            <li>My teeth do not feel as clean as before.</li>

            <li>I have tried several on here and all were good.</li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly; the end result of using pearl drops whitening fluoride is exactly as it states...whitening.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it any more around my area I live.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to do of course is FLOSS daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a regular spearmint toothpaste and isn&#x27;t like the original Pearl Drops that I remember.  </li>
            <li>Not as much silica as the original</li>
            <li>It arrived right on time</li>
            <li>My teeth stay plaque free much longer and much whiter.</li>
            <li>This is the first time we tried the &amp;#34;Freshmint&amp;#34; flavor.  </li>
            <li>Love this product -- I&#x27;ve used it for forty years, and my dentists have always complimented me on my white teeth.</li>
            <li>and i mean years later this product is the best yet!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the US in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I build plaque easily because I salivate a lot, according to several dentists.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like mint</li>
            <li>Pearl Drops gently polish your teeth</li>
            <li>They work really well and don&#x27;t cause any negatives..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Absolutely I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much, gail</li>
            <li>I really like Pearl Drops Toothpaste hahaha.</li>
            <li>I loved the fresh polished feeling my teeth have after using this product, but have not able to find it for several years.  </li>
            <li>I live this tooth polish!</li>
            <li>particularly the upside-down bottle.  </li>
            <li>so I was lucky enough to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Not too strong tasting, and I&#x27;m not allergic to it like some other pastes.  </li>
            <li>but it doesnt have much foaming action</li>
            <li>again my smile is back to what it was when I received all those compliments...</li>
            <li>and they are very watered down, don&#x27;t clean as well as they used to.</li>
            <li>The top gets a little messy but it is easy to wipe away the residual.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without my pearldrops.</li>
            <li>This last batch seems more watery than past purchases, it runs off the toothbrush right away.</li>
            <li>Took a long time but worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a daily toothpaste and does not remove the fuzzy feeling from your teeth any more than any other toothpaste, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to whiten.  </li>
            <li>I knew I wasn&#x27;t crazy, lol.  </li>
            <li>I have used Pearl Drops since they first came on the market (a long time) and have no problems with the product.</li>
            <li>I remember my mother buying this when I was young</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so disappointed that Pearl Drops are no longer available in the US, since I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it!  </li>
            <li>Brush your teeth with Pearl Drops everyday in morning to retain whiteness and clean look.</li>
            <li>i had this a long time ago and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>Unlike so many products that change for the worse over time...</li>
            <li>The product works fine, but is not good for in my travel bag.  </li>
            <li>It did take a long time to ship since it comes from the UK - so order early.</li>
            <li>I happen to like this toothpaste - it is not a thick as other toothpastes.</li>

            <li> I loved the fresh polished feeling my teeth have after using this product, but have not able to find it for several years.  </li>
            <li> I live this tooth polish!</li>
            <li> particularly the upside-down bottle.  </li>
            <li> so I was lucky enough to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Not too strong tasting, and I&#x27;m not allergic to it like some other pastes.  </li>
            <li> but it doesnt have much foaming action</li>
            <li> again my smile is back to what it was when I received all those compliments...</li>
            <li> and they are very watered down, don&#x27;t clean as well as they used to.</li>
            <li> The top gets a little messy but it is easy to wipe away the residual.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my pearldrops.</li>
            <li> This last batch seems more watery than past purchases, it runs off the toothbrush right away.</li>
            <li> Took a long time but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a daily toothpaste and does not remove the fuzzy feeling from your teeth any more than any other toothpaste, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to whiten.  </li>
            <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t crazy, lol.  </li>
            <li> I have used Pearl Drops since they first came on the market (a long time) and have no problems with the product.</li>
            <li> I remember my mother buying this when I was young</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so disappointed that Pearl Drops are no longer available in the US, since I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it!  </li>
            <li> Brush your teeth with Pearl Drops everyday in morning to retain whiteness and clean look.</li>
            <li> i had this a long time ago and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> Unlike so many products that change for the worse over time...</li>
            <li> The product works fine, but is not good for in my travel bag.  </li>
            <li> It did take a long time to ship since it comes from the UK - so order early.</li>
            <li> I happen to like this toothpaste - it is not a thick as other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the old pearl drops tooth polish from a few years back</li>
            <li> I searched for this a long time and was trilled when I found it.</li>
            <li> I plan to use it as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> This product is not new to me</li>
            <li> the only thing is if you put it upside down the bottle eventually leaks.</li>
            <li> then for some unknown reason it disappeared off the store shelves...</li>
            <li> Seemed a little watered down since I last purchased Pearldrops tooth polish.</li>
            <li> This product has no flavor, much less a freshmint flavor.</li>
            <li> This particular one is LITTERED with them!&lt;br /&gt;How to spot fake reviews:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> The more fakes you find, the more cruddy the product probably is.&lt;br /&gt;Companies do this because they feel you, the consumer, are stupid and will only look at the over all rating which is likely high because of all the fake names and fake reviews created!</li>
            <li> A LITTLE OVER PRICED,</li>
            <li> The product is not available in my town</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not available in any stores</li>
            <li> , so many toothpastes are nasty for me (and any other flavor is for kids).  </li>
            <li> the size is small and the product is not what it use to be.  </li>
            <li> So I just use a small amount for the taste.</li>
            <li> In the past my wife always got &amp;#34;Spearmint&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and it doesn&#x27;t have the same scrubbing power.</li>
            <li> I prefer Pearl Drops in the hard bottle.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for having common sense, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lately, we cannot find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much less expensive than a dentist visit.</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find in the states!</li>
            <li> is a blooming idiot...</li>
            <li> I write  minimum for you to notice me, worst customer service!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> On the site was pictured Pearl Drops Toothpolish.  What I received from you was Smoker&#x27;s Toothpaste not Pearl Drops.  The product works fine, but is not good for in my travel bag.  The container can be punctured.  I prefer Pearl Drops in the hard bottle.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Awesome...a shame that i cant find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Have used this ever since the 1970&#x27;s and nothing polishes like Pearl Drops.</li>
            <li> Meh. Not as good as the old pearl drops I remember in the USA. This is from the UK and it&#x27;s rather runny.</li>
            <li> I have used pearl drops since a teen and always received great compliments on my smile...then for some unknown reason it disappeared off the store shelves...I love Pearl Drops Tooth Polish...I am a smoker and my teeth were yellowig from the tobacco stains...now that I found Pearl Drops on Amazon again my smile is back to what it was when I received all those compliments...Who evers decision it was take this product off the store shelves is a blooming idiot...bring back my Pearl Drops!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found Pearl Drops again!  I remember it fondly from the 1970s... particularly the upside-down bottle.  It&#x27;s a fine polishing abrasive for your teeth.  Pearl Drops...  Run your tongue over your teeth after you use it and say, \\&quot;Mmnnnnnnnn!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product has gradually whitened my teeth, and the company&#x27;s customer service is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001IOJUSK Pearl Drops Whitening Toothpolish Spearmint Flavor 50 Ml]]  Woo-hoo sooooo glad I found my Pearl Drops again!  Started using it when it came out in the 70&#x27;s; then one day it was gone, no where to be found.  With all the cola, coffee, tea, and smokes, my dentist could never figure out how I kept them so white.  And, I see I&#x27;m not the only one that loves Pearl Drops...I knew I wasn&#x27;t crazy, lol.  Thank you for having common sense, Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product used by my family for years.  Lately, we cannot find it in the stores.  we are glad we could find it on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have used Pearl Drops since they first came on the market (a long time) and have no problems with the product. I will continue to use it. The product is not available in my town so I was lucky enough to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I love this brand</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great to find Pearl Drops again. I will order from them again when I run out. I love Pearl Drops!</li>
            <li> Brush your teeth with Pearl Drops everyday in morning to retain whiteness and clean look. Even my dentist asked me how I keep my teeth so white!</li>
            <li> Used this growing up, so it was nice to find it on here.  I really don&#x27;t like mint, so many toothpastes are nasty for me (and any other flavor is for kids).  The mint in this toothpaste is very mild.  This ships more quickly than the estimated time.</li>
            <li> Everything went well.  I love the product.  The product does a great job of whitening my teeth.  It&#x27;s so much less expensive than a dentist visit.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> Good old school product! Still shines and cleans teeth as I remember!</li>
            <li> This is the Pearl Drops I remember using many years ago.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not available in any stores, this is a great toothpaste.  Not too strong tasting, and I&#x27;m not allergic to it like some other pastes.  Love it and hope I can always find it here.</li>
            <li> Whitened my teeth in just 5 brushes!! Like really whitened them, it works amazing!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the US in a long time.  The paste seems a bit waterier than I recall it being, and doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth with that \\&quot;just from the dentist\\&quot; feeling which is why I sought it out.  I probably will not buy again.  The package I received had what appeared to be a UK 99 pence price tag on it.  That means it was about $1.5 US. Retail.  Nice markup for crossing the pond.</li>
            <li> Didnt see any difference.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste in part because I really appreciate good, thoughtful design &amp; this package is that.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pearl Drops Toothpolish for many years, Discovered it by accident and have been using it ever since. I build plaque easily because I salivate a lot, according to several dentists. And, I can&#x27;t stand running my tongue around my mouth and finding my teeth gritty with plague, Pearl Drops contains jeweler&#x27;s rouge and does in fact polish the plaque off your teeth. My teeth stay plaque free much longer and much whiter. Pearl Drops is a great way to keep your teeth and gums healthy. I plan to use it as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> used it in my teens and have&#x27;t seen it since, great surprise.</li>
            <li> nice toothpaste.  I thought I was ordering the old pearl drops tooth polish from a few years back but this is nice too.</li>
            <li> I loved the fresh polished feeling my teeth have after using this product, but have not able to find it for several years.  It did take a long time to ship since it comes from the UK - so order early.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the same product. It&#x27;s very thin and it doesn&#x27;t have the same scrubbing power. My teeth don&#x27;t even feel smooth after I brush. I&#x27;m not noticing any whitening but I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Very happy to have found Pearl Drops on Amazon, for a reasonable price with free shipping and available by the tube (without having to buy a case!).  I&#x27;ve been so disappointed that Pearl Drops are no longer available in the US, since I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it!  So being able to order this in from the UK is a boon to me.  Pearl Drops gently polish your teeth and I prefer them to some of the currently available whitening toothpastes available to me.  They work really well and don&#x27;t cause any negatives..no sensitivity or irritation...just fresh, shiny teeth!  :D  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product has no flavor, much less a freshmint flavor. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> i had this a long time ago and it worked really well. The stores around here do not carry it anymore , so this is a good place to get it. It is good stuff.  Will order again when i need more</li>
            <li> makes your teeth white but it doesnt have much foaming action so you have to apply more. why did they take this out of the united states .. everything that is good always is gone. like our jobs!!!</li>
            <li> It took me years to find this toothpaste. I definitely be using it again</li>
            <li> I wish it was the original, where can I get it from? Then I Might be happy...Thank you again PLEASE</li>
            <li> great product for whitening it really works for me</li>
            <li> Love this product. Fast shipping. Thank you A+</li>
            <li> Pearl Drops has been my favorite for years.  They arrived very quickly; the end result of using pearl drops whitening fluoride is exactly as it states...whitening. It works great and the price is great. A truly wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely I would recommend this product. I can&#x27;t find it any more around my area I live. I used it for years then couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so I&#x27;m so happy to find some I can order. Except I&#x27;ll have to look for the Florida kind. Thanks so much, gail</li>
            <li> I live this tooth polish! The bottle is almost sculptural and white. It can sit out on the sink counter top. It has a great flavor and does the job of whitening your teeth. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I happen to like this toothpaste - it is not a thick as other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> never got the product, are you kidding you demand I write  minimum for you to notice me, worst customer service!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for years - good stuff.</li>
            <li> These were sold in the States many years ago and were great at polishing teeth.  Now apparently only sold from England and they are very watered down, don&#x27;t clean as well as they used to.</li>
            <li> Great service, great product</li>
            <li> Great product , can&#x27;t find in our area anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a regular spearmint toothpaste and isn&#x27;t like the original Pearl Drops that I remember.  The texture isn&#x27;t the same.  It tastes good though.</li>
            <li> Took a long time but worth it.</li>
            <li> Before buying ANY product, do some research on the so-called \\&quot;positive reviews\\&quot; listed for the product!! This particular one is LITTERED with them!&lt;br /&gt;How to spot fake reviews:&lt;br /&gt;1. Find a five star review.&lt;br /&gt;2. Click on the users name to see all reviews they&#x27;ve made.&lt;br /&gt;If the product you&#x27;re viewing is the only one they&#x27;ve reviewed, it&#x27;s most likely a fake review. The more fakes you find, the more cruddy the product probably is.&lt;br /&gt;Companies do this because they feel you, the consumer, are stupid and will only look at the over all rating which is likely high because of all the fake names and fake reviews created!</li>
            <li> Seemed a little watered down since I last purchased Pearldrops tooth polish.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like this toothpolish as good as the original pearl drops toothpolish. its still good just not as strong solution as the original product.</li>
            <li> Not as much silica as the original but will whiten over time. You cannot stand on cap as it leaks even with cap tightened to the max.</li>
            <li> i like this product because it makes your teeth so smooth.  i also like the minty taste. i am glad i could find it on the web site, because they do not have it in the stores.</li>
            <li> the size is small and the product is not what it use to be.  My teeth do not feel as clean as before.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my pearldrops. Good product</li>
            <li> It does what is says it will do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good to be able to get Pearl Drops in the US!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant taste. The top gets a little messy but it is easy to wipe away the residual. I will purchase many more.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE OVER PRICED, BUT A GOOD PRODUCT .....</li>
            <li> This stuff still works.  I thought it was no longer available.  Haven&#x27;t seen it the local stores in years.  You know what &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; say, if you find something that works good you had better buy a truck load of it before they stop making it.</li>
            <li> Good taste and makes my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> This product is not new to me it was here in the US back in the 70,80. It is pleasant to use and helps to keep the Coffee stains off teeth. It works much better with an electric Polishing tool.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this--my favorite for years!</li>
            <li> Makes your teeth feel smooth!</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find in the states! I remember my mother buying this when I was young and it worked . Well years later and i mean years later this product is the best yet!</li>
            <li> Unlike so many products that change for the worse over time...Pearl Drops is still as great as always.  Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> This last batch seems more watery than past purchases, it runs off the toothbrush right away. Still tastes great, and the price was low.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product for awhile now and I am very happy that i found it here. My husband and i both use this product and love it. it works for us. It arrived right on time and i was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I searched for this a long time and was trilled when I found it. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I remember. Guess the newer whitening products have it beat.</li>
            <li> Everything went as it should.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Pearl Drops by a dental hygienist and loved the way its mild abrasive cleaned my teeth almost like I had been to the dentist. I used Pearl Drops for about 30 years before it started to disappear from the store shelves. For the last 6-7 years I had not been able to find it anywhere, so I was happy to see it was available on line.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I believe it makes my teeth whiter and definitely feel cleaner.  I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;Becky</li>
            <li> What can I say? I really like Pearl Drops Toothpaste hahaha. I have tried several on here and all were good. Since it is no longer in stores these tubes can be more expensive then regular toothpaste. But for me it takes forever to go through an entire tube. As my dentist once told me you don&#x27;t need to use a lot or any actually. So I just use a small amount for the taste. The most important thing to do of course is FLOSS daily. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Works okay.  Won&#x27;t buy, again.  A bit  pricey for the results given.  Prefer Plus White ... it&#x27;s a better deal... with better results.</li>
            <li> This is the first time we tried the &amp;#34;Freshmint&amp;#34; flavor.  In the past my wife always got &amp;#34;Spearmint&amp;#34;.  The Freshmint seems to be just as good as the Spearmint, tastewise.</li>
            <li> No grit, not like original.  Just watery tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever! My mouth feels refreshed and it doesn&#x27;t leave fluoride residue on my mouth like others do.</li>
            <li> Love this product -- I&#x27;ve used it for forty years, and my dentists have always complimented me on my white teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a daily toothpaste and does not remove the fuzzy feeling from your teeth any more than any other toothpaste, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to whiten.  It&#x27;s not the gel I used back in the day that removed the fuzzy feeling from my teeth.</li>
            <li> works great.  the only thing is if you put it upside down the bottle eventually leaks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the US anymore. Love this toothpaste, but wish I could get spearmint flavor.</li>
