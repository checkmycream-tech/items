            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>looks good to me for now.</li>
            <li>The sisal wash cloth is a good cloth.  </li>
            <li>This cloth is a good wash cloth for the shower or bath.  </li>
            <li>I wish I was able to buy this at the stores!</li>
            <li>These are absolutely my favorite wash cloths!  </li>
            <li>I love them!  </li>
            <li>- It works the best for me to take it first thing in the morning</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Everyone liked the cloth.</li>
            <li>I liked this product, but it mildews too quickly and cannot get good use out of them without having to order newsones all of the time.</li>

            <li>I like the ayate cloths much better.</li>
            <li>Baudelaire Sisal Wash Cloth: &#x27;take me away&#x27;  :-)&#x27;</li>
            <li>Thank you, I do LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love my sisal washcloths....</li>
            <li>My skin tone is better since I started taking it.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of these cloths.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m loving it right now.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more of these cloths because they clean so well.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed it and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good size, and have a handy loop to hang them so they can drip dry after use.</li>
            <li>In short, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>On one side it&#x27;s a tad more exfoliating than the other which makes it great for the body and face.</li>
            <li>Its strong and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product as it keeps my skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but the weave is much looser and it&#x27;s scratchier.</li>
            <li>I had always used wash rags to bathe with but never felt like they scrubbed my skin adequately.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t really feel clean until you use a sisal wash cloth!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been looking for!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much more energetic now that I stopped taking a lot of other</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve experienced that totally refreshing, extra clean, loofah like experience all over your body  - in the convenience of a &#x27;cloth&#x27;...you&#x27;ll never again want to use a plain ol&#x27; cotton one.</li>
            <li>Liked the size and loop to hang on a hook - main reason why I tried this from my old brand.</li>
            <li>It was about the same size, not too large, and it had the loop for hanging, which I liked.  </li>
            <li>They scrub well and don&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
            <li>great stuff large enough for my back</li>
            <li>To me, it feels exactly</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit rough when you first get it, but it softens up to a nice texture after a while.</li>
            <li>My first experience with a sisal wash cloth was with The Body Shop, but when they no longer stocked it, I came to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>thanks for having what I needed and wanted!</li>
            <li>Thanks for providing this option!</li>
            <li>more then just a simple towel.&lt;br /&gt;.  . . . .</li>
            <li>I have had one for a few years, and loved it also.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>They gently exfoliate, and leave my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it only gets better until I feel it must be time to discard and begin to use a new one.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and really gets the dirt off</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It was not as thick as the last one I had (from a different seller) but is pliable and an excellent addition to my bath.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how long I should use the cloth, but I use it until it finally begins to fray, which is after many months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all pure and natural, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li>These cloths are almost exactly the same as the item from The Body Shop.....</li>
            <li>Exfoliates very well and has small spaces which makes it good for being thoroughly rinsed and dried.</li>
            <li>This cloth was recommended to me by my daughter who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just hope will last for a whole year</li>
            <li>The cloth leaves my skin soft and well cleansed.</li>
            <li>not really a green person -</li>
            <li>Initially I chose Baudelair sisal wash cloth because it resembled my old sisal cloth.  </li>
            <li>but if it lasts for a few months after using it repeatedly then I think it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>When I start using the new one after the previous one starts wearing off, I always thought \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li>Wash rags also tended to get musty rather quickly after a few uses even though I always wrung them out to dry after bathing.  </li>
            <li>-- one side is  a flat weave and the other side has large loops.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, the cloth becomes nice and soft because initially it is a little stiff.</li>

            <li> After a few uses, the cloth becomes nice and soft because initially it is a little stiff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wash cloth in a package deal that included a couple of other items, and was I ever surprised by the value.  </li>
            <li> and I fear it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> They are smaller and not as rough as these.  </li>
            <li> I like them because they are abrasive to get off dead skin - but still have a natural feel.  </li>
            <li> The new one feels a little rough anyway.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews here, one saying that it&#x27;s very similar and other</li>
            <li> but mine is just a few days of using it and surely to soften with time, but don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> The only drawback is they only stay abrasive for a few months...</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer I too used a similar product from The Body Shop that is now dis-continued.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really exfoliating and too loosely woven.  </li>
            <li> Some might find it too rough</li>
            <li> Got what I expected.</li>
            <li> empty</li>
            <li> So the roughness the other reviewers are talking about may be due to the fact that they&#x27;ve gotten used to the worn out one.  </li>
            <li> other than that, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thought I was going to do with conventional...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I feel it was a bit over priced, but</li>
            <li> Maybe a little rougher than the other</li>
            <li> Recommend it, and other packaged deals from Amazon wholeheartedly!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I love this cloth and will continue to reorder this sisal wash cloth although I wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> but it unravelled a little immediately</li>
            <li> but I find it to be just rough enough to scrub my skin but not be unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Yep... I am lazy too.  </li>
            <li> Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> I just wish for the price it came with two , lasted longer or was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Nah... actually I just hate going to the mall.</li>
            <li> I tried the mesh &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; and deemed them useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t have to resort to those horrible plastic ones that feel horrible on my skin or those mitten shaped pads that don&#x27;t conform to my body contour.</li>
            <li> a day.&lt;br /&gt;- Haven&#x27;t had a cold since I started taking</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had always used wash rags to bathe with but never felt like they scrubbed my skin adequately.  Wash rags also tended to get musty rather quickly after a few uses even though I always wrung them out to dry after bathing.  I tried the mesh &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; and deemed them useless.  I learned about this product just by poking around the amazon website and reading reviews.  Some might find it too rough but I find it to be just rough enough to scrub my skin but not be unpleasant.  Its strong and dries quickly.  From what I&#x27;ve read it won&#x27;t last forever but if it lasts for a few months after using it repeatedly then I think it&#x27;s worth the money.  In short, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and really gets the dirt off</li>
            <li> They scrub well and don&#x27;t cost very much. I plan on buying more of these cloths because they clean so well.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t Like This At All!!</li>
            <li> This cloth was recommended to me by my daughter who has sensitive skin. We both use our cloths on our faces. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> I like the product but it unravelled a little immediately and I fear it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected. Very nice, on time.  I only bath with these. Thanks</li>
            <li> I too was using the ones from Body Shop, and was looking for substitutes after they discontinued them.  I read reviews here, one saying that it&#x27;s very similar and other saying that it&#x27;s not.  I took my chance and bought it.  To me, it feels exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy several at a time from Body Shop.  When I start using the new one after the previous one starts wearing off, I always thought \\&quot;Wow, was it this rough?\\&quot;  Over the years, I must&#x27;ve gone through tens of them, and each time, I had the same reaction.  So the roughness the other reviewers are talking about may be due to the fact that they&#x27;ve gotten used to the worn out one.  The new one feels a little rough anyway.  But that&#x27;s just my take.  I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t have to resort to those horrible plastic ones that feel horrible on my skin or those mitten shaped pads that don&#x27;t conform to my body contour.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but it mildews too quickly and cannot get good use out of them without having to order newsones all of the time. I have gone back to using regular wash cloths/face towels, but miss the texture of the Sisal wash clothes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> I used to buy similar wash cloths at the Body Shop but they stopped selling them. These are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These are perfect as body washcloths.  I think the ayate washcloth is way better for your face.  They are smaller and not as rough as these.  These are still great and the seller did everything well.</li>
            <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose. I have really enjoyed it and the shipping was quick. I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Good price. It&#x27;s a bit rough when you first get it, but it softens up to a nice texture after a while.</li>
            <li> Very good sisal wash clothes. Exfoliates very well and has small spaces which makes it good for being thoroughly rinsed and dried.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t really feel clean until you use a sisal wash cloth! It is an amazing product. I wish I was able to buy this at the stores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped it was the same as I used to buy from the Body Shop, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s OK, but the weave is much looser and it&#x27;s scratchier.</li>
            <li> Not at all like what is shown in photo -- one side is  a flat weave and the other side has large loops. It sheds a lot and it reeks of diesel fuel, which I later learned is the insecticide they use on sisal. Insecticide??!!  This makes it 100% unusable in any bath or even the kitchen, for that matter. It might work for washing the car but that would be about it.</li>
            <li> great stuff large enough for my back I just hope will last for a whole year is not going to fall apart. looks good to me for now. lets see</li>
            <li> meh. Not at all scrubby. I like the ayate cloths much better.</li>
            <li> The sisal wash cloth is a good cloth.  It was not as thick as the last one I had (from a different seller) but is pliable and an excellent addition to my bath.  My only complaint is I feel it was a bit over priced, but other than that, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My first experience with a sisal wash cloth was with The Body Shop, but when they no longer stocked it, I came to Amazon.  Initially I chose Baudelair sisal wash cloth because it resembled my old sisal cloth.  It was about the same size, not too large, and it had the loop for hanging, which I liked.  I bought several cloths and gave some away because I wanted my friends to experience the cleansing of a sisal cloth.  Everyone liked the cloth. After a few uses, the cloth becomes nice and soft because initially it is a little stiff. The cloth leaves my skin soft and well cleansed. When it was time to reorder, I turned to Amazon and ordered the same cloths. I put my cloth in the washing machine like I would any washcloth and it only gets better until I feel it must be time to discard and begin to use a new one.  I really don&#x27;t know how long I should use the cloth, but I use it until it finally begins to fray, which is after many months.  Needless to say, I love this cloth and will continue to reorder this sisal wash cloth although I wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer I too used a similar product from The Body Shop that is now dis-continued. The Baudelaire Sisal Wash Cloth is a very very good replacement. Maybe a little rougher than the other but mine is just a few days of using it and surely to soften with time, but don&#x27;t get me wrong - I&#x27;m loving it right now. Elbows, knees. Nose, toes. Once you&#x27;ve experienced that totally refreshing, extra clean, loofah like experience all over your body  - in the convenience of a &#x27;cloth&#x27;...you&#x27;ll never again want to use a plain ol&#x27; cotton one. Baudelaire Sisal Wash Cloth: &#x27;take me away&#x27;  :-)&#x27;</li>
            <li> The one I had before had a tighter weave so I was expecting the same one when I ordered, This one is a looser weave but after using it for&lt;br /&gt;awhile I have gotten to like it.</li>
            <li> This cloth is a good wash cloth for the shower or bath.  Not quite as exfoliating as I would like it to be, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product at an excellent price.  Delivered on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Liked the size and loop to hang on a hook - main reason why I tried this from my old brand. But the cloth would never lather up the soap. It was as if the liquid soap would just sit where ever it was poured on and despite efforts to create a lather, it never would. Went</li>
            <li> Thank you, I do LOVE it. I have had one for a few years, and loved it also.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know where to buy these, I shall get another one sooner.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I have been looking for!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product as it keeps my skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> A great find at a good price.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely my favorite wash cloths!  They gently exfoliate, and leave my skin soft and smooth.  They&#x27;re a good size, and have a handy loop to hang them so they can drip dry after use.</li>
            <li> Love my sisal washcloths.... Thought I was going to do with conventional...thanks for having what I needed and wanted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cloth daily for about 6-months.  I should have replaced it about 2-months ago, I&#x27;m replacing it now.  I just wish for the price it came with two , lasted longer or was less expensive.  I think a year in the amount of time I would expect for a product like this to last.</li>
            <li> These cloths are almost exactly the same as the item from The Body Shop.....I love them!  Thanks for providing this option!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a sloughing cloth.  It works wonderfully!  I found one close to it in Walmart, Osprey, FL.  Wish I could find one here in NJ.  Great product.</li>
            <li> When I see Sisal Wash Cloth I expect something like more then just a simple towel.&lt;br /&gt;.  . . . .</li>
            <li> I purchased this wash cloth in a package deal that included a couple of other items, and was I ever surprised by the value.  This cloth is quality stuff, and I got it at a very low price.  Recommend it, and other packaged deals from Amazon wholeheartedly!</li>
            <li> I threw it out.  It&#x27;s not really exfoliating and too loosely woven.  Didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> This cloth exfoliates as well as any loofah, and it doesn&#x27;t fall apart in the washing machine the way plastic scrubbies do.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> - It works the best for me to take it first thing in the morning empty stomach.&lt;br /&gt;- Since I&#x27;m petite, I feel the difference even with just 1 capsule a day.&lt;br /&gt;- If I don&#x27;t consume any caffeinated drinks, I can take 2 or 3 a day.&lt;br /&gt;- Haven&#x27;t had a cold since I started taking it.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m much more energetic now that I stopped taking a lot of other supplements.&lt;br /&gt;- My skin tone is better since I started taking it. The age spots on my hands faded away. Quite amazing!&lt;br /&gt;- This is an U.S. product which I trust and support.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s all pure and natural, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of these cloths. On one side it&#x27;s a tad more exfoliating than the other which makes it great for the body and face.</li>
            <li> I have used these wash clothes for about 10 years now.  I like them because they are abrasive to get off dead skin - but still have a natural feel.  The only drawback is they only stay abrasive for a few months... then I replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not really a green person - but these just work for me.  These ones I ordered off Amazon are same quality I get in Body Shop.  I don&#x27;t know if they are cheaper, but they get shipped to my door.  Yep... I am lazy too.  Nah... actually I just hate going to the mall.</li>
