            <li>Some ppl may LIKE this hair &amp; thats great</li>
            <li>And great customer service.</li>
            <li>The hair was very nice but</li>
            <li>Quality was very nice though.</li>
            <li>After trying extensions with $$$ from Sallys, Pro, Euronext, and Luxy, I decided to give a chance to Tressmatch because of its good reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of extensions and I love them!!!</li>
            <li>I am loving these extensions.</li>
            <li>and I liked those a lot and still have my sets from years ago</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t risk a lot $$$, but still want to use decent quality hair, Tressmatch is a very nice choice, lol.</li>
            <li>I am returning this as I need very light blond.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM..</li>
            <li>My favorite since some hair claim not to shed but do anyway.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend these awesome extensions!</li>
            <li>but the hair is WAYYYYYYYY bettter longer more grams ect.</li>
            <li>, Im glad it worked for them.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps anyone save $$ &amp; time as well as choosing a reputable company-  JR~</li>
            <li>However, if I curl them they are full :) Love!</li>
            <li>Because they HAD LOW RATINGS &amp; WANT TO SELL MORE PRODUCTS!!!  </li>
            <li>so you have to tone them with purple shampoo like you dont really have a choice and after washing extensions they are never as good.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are great!</li>
            <li>They match my hair perfectly, and the hair is very silky and soft.</li>
            <li>do a little research on coloring and trimming your extensions if they dont match your hair perfectly..</li>
            <li>The hair was beautiful, long, and soft,but i noticed that when i tried to curl them some of the hair would stick to curling iron,so i got scared</li>
            <li>The package came fast, they are beautiful, soft and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>The hair was nice, good amount of hair from top to bottom,if you have thick hair like me</li>
            <li>It is pure and beautiful light blonde.</li>
            <li>FULL HEAD OF HAIR.</li>
            <li>I was really upset that this hair wasn&#x27;t better quality</li>
            <li>Overall - pretty good extensions.</li>
            <li>and i stopped,but overall it curled pretty good</li>
            <li>I feel like I finally found a seller who has been honest about what they sell.</li>
            <li>My biggest problem is \\&quot;false, bogus reviews that companies put there to mislead consumers into believing they have tons of happy 5 star reviews!!</li>
            <li>Because my own hair can&#x27;t grow long, I&#x27;ve been stuck in using hair extensions for years.</li>
            <li>The hair quality is perfect, thick, and soft.</li>
            <li>I like the extensions but they look more yellow to me</li>
            <li>They do shed a bit, so be aware of this.  </li>
            <li>And the hair is so soft, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite extensions, i own euronext extensions from sally beauty supply that cost $140 and are  lower quality than these (too thin).</li>
            <li>-  My real name is used &amp; you can check all my other AMAZON purchases &amp; REVIEWS that have helped many ppl !</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li>The hair is not bad, but for the price you can buy Lush Locks or many other 160 gram sets for $110!!&lt;br /&gt;CHECK</li>
            <li>However the benefit to them is they are amazon prime and they ship fast.</li>
            <li>and they are still in decent condition.</li>
            <li>I expected light blond as shown in the picture, but received strawberry blond with some blond strands.</li>
            <li>Please , be an educated consumer &amp; check reviews to SEE if they are true, real ppl that bought OTHER things or have a PROFILE!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>so it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>You can clearly check this yourself by clicking on this persons name!</li>
            <li>:) high reccomend to anyone who has thick hair..</li>
            <li>It does not tangle as easily although I washed it for a few time now.</li>
            <li>One of the wefts had a very minor defect and they sent me a replacement right away at no cost to me.</li>
            <li>This one single set has just the right volume for me</li>
            <li>have stayed on so far</li>
            <li>it is a LOT of hair, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I love the length and how durable and thick they are.</li>
            <li>this company can&#x27;t stand to have someone HONESTLY say there are FALSE REVIEWS</li>
            <li>I have bought many extensions before, These are the same or better than some very expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased before.</li>
            <li>They came straight, so they were a bit hard to curl initially, but after washing, they were easy to style.  </li>
            <li>This is very long - I think it is much longer than the 20&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the 150grams set gave me lots of hair, but it does - it&#x27;s indeed a full head set for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Very thick and smooth extensions, never get tangled.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , just don&#x27;t leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten the 16&amp;#34; though, because the 20&#x27; is ridiculously long on me.</li>
            <li> Also, there were still some black hairs mixed in with the blonde.  </li>
            <li> I had the dark blonde color before</li>
            <li> Be careful.......</li>
            <li> I saw that other people had issues with clips but mine</li>
            <li> I might have to order a second set, though, because as other reviewers mentioned if you have thick hair you might need 2.</li>
            <li> If I look carefully I can pick out a few darker color hair but it is not noticeable.</li>
            <li> .. also layered them a little bit to blend with my shoulder length hair..</li>
            <li> this was the biggest waste of money ever for me.</li>
            <li> totally the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Usually I use two sets each is over $150</li>
            <li> AAND I HAVE THICK HAIR..</li>
            <li> but the instructions said it was not a good idea.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD QUALITY</li>
            <li> Very thick and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and very thick.</li>
            <li> &amp; the clips were thin &amp; broke in days.</li>
            <li> poor quality, overpriced</li>
            <li> Im sorry</li>
            <li> cant stand false reviews!!</li>
            <li> Horrible I am so dissapointed.</li>
            <li> the quality on these are horrible</li>
            <li> They are so ratty and awful.</li>
            <li> I think maybe the bleaching these extensions go through just makes the quality of the hair awful and ratty maybe.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These extensions are great! I was impressed by the color and quality. Would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the extensions but they look more yellow to me then the light/bleach blonde that they should be. Other than that they are great! I love the length and how durable and thick they are. I saw that other people had issues with clips but mine have stayed on so far and they gave me two extra incase that happens.</li>
            <li> Got these in blonde and they matched my hair purfectly.  They came straight, so they were a bit hard to curl initially, but after washing, they were easy to style.  They do shed a bit, so be aware of this.  Also, there were still some black hairs mixed in with the blonde.  Nothing noticable unless you were looking for them. Overall - pretty good extensions.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE BEST EXTENSION INVESTMENT I EVER MADE!! FULL HEAD OF HAIR. AAND I HAVE THICK HAIR.. AND MY HAIR IS SHORT..! I LOVE THEM.. :) high reccomend to anyone who has thick hair.. I will post a picture of before and after..</li>
            <li> Because my own hair can&#x27;t grow long, I&#x27;ve been stuck in using hair extensions for years. After trying extensions with $$$ from Sallys, Pro, Euronext, and Luxy, I decided to give a chance to Tressmatch because of its good reviews on Amazon.

If you don&#x27;t risk a lot $$$, but still want to use decent quality hair, Tressmatch is a very nice choice, lol.</li>
            <li> This was a gift the personloved it, the hair is beautiful and does not shed. My favorite since some hair claim not to shed but do anyway.  This is great arrived on time</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend these awesome extensions! I was kind of nervous because of the cheaper price, but these are great! They match my hair perfectly, and the hair is very silky and soft. I might have to order a second set, though, because as other reviewers mentioned if you have thick hair you might need 2.

            <li> This is my first set of extensions and I love them!!! The package came fast, they are beautiful, soft and comfortable to wear. Deff would reccomend these!!</li>
            <li> The hair quality is perfect, thick, and soft. These are my favorite extensions, i own euronext extensions from sally beauty supply that cost $140 and are  lower quality than these (too thin). I lightened them to match my hair  and the color came out perfect.. also layered them a little bit to blend with my shoulder length hair..do a little research on coloring and trimming your extensions if they dont match your hair perfectly.. youtube. I am loving these extensions.</li>
            <li> The hair was very nice but totally the wrong color. I expected light blond as shown in the picture, but received strawberry blond with some blond strands. I am returning this as I need very light blond. Quality was very nice though. I was under the impression if I needed to color the hair I could but the instructions said it was not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Horrible I am so dissapointed. I bought the regular set but after being sent USED hair I returned them and bought this set. These are SO yellow so you have to tone them with purple shampoo like you dont really have a choice and after washing extensions they are never as good. the quality on these are horrible I ended up buying zala hair extensions which are at the same price point but the hair is WAYYYYYYYY bettter longer more grams ect. this was the biggest waste of money ever for me. They are so ratty and awful. However the benefit to them is they are amazon prime and they ship fast. I had the dark blonde color before and I liked those a lot and still have my sets from years ago and they are still in decent condition. I think maybe the bleaching these extensions go through just makes the quality of the hair awful and ratty maybe.</li>
            <li> The hair was beautiful, long, and soft,but i noticed that when i tried to curl them some of the hair would stick to curling iron,so i got scared and i stopped,but overall it curled pretty good, just don&#x27;t leave it on for too long. The hair was nice, good amount of hair from top to bottom,if you have thick hair like me i recommend you getting 150 grams.</li>
            <li> I feel like I finally found a seller who has been honest about what they sell. The hair I received is as said. Very thick and silky. My hair is shoulder length and very thick. This one single set has just the right volume for me so it looks very natural. Usually I use two sets each is over $150 so total is $300!! This is very long - I think it is much longer than the 20&#x27;&#x27; I used to get and I do not need to trim anything off at the bottom. It is pure and beautiful light blonde. If I look carefully I can pick out a few darker color hair but it is not noticeable. It does not tangle as easily although I washed it for a few time now. I feel great when I put it on!</li>
            <li> I have bought many extensions before, These are the same or better than some very expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased before. I have a lot of hair and I only use 5 tracks! Very thick and smooth extensions, never get tangled. So happy.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this hair, ( not this color!) &amp; the clips were thin &amp; broke in days. The hair is not bad, but for the price you can buy Lush Locks or many other 160 gram sets for $110!!&lt;br /&gt;CHECK THE \\&quot;REVIEWERS\\&quot; THAT DONT HAVE AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE!! THEY ONLY REVIEWED THIS COMPANYS HAIR &amp; DIFFERENT COLORS &amp;LENGTHS!!&lt;br /&gt;I cant stand false reviews!! Companies just want to get the 2-3 stars up to five to sell more items!!!!!! Be careful.......&lt;br /&gt; UPDATE:  I an NOT affiliated with ANY hair brand or company ( as in comments you will see that is what THIS company would like you to believe!) -  My real name is used &amp; you can check all my other AMAZON purchases &amp; REVIEWS that have helped many ppl ! Im sorry this company can&#x27;t stand to have someone HONESTLY say there are FALSE REVIEWS MADE!  You can clearly check this yourself by clicking on this persons name! If they ONLY reviewed 1 company , or products by 1 company &amp; give 5 star rave reviews about them - THEY ARE BOGUS REVIEWS BY THE PPL IN THE COMPANY!&lt;br /&gt; Some ppl may LIKE this hair &amp; thats great, Im glad it worked for them. My biggest problem is \\&quot;false, bogus reviews that companies put there to mislead consumers into believing they have tons of happy 5 star reviews!! You MUST wonder about the honesty of a company that does this &amp; wonder WHY the have to add so many false 5 star reviews! Because they HAD LOW RATINGS &amp; WANT TO SELL MORE PRODUCTS!!!  Please , be an educated consumer &amp; check reviews to SEE if they are true, real ppl that bought OTHER things or have a PROFILE!!&lt;br /&gt;  Hope this helps anyone save $$ &amp; time as well as choosing a reputable company-  JR~</li>
            <li> And great customer service. One of the wefts had a very minor defect and they sent me a replacement right away at no cost to me. The hair is beautiful and very good quality remy hair. I wish I had gotten the 16&amp;#34; though, because the 20&#x27; is ridiculously long on me. it is a LOT of hair, I was surprised. I am getting the extensions cut next week. if i don&#x27;t like the way it turns out i will definitely order the 16&#x27; set.</li>
            <li> poor quality, overpriced I was really upset that this hair wasn&#x27;t better quality</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD QUALITY AT ALL</li>
    </ol>
