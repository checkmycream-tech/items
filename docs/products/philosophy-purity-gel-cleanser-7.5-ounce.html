            <li>My daughter&#x27;s opinion: it works okay, but</li>
            <li>thing I was most amazed at was the fact that all you had to to was put in on your face and rinse with water, most of the time when I use a face wash I need to use a wash rag to get off the excess makeup/cleanser, this stuff?  </li>
            <li>Also, I LOVE how it makes my skin feel afterwards, I have to remind myself to not touch my face</li>

            <li>love how smooth it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li>Someone suggested I might be overtreating my skin, so I opted to try Purity based on good reviews and claims that it was gentle.</li>
            <li>I have finally found a good balance!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for removing makeup, especially waterproof mascara.</li>

            <li>I have very oily skin and most products out there</li>
            <li>I loved the regular philosophy cleanser but even at my age have oilier skin.  </li>
            <li>This foams up and cleans really well, leaves my skin feeling as good as the regular, and I&#x27;m glad to say takes off eye makeup just as well.</li>
            <li>I have heard good things about this cleanser, especially from my who is an expert in all beauty products, so I was eager to give it a try.  </li>

            <li>our entire family loves everything they make and we&#x27;re so glad we are able to purchase them through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this after realizing my current cleanser was not removing my makeup and this product did an excellent job in doing so.  </li>
            <li>Both are very easy on my shin ( i have sensitive skin )</li>
            <li>so you can get the exact amount you would like to use, even in the shower!</li>
            <li>very good product, its thick</li>
            <li>The price for this was also pretty good as I checked around other sites and shopping channels.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and during summer my skin becomes a little oily, so this is the best product because is super soft and gentle for eyes but removes makeup, dirt and oil leaving your skin fresh and clean, ready for serum and cream.</li>

            <li>Its very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>It feels very gentle.</li>
            <li>after having 2 pimples for more than one month, I decided to go back to philosophy for my face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, I prefer this over the liquid foaming cleanser of the same name.</li>
            <li>It is also gentle on your eyes, so it can be used to remove eye makeup!</li>
            <li>Great price on here, shipping was slow.</li>
            <li>Love this facial cleanser !</li>
            <li>, I actually prefer this to the original Purity!</li>
            <li>It loves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and mild on the skin.</li>
            <li>you have acne and large pores, buy this</li>
            <li>my new favorite facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I didn&#x27;t want an acne cleanser which would dry out my face, but I wanted something good enough to remove my makeup and leave my face</li>
            <li>I realize that we are all different and some are more sensitive to certain products than others.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and the gel works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and someone suggested I use a gel cleanser, since what I was using before was a cream-based or something I shouldn&#x27;t have been using.</li>
            <li>really cleans without drying your skin out, doesn&#x27;t remove eye make up</li>
            <li>(I have very oily skin)</li>
            <li>This is just as good, if not better!</li>
            <li>any better then any other soap out there though.</li>
            <li>I had given them up years ago because of the high price.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend the original face wash because this may make your skin too dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good thing about this product is that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean with no residue and not overly dry.</li>
            <li>face wash, I haven&#x27;t been able to find another face wash that cleans as deeply as this yet doesn&#x27;t dry out skin or leave traces of makeup.</li>
            <li>I bought it on a whim because I was looking for a new face wash and my wal-mart stuff</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I did not let the cleanser get on on near my eyes mainly for fear of irritation</li>
            <li>My first step back was</li>
            <li>This bottle lasts for a very long time so the price is totally worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Leave the skin fresh and clean, but sometimes a little bit dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a god job removing makeup and eye makeup, but it doesn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup completely.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything and this is what works for my overly sensitive face.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for nearly 2 years now</li>
            <li>I have oily skin 41 yrs old</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the original Purity, but it was very hard to rinse off and seemed to leave a residue.</li>
            <li>I am going back to using Cetaphil, which I have never had a problem with, I just thought I&#x27;d try something new.  </li>
            <li>it is thick and lathers up quickly.</li>

            <li> (I have very oily skin)</li>
            <li> This is just as good, if not better!</li>
            <li> any better then any other soap out there though.</li>
            <li> I had given them up years ago because of the high price.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend the original face wash because this may make your skin too dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another good thing about this product is that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling clean with no residue and not overly dry.</li>
            <li> face wash, I haven&#x27;t been able to find another face wash that cleans as deeply as this yet doesn&#x27;t dry out skin or leave traces of makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought it on a whim because I was looking for a new face wash and my wal-mart stuff</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I did not let the cleanser get on on near my eyes mainly for fear of irritation</li>
            <li> My first step back was</li>
            <li> This bottle lasts for a very long time so the price is totally worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Leave the skin fresh and clean, but sometimes a little bit dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a god job removing makeup and eye makeup, but it doesn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup completely.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything and this is what works for my overly sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for nearly 2 years now</li>
            <li> I have oily skin 41 yrs old</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the original Purity, but it was very hard to rinse off and seemed to leave a residue.</li>
            <li> I am going back to using Cetaphil, which I have never had a problem with, I just thought I&#x27;d try something new.  </li>
            <li> it is thick and lathers up quickly.</li>
            <li> It is the only face wash that controls my oily skin but does not make it dry.</li>
            <li> , It made my skin break out giving that i have oily combination skin as well as having very sensitive skin, so I picked up a sample of this stuff and it made my face a little dry.</li>
            <li> dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes or dry out skin.</li>
            <li> an this takes it all way without feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It takes less product to do the same job as the lotion.</li>
            <li> It dries out my skin a little too much and it feels a little tight.</li>
            <li> A very little amount goes a long way so  expect that it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and have to be careful about lotions and face/body cleansers.</li>
            <li> I think this tube will last years since I use so little every day !&lt;</li>

            <li> I usually wear waterproof mascara daily</li>

            <li> (while my skin may not be pimply, I still have redness in my skin due to a side effect from a medication.)</li>
            <li> The purity gel makes my skin feel cleaner than any other brand that I have used</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an average cleanser, not worth the price</li>
            <li> and the oil on my face has gone down ALOT.</li>
            <li> It has an odd &amp;#34;hospital&amp;#34; smell that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I have blind bought this, because I live in Vietnam</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering after reading some of the negative reviews about causing dry skin.</li>
            <li> I never had much acne in my teens and twenties, but when I turned 30 my skin went crazy.</li>
            <li> The gel is thin and cleans deeper than the cream version with the same name</li>
            <li> I have been using Philosophy Purity for a few years.</li>
            <li> I use the purity wash everyday , and the Exfoliating one about 4 days a week.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> It lathers well and cleans away dirt and oil without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> It cleans that well, but isn&#x27;t harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past.</li>
            <li> It is unfortunately too dry for my skin, and I use the smallest amount!  </li>
            <li> I have used everything from moderate price to very expensive skin products.</li>
            <li> I definitely wasn&#x27;t disappointed with this gel cleanser</li>
            <li> This is a thin gel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great for fighting acne, so I use an acne cleanser in the mornings.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;d get a random one somewhere on my face.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never had bad acne, just a couple of cystic acne would pop up</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently came back to philosophy products.  I had given them up years ago because of the high price.  My first step back was \\&quot;the present\\&quot; face primer which I had always loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after having 2 pimples for more than one month, I decided to go back to philosophy for my face cleanser.  After using purity made simple twice, my 2 pimples have vanished.  I have combination skin.  So, I didn&#x27;t want an acne cleanser which would dry out my face, but I wanted something good enough to remove my makeup and leave my face clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a god job removing makeup and eye makeup, but it doesn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup completely.  I still have to use castor oil to get the stubborn mascara.  I still gave it 5 stars because I doubt any facial cleanser could remove all eye makeup like oil.</li>
            <li> great product.  Every thing by philosophy is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it. It&#x27;s been great for all seasons and works for sensitive skin. It also smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, I prefer this over the liquid foaming cleanser of the same name. This is a thin gel and I feel I get a deeper clean. And since I have acne that&#x27;s very important for me.</li>
            <li> our entire family loves everything they make and we&#x27;re so glad we are able to purchase them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have blind bought this, because I live in Vietnam so I have to order via my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The gel is thin and cleans deeper than the cream version with the same name&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is very light.&lt;br /&gt;- Leave the skin fresh and clean, but sometimes a little bit dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne and large pores, buy this and you will feel amazed. And very good for combination skin. Please use rich-hydration once a day (at night) after using this cleanser</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an average cleanser, not worth the price</li>
            <li> L0VE IT!! This is a great cleanser</li>
            <li> I have been using Philosophy Purity for a few years. It&#x27;s great for removing makeup, especially waterproof mascara. I was THRILLED when a gel version came out since I have lovely oily skin. It&#x27;s great - I even use it w/my Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to remove even a longwear make-up.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and most products out there dry my skin out. This product does not. It leaves my skin very clean without drying it. Yea!</li>
            <li> The only cleanser I can use that doesn&#x27;t break me out. I have tried everything and this is what works for my overly sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this after realizing my current cleanser was not removing my makeup and this product did an excellent job in doing so.  I wear foundation and blush every day and it worked great!  Although it also says eye makeup remover on the tube I did not let the cleanser get on on near my eyes mainly for fear of irritation so I can&#x27;t say if it removes the eye makeup as well.  I usually wear waterproof mascara daily so I still used my eye make up remover anyway.  Glad to have found this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Philosophy face wash, I haven&#x27;t been able to find another face wash that cleans as deeply as this yet doesn&#x27;t dry out skin or leave traces of makeup. Philosophy products have always been my go-to skin care. I definitely wasn&#x27;t disappointed with this gel cleanser, I actually prefer this to the original Purity! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is gentle yet effective. It&#x27;s also reasonably priced. A little goes a long way so it lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li> I first got this as a sample from redeeming points at Sephora. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this face wash. It smells great, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot bc it is thick and lathers up quickly. It is also gentle on your eyes, so it can be used to remove eye makeup! Great price on here, shipping was slow. Will continue to buy this product though, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Very good product for oily skin. I used to use Clinique gel makeup remover and they discontinued it. I was pleasantly surprised to find this product.</li>
            <li> Very gentle cleanser. It loves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Its great for oily skin as it does not give a dry up feeling after cleansing. It smell good too.</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser ! I use Purity and the Microdelivery Exfoliating wash . Both are very easy on my shin ( i have sensitive skin ) I use the purity wash everyday , and the Exfoliating one about 4 days a week.....Never without them ! Love Philosophy &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I am loving this cleanser. I have always used Philosophy cleansing lotion, but this cleansing gel is way better. It takes less product to do the same job as the lotion. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I love it. It&#x27;s great for removing makeup, especially eye makeup and waterproof mascara. It doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> very good product, its thick so you can get the exact amount you would like to use, even in the shower! use it daily. Its very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering after reading some of the negative reviews about causing dry skin. I have eczema and have to be careful about lotions and face/body cleansers. I have been using the Clarasonic Mia for about 5 years now and loved their foaming gel cleanser. This is just as good, if not better! My skin looks amazing and is incredibly soft. I think I have found my new favorite facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about this product is that a little goes a long way. With daily use, this could last 6 or 7 months like my Clarasonic gel does. The price for this was also pretty good as I checked around other sites and shopping channels. If you are hesitant like I was about Purity drying out your skin, don&#x27;t be. I realize that we are all different and some are more sensitive to certain products than others. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and my skin looks fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser...I use it daily ....love how smooth it makes my face feel.  You will not be disappointed if you choose to buy this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job at removing all makeup traces, including mascara and eyeliner. A very little amount goes a long way so  expect that it will last a very long time. It is very soft and mild on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love philosophy products. I prefer this to the traditional purity because it lathers, but I do feel it dries out my skin. It might be better for use in the summer. It does smell great though!</li>
            <li> works great! I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena for years and decided to make a change.A friend of mine uses the 3 in 1 version of this item and referred it to me, It made my skin break out giving that i have oily combination skin as well as having very sensitive skin, so I picked up a sample of this stuff and it made my face a little dry. I use a moisturizer every day so that helps a bit. On the the other hand, i discontinued using this product until i started to substitute the sample from my neutrogena after the gym. after 2 weeks of using this product I see a huge difference in my complexion! i just purchased a bottle yesterday!</li>
            <li> I used to use skintx, which is a prescription kit that had an amazing gel cleanser. Ever since, I&#x27;ve probably tried a million cleansers just trying to find one that&#x27;s comparable. This is the best I&#x27;ve found. It lathers well and cleans away dirt and oil without being too harsh. It also does a phenomenal job removing eye make up. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price; one tube will last at least 6 months, and that&#x27;s with generous use twice a day</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and the gel works very well for me.  My skin feels very clean after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for nearly 2 years now and I can&#x27;t see me switching face wash anytime soon. This stuff is amazing! I have really oily skin and someone suggested I use a gel cleanser, since what I was using before was a cream-based or something I shouldn&#x27;t have been using. I never had bad acne, just a couple of cystic acne would pop up or I&#x27;d get a random one somewhere on my face. I have not gotten any of  that since I started using this! and the oil on my face has gone down ALOT. I can almost go out in public without foundation on! (while my skin may not be pimply, I still have redness in my skin due to a side effect from a medication.) It&#x27;s great stuff and will stick with this!</li>
            <li> The philosophy brand is great. I have used everything from moderate price to very expensive skin products. The purity gel makes my skin feel cleaner than any other brand that I have used</li>
            <li> really cleans without drying your skin out, doesn&#x27;t remove eye make up any better then any other soap out there though. still a great buy especially if you like using philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I loved the regular philosophy cleanser but even at my age have oilier skin.  This foams up and cleans really well, leaves my skin feeling as good as the regular, and I&#x27;m glad to say takes off eye makeup just as well.</li>
            <li> I have heard good things about this cleanser, especially from my who is an expert in all beauty products, so I was eager to give it a try.  It is unfortunately too dry for my skin, and I use the smallest amount!  I am going back to using Cetaphil, which I have never had a problem with, I just thought I&#x27;d try something new.  I have medium to oily (sometimes acne prone) skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months.  I use it once a day at night becasue it is calming to the skin.  I use Neutrogena Refine Pores in the morning.  It works very well to remove make up and just the everyday dirt that get on the face.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE all of Philosophy&#x27;s Purity cleansers. This gel cleanser works just like the original. This is my #1 cleanser because it&#x27;s the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used to remove all traces of makeup. You don&#x27;t even need a toner. It cleans that well, but isn&#x27;t harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> It dries out my skin a little too much and it feels a little tight. But I think it&#x27;s because this is better for oily skin and my skin isn&#x27;t that oily.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s opinion: It feels nice on your face. My daughter&#x27;s opinion: it works okay, but nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is amazing.  I bought it on a whim because I was looking for a new face wash and my wal-mart stuff wasn&#x27;t cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I was most amazed at was the fact that all you had to to was put in on your face and rinse with water, most of the time when I use a face wash I need to use a wash rag to get off the excess makeup/cleanser, this stuff?  Nope.  Rinse it off in the shower, done, splash with your hands, done.  Also, I LOVE how it makes my skin feel afterwards, I have to remind myself to not touch my face (I have very oily skin) this product softens and evens out the excess oil..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be checking out the Philosophy line in more depth.</li>
            <li> the best face cleanser ever!!!!! I have very sensitive eyes and during summer my skin becomes a little oily, so this is the best product because is super soft and gentle for eyes but removes makeup, dirt and oil leaving your skin fresh and clean, ready for serum and cream. i will repurchase again and again!!!!</li>
            <li> great overall cleanser and removing eye makeup. Doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes or dry out skin. I&#x27;ve used now for about three months and will continue to use/buy again. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product! I think this tube will last years since I use so little every day !&lt;br /&gt;Cleans off makeup  in a jiffy every night.</li>
            <li> Love Philosophy products!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past. It does get all of my makeup off. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small. It has an odd &amp;#34;hospital&amp;#34; smell that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of the Purity gel face wash and the smell is so pleasant. I am always in the search for the best of everything which means I usually never repurchase the same product twice. I have purchased this face wash 4-5 times! It is the only face wash that controls my oily skin but does not make it dry. I also have acne prone skin and this does not break me out at all. If you have normal/dry skin I recommend the original face wash because this may make your skin too dry but this is great for oily skin. This bottle lasts for a very long time so the price is totally worth it to me. One bottle has lasted me 4-5 months which is amazing. Love, love, love Philosophy products and the Purity gel face wash is by far the best I have used!</li>
            <li> I always come back to this cleanser.  I have oily skin 41 yrs old make up user an this takes it all way without feeling dry. It leaves the skin soft.  I&#x27;ve use both the gel and the moisturizing one, I am sticking with the gel kind.  THE BEST.</li>
            <li> I have been using philosophy purity for over 10 years and love the product.I do like something that lathers so I have switched to purity in the gel form.This product lasts forever and I keep it in my shower and use with my clairsonic.I have a prime account and love that I save on shipping and have this product in my hand so fast.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but I feel like i also know nothing about skin care.</li>
            <li> I never had much acne in my teens and twenties, but when I turned 30 my skin went crazy. I used Murad twice daily and it worked for awhile, but eventually my acne came back. Someone suggested I might be overtreating my skin, so I opted to try Purity based on good reviews and claims that it was gentle. I first tried the original Purity, but it was very hard to rinse off and seemed to leave a residue. So then I tried this gel version and am so happy I did. I use it every night as a makeup remover and cleanser. It leaves me feeling clean with no residue and not overly dry. It feels very gentle. It&#x27;s not great for fighting acne, so I use an acne cleanser in the mornings. I have finally found a good balance!</li>
