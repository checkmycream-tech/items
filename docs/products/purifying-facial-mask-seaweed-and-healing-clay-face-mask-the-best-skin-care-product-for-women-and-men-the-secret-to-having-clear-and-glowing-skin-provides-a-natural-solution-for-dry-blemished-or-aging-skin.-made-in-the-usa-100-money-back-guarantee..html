            <li>It was nice to pamper myself from home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was provided this product for a completely honest &amp; Unbiased review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BeautySmoothies Luxury Seaweed Mask is awesome and is a real treat for my skin.</li>
            <li>After rinsing with warm water and drying my face I noticed my skin felt smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li>To top it off, I like its texture and its pleasant odor, unlike many others I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and remove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Removing was also very easy.</li>
            <li>She liked the results better than the spa treatments she has had.</li>
            <li>It went on very smooth and was very easy to take off.</li>
            <li>and I agree that it is safe for the most sensitive of skin types so people with acne will find this product perfect for their needs.</li>
            <li>My skin felt very smooth and</li>
            <li>I wear it for about 20 minutes and afterwards, my face feels very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s best to open the jar over a sink.  </li>
            <li>Felt refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love that the ingredients are so healthy.</li>
            <li>so glad I did buy it</li>
            <li>have used many clay and mud masks over the years</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as described (2 times a week) and hope to see more anti aging results</li>
            <li>and I get to spend more quality time with her.</li>
            <li>A friend who vacationed in Greece kept talking about how incredible her skin looked after the went to a natural mineral bath.</li>
            <li>noticed that the amount in the jar is almost 3 times more then</li>
            <li>Love this stuff will be ordering it again</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, after using this facial mask, I feel my skin is incredible!</li>
            <li>Received this wonderful facial mask on 07/01</li>
            <li>I as well liked the fact that it is a fully non-comedogenic product and is 100 percent free of animal</li>
            <li>After I used it my skin looks soft and clean and my pores looks smoother, I think it is really awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, and the smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I have very good established skin care routine and wasn&#x27;t looking for anything extra to add to it.</li>
            <li>It give it a smooth and healthy feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seaweed is great for acne because it has natural anti-inflammatory and exfoliating properties.</li>
            <li>Of course a mask will make your skin look great after you use it, but my skin just outright looked and felt better the next morning.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and remove once done with the treatment.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked the results afterwards, and it absolutely did not make me break out after using it!  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell, it doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;nice perfume\\&quot; smell to it or anything, so don&#x27;t be expecting something like that.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of seaweed, aloe vera and also Montmorillonite Clay which comes from the Charente region of France and is world famous for being packed full of minerals.  </li>
            <li>My skin cream, also all natural, as is this seaweed face mask, actually absorbed into my skin beautifully after removing the mask.</li>
            <li>I am an immediate loyal client!</li>
            <li>I used this mask twice and already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>have heard great things about seaweed, so I decided to try this facial mask, and I have to tell you, it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>After using the product she claims she loves it and the way it leaves your face all refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mask 3 times in the last 10 days and am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>My face looked smooth and the pores were tighter.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth, creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>I am a great fan of natural ingredients and so thought this product sounded just right for me.  </li>
            <li>I like the feel of the mask, really smooth and rich.</li>
            <li>I have allergies to many ingredients in all sorts of products and am particularly sensitive to smells and odors of many ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>That is a true and most reasonable</li>
            <li>cannot  say enough good things about this product</li>
            <li>Some cool water, a washcloth</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about this mask is how easy it was to put on.</li>
            <li>As a vegan I only buy natural products and I love seaweed, it has so many amazing things in</li>
            <li>So I am very happy with this Seaweed Facial Mask by Beauty Smoothies and will definitely be a regular customer.</li>
            <li>,the smell is not bad at all, and sooo worth it.</li>
            <li>I put on moisturizer and a little makeup, and even my husband noticed how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li>Really leaves your skin silky smooth when you remove it.  </li>
            <li>These facts alone already make this facial mask an amazing, must-have</li>
            <li>But, she does like to pamper herself and has had a couple of these type products at the local spas and really liked the results, so she was eager to give it a try.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite mask.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a face mask that seems to me more natural and now I think I have found one.  </li>
            <li>I love using all natural products.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin, and this facial mask is good even for oily skin...</li>
            <li>I love good facial cleansers and particularly this one Purifying Facial Mask - Seaweed and Healing Clay Face Mask by Beauty Smoothies .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with the results even after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>but when I tried this one and  I washed it off, my skin was free from any dirt, and felt super-fresh and squeaky clean, and not dry at all .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, the smell is thankfully not too strong, and you get a very generous amount that will last for months!</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t smell like a bay full of dead fish on a hot day, like I semi-expected, but rather fresh and clean like seaweed, and the fragrance was very light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always a little nervous to try new things because I&#x27;m sensitive, this was great!  </li>
            <li>you open the jar, you smell the seaside - the seaweed offers a light refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>The mask is truly a clay &amp; mud consistency, exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li>First of all  </li>
            <li>Same (or better) results at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty subjective</li>
            <li>Thanks Beauty Smoothies!</li>
            <li>I love this facial mask!</li>
            <li>Three weeks after using it, I noticed my face is more refreshed, and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>I once went in the natural mud baths by the sea in the Aeolian Islands off the foot of Italy and afterwards my skin felt fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I just tried this product today for the first time.</li>
            <li>product arrived right on time, and I highly recommend it to women of all ages.</li>
            <li>This mask is very nourishing and makes my skin feel really soft and clean.</li>
            <li>but this face mark certainly fits the bill.</li>
            <li>You only have one face, do all you can to keep it looking young and pretty. :)</li>
            <li>and it was soothing, not irritating.  </li>
            <li>my whole life, I kept smelling it and wondering to myself</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the name of it, but it really helped my very oily t-zone and didn&#x27;t burn my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I found this mask to be very cooling when I put it on</li>
            <li>Now I get to tell her about this fantastic cream that does all the same things</li>
            <li>and it came off smoothly and effortlessly with no scrubbing necessary.</li>
            <li>so you know it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>Every time I used it, it gave me a tingly, warm sensation as it dried on my face.</li>
            <li>This product is packed with natural minerals such as Aloe Vera, glycerin, vitamin B-12 and many others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>what most other masks have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a nice glow that I usually don&#x27;t have at my age</li>
            <li>She told me she would definitely buy more in the future, and If she had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 5 she rates it a 5!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main reason why I gave this product a shot</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh but not dry and dehydrated like many other face packs.  </li>
            <li>I have two little kids and time is precious.</li>
            <li>dried, the mask rinses off very easily; there is no harsh rubbing needed to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face was extremely dry before using this the first time, and after removing the mask the first time I used it, my face felt instantly hydrated, clean, and really soft!  </li>
            <li>I am an adult woman in my early 30&#x27;s who has acne-prone skin, thanks to hormonal imbalances (mainly PCOS).</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Plus, my face wasn&#x27;t bright red all over which is my usual reaction!</li>
            <li>buy a natural product with seaweed and complain and  expect it to smell like an unnatural perfume scent that you may be used to!  </li>
            <li>how moisturizing this plant is!I love all the natural ingredients in this facial mask and feel \\&quot;safer\\&quot; knowing I&#x27;m not absorbing a bunch of chemicals into my body but only pure ingredients.</li>
            <li>I usually stay clear of facial masks because they all seem to make me break out and burn on top of it!  </li>
            <li>There is no doubt I need Seaweed and Clay Facial Mask and, as far as I know, we can&#x27;t refrain aging, so I&#x27;ll just keep using it on my skin consistently for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a slightly runny, creamy liquid and it goes on so smoothly and easily without the grittiness you usually feel with a clay based mask.</li>
            <li>And since it&#x27;s an all natural product, there is some liquid separation.  </li>
            <li>This is a  natural  product with the natural scent of seaweed.</li>
            <li>I expect my products to smell natural and smell like the ingredients they are made from.</li>
            <li>If you want a natural product that works and smells natural,  this is it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After using beauty smoothies my skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li>Growing up near the ocean</li>
            <li>My wife told me that it claims to be a natural product, so it should have the smell of seaweed, not another smell  </li>
            <li>Now she is hinting that I play the role of the spa personnel and pamper her with candles, a massage and soft music...</li>
            <li>this seaweed and clay facial mask really showed its benefits</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I feel a lot safer when I use natural ingredients on my skin.</li>
            <li>As a woman in my 40s, I am always looking for skin care products with natural ingredients that reduce the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>My husband even says I now have a natural</li>
            <li>+ years later I still have very sensitive and oily skin-</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 13 minutes once applied, and felt the action on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this daily, and I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the mask Sunday night, and it calmed my face right down, and I felt back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this facial mask because it uses only natural ingredients including seaweed and clay.</li>

            <li> After using the product she claims she loves it and the way it leaves your face all refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask 3 times in the last 10 days and am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My face looked smooth and the pores were tighter.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth, creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> I am a great fan of natural ingredients and so thought this product sounded just right for me.  </li>
            <li> I like the feel of the mask, really smooth and rich.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to many ingredients in all sorts of products and am particularly sensitive to smells and odors of many ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> That is a true and most reasonable</li>
            <li> cannot  say enough good things about this product</li>
            <li> Some cool water, a washcloth</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about this mask is how easy it was to put on.</li>
            <li> As a vegan I only buy natural products and I love seaweed, it has so many amazing things in</li>
            <li> So I am very happy with this Seaweed Facial Mask by Beauty Smoothies and will definitely be a regular customer.</li>
            <li> ,the smell is not bad at all, and sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> I put on moisturizer and a little makeup, and even my husband noticed how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li> Really leaves your skin silky smooth when you remove it.  </li>
            <li> These facts alone already make this facial mask an amazing, must-have</li>
            <li> But, she does like to pamper herself and has had a couple of these type products at the local spas and really liked the results, so she was eager to give it a try.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite mask.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a face mask that seems to me more natural and now I think I have found one.  </li>
            <li> I love using all natural products.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin, and this facial mask is good even for oily skin...</li>
            <li> I love good facial cleansers and particularly this one Purifying Facial Mask - Seaweed and Healing Clay Face Mask by Beauty Smoothies .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with the results even after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> but when I tried this one and  I washed it off, my skin was free from any dirt, and felt super-fresh and squeaky clean, and not dry at all .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, the smell is thankfully not too strong, and you get a very generous amount that will last for months!</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t smell like a bay full of dead fish on a hot day, like I semi-expected, but rather fresh and clean like seaweed, and the fragrance was very light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little nervous to try new things because I&#x27;m sensitive, this was great!  </li>
            <li> you open the jar, you smell the seaside - the seaweed offers a light refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> The mask is truly a clay &amp; mud consistency, exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li> First of all  </li>
            <li> Same (or better) results at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty subjective</li>
            <li> Thanks Beauty Smoothies!</li>
            <li> I love this facial mask!</li>
            <li> Three weeks after using it, I noticed my face is more refreshed, and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> I once went in the natural mud baths by the sea in the Aeolian Islands off the foot of Italy and afterwards my skin felt fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I just tried this product today for the first time.</li>
            <li> product arrived right on time, and I highly recommend it to women of all ages.</li>
            <li> This mask is very nourishing and makes my skin feel really soft and clean.</li>
            <li> but this face mark certainly fits the bill.</li>
            <li> You only have one face, do all you can to keep it looking young and pretty. :)</li>
            <li> and it was soothing, not irritating.  </li>
            <li> my whole life, I kept smelling it and wondering to myself</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the name of it, but it really helped my very oily t-zone and didn&#x27;t burn my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I found this mask to be very cooling when I put it on</li>
            <li> Now I get to tell her about this fantastic cream that does all the same things</li>
            <li> and it came off smoothly and effortlessly with no scrubbing necessary.</li>
            <li> so you know it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> Every time I used it, it gave me a tingly, warm sensation as it dried on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is packed with natural minerals such as Aloe Vera, glycerin, vitamin B-12 and many others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> what most other masks have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a nice glow that I usually don&#x27;t have at my age</li>
            <li> She told me she would definitely buy more in the future, and If she had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 5 she rates it a 5!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main reason why I gave this product a shot</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh but not dry and dehydrated like many other face packs.  </li>
            <li> I have two little kids and time is precious.</li>
            <li> dried, the mask rinses off very easily; there is no harsh rubbing needed to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face was extremely dry before using this the first time, and after removing the mask the first time I used it, my face felt instantly hydrated, clean, and really soft!  </li>
            <li> I am an adult woman in my early 30&#x27;s who has acne-prone skin, thanks to hormonal imbalances (mainly PCOS).</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Plus, my face wasn&#x27;t bright red all over which is my usual reaction!</li>
            <li> buy a natural product with seaweed and complain and  expect it to smell like an unnatural perfume scent that you may be used to!  </li>
            <li> how moisturizing this plant is!I love all the natural ingredients in this facial mask and feel \\&quot;safer\\&quot; knowing I&#x27;m not absorbing a bunch of chemicals into my body but only pure ingredients.</li>
            <li> I usually stay clear of facial masks because they all seem to make me break out and burn on top of it!  </li>
            <li> There is no doubt I need Seaweed and Clay Facial Mask and, as far as I know, we can&#x27;t refrain aging, so I&#x27;ll just keep using it on my skin consistently for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slightly runny, creamy liquid and it goes on so smoothly and easily without the grittiness you usually feel with a clay based mask.</li>
            <li> And since it&#x27;s an all natural product, there is some liquid separation.  </li>
            <li> This is a  natural  product with the natural scent of seaweed.</li>
            <li> I expect my products to smell natural and smell like the ingredients they are made from.</li>
            <li> If you want a natural product that works and smells natural,  this is it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After using beauty smoothies my skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li> Growing up near the ocean</li>
            <li> My wife told me that it claims to be a natural product, so it should have the smell of seaweed, not another smell  </li>
            <li> Now she is hinting that I play the role of the spa personnel and pamper her with candles, a massage and soft music...</li>
            <li> this seaweed and clay facial mask really showed its benefits</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I feel a lot safer when I use natural ingredients on my skin.</li>
            <li> As a woman in my 40s, I am always looking for skin care products with natural ingredients that reduce the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> My husband even says I now have a natural</li>
            <li> + years later I still have very sensitive and oily skin-</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 13 minutes once applied, and felt the action on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this daily, and I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the mask Sunday night, and it calmed my face right down, and I felt back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this facial mask because it uses only natural ingredients including seaweed and clay.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, she loves it!</li>
            <li> but seriously this seaweed facial mask is absolutely fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But a friend of mine mentioned this mask that she purchased not so long ago and swears by it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I have dry skin prone to breakouts</li>
            <li> have dry skin and</li>
            <li> and oh boy, my skin definitely looks fresher, little blackheads are gone and even though the mask looks green and not very attractive, there is no unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> I have trouble with a lot of masks that are directed at middle aged women-</li>
            <li> and once it&#x27;s dry, your skin feels tight.</li>
            <li> It also has a slight smell of seaweed</li>
            <li> a little less pronounced.</li>
            <li> Plus, this mask did not leave my skin feeling too tight after I washed it</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager I used to use a green clay mask as part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> put this product to the test this past weekend.  </li>
            <li> I have just made up a small sample for my sister.</li>
            <li> the past, I have been using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I get really bad discoloration on my face due to the sun and people are asking me what am I using cause they are not visible.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews carefully before I ordered this item, and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was out all weekend in 90+ degree heat with humidity, and needless to say my face felt a bit stressed when I got home.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not difficult to take off face once you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get any scary burning sensations that I&#x27;ve had with some</li>
            <li> It looked gross(dark brown) but it didn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t disappointed</li>
            <li> Seaweed also helps to detoxify, which means that it can draw out all that nasty stuff in your pores!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I felt like Cleopatra when I used this mask. She was known for using clay masks to keep her skin beautiful and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you open the jar, you smell the seaside - the seaweed offers a light refreshing scent. The mask is truly a clay &amp; mud consistency, exactly as it should be. Nice container and packaging. I left it on for about 13 minutes once applied, and felt the action on my skin. I used a damp cloth to remove the clay and then rinsed throughly. My skin felt very smooth and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this mask a try!</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin, and this facial mask is good even for oily skin...there was no irritation whatsoever.  Of course a mask will make your skin look great after you use it, but my skin just outright looked and felt better the next morning. Plus, this mask did not leave my skin feeling too tight after I washed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this product to the test this past weekend.  I was out all weekend in 90+ degree heat with humidity, and needless to say my face felt a bit stressed when I got home.  I used the mask Sunday night, and it calmed my face right down, and I felt back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of product in the jar.  And since it&#x27;s an all natural product, there is some liquid separation.  So it&#x27;s best to open the jar over a sink.  Also, the contents should probably be stirred before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once dried, the mask rinses off very easily; there is no harsh rubbing needed to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with the results even after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> After I used it my skin looks soft and clean and my pores looks smoother, I think it is really awesome.</li>
            <li> As I have dry skin prone to breakouts it is always a challange to find something that works but this face mark certainly fits the bill. It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh but not dry and dehydrated like many other face packs.  Will definately be buying again.</li>
            <li> This clay mask makes my skin feel and look smoother. I use this daily, and I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a sea smell what would  you expect? Ever been to the sea?  Ever smell seaweed?  This is a  natural  product with the natural scent of seaweed. I expect my products to smell natural and smell like the ingredients they are made from. That is a true and most reasonable expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy a natural product with seaweed and complain and  expect it to smell like an unnatural perfume scent that you may be used to!  If you want chemicals in your products that  smell like perfume, shop elsewhere. If you want a natural product that works and smells natural,  this is it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, made my skin feel great.  I have sensitive skin and it was soothing, not irritating.  I&#x27;m always a little nervous to try new things because I&#x27;m sensitive, this was great!  Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> Felt refreshing on my skin. Love that the ingredients are so healthy. I plan to make this a part of my weekly beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I have two little kids and time is precious. I also have very sensitive skin. After using beauty smoothies my skin felt so soft. It was nice to pamper myself from home. I&#x27;m looking forward to doing it again soon. Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> I love good facial cleansers and particularly this one Purifying Facial Mask - Seaweed and Healing Clay Face Mask by Beauty Smoothies . Basically I figured their Seaweed mask would be good, too from the reviews written&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did buy it First of all  It&#x27;s made from seaweed! And it didn&#x27;t smell like a bay full of dead fish on a hot day, like I semi-expected, but rather fresh and clean like seaweed, and the fragrance was very light. Growing up near the ocean my whole life, I kept smelling it and wondering to myself so where&#x27;s the stink?&lt;br /&gt;I have used many clay and mud masks over the years but when I tried this one and  I washed it off, my skin was free from any dirt, and felt super-fresh and squeaky clean, and not dry at all . I put on moisturizer and a little makeup, and even my husband noticed how great my skin looked. And still does, a day later.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot  say enough good things about this product ,the smell is not bad at all, and sooo worth it. Thankyou Jennifer r Longisland Newyork I give 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really leaves your skin silky smooth when you remove it.  I am a fan!  I read the reviews carefully before I ordered this item, and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually stay clear of facial masks because they all seem to make me break out and burn on top of it!  I chose to try this one due to the all natural ingredients of Seaweed, Aloe Vera,and Bentonite Healing Clay put together into one mask!  My face was extremely dry before using this the first time, and after removing the mask the first time I used it, my face felt instantly hydrated, clean, and really soft!  I really liked the results afterwards, and it absolutely did not make me break out after using it!  I will continue to use it as described (2 times a week) and hope to see more anti aging results the more I use it! I definitely would recommend this purifying mask to others!  I am an immediate loyal client!</li>
            <li> I let my wife use this product since she uses these kinds of products and I really don&#x27;t. The first thing I noticed was the smell, it doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;nice perfume\\&quot; smell to it or anything, so don&#x27;t be expecting something like that. My wife told me that it claims to be a natural product, so it should have the smell of seaweed, not another smell  so that was a big plus for her. After using the product she claims she loves it and the way it leaves your face all refreshed and smooth. She might even convince me into trying this, but for now I shall take her word for it. She told me she would definitely buy more in the future, and If she had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 5 she rates it a 5! Thus being I rate this product a perfect 5 stars out of 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has helped you out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product for a completely honest &amp; Unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I asked her if she would like to try this before I ordered it as I didn&#x27;t want to imply that she &amp;#34;needed&amp;#34; anything to help her looks. (I think she is beautiful every day!) But, she does like to pamper herself and has had a couple of these type products at the local spas and really liked the results, so she was eager to give it a try. To make a long story short, she loves it! It makes her skin feel smoother and look healthier. She liked the results better than the spa treatments she has had. Now she is hinting that I play the role of the spa personnel and pamper her with candles, a massage and soft music... I&#x27;m in! Same (or better) results at a fraction of the cost and I get to spend more quality time with her. I think I will be trying this out myself.</li>
            <li> Great seaweed mask for your skin. Left my skin feeling refreshed and clean. Easy to apply and remove once done with the treatment.</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager I used to use a green clay mask as part of my beauty routine. I can&#x27;t remember the name of it, but it really helped my very oily t-zone and didn&#x27;t burn my cheeks. 20+ years later I still have very sensitive and oily skin- moms  just warning you that when you hit your 40&#x27;s your skin starts to behave like a teenager&#x27;s again! I have trouble with a lot of masks that are directed at middle aged women- alpha hydroxies are great- but they burn my skin. I found this mask to be very cooling when I put it on and it did a good job of tightening my skin and drying the oily parts without making my cheeks burn or over-dry. I also like that it smells a bit like the ocean. I&#x27;ve used this mask 3 times in the last 10 days and am really happy with the results. I also feel like it&#x27;s making my forehead wrinkles a little less pronounced. That&#x27;s pretty subjective I suppose, but I like how I feel when I&#x27;m using it and I like how I look when I rinse it away. In all- I&#x27;ll be buying another jar when I&#x27;ve used up this one. Thanks Beauty Smoothies!</li>
            <li> I have always raved about the benefits of Aloe and trust the research I&#x27;ve done that shows how moisturizing this plant is!I love all the natural ingredients in this facial mask and feel \\&quot;safer\\&quot; knowing I&#x27;m not absorbing a bunch of chemicals into my body but only pure ingredients.A friend who vacationed in Greece kept talking about how incredible her skin looked after the went to a natural mineral bath. Now I get to tell her about this fantastic cream that does all the same things but she wont have to travel to Greece!</li>
            <li> I have very good established skin care routine and wasn&#x27;t looking for anything extra to add to it. But a friend of mine mentioned this mask that she purchased not so long ago and swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really concerned about the seaweed smell and whether it will be too messy to apply on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well my friend let me try some of hers and oh boy, my skin definitely looks fresher, little blackheads are gone and even though the mask looks green and not very attractive, there is no unpleasant smell and it is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the amount in the jar is almost 3 times more then what most other masks have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem recommending it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It looked gross(dark brown) but it didn&#x27;t have a bad smell. I used this mask twice and already see a huge difference. I get really bad discoloration on my face due to the sun and people are asking me what am I using cause they are not visible. Love this stuff will be ordering it again</li>
            <li> By far my favorite mask. I have very sensitive skin and this mask doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It give it a smooth and healthy feel. I feel my face looks younger. It has a scent of the beach, makes me think if I was a mermaid this is what I would use. LOL...but seriously this seaweed facial mask is absolutely fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scoop it out and apply with my fingers. I like the feel of the mask, really smooth and rich. I wait with it on 15 to 20 minutes and wash out with warm water and then cold water. I feel Beauty Smoothies has improved the tone of my skin. My t-zones tend to get red a lot and Beauty Smoothies has even out the tone of my skin. My skin feels healthier, smoother and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended Beauty Smoothies to my sisters and mother. I hope the price of this product doesn&#x27;t increase once women discover how great Beauty Smoothies works.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt I need Seaweed and Clay Facial Mask and, as far as I know, we can&#x27;t refrain aging, so I&#x27;ll just keep using it on my skin consistently for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and this seaweed and clay facial mask really showed its benefits so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, after using this facial mask, I feel my skin is incredible! To top it off, I like its texture and its pleasant odor, unlike many others I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I feel a lot safer when I use natural ingredients on my skin. That&#x27;s the main reason why I gave this product a shot and now I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Received this wonderful facial mask on 07/01 and I wanted to use this for a couple of weeks before giving a proper review. I love this facial mask! Every time I used it, it gave me a tingly, warm sensation as it dried on my face. Three weeks after using it, I noticed my face is more refreshed, and my pores look smaller. You only have one face, do all you can to keep it looking young and pretty. :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this facial mask because it uses only natural ingredients including seaweed and clay. I as well liked the fact that it is a fully non-comedogenic product and is 100 percent free of animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t disappointed - just after one use my face was feeling youthful and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne rosacea and I agree that it is safe for the most sensitive of skin types so people with acne will find this product perfect for their needs.</li>
            <li> I am a great fan of natural ingredients and so thought this product sounded just right for me.  I am a fan of seaweed, aloe vera and also Montmorillonite Clay which comes from the Charente region of France and is world famous for being packed full of minerals.  I have been looking for a face mask that seems to me more natural and now I think I have found one.  I once went in the natural mud baths by the sea in the Aeolian Islands off the foot of Italy and afterwards my skin felt fabulous.  This is just as good, but now you can get it in a jar and have it at home!</li>
            <li> As a woman in my 40s, I am always looking for skin care products with natural ingredients that reduce the signs of aging. This product is packed with natural minerals such as Aloe Vera, glycerin, vitamin B-12 and many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard great things about seaweed, so I decided to try this facial mask, and I have to tell you, it is fantastic. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, and the smell is not bad at all. I wear it for about 20 minutes and afterwards, my face feels very smooth and silky. My husband even says I now have a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived right on time, and I highly recommend it to women of all ages. If you want smoother, younger-looking skin, you have to try this!</li>
            <li> I loved this mask! It has a pleasant fragrance, a very clean fragrance. It went on very smooth and was very easy to take off. My skin after felt great and I noticed a nice glow that I usually don&#x27;t have at my age, I am in my sixties. My face looked smooth and the pores were tighter. I would definitely recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> This is the best face mask I have ever used. I am not a big user of face masks, but that has just changed! I will definitely use it again later this week. I have just made up a small sample for my sister. My skin feels smoother and looks great. My skin cream, also all natural, as is this seaweed face mask, actually absorbed into my skin beautifully after removing the mask. It is very easy to use and remove. I love using all natural products. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am an adult woman in my early 30&#x27;s who has acne-prone skin, thanks to hormonal imbalances (mainly PCOS). I&#x27;ve been wanting to use a skincare product with seaweed in it for a while now because of its health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seaweed is great for acne because it has natural anti-inflammatory and exfoliating properties. Seaweed also helps to detoxify, which means that it can draw out all that nasty stuff in your pores! Best of all, it&#x27;s full of excellent nutrients and vitamins. These facts alone already make this facial mask an amazing, must-have product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BeautySmoothies Luxury Seaweed Mask is awesome and is a real treat for my skin. It&#x27;s easy to apply, the smell is thankfully not too strong, and you get a very generous amount that will last for months! This mask is very nourishing and makes my skin feel really soft and clean. My pores look smoother, and my blemishes heal faster! Plus, it contains wonderful ORGANIC ingredients like Bentonite Clay and Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have been using [[ASIN:B0014272VI Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque]], but for now I&#x27;m switching to BeautySmoothies Luxury Seaweed Mask.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to many ingredients in all sorts of products and am particularly sensitive to smells and odors of many ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This has pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;Not difficult to take off face once you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I chose this mask because of the ingredients. As a vegan I only buy natural products and I love seaweed, it has so many amazing things in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this mask is how easy it was to put on. It&#x27;s a slightly runny, creamy liquid and it goes on so smoothly and easily without the grittiness you usually feel with a clay based mask. I could feel it working during the 15 minutes but I didn&#x27;t get any scary burning sensations that I&#x27;ve had with some mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing was also very easy. Some cool water, a washcloth and it came off smoothly and effortlessly with no scrubbing necessary. Plus, my face wasn&#x27;t bright red all over which is my usual reaction! So I am very happy with this Seaweed Facial Mask by Beauty Smoothies and will definitely be a regular customer.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product today for the first time. It has a smooth, creamy consistency. It also has a slight smell of seaweed so you know it&#x27;s the real thing. Reminds me of the beach. You leave the mask on for about 15 minutes or so and once it&#x27;s dry, your skin feels tight. After rinsing with warm water and drying my face I noticed my skin felt smoother and firmer. I like this product a lot!</li>
