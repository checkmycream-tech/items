            <li>The smell is a minty scent which Ive begun to enjoy lol</li>
            <li>but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I put it on my edges and was impressed with how straight my edges looked.</li>
            <li>And my edges get kind of poofy</li>
            <li>honestly, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect of this product upon purchase.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this edge control.</li>
            <li>It was just ok, it did not hold done my edges at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Hick&#x27;s makes a much better edge controller.</li>
            <li>I love the hold to this</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>My favorite out of all the gels I use.</li>
            <li>and I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smooths my edges</li>
            <li>But so far so good!</li>
            <li>I think for kinkier air this would be a dream but maybe a bit much for my fine hair and fly aways.</li>
            <li>My jar had a huge crack when i took it out the packagevI&#x27;m so dissapointed, the shipping was okay</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced any white residue like most people complain about when it comes to edge controls.</li>
            <li>This is the best product on the market for smoothing down the edges of hair that African-American women have.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use to smooth my edges.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and you don&#x27;t need a bunch on.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel, and has a nice cooling sensation when applied.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s  not all sticky once you smooth it with a brush.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the reviews for this product, I was excited about trying it out.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I originally use cr√®me of nature argan oil edge control and was making an attempt to go for something more natural...</li>
            <li>It smooths down those &#x27;fly away&#x27; edges along the nape of your neck and your temples.</li>
            <li>Great for smoothing down the edges along the hairline.</li>
            <li>I think so far this is the best edge product I used that lay the edges down</li>
            <li>yes lay my edges down very nicely.</li>
            <li>As soon as I applied this pomade my hair looked like I got a fresh perm.</li>
            <li>Wearing a scarf to help it stay down is a good suggestion.</li>
            <li>My hair is lightly relaxed but naturally course.</li>
            <li>I like it better than regular gel.</li>
            <li>It works very well and does not cake up!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery 3 days!</li>
            <li>this edge tamer smells EXACTLY like the relaxer and shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am mixed but think it would be great for black girls hair.</li>
            <li>The shipping of the product was fast.</li>
            <li>The real test will be how it reacts when I go out in the south georgia humidity.</li>
            <li>I have never paid this much for an edge tamer before</li>
            <li>Organic Stimulator Edge Control or Jam Gel, much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I really like how well this holds and</li>
            <li>and too much def leave a build up.</li>
            <li>I have really frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I put some on my edges and it didn&#x27;t stay straight at all, gave it to my sister...</li>
            <li>I especially use it around retouch time to  keep the hair smooth.</li>
            <li>But  I run a small amount of this in my hair after my leave in (shea moisture jco) and curl control (ufd curly magic) and it sets my curls all the way off!</li>
            <li>This package is not available in most stores, so ordering online is my only option, however it&#x27;s worth the delay!</li>
            <li>I live in a humid climate so this would be the real test.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews I was super excited to try it, but that was my first and last order!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading other amazon reviews and just like any other edge control it looks good when you apply it</li>
            <li>the staying power isn&#x27;t that long for me or strong enough.  </li>
            <li>First, I did not buy on Amazon but prob will in the future.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find it in local stores, but thanks to Amazon, I can always order it!</li>
            <li>Best of all, this product doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty white residue that so many edge controls cause.</li>
            <li>This edge definer does just what it said it would define and smooth down my edges.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product for Black women who need something to smooth down their edges.  </li>
            <li>This product was the very 1st product I&#x27;ve used that actually worked for more than a day, with out having to re-apply it daily (if you tie down your edges with a scarf or velcro hair wrap).</li>
            <li>I love the product and it only takes a little, anymore than that</li>
            <li>and it turns from clear to greyish tone.  </li>
            <li>Works on natural and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for edges, I was skeptical before ordering, because of another product, very similar left a white film in  my hair.</li>
            <li>So far it does what it should do.</li>
            <li>This product works well around my edges with my twist-outs, and it works equally well when I have a straight style.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>If you have natural hair, I would not recommend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and it holds my edges without them curling up.</li>
            <li>Reviews bad and good do help a lot!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different gels/edge smoothers and I&#x27;m still in search of one that will give me hold all day without making my edges hard.</li>
            <li>I have a short natural tapered cut.</li>
            <li>This product did not hold my edges longer than 20mins and left the area very oily, it also left a white film on my hair!!</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, I was like &amp;#34;Damn, that is thick&amp;#34; and when I put a tiny bit on my edges, it plastered my hair down to my head.</li>
            <li>Does lay the hair down and it does look straight.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair, and it doesn&#x27;t hold for too long, especially in warmer weather.</li>

            <li> I have natural hair and purchase this product to tame my edges.</li>
            <li> kind of disappointed but again....</li>
            <li> The product works well laying down my edges for a short time period (maybe and couple of hours).</li>
            <li> I use this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it is the only one that has worked with keeping her edges down.</li>
            <li> Being a woman of color, it is sometimes difficult to find products that work just right for your day-to-day hair needs.</li>
            <li> I just got the smoother today and tested it out on only a small part of my THICK hair and 4 hours later, the area is still flat.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> it did not flake like other brands and it gives the shine without the greasy feeling...</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s Jam or any of the other pomades.</li>
            <li> A very little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> not so sticky feeling is my only complaint</li>
            <li> I have 4b hair, which means really thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> and it laid it down without being greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It is not oily or greasy and will hold down your edges.  </li>
            <li> and it slicks wavy and kinky hair down like a dream.</li>
            <li> Holds the edges down..</li>
            <li> and my edges are down for the day.</li>
            <li> I have used other edge control and this lays down my hair all day without it frizzing up!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Jamaican black castor oil</li>
            <li> That \\&quot;syntonics\\&quot; smell to say the less.</li>
            <li> I usually have a difficult time with my edges staying down for a long time before it frizzes back up.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and does not leave the white residue after applying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy, not too heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t cake up or flake when applied.</li>
            <li> If u have trouble with your edges whatsoever</li>
            <li> One small application in the morning</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t become hard or stiff.</li>
            <li> n doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy hard like gel.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> but I guess I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it something wrong with my jar</li>
            <li> This product is impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I faithfully use syntonics relaxer, base, and neutralizing shampoo but nothing else...</li>

            <li> BEST EVER FOR NATURAL HAIR!!!!</li>
            <li> The product works well laying down my edges for a short time period (maybe and couple of hours). I have natural hair, and it doesn&#x27;t hold for too long, especially in warmer weather. Wearing a scarf to help it stay down is a good suggestion. The shipping of the product was fast.</li>
            <li> Works on natural and relaxed hair. Especially when you tie your hair up</li>
            <li> I just got the smoother today and tested it out on only a small part of my THICK hair and 4 hours later, the area is still flat. The real test will be how it reacts when I go out in the south georgia humidity. But so far so good!</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews for this product, I was excited about trying it out. I am an African American female who is transitioning. I have tried many different gels/edge smoothers and I&#x27;m still in search of one that will give me hold all day without making my edges hard. I received my product and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I put it on my edges and was impressed with how straight my edges looked. The peppermint scent was very pleasant. The product did not feel greasy or sticky. My edges looked good and I was very happy. I live in a humid climate so this would be the real test. After several hours, my edges reverted back to their frizzy state and the edge tamer looked oily on the side of my face. I thought I&#x27;d found the \\&quot;One\\&quot; but I guess I was wrong. I have never paid this much for an edge tamer before and I don&#x27;t think I ever will again. I will stick with my cheaper gels which do the same thing. Organic Stimulator Edge Control or Jam Gel, much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really like how well this holds and it isn&#x27;t sticky.  I would recommend this product to those looking for an alternative to sticky products.  My hair is lightly relaxed but naturally course.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for Black women who need something to smooth down their edges.  It is not drying nor is it oily.  It is the only product I use for my edges.</li>
            <li> My jar had a huge crack when i took it out the packagevI&#x27;m so dissapointed, the shipping was okay but the product its self is great.</li>
            <li> I like how it does not strip the hair of moisture or break it off.  Does lay the hair down and it does look straight.  However I perspire a lot b/c of exercising so the staying power isn&#x27;t that long for me or strong enough.  I will purchase again.  I like it better than regular gel.</li>
            <li> Being a woman of color, it is sometimes difficult to find products that work just right for your day-to-day hair needs. This product was the very 1st product I&#x27;ve used that actually worked for more than a day, with out having to re-apply it daily (if you tie down your edges with a scarf or velcro hair wrap). It&#x27;s not too greasy, not too heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t cake up or flake when applied. It smooths down those &#x27;fly away&#x27; edges along the nape of your neck and your temples. I have recommended this product to all of my friends, co-workers, and even my hair stylist. It is the BEST hair product I&#x27;ve used for my hair&#x27;s edges yet!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for edges, I was skeptical before ordering, because of another product, very similar left a white film in  my hair. Reviews bad and good do help a lot!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. So far it does what it should do. Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  A very little bit goes a long way.  I used it on my daugher&#x27;s heat straightened hair and it laid it down without being greasy or sticky.  Also, if you use a scarf at night, there is no need to reapply it day after day.  The hold is just that good.  I recommend this to everyone, especially the transitioning ladies.  It even holds down natural hair!</li>
            <li> I love this edge control. It works very well and does not cake up! This package is not available in most stores, so ordering online is my only option, however it&#x27;s worth the delay! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the very best for women of color--it does what it says!  It is not oily or greasy and will hold down your edges.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was used on my edges when I visited the salon and it was great, but when I use it at home it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I wonder if it something wrong with my jar</li>
            <li> It was just ok, it did not hold done my edges at all.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it is the only one that has worked with keeping her edges down. It does have a minty smell which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. A little goes a long way so hopefully it will last for awhile. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great product!!!....it did not flake like other brands and it gives the shine without the greasy feeling...i would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Hick&#x27;s makes a much better edge controller.</li>
            <li> I think so far this is the best edge product I used that lay the edges down n doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy hard like gel. I just wish it was easier to apply and not so sticky feeling is my only complaint</li>
            <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t a fan but yeah this is the stuff for me. I love the hold to this I have thick hair so I tend to use this for my entire head sometimes and it slicks wavy and kinky hair down like a dream. I use this in conjunction with Jamaican black castor oil and I haven&#x27;t experienced any white residue like most people complain about when it comes to edge controls.The smell is a minty scent which Ive begun to enjoy lol</li>
            <li> First, I did not buy on Amazon but prob will in the future. I love this but I don&#x27;t use to smooth my edges. I have a short natural tapered cut. I have never learned to type my hair but I have a mix of waves and curls. But  I run a small amount of this in my hair after my leave in (shea moisture jco) and curl control (ufd curly magic) and it sets my curls all the way off! A little goes a long way and too much def leave a build up. Love love love. The Peppermint oil is a great addition. You can smell and feel it.  Pic is after the gym sweating.</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy hair And my edges get kind of poofy but this stuff is amazing. It goes on smoothly and you don&#x27;t need a bunch on. Plus it holds all day soo no re-applying or worrying. Defiantly recommend to people with curly or even frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery 3 days!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I have 4b hair, which means really thick and coarse hair. I usually have a difficult time with my edges staying down for a long time before it frizzes back up. As soon as I applied this pomade my hair looked like I got a fresh perm. It not greasy like Let&#x27;s Jam or any of the other pomades. If u have trouble with your edges whatsoever I definately recommend u get this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading other amazon reviews and just like any other edge control it looks good when you apply it but within 10 minutes my edges were sticking up again. It is very thick and does not leave the white residue after applying</li>
            <li> Works well but builds up on hair.</li>
            <li> This edge control is awesome!! It does the job perfectly.  I have used other edge control and this lays down my hair all day without it frizzing up! great product!!</li>
            <li> I have 4a type hair and this did not work for me at all.  I put some on my edges and it didn&#x27;t stay straight at all, gave it to my sister...</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for smoothing down the edges of hair that African-American women have. I will continue to tell all of my friends about coming to this site on Amazon.com to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Thee BEST edge control ever! A must buy!</li>
            <li> Holds the edges down..i have 4c hair...but after 10mins its like grease...</li>
            <li> I have natural, Black hair.....curly.  This product works well around my edges with my twist-outs, and it works equally well when I have a straight style.  I wish I could find it in local stores, but thanks to Amazon, I can always order it!</li>
            <li> yes lay my edges down very nicely.</li>
            <li> My favorite out of all the gels I use.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I am in love with this product. One small application in the morning and my edges are down for the day. Very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel, and has a nice cooling sensation when applied. Best of all, this product doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty white residue that so many edge controls cause. Hair doesn&#x27;t become hard or stiff. This product is impossible to find in stores. So I recommend buying it when you can find it!</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing down the edges along the hairline. I especially use it around retouch time to  keep the hair smooth. My stylist uses it at her salon and I was so happy to find the product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I was like &amp;#34;Damn, that is thick&amp;#34; and when I put a tiny bit on my edges, it plastered my hair down to my head. I think for kinkier air this would be a dream but maybe a bit much for my fine hair and fly aways. I am mixed but think it would be great for black girls hair.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a hairdresser - I love the way it smooths my edges and it&#x27;s  not all sticky once you smooth it with a brush. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I was super excited to try it, but that was my first and last order! I have natural hair and purchase this product to tame my edges. This product did not hold my edges longer than 20mins and left the area very oily, it also left a white film on my hair!! If you have natural hair, I would not recommend</li>
            <li> Awesome product recommended by my stylist. I&#x27;m natural and it holds my edges without them curling up. That makes a world of difference dealing w/ the humidity I deal with.</li>
            <li> This edge definer does just what it said it would define and smooth down my edges.  I love the product and it only takes a little, anymore than that and it turns from clear to greyish tone.  Nice product!</li>
            <li> honestly, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect of this product upon purchase. I faithfully use syntonics relaxer, base, and neutralizing shampoo but nothing else...this edge tamer smells EXACTLY like the relaxer and shampoo. That \\&quot;syntonics\\&quot; smell to say the less. I originally use cr√®me of nature argan oil edge control and was making an attempt to go for something more natural...but...I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this one again. kind of disappointed but again....hey, its syntonics.</li>
