            <li>This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years!</li>
            <li>Best Jurlique face wash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>One of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Best cleanser ever, and I have allergies to everything!  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>The cleanser works great.</li>
            <li>Great face cleanser even for removing makeup.  </li>
            <li>great stuff, great shopping experience</li>
            <li>It smes wonderful and feels lovely when I use it.</li>
            <li>However, the smell is not as pleasant as I would like - it has a pharmaceutical odor.</li>
            <li>After the face is very smooth, very good</li>
            <li>what more can I say ?!</li>
            <li>The smell of this product isn&#x27;t amazing</li>
            <li>Any break out or blemishes I experienced have subsided SIGNIFICANTLY.  </li>
            <li>It foams up great and does a pretty dang good job of washing my face.</li>
            <li>so need this kind (as opposed to the more moisturizing kind).</li>
            <li>It worked fine and the price was good.</li>
            <li>so pleased</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I bought my first one of these more than a year ago and it felt perfect from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I love this this foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling very clean, maybe too clean.</li>
            <li>They leave my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>This is very concentrated and does a nice job not drying out skin, but yet still maintaining balance.</li>
            <li>I have used Jurlique products and so far, they have been good to my skin.</li>
            <li>A very good gentle daily cleanser for removing make up and dirt without drying skin.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, gentle cleanser and another &amp;#34;home run&amp;#34; from the Jurlique line of skincare products.</li>
            <li>I love jurlique products and buying here was affordable and fast  </li>
            <li>Try this in the shower for the first time so you can truly experience the benefit of steam and the scent!  </li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised to see I was able to find it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Btw,</li>
            <li>I rarely give anything 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Love Jurlique Products and Amazon delivery is the best!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful natural way to care for your face.</li>
            <li>I fee like it takes away all the natural moisture in my face, so I compensate with more moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have to use face towelettes first to remove the vast majority of my makeup, but it does clean my bare face AMAZINGLY.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different cleansers and nothing else</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried (literally) thousands of facial products over my entire life and this foaming facial cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels clean, fresh, never dry and has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product cleanses without stripping and leaves my skin super soft and hydrates!</li>
            <li>I used to buy it at Whole Foods</li>
            <li>For a $30 cleanser, I expected more from this product.</li>
            <li>Jurlique products have done very well for my family.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant peppermint scent that actually works very well to open your pores and allow for deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need harsh scrubbing for it to work, which is great especially on the mature skin</li>
            <li>Another huge plus is that a small pump is more than enough</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have little acne, the most I get is hormonal</li>
            <li>I like how smell this cleanser - very natural herbs.</li>
            <li>Oops, good product, but it&#x27;s not suitable for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but the pump dispenser starts to leak after being used a short while and creates a mess.</li>
            <li>My fault, I haven&#x27;t read the product instruction clearly before I buy this item.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin really soft after washing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ingredients in this product are naturally derived from flowers and peppermint.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works well for my face, even in the dry climate in which I live.  </li>

            <li> A very good gentle daily cleanser for removing make up and dirt without drying skin. Don&#x27;t need harsh scrubbing for it to work, which is great especially on the mature skin</li>
            <li> The cleanser works great. However, the smell is not as pleasant as I would like - it has a pharmaceutical odor.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 10 years I swear by it I look 10 years younger  because I use this. Forget the doctor and the needles get some Jurlique!</li>
            <li> Thank you ..so pleased</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years! Love this product</li>
            <li> Best Jurlique face wash I&#x27;ve used. I have little acne, the most I get is hormonal but I take a supplement to aid in that. The smell of this product isn&#x27;t amazing but it isn&#x27;t terrible. It foams up great and does a pretty dang good job of washing my face. It doesn&#x27;t take off a lot of make up though. I have to use face towelettes first to remove the vast majority of my makeup, but it does clean my bare face AMAZINGLY.</li>
            <li> I keep one of these in my shower</li>
            <li> Great face cleanser even for removing makeup.  A little bit goes along way.  I used to buy it at Whole Foods but they stopped carrying it for whatever unknown reason.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see I was able to find it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I rarely give anything 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, gentle cleanser and another &amp;#34;home run&amp;#34; from the Jurlique line of skincare products. I never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have acne and wrinkles. Acne cleansers are too drying for my skin and anti-aging cleansers break me out. I bought my first one of these more than a year ago and it felt perfect from the first time I used it. My face feels clean, fresh, never dry and has not caused any breakouts. Another huge plus is that a small pump is more than enough so it lasts months. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After the face is very smooth, very good</li>
            <li> Love this product, but the pump dispenser starts to leak after being used a short while and creates a mess.</li>
            <li> This product smells very medicinal and that horrible scent lingered after I dried my face off.  It smelled so strange I had to rewash my face several times to get rid if the odor. I do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this this foaming cleanser. It leaves my skin really soft after washing. I have used Jurlique products and so far, they have been good to my skin. They leave my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> One of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used. Treat yoself.</li>
            <li> For a $30 cleanser, I expected more from this product. My T zone is still an issue and for a \\&quot;wash the day away\\&quot; product it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup as well as I would like. I doubt I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love Jurlique Products and Amazon delivery is the best!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful natural way to care for your face.</li>
            <li> This is very concentrated and does a nice job not drying out skin, but yet still maintaining balance. A bit expensive but it does last a long time. Jurlique products have done very well for my family.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser ever, and I have allergies to everything!  So long as a product is organic, my skin is much less sensitive.  This product cleanses without stripping and leaves my skin super soft and hydrates!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I&#x27;ve tried many different cleansers and nothing else leaves my skin feeling so clean. It smes wonderful and feels lovely when I use it. I love jurlique products and buying here was affordable and fast  I bought one as a gift also.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well for my face, even in the dry climate in which I live.  I have quite oily skin so need this kind (as opposed to the more moisturizing kind).</li>
            <li> I like how smell this cleanser - very natural herbs. I know that its organic Australian cosmetic,&lt;br /&gt;so i trust them. But 4 stars only because its a little dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I start out every review for Jurlique products the same way.  Too often people overlook the ingredients of the products they use as the source of skin issues they experience.  I&#x27;ve tried (literally) thousands of facial products over my entire life and this foaming facial cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this product are naturally derived from flowers and peppermint.  It has a pleasant peppermint scent that actually works very well to open your pores and allow for deep cleaning.  I currently use this product twice a day, and have done so for about one year.  Any break out or blemishes I experienced have subsided SIGNIFICANTLY.  Probably 70% at the least.  Try this in the shower for the first time so you can truly experience the benefit of steam and the scent!  Just remember to shake this before each use as the ingredients can settle.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has a weird odd. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as what I bought from department store. I won&#x27;t buy it again from here.</li>
            <li> great stuff, great shopping experience</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have to write nineteen words to submit this review — what more can I say ?! It worked fine and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Oops, good product, but it&#x27;s not suitable for my dry skin. My fault, I haven&#x27;t read the product instruction clearly before I buy this item.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling very clean, maybe too clean. I fee like it takes away all the natural moisture in my face, so I compensate with more moisturizer.</li>
