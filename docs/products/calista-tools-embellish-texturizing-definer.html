            <li>Just a pea size amount, give great body and control to hair style.</li>
            <li>Great for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>but you get it its a great product</li>
            <li>Wonderful and unique product</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The product smells nice, kind of baby-powdery.  </li>
            <li>But it looked so interesting, and a friend described it being used at her own hairdresser&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and love it.  </li>
            <li>I really love this hair product</li>
            <li>The product is easily washed off of your hands.  </li>
            <li>It is not as easy as they show on TV  Do not care for the product.</li>
            <li>It has an extremely strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>So strong, in fact, it made me sick...literally.</li>
            <li>Update Day 2: the fragrance is still so strong it would compete with any perfume I might want to wear.</li>
            <li>I find it is great for my short, curly, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you do not use too much on your hair.</li>
            <li>It takes practice to get this right</li>
            <li>This is the most expensive good for nothing product.  </li>
            <li>I either need to play around with it some more, since I have never used it before, or  it could just  be that my hair is too long to&lt;</li>
            <li>Product works very well.</li>
            <li>and I think that really anybody can use this product</li>
            <li>makes my hair much to sticky</li>
            <li>I have short thin hair and it works perfectly for me - adds volume and texture and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>On my first try, I dispensed a little more than needed.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to achieve greater definition, but this product did nothing but weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>The only caution I have is that you need to really work the product before scrunching it into your hair (after hair has been almost completely styled); otherwise it cannot do its job.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I simply can&#x27;t get past the strong smell.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t what i expected, and it&#x27;s very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I have short thick hair and it gives me tremendous volume.</li>

            <li> Not sticky and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> In a previous review I did mention that the package was damaged and the product had leaked out leaving me with only a partial fill.  </li>

            <li> I did not mention that the thin bubble wrap inside a lightly padded envelope was not sufficient protection because the tab that breaks off so the button can be pushed was broken and it seemed like something heavy must have landed on the packed causing the button to be pressed inside the wrap and therefore causing the product to be pushed out..  </li>

            <li> but it deserves no star at all, the product is bad for my hair, I already trashed it!</li>

            <li> Just a pea size amount, give great body and control to hair style. Not sticky and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> With my shoulder length, straight hair, keeping body and curls in it is nearly impossible; until I tried Calista! The product does not weigh your hair down, does not feel sticky or stiff.  The only caution I have is that you need to really work the product before scrunching it into your hair (after hair has been almost completely styled); otherwise it cannot do its job.  A dime size squirt in the palm of your hand (followed by clapping the hands together until strings form) is all you need for longer hair.  My style and curls last all day now!</li>
            <li> Product works very well. However, I noticed I have an allergy to the styling foam, not sure about this product though. Have not tried it again since that discovery.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Great for my curly hair. Just make sure you do not use too much on your hair.</li>
            <li> I just received this product after watching it being demonstrated on TV.  As always, I am leery.  But it looked so interesting, and a friend described it being used at her own hairdresser&#x27;s.  I find it is great for my short, curly, fine hair.  Gave immediate body.  Not greasy or too heavy.  On my first try, I dispensed a little more than needed.  As other reviewers have said, you need very little.  The product smells nice, kind of baby-powdery.  Keep your hands over the sink as you \\&quot;clap\\&quot;, and I found no fiber mess in the bathroom.  The product is easily washed off of your hands.  It may take one or two tries to see how little is needed.  But I like it.</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t get past the strong smell. It doesn&#x27;t diminish at all. I have watched demo&#x27;s and the scent isn&#x27;t mentioned.</li>
            <li> It takes practice to get this right but you get it its a great product and I think that really anybody can use this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m following the directions correctly. I either need to play around with it some more, since I have never used it before, or  it could just  be that my hair is too long to&lt;br /&gt;do what I wanted the product to do for me.</li>
            <li> I have read some of the other reviews from people who don&#x27;t like this product. Perhaps they don&#x27;t know how to use it. Put just a small amount in the palm pf your hand, rub palms together until product feels dry and then finger comb it through your hair. I have short thick hair and it gives me tremendous volume. I&#x27;ll buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> I suppose this would work well on short, layered hair styles, but did&lt;br /&gt;nothing for my hair which is finely textured and fairly thick with slight layering&lt;br /&gt;and just below my shoulders.  I was hoping to see lift at the root, but this didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> It has an extremely strong fragrance. So strong, in fact, it made me sick...literally. Wow.  Update Day 2: the fragrance is still so strong it would compete with any perfume I might want to wear.</li>
            <li> This is the most expensive good for nothing product.  I gave one star because I had to pick something but it deserves no star at all, the product is bad for my hair, I already trashed it!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what i expected, and it&#x27;s very sticky.  makes my hair feel dirty so i would not rec9ommend it at all</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and love it.  I have short thin hair and it works perfectly for me - adds volume and texture and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It is not as easy as they show on TV  Do not care for the product. Sorry but I did not care for it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the sticky and gooey way it goes on your hair....  my hair is awful after I use it.</li>
            <li> I use this every day after styling my hair, and it helps it hold all day! I bought extras so I don&#x27;t run out</li>
            <li> Wonderful and unique product</li>
            <li> I have short, thick, wavy  hair.  I was hoping to achieve greater definition, but this product did nothing but weigh my hair down.  My hair felt dirty, and looked greasy. I tried using this several times, following the directions carefully and always got the same results.</li>

I really love this hair product but I do think it should be shipped in a sturdy box to prevent damage to the tab.</li>
