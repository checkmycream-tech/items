            <li>I don&#x27;t leave home with out it - unless I&#x27;m doing yard work. :)</li>
            <li>It looks quite simple, but smells quite awesome.</li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll be complimented, you fall in love with the smell, no wonder its irresistible to women</li>
            <li>I have yet to try the product, but I saved a bundle, and am confident I got what was advertised.  </li>
            <li>i am gonna buy some more asap</li>
            <li>I told him it was the magic of the cologne that did it.</li>
            <li>love love love this scent, I bought for me my neice and husband.</li>
            <li>We love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>So delicious and sexy that I just want to be around him constantly.</li>

            <li>had a shelf age of more than a year</li>
            <li>and it makes me feel better.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found the best deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Light Blue scores great with bottle design, using a \\&quot;frosted\\&quot; glass bottle with great etching of the Dolce logo -</li>
            <li>This has a very clean, but also sexy aroma to it.</li>
            <li>I thought her D &amp; G Light Blue smelled great on her but wasn&#x27;t too sure his and her sets were a good thing.</li>
            <li>and it was a happy accident, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>this is a Great find for me, again I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I was wearing (Which was a pretty good feeling knowing you smell good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew my husband would love it too because it was a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful lasts all day, light and simple smell never over powering</li>
            <li>the bottle is very cool also.  </li>
            <li>I smelled dozens of colognes looking for the perfect scent- not too overbearing, not too sweet, definitely not too musky.  </li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing and light, with a citrus slant to it.</li>
            <li>a&lt;br /&gt;lingering stink, but light &amp; fresh.&lt;br /&gt;You will really love it.</li>
            <li>Packaged safely and securely.</li>
            <li>stuff does not smell all that great directly as you spray it on.</li>
            <li>Light Blue is a very pleasant scent, easy on the nose, and will get you compliments.  </li>
            <li>Nice perfum, price is just right.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for well-packed box!We are satisfied with everything!</li>
            <li>It was a Christmas present for my son who loved it!</li>
            <li>Dolce &amp; Gabbana is one of my favorite colognes &amp; when I sprayed this on, it did not at all smell like the original.</li>
            <li>But I received a refund very quickly, so in terms of customer service i give it a 100%.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice light fresh smell that is uplifting and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and people near you can breathe and of course its enjoyed by who it really counts great product for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>He does not wear fragrances often and when he does he does not like it when they are too strong.</li>
            <li>i would strongly recommend the brand.</li>
            <li>my husband doesnt like his cologne too strong.</li>
            <li>The bottle seemed to be too full and leaked from the top sprayer.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful scent for a guy and definitely can make a girls head turn.</li>
            <li>Love this scent; slightly sweet, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I experienced was a faulty bottle.</li>
            <li>This product is offered at a fabulous price.</li>
            <li>This is such a great scent.</li>
            <li>I like this for its light scent.  </li>
            <li>I have used Royal Copenhagen products for years and still find that they are the best for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>and I would enjoy it..</li>
            <li>Bought this item and it arrived WELL PACKED and secure.  </li>
            <li>and he forgot he  already had \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot; on</li>
            <li>D&amp;G light Blue smells just like the sample - maybe better!!  </li>
            <li>Right now my favorite scent is \\&quot;The</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>My new favorite cologne for my husband!  </li>
            <li>I bought this Product D &amp; G Light Blue, 4.2 oz, very good price came packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>but I feel as if though someone sabotaged the original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good in the background where you barely notice it.  </li>
            <li>I like the cool and light smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is original.</li>
            <li>the Light Blue was for my son and he loved it.</li>
            <li>It is a long way to the top if you want to rock-n-roll..!!</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased this fragrance in it&#x27;s female adaptation for my girlfriend and loved the way it smelled on her.</li>
            <li>it has a nice clean but masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Came across light blue and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>good perfume, only has almost no aroma, and there to apply too.</li>
            <li>I love the clean, masculine but not too strong smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>It has a hint of sweet but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>The cap is off colored and lighter in weight than the true bottle.</li>
            <li>The sprayer mechanism is elongated compared to the true bottle.</li>
            <li>It is very versatile, appropriate for any season and any occasion.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product</li>
            <li>Mild and not very overpowering, a great spring and summer cologne.</li>
            <li>to the perfume itself - I have a very unique taste when it comes to perfumes/colognes and generally am very picky when it comes to buying one.</li>
            <li>It is a subtle and the best of the aqua scents I&#x27;ve come across for men.&lt;br /&gt;FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and stays fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>Got it so quick..</li>
            <li>Item came quickly.</li>
            <li>The shipping of the product was quick.</li>
            <li>Guess we will have to purchase a smaller one too! :) :)</li>
            <li>It is mildly spendy, but you get a lot of squirts for the money.  </li>
            <li>arrived quickly as well.will buy again soon</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about what I would end up with since this deal is unheard of, but sure enough, the product is just as perfect as it would be at full-price from a department store.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the entire experience.</li>
            <li>but apparently Amazon does not allow returns of hazardous materials (even though they have no problem selling them to you)</li>
            <li>It is fresh, light, long lasting and has good projection in warm weather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells slightly fruity, slightly sweet, and fresh but has this great earthy finish that says \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I did not expect this from Amazon seeing as though all the other products I have ordered from them have been impeccable...</li>
            <li>It then settles down to a musky evergreen fragrance that is very nice.  </li>
            <li>a kenneth cole reaction kind of smell, or lacoste essential, and this one really fits in, its not that strong</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has an extremely long lasting scent - more than anyone else i have ever owned - and you have to own one to realize how unique refreshing the scent is.&lt;br /&gt;Ill highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Have never actually smelled this in a store, but there was an insert in a magazine I subscribe to and thought it would be something that I liked.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s def worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Blue is a nice, manly scent.</li>
            <li>Light Blue is a lighter scent, a bit more floral with bergamot undertones.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>but if liked \\&quot;Blue by Dolce Gabbana\\&quot; you definitely gonna like love the \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love the D &amp; G light blue for man!..</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Light Blue Dolce Gabbana\\&quot; perfume is my son&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>, I was told to dispose of hazardous materials in accordance with state and local laws</li>
            <li>We still laugh about it.</li>
            <li>I always keep looking for some fresh smell until I found this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Scent is fresh, crisp, light, citrus, sweet yet very masculine!  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is great and most importantly, long lasting which tells me it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>And buying it on Amazon made it a heck of deal too, saving more than $10 if I would have purchased at a major department store!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this brand, and this is the 2nd bottle of this particular cologne that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Amazon has resolved this situation for me right away..</li>
            <li>They reimbursed me and had no qualms about making things right.</li>
            <li>Yep, she was right.</li>
            <li>So, for everyday used, this is super good.</li>
            <li>First things first, the delivery was quick and hassle free.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming and very sophisticated, sexy and modern.</li>
            <li>But if it&#x27;s you first try it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Light Blue for four years now, and I am confident I know what the true Light Blue looks and smells like.</li>
            <li>They shipped it quickly which made this very convenient for me.</li>
            <li>Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue is a very distinct smell that I can smell from a mile away.</li>
            <li>After I bought this item, the cologne did not last more than 10-15 minutes before fading away.  </li>
            <li>First of all, let me state</li>
            <li>At first when I bought it, the smell seemed to go away after 10 minutes (To my sense of smell), but wherever I went if it was minutes or hours after, I always got compliments on my Cologne</li>
            <li>Perhaps I only need more time to adjust.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly who I received my product from</li>
            <li>BONUS-- VERY AFFORDABLE!</li>
            <li>reviews say the scent should last for more than 10hours</li>
            <li>This is one of my top preferred products to wear outside of work.  </li>
            <li>If you are big and more imposing, it balances things out well, imo.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to match the heat of the summer, then this refreshing fragrance is one possible solution.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>first item amazon sent me</li>
            <li>I normally buy this product from the mall(1.5 to 2 hours away), but I needed it quickly and was not headed out of town anytime soon.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper then buying in the store and a large bottle!</li>
            <li>Smells great and stays on for a long long time.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old grandson has recently discovered girls and nice clothing.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely positive this is a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li>Love D&amp;G Blue and Light Blue, both.</li>
            <li>I could wear either of these every day, and pretty much do.</li>
            <li>Because it is so light, it&#x27;s not particularly manly, but this is not necessarily bad.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly like the Light Blue I had, the sent wouldn&#x27;t take.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and with all the comments I get from other people, evidently they do, too.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not musty (which is a huge plus for my taste) and it can be worn all seasons in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the price.</li>
            <li>but you do not need much.</li>
            <li>Price through Amazon very resonable as always vs the store.</li>
            <li>this fast...</li>
            <li>really cannot think of any CONS from this brand of Cologne for the time being that I have owned</li>
            <li>It is so masculine and fresh.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle aroma to it that doesn&#x27;t scream for attention or overpower anyone that gets too close to you.</li>
            <li>My purchase of D&amp;G Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana for Men was just what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>D &amp; G Light Blue is</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I took it to Macy&#x27;s to compare it against the real thing and</li>
            <li>I really recomend it get it</li>
            <li>Product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Just beware of what you&#x27;re paying for - not the real thing.</li>
            <li>So who ever received what I paid for Thanks never using AMAZON again sally reyes</li>
            <li>They do with D&amp;G Light Blue.  </li>
            <li>To the untrained eye, and nose, this could be passed off for Light Blue, but I will not be fooled.</li>
            <li>So I believe this is a real one and not a knock off.</li>
            <li>i bought the D&amp;G light blue for my husband for Christmas ,  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment and no problems.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of haters out of there of Dolce Men&#x27;s Light Blue, but I say, \\&quot;Not so Fast\\&quot;..!!  </li>
            <li>I give Light Blue 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, but definitely does not last.</li>
            <li>My husband wears Egoiste Platinum and this is my other favorite on him.</li>
            <li>I knew the scent was not the same as the original</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, D &amp; G is an outstanding product that sweeps the floor with other competitive brands.</li>
            <li>smells great, but fragrance doesnt last long enough.</li>
            <li>it smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li>Maybe D &amp; G has a stronger more lasting scent that lasts longer but smells the same as light blue.</li>
            <li>things considered, Light Blue falls just outside my Top 10, but I definitely recommend adding to your collection.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cologne for years now and this year I bought some and someone purchased me some for Christmas right at the same time, I literally had two unopened boxes of this exact item.</li>
            <li>I got 2 D and G Light blue bottle and the bottle is very old with oil in it-</li>
            <li>I use D&amp;G Light Blue everyday at college and the ladies love the scent.</li>
            <li>This is for the younger guys that grew up on Cool Water. . . .</li>
            <li>It is more then twice as much as what I bought at Dillards, and $20 cheaper then that little bottle.  </li>
            <li>Coming out of the bottle, Light Blue offers notes of aquatic, citrus, and a bit of pepper.  </li>
            <li>sillage is surprisingly high - I had given up on the projection when asked about the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is  subtle fragrance, very sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have loved Kenneth Cole Thermal Reaction, Kenneth Cole Black, Liz Claiborne Sport, Nautica Blue, Ferrari Black, Bvlgari BVL, Bvlgari Aqua, Terre-d-Hermes and now D&amp;G Light Blue!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant because of reviews claiming fakes but as far as I can tell, this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I bought a small bottle of this because a girl that I was dating told me that it was her favorite and that she really wanted me to wear it.  </li>
            <li>I have worn cologne all my life and rarely had total strangers comment on my scent.  </li>
            <li>Would rather purchase from here and save a few dollars instead of driving to the mall which isn&#x27;t close and paying more.</li>
            <li>Amazon sent out package but there was a computer glitch and it went right by my house back to sender.</li>
            <li>I have used D &amp; G Light Blue from an unnamed high end department store and this purchase is no different from their stock.  </li>
            <li>Light Blue has potential Wow Factor..!!  </li>
            <li>did not want a used product , I paid for new &amp; unopened and did not receive this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While wearing this today, and shopping for new additions to my collection, was asked about the fragrance...</li>
            <li>the lady at the counter said that she felt this was a cheap imitation.</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle of light blue..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon (I had locally bought it through the Military BX)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;out of most colognes I have had over the years</li>
            <li>Is not as deep, and for that the smell goes out very fast.....</li>
            <li>I hope future customers are aware who they purchase from.</li>
            <li>think the cologne smells OK, but not sure as I have nothing to compare</li>
            <li>but I am still looking for that scent that is not too loud or offensive but stays with you all day!</li>
            <li>an Eau De Toilette is a cologne known for its sweet distinctive scent that sets itself apart from other colognes.</li>
            <li>Even the packaging is fancy, as the D&amp;G box has a soft velvet texture.</li>
            <li>As far as my experience goes, Amazon always delivers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to heavier/muskier old school.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional and if used sparingly I can even wear it to work without adversely affecting patients.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>But this should last much longer, probably about 4 hours.</li>
            <li>even quite a few I don&#x27;t know seem to really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>The item has soft smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; so it is exciting to find other products for it.</li>
            <li>When I narrowed it down (I also have Chanel de Blu, Oscar, Tommy and others) and found it to be my Light Blue</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will now be a regular purchase of mine and it comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would equate it to the end of the day when normal colognes start to wear off and you are left with the hint of it&#x27;s existence except in this case</li>
            <li>I normally use 4-5 different fragrances</li>
            <li>Though subtle at first, the fragrance creeps up on you, drawing attention to its compelling scent.  </li>
            <li>D &amp; G Light Blue is an Eau De Toilette that can be worn everyday.</li>
            <li>I was told by a rep that if the product comes direct from Amazon, and not a third party seller, it is direct from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>I sense as if though its been watered down and I am probably right.</li>
            <li>Its not too overwhelming BUT its not too weak either.</li>
            <li>only (minimal) downside is the price/value - Light Blue is riding the female version, and</li>
            <li>As with all fine colognes, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little bit heavier than the woman&#x27;s version, but it still is a wonderfully fresh, citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li>So, great product but bad purchase method.</li>
            <li>Just a general warning to everyone who buys cologne online.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of buying through a personal buyer instead of buying directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It smells similar to Light Blue, but is unmistakeably NOT light blue.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than other places, I think this is not fake but probably was just sitting idle in some warehouse for few years.</li>
            <li>Disappointed with the light almost elusive smell of Light Blue.</li>
            <li>Very weak colonge, didn&#x27;t \\&quot;stay on\\&quot; for more then 15min.  </li>
            <li>When recieved, the bottle was less then half full.</li>

            <li> I have yet to try the product, but I saved a bundle, and am confident I got what was advertised.  </li>
            <li> i am gonna buy some more asap</li>
            <li> I told him it was the magic of the cologne that did it.</li>
            <li> love love love this scent, I bought for me my neice and husband.</li>
            <li> We love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> So delicious and sexy that I just want to be around him constantly.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne</li>
            <li> had a shelf age of more than a year</li>
            <li> and it makes me feel better.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found the best deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Light Blue scores great with bottle design, using a \\&quot;frosted\\&quot; glass bottle with great etching of the Dolce logo -</li>
            <li> This has a very clean, but also sexy aroma to it.</li>
            <li> I thought her D &amp; G Light Blue smelled great on her but wasn&#x27;t too sure his and her sets were a good thing.</li>
            <li> and it was a happy accident, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this is a Great find for me, again I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I was wearing (Which was a pretty good feeling knowing you smell good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew my husband would love it too because it was a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful lasts all day, light and simple smell never over powering</li>
            <li> the bottle is very cool also.  </li>
            <li> I smelled dozens of colognes looking for the perfect scent- not too overbearing, not too sweet, definitely not too musky.  </li>
            <li> The smell is refreshing and light, with a citrus slant to it.</li>
            <li> a&lt;br /&gt;lingering stink, but light &amp; fresh.&lt;br /&gt;You will really love it.</li>
            <li> Packaged safely and securely.</li>
            <li> stuff does not smell all that great directly as you spray it on.</li>
            <li> Light Blue is a very pleasant scent, easy on the nose, and will get you compliments.  </li>
            <li> Nice perfum, price is just right.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for well-packed box!We are satisfied with everything!</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas present for my son who loved it!</li>
            <li> Dolce &amp; Gabbana is one of my favorite colognes &amp; when I sprayed this on, it did not at all smell like the original.</li>
            <li> But I received a refund very quickly, so in terms of customer service i give it a 100%.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice light fresh smell that is uplifting and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Great smell and people near you can breathe and of course its enjoyed by who it really counts great product for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> He does not wear fragrances often and when he does he does not like it when they are too strong.</li>
            <li> i would strongly recommend the brand.</li>
            <li> my husband doesnt like his cologne too strong.</li>
            <li> The bottle seemed to be too full and leaked from the top sprayer.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful scent for a guy and definitely can make a girls head turn.</li>
            <li> Love this scent; slightly sweet, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I experienced was a faulty bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is offered at a fabulous price.</li>
            <li> This is such a great scent.</li>
            <li> I like this for its light scent.  </li>
            <li> I have used Royal Copenhagen products for years and still find that they are the best for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> and I would enjoy it..</li>
            <li> Bought this item and it arrived WELL PACKED and secure.  </li>
            <li> and he forgot he  already had \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot; on</li>
            <li> D&amp;G light Blue smells just like the sample - maybe better!!  </li>
            <li> Right now my favorite scent is \\&quot;The</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> My new favorite cologne for my husband!  </li>
            <li> I bought this Product D &amp; G Light Blue, 4.2 oz, very good price came packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> but I feel as if though someone sabotaged the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good in the background where you barely notice it.  </li>
            <li> I like the cool and light smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is original.</li>
            <li> the Light Blue was for my son and he loved it.</li>
            <li> It is a long way to the top if you want to rock-n-roll..!!</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this fragrance in it&#x27;s female adaptation for my girlfriend and loved the way it smelled on her.</li>
            <li> it has a nice clean but masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Came across light blue and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> good perfume, only has almost no aroma, and there to apply too.</li>
            <li> I love the clean, masculine but not too strong smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> It has a hint of sweet but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> The cap is off colored and lighter in weight than the true bottle.</li>
            <li> The sprayer mechanism is elongated compared to the true bottle.</li>
            <li> It is very versatile, appropriate for any season and any occasion.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product</li>
            <li> Mild and not very overpowering, a great spring and summer cologne.</li>
            <li> to the perfume itself - I have a very unique taste when it comes to perfumes/colognes and generally am very picky when it comes to buying one.</li>
            <li> It is a subtle and the best of the aqua scents I&#x27;ve come across for men.&lt;br /&gt;FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and stays fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Got it so quick..</li>
            <li> Item came quickly.</li>
            <li> The shipping of the product was quick.</li>
            <li> Guess we will have to purchase a smaller one too! :) :)</li>
            <li> It is mildly spendy, but you get a lot of squirts for the money.  </li>
            <li> arrived quickly as well.will buy again soon</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about what I would end up with since this deal is unheard of, but sure enough, the product is just as perfect as it would be at full-price from a department store.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the entire experience.</li>
            <li> but apparently Amazon does not allow returns of hazardous materials (even though they have no problem selling them to you)</li>
            <li> It is fresh, light, long lasting and has good projection in warm weather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells slightly fruity, slightly sweet, and fresh but has this great earthy finish that says \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I did not expect this from Amazon seeing as though all the other products I have ordered from them have been impeccable...</li>
            <li> It then settles down to a musky evergreen fragrance that is very nice.  </li>
            <li> a kenneth cole reaction kind of smell, or lacoste essential, and this one really fits in, its not that strong</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an extremely long lasting scent - more than anyone else i have ever owned - and you have to own one to realize how unique refreshing the scent is.&lt;br /&gt;Ill highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Have never actually smelled this in a store, but there was an insert in a magazine I subscribe to and thought it would be something that I liked.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s def worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Blue is a nice, manly scent.</li>
            <li> Light Blue is a lighter scent, a bit more floral with bergamot undertones.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> but if liked \\&quot;Blue by Dolce Gabbana\\&quot; you definitely gonna like love the \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love the D &amp; G light blue for man!..</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Light Blue Dolce Gabbana\\&quot; perfume is my son&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> , I was told to dispose of hazardous materials in accordance with state and local laws</li>
            <li> We still laugh about it.</li>
            <li> I always keep looking for some fresh smell until I found this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Scent is fresh, crisp, light, citrus, sweet yet very masculine!  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is great and most importantly, long lasting which tells me it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> And buying it on Amazon made it a heck of deal too, saving more than $10 if I would have purchased at a major department store!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this brand, and this is the 2nd bottle of this particular cologne that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Amazon has resolved this situation for me right away..</li>
            <li> They reimbursed me and had no qualms about making things right.</li>
            <li> Yep, she was right.</li>
            <li> So, for everyday used, this is super good.</li>
            <li> First things first, the delivery was quick and hassle free.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming and very sophisticated, sexy and modern.</li>
            <li> But if it&#x27;s you first try it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Light Blue for four years now, and I am confident I know what the true Light Blue looks and smells like.</li>
            <li> They shipped it quickly which made this very convenient for me.</li>
            <li> Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue is a very distinct smell that I can smell from a mile away.</li>
            <li> After I bought this item, the cologne did not last more than 10-15 minutes before fading away.  </li>
            <li> First of all, let me state</li>
            <li> At first when I bought it, the smell seemed to go away after 10 minutes (To my sense of smell), but wherever I went if it was minutes or hours after, I always got compliments on my Cologne</li>
            <li> Perhaps I only need more time to adjust.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly who I received my product from</li>
            <li> BONUS-- VERY AFFORDABLE!</li>
            <li> reviews say the scent should last for more than 10hours</li>
            <li> This is one of my top preferred products to wear outside of work.  </li>
            <li> If you are big and more imposing, it balances things out well, imo.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to match the heat of the summer, then this refreshing fragrance is one possible solution.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> first item amazon sent me</li>
            <li> I normally buy this product from the mall(1.5 to 2 hours away), but I needed it quickly and was not headed out of town anytime soon.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper then buying in the store and a large bottle!</li>
            <li> Smells great and stays on for a long long time.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old grandson has recently discovered girls and nice clothing.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely positive this is a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> Love D&amp;G Blue and Light Blue, both.</li>
            <li> I could wear either of these every day, and pretty much do.</li>
            <li> Because it is so light, it&#x27;s not particularly manly, but this is not necessarily bad.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly like the Light Blue I had, the sent wouldn&#x27;t take.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and with all the comments I get from other people, evidently they do, too.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not musty (which is a huge plus for my taste) and it can be worn all seasons in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the price.</li>
            <li> but you do not need much.</li>
            <li> Price through Amazon very resonable as always vs the store.</li>
            <li> this fast...</li>
            <li> really cannot think of any CONS from this brand of Cologne for the time being that I have owned</li>
            <li> It is so masculine and fresh.</li>
            <li> It has a gentle aroma to it that doesn&#x27;t scream for attention or overpower anyone that gets too close to you.</li>
            <li> My purchase of D&amp;G Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana for Men was just what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> D &amp; G Light Blue is</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I took it to Macy&#x27;s to compare it against the real thing and</li>
            <li> I really recomend it get it</li>
            <li> Product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Just beware of what you&#x27;re paying for - not the real thing.</li>
            <li> So who ever received what I paid for Thanks never using AMAZON again sally reyes</li>
            <li> They do with D&amp;G Light Blue.  </li>
            <li> To the untrained eye, and nose, this could be passed off for Light Blue, but I will not be fooled.</li>
            <li> So I believe this is a real one and not a knock off.</li>
            <li> i bought the D&amp;G light blue for my husband for Christmas ,  </li>
            <li> Fast shipment and no problems.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of haters out of there of Dolce Men&#x27;s Light Blue, but I say, \\&quot;Not so Fast\\&quot;..!!  </li>
            <li> I give Light Blue 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, but definitely does not last.</li>
            <li> My husband wears Egoiste Platinum and this is my other favorite on him.</li>
            <li> I knew the scent was not the same as the original</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, D &amp; G is an outstanding product that sweeps the floor with other competitive brands.</li>
            <li> smells great, but fragrance doesnt last long enough.</li>
            <li> it smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> Maybe D &amp; G has a stronger more lasting scent that lasts longer but smells the same as light blue.</li>
            <li> things considered, Light Blue falls just outside my Top 10, but I definitely recommend adding to your collection.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for years now and this year I bought some and someone purchased me some for Christmas right at the same time, I literally had two unopened boxes of this exact item.</li>
            <li> I got 2 D and G Light blue bottle and the bottle is very old with oil in it-</li>
            <li> I use D&amp;G Light Blue everyday at college and the ladies love the scent.</li>
            <li> This is for the younger guys that grew up on Cool Water. . . .</li>
            <li> It is more then twice as much as what I bought at Dillards, and $20 cheaper then that little bottle.  </li>
            <li> Coming out of the bottle, Light Blue offers notes of aquatic, citrus, and a bit of pepper.  </li>
            <li> sillage is surprisingly high - I had given up on the projection when asked about the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is  subtle fragrance, very sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have loved Kenneth Cole Thermal Reaction, Kenneth Cole Black, Liz Claiborne Sport, Nautica Blue, Ferrari Black, Bvlgari BVL, Bvlgari Aqua, Terre-d-Hermes and now D&amp;G Light Blue!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant because of reviews claiming fakes but as far as I can tell, this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this because a girl that I was dating told me that it was her favorite and that she really wanted me to wear it.  </li>
            <li> I have worn cologne all my life and rarely had total strangers comment on my scent.  </li>
            <li> Would rather purchase from here and save a few dollars instead of driving to the mall which isn&#x27;t close and paying more.</li>
            <li> Amazon sent out package but there was a computer glitch and it went right by my house back to sender.</li>
            <li> I have used D &amp; G Light Blue from an unnamed high end department store and this purchase is no different from their stock.  </li>
            <li> Light Blue has potential Wow Factor..!!  </li>
            <li> did not want a used product , I paid for new &amp; unopened and did not receive this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While wearing this today, and shopping for new additions to my collection, was asked about the fragrance...</li>
            <li> the lady at the counter said that she felt this was a cheap imitation.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of light blue..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon (I had locally bought it through the Military BX)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;out of most colognes I have had over the years</li>
            <li> Is not as deep, and for that the smell goes out very fast.....</li>
            <li> I hope future customers are aware who they purchase from.</li>
            <li> think the cologne smells OK, but not sure as I have nothing to compare</li>
            <li> but I am still looking for that scent that is not too loud or offensive but stays with you all day!</li>
            <li> an Eau De Toilette is a cologne known for its sweet distinctive scent that sets itself apart from other colognes.</li>
            <li> Even the packaging is fancy, as the D&amp;G box has a soft velvet texture.</li>
            <li> As far as my experience goes, Amazon always delivers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to heavier/muskier old school.  </li>
            <li> I am a professional and if used sparingly I can even wear it to work without adversely affecting patients.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> But this should last much longer, probably about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> even quite a few I don&#x27;t know seem to really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> The item has soft smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; so it is exciting to find other products for it.</li>
            <li> When I narrowed it down (I also have Chanel de Blu, Oscar, Tommy and others) and found it to be my Light Blue</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will now be a regular purchase of mine and it comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would equate it to the end of the day when normal colognes start to wear off and you are left with the hint of it&#x27;s existence except in this case</li>
            <li> I normally use 4-5 different fragrances</li>
            <li> Though subtle at first, the fragrance creeps up on you, drawing attention to its compelling scent.  </li>
            <li> D &amp; G Light Blue is an Eau De Toilette that can be worn everyday.</li>
            <li> I was told by a rep that if the product comes direct from Amazon, and not a third party seller, it is direct from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I sense as if though its been watered down and I am probably right.</li>
            <li> Its not too overwhelming BUT its not too weak either.</li>
            <li> only (minimal) downside is the price/value - Light Blue is riding the female version, and</li>
            <li> As with all fine colognes, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little bit heavier than the woman&#x27;s version, but it still is a wonderfully fresh, citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> So, great product but bad purchase method.</li>
            <li> Just a general warning to everyone who buys cologne online.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying through a personal buyer instead of buying directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It smells similar to Light Blue, but is unmistakeably NOT light blue.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than other places, I think this is not fake but probably was just sitting idle in some warehouse for few years.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the light almost elusive smell of Light Blue.</li>
            <li> Very weak colonge, didn&#x27;t \\&quot;stay on\\&quot; for more then 15min.  </li>
            <li> When recieved, the bottle was less then half full.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very large and the only complaint he has is that he can&#x27;t bring it in his carry-on when he travels for work.  </li>
            <li> Now I am using the unnamed high end department store as my testing center for other toilette sprays.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the smell lingers on to my clothes as well and can last a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it had been sitting on the shelf too long, but it was not the same as what I have purchased for years from the department store.</li>
            <li> (he&#x27;s a contractor) and he came home saying how strangely she was acting because we had known them for years.</li>
            <li> They really should lower their prices and be competitive for the consumer&#x27;s hard earned dollar.</li>
            <li> Next time I will stick to my preferred fragrance, D&amp;G (Dark Blue).</li>
            <li> The longevity is above average, lasting 7</li>
            <li> One person told me it smelled a lot like Grey Flannel, but I never thought so.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts a long time!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the product for 2 days and it was obvious to me that this product was not real.</li>
            <li> It goes well for any occasion and is not too intense, overpowering or headache causing (which I hate with strong colognes).</li>
            <li> ordered 11/24/08, returned due to leaking product after seller Fragrance Haeven replies to email, sent back on 12/19/08 at my expense and to date, 02/21/09, no replacement has been received.</li>
            <li> The bottle curvature is absolutely wrong; the true bottle is shorter and wider than than bottle I received.</li>
            <li> I purchased a larger size for less money.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> After that small bottle ran out, I bought this larger bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that it was due to an extended time on shelf thats why it wasn&#x27;t what it was suppose to be.</li>
            <li> Never seen the effects of D &amp; G to this extreme...</li>
            <li> Being skeptical, as the price was 20 plus dollars off of Macy&#x27;s, where I would normally purchase cologne, I went to Macy&#x27;s and carefully looked at the packaging.  </li>
            <li> My cologne bottle had a leak in the spray component and half of the conents ended up in the box.  </li>
            <li> When I saw it on Amazon for almost half of what I had been paying, I jumped on it.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> It might also be other reasons i&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> the plastic was a little torn on the box..</li>
            <li> is not as heavy and overbearing as some men&#x27;s colognes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> year round</li>
            <li> I was concerned, after reading a few reviews that felt that this product was a counterfeit, so I contacted Amazon via chat.  </li>
            <li> Either other reviewers are receiving from a third party, reviews are done by competitors, or sheer bad luck.  </li>
            <li> The EDT lasts for about 1-2 hours on my skin and then slowly wears down.</li>
            <li> I have used Armani code, acqua di gio in the past and wanted to switch it up.</li>
            <li> The product was weird, leaked and the label had come off.. and didn&#x27;t have an odor after several sprays?</li>
            <li> &quot; - you can now pick up the small bottle for around $30-$35 - which is not too shabby..</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a cologne that Truly Complements your chemistry</li>
            <li> Not worth $10, can&#x27;t believe I paid $60!!!</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t buy it, at least from this seller.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband and have for at least 6 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about buying cologne unless it is from a BRAND store (i.e... Dillards, Macy,...) due to fakes.  </li>
            <li> I mean IT.</li>
            <li> : after some days using it, I must say that this is a fake, the letters of the bottle are dissapearing and the spray falls down at pressuring it.</li>
            <li> Also, another indicator that the product was a fake is that the cap of the product does not fit the bottle...</li>
            <li> i dont think this is fake though.</li>
            <li> I received this order promptly but when I opened the package, I could tell that it just seemed fake.</li>
            <li> but I believe that I may have purchased a fake.</li>
            <li> I am now unable to return this product because it is flammable.</li>
            <li> I Was Wrong.</li>
            <li> I thought something was wrong</li>
            <li> The website might be wrong but it said that it was manufactured in August 2009.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I sprayed and smelled and the smell is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great smell. Love the women&#x27;s better I got my wife as a gift and I think I liked it more</li>
            <li> the Light Blue was for my son and he loved it. I myself have it for women and I also love it. The milkbath from D&amp; G also great. Right now my favorite scent is \\&quot;The One\\&quot; so it is exciting to find other products for it.</li>
            <li> I use D&amp;G Light Blue everyday at college and the ladies love the scent. Its not too overwhelming BUT its not too weak either. The fragrance is not musty (which is a huge plus for my taste) and it can be worn all seasons in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!!! I love this! My husband wears Egoiste Platinum and this is my other favorite on him. Refreshing blend of citrus, Wood and spice. It&#x27;s so clean and smooth. Not overwhelming and very sophisticated, sexy and modern. I love the Rosemary and bergamot. It is a subtle and the best of the aqua scents I&#x27;ve come across for men.&lt;br /&gt;FRAGRANCE NOTES - Mandarin, Bergamot, Grapefruit, Juniper, Rosewood, Rosemary, Musk, Wood, Oakmoss, Incense</li>
            <li> I loved this scent from the first time I smelled it in a magazine insert! I knew my husband would love it too because it was a nice fresh scent. He does not wear fragrances often and when he does he does not like it when they are too strong. This has a very clean, but also sexy aroma to it. It is a little pricey but you do not need much.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and I get compliments from women all the time. It is light and playful and invokes the idea of a good time. It goes well for any occasion and is not too intense, overpowering or headache causing (which I hate with strong colognes). Price through Amazon very resonable as always vs the store.</li>
            <li> It smells really great and is really strong. Would recommend. I got it on sale so it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of light blue.. Never had the scent go away this fast...(within 2-3 hours)&lt;br /&gt;Ive always been satisfied with my purchase with amazon but probably wont be buying any cologne/perfume products.</li>
            <li> Have never actually smelled this in a store, but there was an insert in a magazine I subscribe to and thought it would be something that I liked.  It&#x27;s a great, light, citrus scent that is perfect for the spring/summer season and glad I bought it.  And buying it on Amazon made it a heck of deal too, saving more than $10 if I would have purchased at a major department store!</li>
            <li> Just a general warning to everyone who buys cologne online.  I don&#x27;t think its the problem of being \\&quot;fake\\&quot; but it is the shelf life probably.  After I bought this item, the cologne did not last more than 10-15 minutes before fading away.  But I received a refund very quickly, so in terms of customer service i give it a 100%.  In terms of the product &#x3D; 0&lt;br /&gt;I just hope they will fix this problem.  It might also be other reasons i&#x27;m not sure but I will never buy cologne online every again.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me state I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon (I had locally bought it through the Military BX)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;out of most colognes I have had over the years, I would have to say this tops my list. The Fragrance has a really good smell to it. At first when I bought it, the smell seemed to go away after 10 minutes (To my sense of smell), but wherever I went if it was minutes or hours after, I always got compliments on my Cologne I was wearing (Which was a pretty good feeling knowing you smell good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really cannot think of any CONS from this brand of Cologne for the time being that I have owned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, I think it&#x27;s def worth the purchase and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great scented cologne that lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this item, As soon as I opened the item I knew the scent was not the same as the original, I then went to compare it with the demo at the store and found it was not the same. So I requested a refund on this product, and Amazon awarded me a refund and processed it. Great Customer Service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just received this cologne in the mail and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I was a little nervous about what I would end up with since this deal is unheard of, but sure enough, the product is just as perfect as it would be at full-price from a department store. Even the packaging is fancy, as the D&amp;G box has a soft velvet texture. Take advantage of this offer! You won&#x27;t be dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Yuuummmmm....this cologne smells awesome. It is so masculine and fresh. The only problem I experienced was a faulty bottle. The bottle seemed to be too full and leaked from the top sprayer. According to Amazon&#x27;s return policy, perfume or cologne is considered a flammable substance and cannot be returned. It&#x27;s an awesome cologne but a sucky return policy.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant because of reviews claiming fakes but as far as I can tell, this is the real thing. The scent lasts all day and is the same as the tester that I tried on at Macys. As far as my experience goes, Amazon always delivers.</li>
            <li> Awesome Awesome Awesome!!!! Got it so quick.. the plastic was a little torn on the box.. I inspected it.. It was perfect! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This is for the younger guys that grew up on Cool Water. . . . I&#x27;m used to heavier/muskier old school.  Paul Sebastian/Brute/Old Spice/Zizani/Coty Musk.  That being said, it is nice and fresh/refreshing fragrance. . . . Perhaps I only need more time to adjust.  Wonderful packaging.  Recommended by female friend.</li>
            <li> Though subtle at first, the fragrance creeps up on you, drawing attention to its compelling scent.  Since wearing it, I have had several compliments bestowed to me from female co-workers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This initial bottle was a birthday gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will now be a regular purchase of mine and it comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My cologne bottle had a leak in the spray component and half of the conents ended up in the box.  Further, the scent had a very short life which made me question the integrity of the product.  Have not and will not order from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this fragrance from a department store for my husband before and we both love it. The difference is that buying through Amazon.com I purchased a larger size for less money. Excellent seller - I received it days before it was promised.</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this because a girl that I was dating told me that it was her favorite and that she really wanted me to wear it.  After that ended, I continued to use it with very good results.  Every girl that I&#x27;ve met has complimented me on it.  After that small bottle ran out, I bought this larger bottle.  It is more then twice as much as what I bought at Dillards, and $20 cheaper then that little bottle.  It&#x27;s a great fragrance and a very good deal compared to buying it at the store.</li>
            <li> This product is offered at a fabulous price. It was a Christmas present for my son who loved it! He never thought he would ever get this because of the price. However, Amazon&#x27;s prices can&#x27;t be beat. Also, I ordered it the week of Christmas and it says it takes 1 to 2 extra days to ship and they stated it would not be here for Christmas. But, as always, Amazon and the seller came through. I received it 2 days before Christmas. Very happy!</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loved this and I know how much I love the Dolce &amp; Gabbana for women. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have used Armani code, acqua di gio in the past and wanted to switch it up. Came across light blue and am very satisfied. Mild and not very overpowering, a great spring and summer cologne.</li>
            <li> Love D&amp;G Blue and Light Blue, both. They are easily my favorite scents. Blue is a nice, manly scent. One person told me it smelled a lot like Grey Flannel, but I never thought so. There&#x27;s a nice citrus hit to it for me. Light Blue is a lighter scent, a bit more floral with bergamot undertones. I could wear either of these every day, and pretty much do.</li>
            <li> I smelled dozens of colognes looking for the perfect scent- not too overbearing, not too sweet, definitely not too musky.  I kept coming back to this one.  It&#x27;s smells slightly fruity, slightly sweet, and fresh but has this great earthy finish that says \\&quot;I&#x27;m ALL man.\\&quot;  Best of all, Sweetie loves it, too!</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne ever!  Buy the largest size you can!  it will last about a year</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this fragrance in it&#x27;s female adaptation for my girlfriend and loved the way it smelled on her. I later found out that it was made for men as well so I took a leap of faith and went for it without having smelled it. Glad I did. It has a gentle aroma to it that doesn&#x27;t scream for attention or overpower anyone that gets too close to you. I would equate it to the end of the day when normal colognes start to wear off and you are left with the hint of it&#x27;s existence except in this case it&#x27;s like that all day. Love the smell, love the style.</li>
            <li> I received this product through amazon. It wasn&#x27;t exactly like the Light Blue I had, the sent wouldn&#x27;t take. I have had this product before but it wasn&#x27;t the same. I&#x27;m guessing that it was due to an extended time on shelf thats why it wasn&#x27;t what it was suppose to be. Anyways I contacted amazon and was refunded immediately. so good customer service. I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t what happens with all shipments and that this was just what happens sometime with colognes. I should mention that amazon also offered to replace it so they gave me the option of what i wanted to do, they didn&#x27;t give an ultimatum.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts a long time!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband wears this perfume and I absolutely love it. Sometimes the smell lingers on to my clothes as well and can last a long time. This perfume is definitely a win-win situation. A great smell that lasts!</li>
            <li> My purchase of D&amp;G Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana for Men was just what I ordered.  The price was good and shipment was expedient!</li>
            <li> D &amp; G Light Blue is an Eau De Toilette is a cologne known for its sweet distinctive scent that sets itself apart from other colognes. I don&#x27;t know exactly who I received my product from but I feel as if though someone sabotaged the original. The lettering of the logo is not visible on some parts of the bottle. I sense as if though its been watered down and I am probably right. I made the mistake of buying through a personal buyer instead of buying directly from Amazon. I hope future customers are aware who they purchase from. Nevertheless, D &amp; G is an outstanding product that sweeps the floor with other competitive brands.</li>
            <li> Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue is a very distinct smell that I can smell from a mile away. It is a beautiful scent for a guy and definitely can make a girls head turn. I bought this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day not realizing that it was going to make him smell that good. Almost wish I would have held out and bought it for my boyfriend instead. Great scent, would recommend this to anyone. BONUS-- VERY AFFORDABLE!</li>
            <li> its just what the men folks have been looking for. worth the price. i would strongly recommend the brand.</li>
            <li> D &amp; G Light Blue is an Eau De Toilette that can be worn everyday. The smell is refreshing and light, with a citrus slant to it. I recommend this to everyone. Yes, this is a short review, but it gets to the point. Buy this, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Dolce &amp; Gabbana is one of my favorite colognes &amp; when I sprayed this on, it did not at all smell like the original. I don&#x27;t know if it had been sitting on the shelf too long, but it was not the same as what I have purchased for years from the department store.</li>
            <li> Love this scent; slightly sweet, but not overpowering.  I am a professional and if used sparingly I can even wear it to work without adversely affecting patients.&lt;br /&gt;Just bought as a gift for my brother and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Very weak colonge, didn&#x27;t \\&quot;stay on\\&quot; for more then 15min.  Not worth $10, can&#x27;t believe I paid $60!!!</li>
            <li> Excelente Vendedor Seguro y confiable Todo Lo descrito en El perfume para caballero rapido en las Fechas de pautas nuevo Paquete. lo recomiendo 100% carlos DESDE Guarenas Venezuela.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s different so i can say you gonna love it but if liked \\&quot;Blue by Dolce Gabbana\\&quot; you definitely gonna like love the \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot;. But if it&#x27;s you first try it&#x27;s worth it you will like it!!!!</li>
            <li> PROMPT SHIPPING, NICE PACKING.&lt;br /&gt;I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE,&lt;br /&gt;JUST IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.&lt;br /&gt;MY FRIEND WILL BE PLEASED.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU,CHRISP.</li>
            <li> This is such a great scent. It lasts all day and stays fresh and clean smelling. I love it! Totally authentic.</li>
            <li> When recieved, the bottle was less then half full. I contacted the seller, with no response. I contacted Amazon and they took care of the problem right away!!!  I was very surprised and happy with their response!!!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my Boyfriend!.. I love the D &amp; G light blue for man!.. the Best perfum!</li>
            <li> smells great, but fragrance doesnt last long enough. reviews say the scent should last for more than 10hours but I am not getting that. i dont think this is fake though.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Light Blue Dolce Gabbana\\&quot; perfume is my son&#x27;s favorite fragrance. He was happy to get this item and not disappointed with the bouquet at all. It has the same persistent aroma we tried in \\&quot;Mason\\&quot;.Thank you very much for well-packed box!We are satisfied with everything!</li>
            <li> The product received was not the correct, product...it seems to have been tampered with and it does not have the scent of the actual product. Also, another indicator that the product was a fake is that the cap of the product does not fit the bottle...I tried the product for 2 days and it was obvious to me that this product was not real. I did not expect this from Amazon seeing as though all the other products I have ordered from them have been impeccable...it pains me to leave this review...</li>
            <li> A really great fresh fragrance that lasts 45 minutes.  I would not buy this again but I do like the fragrance.  Maybe D &amp; G has a stronger more lasting scent that lasts longer but smells the same as light blue.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son who does not always wear cologne.&lt;br /&gt;This is not as heavy and overbearing as some men&#x27;s colognes.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bit heavier than the woman&#x27;s version, but it still is a wonderfully fresh, citrus fragrance. I love the after smell not a&lt;br /&gt;lingering stink, but light &amp; fresh.&lt;br /&gt;You will really love it.</li>
            <li> Ok the scent of this perfume is just amazing! Really!&lt;br /&gt;I am more a kenneth cole reaction kind of smell, or lacoste essential, and this one really fits in, its not that strong but it happens to stay with you for just enough hours&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten great compliments since I&#x27;m using this one, so go ahead, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the light almost elusive smell of Light Blue. Next time I will stick to my preferred fragrance, D&amp;G (Dark Blue).</li>
            <li> ordered 11/24/08, returned due to leaking product after seller Fragrance Haeven replies to email, sent back on 12/19/08 at my expense and to date, 02/21/09, no replacement has been received.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells great and stays on for a long long time. In my personal experience, this is only bested by Allure Homme Sport by Chanel. But that&#x27;s much more expensive. So, for everyday used, this is super good.</li>
            <li> Great smell.  This is one of my top preferred products to wear outside of work.  I normally use 4-5 different fragrances but, this one is always in the cabinet</li>
            <li> I like this for its light scent.  Not too heavy, which is nice.  A little goes a long way.  Because it is so light, it&#x27;s not particularly manly, but this is not necessarily bad.  It&#x27;s good in the background where you barely notice it.  If you are big and more imposing, it balances things out well, imo.</li>
            <li> Shopped around, best price by far. Allowed me to purchase larger size. Was request for Christmas gift for son. GREAT</li>
            <li> I have never asked another man what scent he was wearing until a co worker was wearing this.  It was great and I had to purchase!</li>
            <li> My husband saw this fragrance at a perfume store in the mall for 80.00. He said he was going to go back and get it, I told him to wait and let me see if it&#x27;s cheaper at Amazon and it was!  Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> Item came quickly. Packaged safely and securely. Product was just as I wanted. Very pleased with the entire experience. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I received this order promptly but when I opened the package, I could tell that it just seemed fake. The box and the cap looked real cheap. I took it to Macy&#x27;s to compare it against the real thing and the lady at the counter said that she felt this was a cheap imitation. I also discovered that you cannot return it. Now I have to call Amazon to try to resolve this.&lt;br /&gt;***************  BUYER BEWARE **************  If something smells too good to be true...</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a bargain but I believe that I may have purchased a fake. The scent only last 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Amazon has resolved this situation for me right away..Thank you Amazon..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was the the shrink wrap was not sealed at the bottom. There was a seal on the top of the shrink wrap and not the bottom. The bottle was not full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the cologne smells OK, but not sure as I have nothing to compare to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed. I can&#x27;t believe this happens on Amazon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not want a used product , I paid for new &amp; unopened and did not receive this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to hassle and look for what to do next</li>
            <li> Found the after shave to last longer than the cologne.  Not a bad product but it could be improved.  I have used Royal Copenhagen products for years and still find that they are the best for everyday use.  D&amp;G is good for a change but I am still looking for that scent that is not too loud or offensive but stays with you all day!</li>
            <li> I received a paper sample in the mail and took a chance buying it without sampling the actual product. D&amp;G light Blue smells just like the sample - maybe better!!  Product was delivered as promised and the price was below the department stores!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and with all the comments I get from other people, evidently they do, too. I don&#x27;t leave home with out it - unless I&#x27;m doing yard work. :)</li>
            <li> this cologne smells pretty good, it is just what i seek! give it five star without any doubt! if it can  keep this quality, i&#x27;ll still have it next time!</li>
            <li> Nice perfum, price is just right. excelent fragrance for mens who like softs fragrances. I really recomend it get it</li>
            <li> A gift for my son.  He specifically requested this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a great summer perfume, I would get so many compliments on it when I wore it, one person told me it reminded them of sunshine, very clean.  I actually bought this by accident when I wanted another D &amp; C perfume and it was a happy accident, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a short amount of time.  it was packaged appropriately, the price was fair and I love this scent!</li>
            <li> good perfume, only has almost no aroma, and there to apply too. but it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to match the heat of the summer, then this refreshing fragrance is one possible solution. It looks quite simple, but smells quite awesome.</li>
            <li> I wear cologne to make me feel good and to get noticed. This feels like a breath of the Mediterranean Sea. It is fresh, light, long lasting and has good projection in warm weather. It draws complements and is something that lingers on your shirt even the next day. You could wear it year round but I like it more in the spring and summer. It has the benefit of being non-offensive if over sprayed. If you like colognes like Aqua Di Gio and L&#x27;Homme than this is something you should try.</li>
            <li> Product is the real deal.  I&#x27;m skeptical about buying cologne unless it is from a BRAND store (i.e... Dillards, Macy,...) due to fakes.  Fragrance is great and most importantly, long lasting which tells me it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my husband. I had read the reviews but decided to take the chance anyway. It smells nice, but definitely does not last. Good thing my husband doesnt like his cologne too strong. The \\&quot;Dolce\\&quot; on the bottle has come off too. Just beware of what you&#x27;re paying for - not the real thing. The shipping of the product was quick.</li>
            <li> Last all day, smells wonderful.  My new favorite cologne for my husband!  I also bought some for my son-in law this year.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.  I got it for my husband for his birthday and he can&#x27;t get enough of it!  The bottle is very large and the only complaint he has is that he can&#x27;t bring it in his carry-on when he travels for work.  Guess we will have to purchase a smaller one too! :) :)</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend , its his favorite cologne and we are both very happy with it :- )</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened. I smelled this perfume on a friend and the one I bought was just different.</li>
            <li> This Cologne smells soo good, I recommend it:-) I have a sensative nose and this is a Very light smell, not over bearing</li>
            <li> Amazon sent out package but there was a computer glitch and it went right by my house back to sender. THANK YOU!!! So, I didn&#x27;t have this product for Christmas!!! I am sure it is a good product. Oh there is no way to get intouch with the sender. It shows a tracking number which states it has been delivered. So who ever received what I paid for Thanks never using AMAZON again sally reyes</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for years now and this year I bought some and someone purchased me some for Christmas right at the same time, I literally had two unopened boxes of this exact item. I tried to return the one that I bought from Amazon but apparently Amazon does not allow returns of hazardous materials (even though they have no problem selling them to you), I was told to dispose of hazardous materials in accordance with state and local laws blah blah blah....... but there was never an option to return this product. So, great product but bad purchase method.</li>
            <li> Never seen the effects of D &amp; G to this extreme... You&#x27;ll be complimented, you fall in love with the smell, no wonder its irresistible to women ;) Amazing product, best i&#x27;v ever worn and gone out with, thank you.!</li>
            <li> I love the clean, masculine but not too strong smell of this cologne. It has a hint of sweet but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because when I had smelt it I knew he and I would enjoy it..</li>
            <li> I have worn cologne all my life and rarely had total strangers comment on my scent.  They do with D&amp;G Light Blue.  It is mildly spendy, but you get a lot of squirts for the money.  Besides, to get the lady&#x27;s attention, who cares what it costs?  I don&#x27;t plan to ever wear anything else (in cologne, that is).</li>
            <li> Just what I need when I need it !!!!.&lt;br /&gt;The size and the box were in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Great for gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Light Blue for four years now, and I am confident I know what the true Light Blue looks and smells like. I am absolutely positive this is a counterfeit product. 1. The bottle curvature is absolutely wrong; the true bottle is shorter and wider than than bottle I received. 2. The cap is off colored and lighter in weight than the true bottle. 3. The sprayer mechanism is elongated compared to the true bottle. 4. It smells similar to Light Blue, but is unmistakeably NOT light blue. To the untrained eye, and nose, this could be passed off for Light Blue, but I will not be fooled. I am now unable to return this product because it is flammable. My advise, take the more expensive route and buy it in person.</li>
            <li> Is not as deep, and for that the smell goes out very fast..... it smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long...&lt;br /&gt;Comment update (21st jan. 2013): after some days using it, I must say that this is a fake, the letters of the bottle are dissapearing and the spray falls down at pressuring it. So don&#x27;t buy it, at least from this seller.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  It is a nice light fresh smell that is uplifting and not too overpowering.  Perfect size as well.</li>
            <li> saved some cash on this product, like 10 dollars. Macy&#x27;s price was way more!! But it here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S.Thomas&lt;br /&gt;West Chester,Pa.</li>
            <li> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm My man smelled sooooo good wearing this! Scent is fresh, crisp, light, citrus, sweet yet very masculine!  I enjoyed smelling him with this on!!</li>
            <li> I was concerned, after reading a few reviews that felt that this product was a counterfeit, so I contacted Amazon via chat.  I was told by a rep that if the product comes direct from Amazon, and not a third party seller, it is direct from the manufacturer.  Being skeptical, as the price was 20 plus dollars off of Macy&#x27;s, where I would normally purchase cologne, I went to Macy&#x27;s and carefully looked at the packaging.  When the bottle arrived from Amazon, the packaging was identical to what was offered at the Macy&#x27;s counter.  Either other reviewers are receiving from a third party, reviews are done by competitors, or sheer bad luck.  I have yet to try the product, but I saved a bundle, and am confident I got what was advertised.  Don&#x27;t be swayed, like I almost was...</li>
            <li> Mmmm! That is the reaction you will get with this cologne. This is a great fragrance from Dolce and Gabbana. When I saw it on Amazon for almost half of what I had been paying, I jumped on it. I only wish I had purchased two or three at the sale price. This is  subtle fragrance, very sophisticated. You will definitely get compliments when you wear this cologne. I recommend it to all. As with all fine colognes, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This was for my hubby. He smells soooooo good.</li>
            <li> great cologne i wear it all the time its some of the best there is in my opinon i am gonna buy some more asap</li>
            <li> Bought this item and it arrived WELL PACKED and secure.  It was shipped in the time frame required. The product was weird, leaked and the label had come off.. and didn&#x27;t have an odor after several sprays? I contacted the seller and they were AMAZING.  They reimbursed me and had no qualms about making things right. Kudos to them!! Would use them again in the future!!</li>
            <li> I normally buy this product from the mall(1.5 to 2 hours away), but I needed it quickly and was not headed out of town anytime soon.  They shipped it quickly which made this very convenient for me.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this product as a gift for my son for several years.  Would rather purchase from here and save a few dollars instead of driving to the mall which isn&#x27;t close and paying more.</li>
            <li> I thought her D &amp; G Light Blue smelled great on her but wasn&#x27;t too sure his and her sets were a good thing. Well ladies listen really good, you&#x27;ll only hear this once...I Was Wrong. She Was Right!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does not smell all that great directly as you spray it on. But once it settles on you it&#x27;s great. No joke, I could not identify the scent from my closet after I used this a time or two after receiving it for Christmas last year. When I narrowed it down (I also have Chanel de Blu, Oscar, Tommy and others) and found it to be my Light Blue I was shocked. Yep, she was right.</li>
            <li> It took for ever to arrive but packaging was great and the product is fantastic. My husband loves it (I do too).</li>
            <li> I have used D &amp; G Light Blue from an unnamed high end department store and this purchase is no different from their stock.  Great price and no issues with this purchase.  Now I am using the unnamed high end department store as my testing center for other toilette sprays.  They really should lower their prices and be competitive for the consumer&#x27;s hard earned dollar.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift and received in great shape. My son loved it!</li>
            <li> very light cologne  clean and masculine  perfect for warm weather months.  the bottle is very cool also.  this price was way cheaper than at macys</li>
            <li> There is no damage to the bottle and also, there was no delay in the shipping. The EDT lasts for about 1-2 hours on my skin and then slowly wears down. I compared it to the tester I took from department stores and the smell is the same. So I believe this is a real one and not a knock off. The serial number on the box and the bottle are also matching. This adds to the genuineness of the product. But this should last much longer, probably about 4 hours. I thought something was wrong and I checked in a website when it was manufactured using the batch number. The website might be wrong but it said that it was manufactured in August 2009. It will be good if the seller can specify the manufactured date so the buyers will know what they are paying for. It is much cheaper than other places, I think this is not fake but probably was just sitting idle in some warehouse for few years.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband and have for at least 6 years.  My mother and I picked it out for him when he had to quit the product he was using years ago for different reasons and every woman I know, and even quite a few I don&#x27;t know seem to really enjoy it. lol  He had to help a neighbor with something one evening before we were going somewhere and he forgot he  already had \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot; on and he swears the teenage daughter kept following them around the house (he&#x27;s a contractor) and he came home saying how strangely she was acting because we had known them for years. I told him it was the magic of the cologne that did it. We still laugh about it.</li>
            <li> love love love this scent, I bought for me my neice and husband. arrived quickly as well.will buy again soon</li>
            <li> My 14 year old grandson has recently discovered girls and nice clothing.  I purchased this cologne hoping he would appreciate a nice gift.  This was a hit.</li>
            <li> We love the fragrance. Dolce and Gabbana they know what they are doing. My husband smells very handsome and manly with this perfume. So delicious and sexy that I just want to be around him constantly. If my man smells good it makes me feel even better. I love to take good care of him and this is one of many ways to do so.</li>
            <li> i bought the D&amp;G light blue for my husband for Christmas ,  it has a nice clean but masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne I&#x27;ve bought it for two different people now. And probably would buy it again. Fast shipment and no problems.</li>
            <li> Cologne is a personal preference, and this is mine for my husband.  The price for the bottle size was the best I have found.  Shipped quickly.  Good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I always keep looking for some fresh smell until I found this.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have GIO until I found this.&lt;br /&gt;The first item amazon sent me had a shelf age of more than a year but Amazon customer service replace it in a second!&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT fragrance.  It is not overpowering but does last throughout the day.  Wonderful fragrance for teens as well as men.</li>
            <li> Hello All, Please don&#x27;t but from this seller. I got 2 D and G Light blue bottle and the bottle is very old with oil in it- I mean IT. This is inside the package. I sprayed and smelled and the smell is terrible. Don&#x27;t BUY it.. I can&#x27;t stress further..</li>
            <li> I bought this Product D &amp; G Light Blue, 4.2 oz, very good price came packaged very well.  Smells wonderful lasts all day, light and simple smell never over powering lasts from start of day to the end.  I have gone out to eat after work and still Receive wonderful complements on how I smell.  Wont leave the house with out it, since they Discontinued Ezra Finch.  This is great a product I would and have recommend this item.  Its hard to find a cologne that Truly Complements your chemistry this is a Great find for me, again I highly recommend this product.  As always you can&#x27;t beat the S &amp; H with Amazon.com hats off to you again by dear Friend.</li>
            <li> First things first, the delivery was quick and hassle free.&lt;br /&gt;Now to the perfume itself - I have a very unique taste when it comes to perfumes/colognes and generally am very picky when it comes to buying one. Over the years I have loved Kenneth Cole Thermal Reaction, Kenneth Cole Black, Liz Claiborne Sport, Nautica Blue, Ferrari Black, Bvlgari BVL, Bvlgari Aqua, Terre-d-Hermes and now D&amp;G Light Blue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an extremely long lasting scent - more than anyone else i have ever owned - and you have to own one to realize how unique refreshing the scent is.&lt;br /&gt;Ill highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear this cologne unless you want your wife to jump you.</li>
            <li> I have searched for the best deal for this perfume because it is my favorite. I like the cool and light smell and it makes me feel better. Finally, I found the best deal on Amazon. From now on I will order from Amazon to save my money on tax and shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this brand, and this is the 2nd bottle of this particular cologne that I&#x27;ve purchased. I&#x27;ll def. be buying another one when this runs out.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of haters out of there of Dolce Men&#x27;s Light Blue, but I say, \\&quot;Not so Fast\\&quot;..!!  Light Blue is a very pleasant scent, easy on the nose, and will get you compliments.  Coming out of the bottle, Light Blue offers notes of aquatic, citrus, and a bit of pepper.  It then settles down to a musky evergreen fragrance that is very nice.  Great job Dolce...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While wearing this today, and shopping for new additions to my collection, was asked about the fragrance... Light Blue has potential Wow Factor..!!  It is very versatile, appropriate for any season and any occasion.The longevity is above average, lasting 7+ hours on the skin, and all day on my shirtsleeve.  The projection/sillage is surprisingly high - I had given up on the projection when asked about the fragrance.  It has all the tools...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, for those reading my reviews, you know I give a brief critique of the bottle and packaging.  Light Blue scores great with bottle design, using a \\&quot;frosted\\&quot; glass bottle with great etching of the Dolce logo - you can still see the clarity of the fragrance.  The packaging is above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only (minimal) downside is the price/value - Light Blue is riding the female version, and Dolce reputation, keeping the it&#x27;s price elevated.  There is a \\&quot;but\\&quot; - you can now pick up the small bottle for around $30-$35 - which is not too shabby..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, Light Blue falls just outside my Top 10, but I definitely recommend adding to your collection.  It is a great scent that provides flexibility/versatility without being overbearing.  I give Light Blue 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.  It is a long way to the top if you want to rock-n-roll..!!</li>
            <li> Got this as a christmas present for my husband. He loves it! Much cheaper then buying in the store and a large bottle!</li>
            <li> Great smell and people near you can breathe and of course its enjoyed by who it really counts great product for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> The item has soft smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used it before. I do not know why this bottle smells different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is original. I do not know,  but this is acceptable.</li>
