            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also very happy that it is unscented as witch hazel distillate has a smell that you definitely have to become accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love using this after I shave.  </li>
            <li>I like that this is alcohol free!</li>
            <li>Witch Hazel has always been my favorite toner.</li>
            <li>I have been using it and loving the fact that I can use a more pure and organic form of my favorite toner.</li>
            <li>Super!)</li>
            <li>Non greasy, soothing and scent free.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a twin pack and enjoy wrapping up every shave with it.  </li>
            <li>I was overjoyed when I found Thayer&#x27;s alcohol free unscented Witch Hazel on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I will go through this pretty quick because you can use it whenever you skin needs cleaning!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed alcohol free and paraben free!</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast and put to use right away making my own hand sanitizer and for use as a toner.</li>
            <li>I spritz the outer part of my ears then clean with a cue-tip.</li>
            <li>Very effective toner, yet very gentle to skin (does not burn or sting like other toners) and the lack of a scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They work and no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to alleviate any dryness or irritation you may get from swimming, sitting in a hot tub, sitting in a wet bathing suit or just from hormonal changes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and my skin feels great afterwards.</li>
            <li>leaves face feeling fresh, no stinging etc.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so fresh after I cleanse and tone with Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>most likely bc</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the unscented alcohol free toner locally.  </li>
            <li>And it is very affordable</li>
            <li>(You can use your non-toxic deodorant afterwards and this seems to give it that boost it needs to actually prevent odor, since most non-toxic ones don&#x27;t prevent sweating since this your body&#x27;s natural response)</li>
            <li>Dont waste your time ordering from them OR make sure you dont have it shipped to your place.</li>
            <li>Good for cleansing without irritating alcohol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with many different facial toners for my combination/oily skin especially for the climate here in Los Angeles, dry and very rarely it&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li>The alcohol free version is more expensive, but I have no problem shelling out a few extra bucks for the alcohol free version.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural moisturizer</li>
            <li>I can also use this brand on my children for insect bites or minor skin irritations and not have to worry about the high alcohol content.</li>
            <li>I like this toner because it is unscented, and, does not dry my skin like some others I have tried making it neccessary to use a moisterizer after.</li>

            <li> and then I need to find a facial moisturizer (water based) lotion to correct it, but it makes my skin oily and/or still dry.</li>
            <li> Got this to keep by the toilet to make instant wet naps from folded toilet paper.  </li>
            <li> For our face, we spray it from a bottle and allow it to air dry, then apply our moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However, it consists of about 14% Alcohol, which can dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves packages outside of your building if they are less than $40.</li>
            <li> Other toners dry out my skin</li>

            <li> Delivered as expected.  </li>
            <li> I add doTerra essential oils to this base to use as a deodorant that is aluminum free so less toxic after a partial lymphectomy from metastatic breast cancer.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday all over my body</li>
            <li> Astringent based, it closes the pores and heals any small nicks.  </li>
            <li> Lazy business people means upset customers.</li>
            <li> Careless.</li>

            <li> I have been looking for a product like this all of my shaving years.  Alcohol free, eliminating that dreaded post razor burn!!  Non greasy, soothing and scent free.  The Aloe Vera is just sufficient to take the sting out.  Astringent based, it closes the pores and heals any small nicks.  I cant believe this product has been around all these years.  It took someone wiser than I to discover it and post its application on an internet shaving blog.  I purchased a twin pack and enjoy wrapping up every shave with it.  Try it.....you can&#x27;t beat it!!  Promise.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed alcohol free and paraben free!</li>
            <li> nice alternative to aftershave. leaves face feeling fresh, no stinging etc.</li>
            <li> Leaves packages outside of your building if they are less than $40. This is the 2nd time I have ordered this and had it lost my the shippers. Lazy business people means upset customers. Dont waste your time ordering from them OR make sure you dont have it shipped to your place. I lost my package on a Friday evening most likely bc the delivery person wanted to party this weekend. Careless. Now I have to wait ONE MONTH for my order. Do yourself a favor and FIND THIS LOCAL</li>
            <li> Got this to keep by the toilet to make instant wet naps from folded toilet paper.  It&#x27;s perfect, and the aloe with no alcohol is wonderful on the skin!  This is now a staple in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful. It was received when promised.</li>
            <li> I love using this after I shave.  Very refreshing and cleans up the skin after a shave.  Doesn&#x27;t sting and the aloe vera helps to soothe the skin.  The unscented formula is just that, great if you are using a cologne or scented after shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with many different facial toners for my combination/oily skin especially for the climate here in Los Angeles, dry and very rarely it&#x27;s humid. Other toners dry out my skin and then I need to find a facial moisturizer (water based) lotion to correct it, but it makes my skin oily and/or still dry. I like that this is alcohol free! I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and my skin feels great afterwards. It gives a natural moisturizer so I don&#x27;t use much of my own (water based) facial moisturizer lotion you can see the dirty film from being outside, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this is offered as a dual pack! I will go through this pretty quick because you can use it whenever you skin needs cleaning!!</li>
            <li> Excellent and at a great price! Good for cleansing without irritating alcohol.</li>
            <li> I love this witch hazel extract and the 2 pack is a great buy!  Shipped very fast and put to use right away making my own hand sanitizer and for use as a toner.</li>
            <li> love it, great for your skin</li>
            <li> Best Witch Hazel you can ever use! I use this everyday all over my body and so does my husband, so two bottles for this price was wonderful! For our face, we spray it from a bottle and allow it to air dry, then apply our moisturizer. I spritz the outer part of my ears then clean with a cue-tip. We spray 3 pumps under my arm pits to prevent smell and prevent bacteria from growing and causing odor. (You can use your non-toxic deodorant afterwards and this seems to give it that boost it needs to actually prevent odor, since most non-toxic ones don&#x27;t prevent sweating since this your body&#x27;s natural response) And I even spray it vaginally and/or rectally (if needed) mixed with Aloe Vera when I&#x27;m irritated. (This formula actually has Aloe in it already. Super!) Ever since peri-menopause, it&#x27;s been a life saver. It&#x27;s great to alleviate any dryness or irritation you may get from swimming, sitting in a hot tub, sitting in a wet bathing suit or just from hormonal changes.</li>
            <li> I like all of Thayers Witch Hazel products.  They work and no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I like this toner because it is unscented, and, does not dry my skin like some others I have tried making it neccessary to use a moisterizer after.</li>
            <li> Very effective toner, yet very gentle to skin (does not burn or sting like other toners) and the lack of a scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li> great product and service</li>
            <li> Product is as expected, tried before.  Packaged in sealed wrapping which is good. Delivered as expected.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel has always been my favorite toner. However, it consists of about 14% Alcohol, which can dry out the skin.

I can also use this brand on my children for insect bites or minor skin irritations and not have to worry about the high alcohol content. The alcohol free version is more expensive, but I have no problem shelling out a few extra bucks for the alcohol free version. I will definitely be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Best astringent I have ever used. Very effective on my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Best all-natural toner I have ever used. And it is very affordable</li>
            <li> Was told this is AFTER SHEVE,  it is not to me.</li>
