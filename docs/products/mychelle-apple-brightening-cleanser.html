            <li>I love MyChelle products.  </li>
            <li>but I am in love with the Fruit Enzyme Scrub which smells like Lemongrass.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the look out for better &amp;#34;Brightening&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I realize this product does not contain many of the ingredients that are harmful or provide a lather but for the amount recommended to use it does not even cover my face.  </li>
            <li>It is still a good product but not as good as the old formula</li>

            <li>As everyone else in my situation, have tried many, many products.</li>
            <li>Mychelle really does make some very nice skincare products.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my skin visibly looks better (brighter, shinier), but I also rotate through Oil Free Grapefruit Cream, some toners, and the Supreme Polypeptide, so I don&#x27;t know which deserve the most credit.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to wash off; nondrying as soap can be.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really smooth.</li>
            <li>It gets my skin so clean without any residue or dryness.  </li>
            <li>It seems that they changed the formula on this one and in my opinion, the older one works better.</li>
            <li>I used this a long time ago and loved the smell</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, this brightening series are very rich texture so you will love them all.  </li>
            <li>Works great but its a bit messy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the money even though I don&#x27;t have the cholasma anymore.</li>
            <li>but this time around I&#x27;m not crazy.  </li>
            <li>I cant tell much of a difference yet, but so far my skin feels clean without the burn or drying of more &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; cleansers I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>My skin gets nice and clean, and I am still left with very soft skin with an undisturbed PH.  </li>
            <li>That is what attracted me to this company in the first place.</li>
            <li>Must be sure to rinse and dry bottle after use to avoid this.</li>
            <li>It has a really silky feel and the trick is not to just lather it on and wash it off but to take a minute or two to rub it over your skin before you rinse.  </li>
            <li>It really does make my complexion look brighter and fresher</li>
            <li>I could give it 5 stars but am giving it 4 since I just don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>my skin really improved using this product.  </li>
            <li>although it does clean without residue left or drying up the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed the gel leaks out of the cap everywhere from normal use, and sitting it upright, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to travel with it.</li>
            <li>Until recently I washed my face only with mild soap and water, so this is probably the first cleanser I&#x27;ve used since college-ish (20ish years ago).</li>
            <li>The reason I am giving this Apple Brightening Cleanser 5 stars though is because during the summer months, I mix just a drop of this with the Mychelle Pure Harmony Sensitive Skin Cleanser, and it does a great job of cutting through oil and sweat from the summer heat.  </li>
            <li>Not everything has worked for me, but there have been several products that have, and my skin is very fussy and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>A young woman at an organic market recommended this to me and I bought it because she had glowing skin.</li>
            <li>It rinses completely and even removes make up.</li>
            <li>I will use a loofah to wash my face with the product, but I will put some directly on the discoloration and leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural product</li>
            <li>so I looked for natural products.  </li>
            <li>This was the only one that really worked.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> A young woman at an organic market recommended this to me and I bought it because she had glowing skin. She told me she suffered from acne and it was helping her dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will clean your face with no residue left behind. It rinses completely and even removes make up. After one bottle I felt my skin was brighter and my dark spots were less noticeable. However during my second bottle, I felt like my skin wasn&#x27;t reacting in the same way so I discontinued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am purchasing again after about 5 months of not using it in hopes that my skin will respond to it again. Will try to remember to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s a bit messy and leaves behind unsightly brown residue on your counter. Must be sure to rinse and dry bottle after use to avoid this.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleaner I have ever used.  It gets my skin so clean without any residue or dryness.  I have not found any other cleaner that does both.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin seem brighter.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a short time, but it seems like my discoloration is starting to be less noticeable. My skin feels really smooth. I will use a loofah to wash my face with the product, but I will put some directly on the discoloration and leave it on overnight. It&#x27;s a natural product so I feel safe with doing that.</li>
            <li> The price is great on these products.  The product itself is very healthy for you skin and a great value</li>
            <li> I cant tell much of a difference yet, but so far my skin feels clean without the burn or drying of more &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; cleansers I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> This product really works great!  I suffered from cholasma starting about my 2nd month of pregnancy when my face all of a sudden got like 3 or 4 shades darker than the rest of my body.  I read alot of medical advice online that said not to use conventional skin lighteners since they could potentionally harm my little one so I looked for natural products.  This was the only one that really worked.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not cheap (I was paying $13.99 a bottle at my local store)and the bottle will only last about a month or so but after a week or two I noticed a difference in the cholasma.  My face became much more even toned and honestly, I think the cleanser kept the cholasma from getting worse.  It has a really silky feel and the trick is not to just lather it on and wash it off but to take a minute or two to rub it over your skin before you rinse.  Anyway post-partum I decided to save my money and use something else for my face but after trying a couple of different products that were cheaper, I went back to it.  It really does make my complexion look brighter and fresher and my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry or flaky either (the way it did with other products) so it&#x27;s worth the money even though I don&#x27;t have the cholasma anymore.</li>
            <li> Works great but its a bit messy. I have noticed the gel leaks out of the cap everywhere from normal use, and sitting it upright, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to travel with it.</li>
            <li> I love MyChelle products.  I used this a long time ago and loved the smell but this time around I&#x27;m not crazy.  It&#x27;s dark, runny, thin and watery...but I am in love with the Fruit Enzyme Scrub which smells like Lemongrass.  If I use that with this then I get a nice wash.</li>
            <li> If you are like me using skincare as organic/natural/safe as possible, you gotta try this one as well.  For me being combination (T-zone oily) skin, it wasn&#x27;t good satisfaction of clean feeling (thus 4 stars) although it does clean without residue left or drying up the skin.  If you have dry skin, this brightening series are very rich texture so you will love them all.  I&#x27;m still on the look out for better &amp;#34;Brightening&amp;#34; series but mean time, I would repeat to buy this again.</li>
            <li> I realize this product does not contain many of the ingredients that are harmful or provide a lather but for the amount recommended to use it does not even cover my face.  Will be returning.</li>
            <li> I cannot use this cleanser regularly, because I am 39 and my skin is no longer as oily as it was when I was younger.  The reason I am giving this Apple Brightening Cleanser 5 stars though is because during the summer months, I mix just a drop of this with the Mychelle Pure Harmony Sensitive Skin Cleanser, and it does a great job of cutting through oil and sweat from the summer heat.  My skin gets nice and clean, and I am still left with very soft skin with an undisturbed PH.  Mychelle really does make some very nice skincare products.  Not everything has worked for me, but there have been several products that have, and my skin is very fussy and sensitive.  I pray that Mychelle continues to keep their products all natural.  That is what attracted me to this company in the first place.</li>
            <li> I bought the product because we had used the old version that contained Garlic. It seems that they changed the formula on this one and in my opinion, the older one works better. It is still a good product but not as good as the old formula</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Love it.</li>
            <li> Until recently I washed my face only with mild soap and water, so this is probably the first cleanser I&#x27;ve used since college-ish (20ish years ago). I could give it 5 stars but am giving it 4 since I just don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  Pros: Small bottle lasts long; nice scent; good consistency that&#x27;s easy to wash off; nondrying as soap can be.  Cons: None.  I&#x27;m really liking all the MyChelle products I&#x27;ve tried lately. ALL. I feel like my skin visibly looks better (brighter, shinier), but I also rotate through Oil Free Grapefruit Cream, some toners, and the Supreme Polypeptide, so I don&#x27;t know which deserve the most credit. I&#x27;d buy them all again. [The only MyChelle product I didn&#x27;t like--a LOT--was the sunscreen, which leaves my skin sticky and white, is hard to rub in, and smells weird.]</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The best cleaners I have ever used. Delivers on it&#x27;s claims. Wonderful product line. I recommend it to anyone looking for facial products.</li>
            <li> So - I was looking for a cleanser that was cruelty-free, wasn&#x27;t going to give me cancer, and also didn&#x27;t make my skin break out or peel off or look crappy. This cleanser, miraculously, does the trick. I use a serum and lotion after cleansing, so that helps, but it really is a good cleanser.  I will warn you, keep your mouth closed. If you get any on your lips it tastes like crap. But doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything, just don&#x27;t eat it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 1 month. I follow the direction and don&amp;#34;t see changes on my face.</li>
            <li> cleared up my acne from clogged pores without drying my skin.  my skin really improved using this product.  one of the mychelle products that I hope to always keep in rotation.</li>
            <li> Love this soap for your face. It helps brighten your skin.</li>
            <li> I have extensive sun damage to my face. As everyone else in my situation, have tried many, many products. This is the only that actually made a difference. It truly improved the texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
