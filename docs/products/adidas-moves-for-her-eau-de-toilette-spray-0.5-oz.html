            <li> I have used this perfume for probably 15 years! I love it!!! I always get compliments on it, like one persons review said, even when walking down the street. A couple people say the smell wears off, I dont think it does. I have said that before but people still smell it when i dont, I think your nose just gets used to it. I absolutely LOVE this perfume!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product at Wal-Mart when I was in college.  Suddenly I can&#x27;t find it anymore!  I have gotten so many compliments on this scent. It is subtle and clean without being overpowering.  I also noticed it lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it is in a smaller bottle - for those pesky TCA security reasons :)</li>

            <li> I love this product.  It is a sharp distinctive smell.  Something like pine needles but not.  My daughter bought this for me while I was working in Kuwait and I wear from time to time since.  For me, it&#x27;s more like a summer time smell as I wear a softer smell in the winter months.  And I refuse to wear &amp;#34;some famous person&#x27;s name&amp;#34; because their name is on it.  I put some of this on this morning.  Rode two airplanes today and still can catch a faint smell of it now while typing.  Body chemistry must e right because I have received compliments for this fragrance over the years.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells. It gives me a very clean and fresh feeling. The ordering process was easy and the product arrived on schedule.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. If you&#x27;re a female and like the smell of axe or old spice (typical male scents), then you will love this perfume. Smells similar but with a touch of girly scent. Always am complimented when I wear Adids moves for women. And one spray is all you need. Strong enough to last all day.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. Its light and clean. I get so many compliments when I wear it. Smaller than I expected but it was cheap so what can I say.</li>
            <li> I love this smell , last for a while</li>
            <li> It is a basic but effective perfume. The scent lasts only a few hours but does the job in a tight spot.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Has a fresh clean smell. I would totally give this 5 stars but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. It&#x27;s a small bottle do its easy to bring in my purse. Great price for a great scent! I love perfume and have a big collection but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I like this product, as a gift, my relatives like it very much. I will keep checking Adida&#x27;s perfum products.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite spray by Adidas. I also liked how it was shipped and how quick I received it. I would recommend you.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume.</li>
