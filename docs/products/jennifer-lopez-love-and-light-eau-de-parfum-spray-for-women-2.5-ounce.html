            <li>a great scent that doesn&#x27;t get enough credit if u ask me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but unique and noticeable.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really light and clean.  </li>
            <li>I first bought it on HSN and when I wanted to reorder more they had discontinued it.</li>
            <li>I  originally bought this cologne on a home shopping show when it was being launched.  </li>
            <li>To be honest,  I don&#x27;t think many people know enough about it</li>
            <li>My ABSOLUTE ALL TIME Favorite perfume for overy 3 yrs now.  </li>
            <li>and it is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li>Smells light and crisp.</li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;Will Live Happyly Everafter : ))</li>
            <li>I first purchased this on HSN not knowing how much I would love it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making this parfum available.  </li>
            <li>I really love the light, airy scent of this all day lasting perfume.</li>
            <li>, I smell possibly a bit of vanilla &amp; a warm smell,  if that makes sense??  </li>
            <li>The only way I could really describe the scent is a clean smell, nothing too overwhelming,  but does have a bit of sexiness 2 it as well</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Scent was exactly as I remembered it from when it first came out.</li>
            <li>but with that part of sexiness thrown in &amp; can&#x27;t put my finger on what it is exactly,  </li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>Anyone who comes close to me throughout the day, mentions how great I smell &amp; next thing out of their mouths is &amp;#34;what are u wearing??&amp;#34;  It also seems to last a decent amount of time thru the day,  unlike many I&#x27;ve worn in the past that seem to not even b able 2 smell by the time I&#x27;m leaving the house.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain it most likely is going to be discontinued.</li>
            <li>too light and dosent last.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like this scent ..</li>
            <li>Very non-overbearing.</li>
            <li>But my husband seems to REALLY like the scent on me...</li>
            <li>Who wants their perfume to smell like bug spray?</li>
            <li>There seems to be something different about the fragrance from when I originally ordered it from HSN.  </li>
            <li>I could only buy it in one store and when I went back to get more they no longer carried it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light just as I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>When i said above it had a &amp;#34;clean scent&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t mean like other perfumes that smell like clean clothes just out of the laundry,  but clean as in smelling light &amp; fresh</li>
            <li>so until something new comes along that i feel isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;teenager type&amp;#34; or just &amp;#</li>
            <li>kinda reminds me of old lady perfume</li>
            <li>THAT IS VERY ROMANTIC AND VERY FEMININE AS</li>
            <li>The fragrance lingers long after it was first</li>
            <li>Since the very 1st time I got it,  I&#x27;ve been wearing daily &amp; has become my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>equally I&#x27;d say have made the comments of really liking the scent &amp; asking where I&#x27;ve gotten it</li>
            <li>As far as shipping, it took about a week which is pretty long considering it was on Prime.</li>
            <li>Very subtle and lovely!</li>
            <li>It is the only thing I can wear that does not bother my significant other.</li>
            <li>If u look at the description of the scent &amp; is something u normally like,  definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li>I like this perfume, not strong, and I get people who say it smells pretty...</li>

I went for months with out this wonderful scent and finally went on Jennifer Lopez site and found my &amp;#34; Love &amp; Light .

            <li> One the BEST FRAGRANCES I&#x27;VE HAD. I&#x27;M PROUD TO SAY AS A FELLOW PUERTO RICAN SH, MS.LOPEZ KNOCKED OUT OF THE BALLPARK WITH THIS AMAZING SCENT!! ITS A LIGHT FLORAL FRAGRANCE  THAT IS VERY ROMANTIC AND VERY FEMININE AS WELL.</li>
            <li> My wife found this parfum a few years ago and has been buying from Amazon since then. Her friends always compliment&lt;br /&gt;her on the nice fresh, airy scent.</li>
            <li> This has become my signature scent, I really, really love this.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It is so refreshing and light.  The fragrance lingers long after it was first applied.&lt;br /&gt;I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> everything was as expected</li>
            <li> My all time favorite perfume. The smell is amazing. No matter where I am I always get complements.. Gotta have.</li>
            <li> I really love the light, airy scent of this all day lasting perfume. I receive many compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s a winner. Very non-overbearing.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  Highly recommend it.  I have had many people ask me what perfume I am wearing, even strangers</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on this fragrance. It&#x27;s light but unique and noticeable. Never disappointed with J-Lo perfumes!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this about 3 times from Amazon. I love JLo colognes but to me this is the best one. Not fruity like her other ones and the scent lasts a long time. I get compliments on it every time I wear it and told my friends where to get this scent. It&#x27;s wonderful and fresh and sexy</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and plan on trying some others in the product line. It&#x27;s a great scent, but I wish it would last longer. I just reapply a couple times during the day. The bottle is quite distinctive too!</li>
            <li> There seems to be something different about the fragrance from when I originally ordered it from HSN.  It is not as potent, and the scent does not endure. My HSN shower gel carries more potency and fragrance than this order. Sorry....</li>
            <li> It is a xmas gift for someone who asked for it.  She uses this parfum as one of her many select scents.</li>
            <li> Found a perfume that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache or make me sneeze and it smells wonderful. I even get compliments and people asking what perfume I&#x27;m wearing :)</li>
            <li> My ABSOLUTE ALL TIME Favorite perfume for overy 3 yrs now.  Since the very 1st time I got it,  I&#x27;ve been wearing daily &amp; has become my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;. Anyone who comes close to me throughout the day, mentions how great I smell &amp; next thing out of their mouths is &amp;#34;what are u wearing??&amp;#34;  It also seems to last a decent amount of time thru the day,  unlike many I&#x27;ve worn in the past that seem to not even b able 2 smell by the time I&#x27;m leaving the house.  Both men &amp; women equally I&#x27;d say have made the comments of really liking the scent &amp; asking where I&#x27;ve gotten it or if I know where they could get it. The only way I could really describe the scent is a clean smell, nothing too overwhelming,  but does have a bit of sexiness 2 it as well, I smell possibly a bit of vanilla &amp; a warm smell,  if that makes sense??  But my husband seems to REALLY like the scent on me...so until something new comes along that i feel isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;teenager type&amp;#34; or just &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;, I will continue to wear this daily. When i said above it had a &amp;#34;clean scent&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t mean like other perfumes that smell like clean clothes just out of the laundry,  but clean as in smelling light &amp; fresh but with that part of sexiness thrown in &amp; can&#x27;t put my finger on what it is exactly,  but I do feel kinda sexy when wearing it. Maybe the Vanilla which I believe is in it or sandlewood also believe I saw was in it. To be honest,  I don&#x27;t think many people know enough about it or I think many more would be wearing it. Or maybe they see its a scent by Jennifer Lopez &amp;:assume it will b &amp;#34;too young&amp;#34; but not the case at all!!! I 1st ordered from one of the TV channels that sells everything &amp; also has a website &amp; I knew if I didn&#x27;t like it,  I had 30 days to return it,  no questions asked, open &amp; used, etc.,  or I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased. Since then have found on Amazon &amp; getting it here or as gifts! If u look at the description of the scent &amp; is something u normally like,  definitely give it a try. .is a great scent that doesn&#x27;t get enough credit if u ask me!efinitely give it a try. .is a great scent that doesn&#x27;t get enough credit if u ask me!</li>
            <li> I like this perfume, it&#x27;s really light and clean.  It doesn&#x27;t linger to long but it does the job.  As far as shipping, it took about a week which is pretty long considering it was on Prime.</li>
            <li> what a woman should smell like</li>
            <li> I  originally bought this cologne on a home shopping show when it was being launched.  Decided t try it and fell in love with the scent.  I find it very appealing and yet a very light scent.  I could only buy it in one store and when I went back to get more they no longer carried it.  That&#x27;s when I decided to look it u</li>
            <li> Ahhhh wonderful light scent that stays on all day.  I first purchased this on HSN not knowing how much I would love it.  Then couldn&#x27;t find it anymore until I checked with Amazon.  Thanks for making this parfum available.  I love love love it.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous Eau de Parfum!  So many people ask me what I perfume I have on when I pass by, I tell them and they can not believe that it is a &amp;#34;star&#x27;s&amp;#34; fragrance.  I have worn it since it came out and it is light and fresh.  Doesn&#x27;t change throughout the day and has staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.  I just wish that I could continue to purchase it in the stores.  I&#x27;m certain it most likely is going to be discontinued.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very light just as I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> It smells overwhelmingly like citronella to me. Not an appealing scent! Who wants their perfume to smell like bug spray? I do like the bottle, but ugh...horrible scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this! It is the only thing I can wear that does not bother my significant other.</li>
