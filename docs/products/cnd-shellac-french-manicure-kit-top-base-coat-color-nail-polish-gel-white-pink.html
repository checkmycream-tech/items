            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!  </li>
            <li>You enjoy doing your own (or others&#x27;)</li>
            <li>Still working with the polish to get it&#x27;s top performance.</li>
            <li>Use much more top coat to rest of kit.</li>
            <li>You will need much more top coat</li>
            <li>I think CND makes a superb product and have found out that it definitely lasts the 2 weeks as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I love the CND Shellac system.  </li>
            <li>I love shellac,since I started do on my own,I don&#x27;t have to weaken my nail with shave them off now and don&#x27;t have to worry about chipping off neither.</li>
            <li>Six more words are required for now.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The shellac polish is much better than the gel polish.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Must have for sure.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li>Much better option to wrapping my nails in acrylic or fibre glass</li>
            <li>I love CND</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>this kit is perfect if you start working with your shellac and want to start doing french manicure, go for it</li>
            <li>Make sure you are not getting the polish on the cuticles as this will cause it to lift prematurely.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery, and very economical price</li>
            <li>though it takes me approximately 2 hours to do my own manicure, I am very happy that I took the step to start doing this in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>Its so easy to apply and lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li>I do my own manicures now and save so much money!</li>
            <li>I do use this polish with a LED UV light (not from CND) and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>This product is primarily for you if:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>I really like that I can get this product to do my own shellacs at home and save a lot of money.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on how long and beautiful my nails are all the time.</li>
            <li>I love this product very much....</li>
            <li>The whole Shellac process works great, and I&#x27;m a huge fan, just not a fan of whomever sold me the old polish.</li>
            <li>this is my first experience with Shellac, and I liked being able to get a complete manicure in one order!  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the professional looking manicure I can give myself in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li>I order large bottles of the top and bottom coat.</li>
            <li>My nails looked good for several weeks.</li>
            <li>Then tried it again and it lasted a full week with no chips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to invest in the light ($40) and polish.  </li>
            <li>I like that I can do my own nails and get the professional look.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to order more in the future...</li>
            <li>At home I like to finish with a coat or two of gelish top coat to create an even longer lasting nail generating more thickness.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses it and highly recommended it.10 more words are required.</li>
            <li>Nt sure if it was new or not?</li>
            <li>I do my own nails, so the price was right and the set is complete to do your own french nails.</li>
            <li>they make it look so very natural and elegant.  </li>
            <li>I love french manicures but love the bright white of French manicure :)</li>
            <li>My nails look perfect for at least 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>though we&#x27;ll see when I do the right hand if my left hand is as adept as my right!</li>
            <li>My at home manicure looks better than some I have had done professionally.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very fast.</li>
            <li>I love this brand for french.  </li>
            <li>and I still have a fair amount of product left to do a few more applications.  </li>
            <li>Love these colors for the french mani.  </li>
            <li>First time user of shellac nail polish</li>
            <li>This was my first attempt at home Shellac.</li>
            <li>this is more off white....</li>
            <li>I started using gel at first</li>
            <li>Came in fast!</li>
            <li>I got into doing my nails myself and it is an investment at first.  </li>
            <li>Does not rub off or chip in first 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have had to replace the polishes in the year that I started using it.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors and lasts.</li>
            <li>But, i would have liked for the &amp;#34;Clearly pink&amp;#34; to be actually pink!</li>
            <li>Have to apply several coats to make the white look good</li>
            <li>all CND Nail colors are Sheer, Semi Sheer, or Opaque.&lt;br /&gt;However - following the instructions on the provided video link above from CND; I was able (as a complete newbie, and not a professional nail tech) to do a perfect french manicure on my own nails!  </li>
            <li>I am sure that I will use this product for long time now.</li>
            <li>Worked amazing and so much easier to get off then other shellac polishes.</li>
            <li>Pink is more clear than pink - otherwise a good set.</li>
            <li>The pink color is very close to clear but makes a beautiful French manicure.</li>
            <li>And much easier than I thought...</li>
            <li>I am very diapointed</li>
            <li>The product lasts about 3 weeks if your nails grow fast as mine do.  </li>
            <li>it was more of a pink color.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for it all</li>
            <li>My salon uses this same product with a LED UV light not CND and told me to up the time to 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>Only problem I have with this set of polish is that the white goes on kind of &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love the french manicure set, it looks natural and gives my hands a &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>Having the top coat too thick leads to the polish peeling easily, which completely defeats the purpose of gel polish.</li>
            <li>The white isn&#x27;t a really BRIGHT white, but a soft natural.  </li>
            <li>I also tried this using a pink polish and it was very cool.</li>
            <li>I was excited to recieve this but am only happy I bought this for the base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>And even after several coals it looked more off white.</li>
            <li>Love all the cnd products I get except this white isn&#x27;t like the cream puff white.  </li>
            <li>Prather than minutes, it is taking hours under the UV light to dry!</li>
            <li>The white is light and hard to see, but the shipment arrived safe, and on time.  </li>
            <li>I have used them with other polishes and they worked fine.</li>
            <li>Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot I have several used once bottles, but I just can&#x27;t apply it right.  </li>
            <li>New , came in about a week.</li>
            <li>The packaging for the top coat was different from the other three, which led me to believe I had been sold an older bottle.  </li>
            <li>a must have  looks very natural</li>
            <li>I would have given this a 5, but after several uses, the white polish was thicker and a little more difficult when trying to perfect the white tips.</li>
            <li>I know that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s supposed to be,  because I&#x27;ve had professional CND Shellac manicures before.</li>
            <li>I would also purchase cuticle care kits as this makes your manicures look professional.  </li>
            <li>a professional did my nails.</li>
            <li>Really does last for 2 weeks looking shiny.  </li>
            <li>The top coat is too thick.</li>
            <li>Bottles are kind of small compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li>The base coat, the top coat, the white for the smile and clear pink for top.  </li>
            <li>The polish is easy to apply and lasts for at least two weeks sometimes 3.</li>
            <li>It is disheartening to do an entire great-looking pink and white French polish, only to have it ruined with a crummy top coat.  </li>
            <li>I use regular white now and just ensure it is super dry before putting the shellac over it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s barely any color in them.</li>
            <li>The top coat and base coat works perfectly, but the white and pink is pretty useless.</li>
            <li>The white is not bright as others indicated and you get a more natural nail look with one coat but applying two to three coats of the white will make up for this if you like.</li>
            <li>The pink is definitely a very sheer color as there isn&#x27;t much tint above a clear polish.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;pink\\&quot; base is nearly transparent, which I liked very much</li>
            <li>The base and top coat seem fine.</li>
            <li>It is very decieving that the bottle color is a typical french manicure color, but ends up being just clear.</li>
            <li>In all fairness i am intimidate by French Manicures, and cant seem to get the white right, looks jaggity and not smooth</li>
            <li>At the salon I recently went to with a wedding party, they used the same products and I paid over $35 (not including tip) to have them do what I generally would do at home.</li>
            <li>the pink colour is actually clear....</li>

            <li> This was my first attempt at home Shellac.</li>
            <li> this is more off white....</li>
            <li> I started using gel at first</li>
            <li> Came in fast!</li>
            <li> I got into doing my nails myself and it is an investment at first.  </li>
            <li> Does not rub off or chip in first 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have had to replace the polishes in the year that I started using it.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors and lasts.</li>
            <li> But, i would have liked for the &amp;#34;Clearly pink&amp;#34; to be actually pink!</li>
            <li> Have to apply several coats to make the white look good</li>
            <li> all CND Nail colors are Sheer, Semi Sheer, or Opaque.&lt;br /&gt;However - following the instructions on the provided video link above from CND; I was able (as a complete newbie, and not a professional nail tech) to do a perfect french manicure on my own nails!  </li>
            <li> I am sure that I will use this product for long time now.</li>
            <li> Worked amazing and so much easier to get off then other shellac polishes.</li>
            <li> Pink is more clear than pink - otherwise a good set.</li>
            <li> The pink color is very close to clear but makes a beautiful French manicure.</li>
            <li> And much easier than I thought...</li>
            <li> I am very diapointed</li>
            <li> The product lasts about 3 weeks if your nails grow fast as mine do.  </li>
            <li> it was more of a pink color.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for it all</li>
            <li> My salon uses this same product with a LED UV light not CND and told me to up the time to 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> Only problem I have with this set of polish is that the white goes on kind of &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love the french manicure set, it looks natural and gives my hands a &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Having the top coat too thick leads to the polish peeling easily, which completely defeats the purpose of gel polish.</li>
            <li> The white isn&#x27;t a really BRIGHT white, but a soft natural.  </li>
            <li> I also tried this using a pink polish and it was very cool.</li>
            <li> I was excited to recieve this but am only happy I bought this for the base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> And even after several coals it looked more off white.</li>
            <li> Love all the cnd products I get except this white isn&#x27;t like the cream puff white.  </li>
            <li> Prather than minutes, it is taking hours under the UV light to dry!</li>
            <li> The white is light and hard to see, but the shipment arrived safe, and on time.  </li>
            <li> I have used them with other polishes and they worked fine.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot I have several used once bottles, but I just can&#x27;t apply it right.  </li>
            <li> New , came in about a week.</li>
            <li> The packaging for the top coat was different from the other three, which led me to believe I had been sold an older bottle.  </li>
            <li> a must have  looks very natural</li>
            <li> I would have given this a 5, but after several uses, the white polish was thicker and a little more difficult when trying to perfect the white tips.</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s supposed to be,  because I&#x27;ve had professional CND Shellac manicures before.</li>
            <li> I would also purchase cuticle care kits as this makes your manicures look professional.  </li>
            <li> a professional did my nails.</li>
            <li> Really does last for 2 weeks looking shiny.  </li>
            <li> The top coat is too thick.</li>
            <li> Bottles are kind of small compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> The base coat, the top coat, the white for the smile and clear pink for top.  </li>
            <li> The polish is easy to apply and lasts for at least two weeks sometimes 3.</li>
            <li> It is disheartening to do an entire great-looking pink and white French polish, only to have it ruined with a crummy top coat.  </li>
            <li> I use regular white now and just ensure it is super dry before putting the shellac over it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s barely any color in them.</li>
            <li> The top coat and base coat works perfectly, but the white and pink is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> The white is not bright as others indicated and you get a more natural nail look with one coat but applying two to three coats of the white will make up for this if you like.</li>
            <li> The pink is definitely a very sheer color as there isn&#x27;t much tint above a clear polish.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;pink\\&quot; base is nearly transparent, which I liked very much</li>
            <li> The base and top coat seem fine.</li>
            <li> It is very decieving that the bottle color is a typical french manicure color, but ends up being just clear.</li>
            <li> In all fairness i am intimidate by French Manicures, and cant seem to get the white right, looks jaggity and not smooth</li>
            <li> At the salon I recently went to with a wedding party, they used the same products and I paid over $35 (not including tip) to have them do what I generally would do at home.</li>
            <li> the pink colour is actually clear....</li>
            <li> The trouble came with the top coat, which was thick and had actual gritty particles in it.  </li>
            <li> This color of white is not bright bright white and the pink is very very subtle but this makes natural looking french easier.  </li>
            <li> The pink is very clear and barely pink</li>
            <li> My nails must be too flat, or something.</li>
            <li> It does not chip and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The white on the other hand, I had to put 3-4 layers for it to look white and at that point it started looking bumpy.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional; and I have read all the reviews - and I see people upset because of wrinkling or color</li>
            <li> The bottle is a brown bottle; painted pink; but is NOT reflective of the final color on the nail.  </li>
            <li> And they are growing so long I have to cut them</li>
            <li> Mine however only contained the Clearly Pink Color.</li>
            <li> The pink bottle product was not as shiny as the last one that I bought.  </li>
            <li> so I bought them together, Machine doesn&#x27;t dry the polish.</li>
            <li> The Clearly Pink is not an opaque pink - it is a sheer color.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a CND Shellac French Manicure Kit which was to include four bottles of shellac a top, base, white, and pink coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how long these small little bottles have lasted me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s called clearly pink but almost no colour at all.</li>
            <li> If you have watched your manicurist carefully, you can do this yourself.</li>
            <li> Top and Base Coats are, of course - sheer.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone who&#x27;s thinking about buying Shellack to just but top- and base coat and use regular nail polish as well with the Shellack.</li>
            <li> But I also received an email that the white is not available and they are sending me another pink.</li>
            <li> The Bottles are very small and the powder white polish color was not white</li>
            <li> I ordered this online along with two other items.  </li>
            <li> I had not used my card for at least 6 months prior to these purchases</li>
            <li> My only  complaint is that one of the bottles wasn&#x27;t in a box.</li>
            <li> I was running out of my top and base coat</li>
            <li> Something is wrong, it must be old maybe, I can&#x27;t get it to dry.</li>
            <li> Like less toxic/healthier alternatives than the power gel nails&lt;</li>
            <li> The white is not very opaque either so some might find that these colors are not as dramatic as they would like.  </li>
            <li> but then it seems a little bulky.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars at the nail salon every few months</li>
            <li> Just takes a few minutes</li>
            <li> I had some trouble doing the tips, but it came out</li>
            <li> (no worry about streaks), the white was a bit thin, which meant two coats.  </li>
            <li> was careful not to get the polish on to thick.</li>
            <li> It seems that the Shellac is less thick.  </li>
            <li> Take your time and put a small amount on the tips as well.</li>
            <li> (and I am hard on my nails).  </li>
            <li> Lasts at least two weeks before chipping/peeling by my cuticles.</li>
            <li> If applied correctly it lasts for t least two weeks.</li>
            <li> The trick is to not put the coats on too thick.  </li>
            <li> Hate it when you smudge your nails immediately after using regular polish&lt;br /&gt;4)  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all</li>
            <li> but this kit is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> removal process isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this polish and the LED machine for my sister. She used to get her nails shellaced all the time. Not anymore. She does them herself and it looks just like the professionals :)</li>
            <li> Only problem I have with this set of polish is that the white goes on kind of &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34;. Have to apply several coats to make the white look good but then it seems a little bulky. Otherwise I love the quality...</li>
            <li> I love this brand for french.  This color of white is not bright bright white and the pink is very very subtle but this makes natural looking french easier.  Bottles are kind of small compared to other brands.  I order large bottles of the top and bottom coat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!  I really enjoy the professional looking manicure I can give myself in the privacy of my own home. I&#x27;m surprised how long these small little bottles have lasted me.  I have maybe done 30+ applications and I still have a fair amount of product left to do a few more applications.  Although appearing to be pricey, this product pays for itself.  At the salon I recently went to with a wedding party, they used the same products and I paid over $35 (not including tip) to have them do what I generally would do at home. Again, this product pays for itself!  This product is primarily for you if:&lt;br /&gt;1) You enjoy doing your own (or others&#x27;) nails&lt;br /&gt;2)  Like having a nice looking but affordable manicure&lt;br /&gt;3)  Hate it when you smudge your nails immediately after using regular polish&lt;br /&gt;4)  Don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars at the nail salon every few months&lt;br /&gt;5)  Don&#x27;t like going to the nail salon&lt;br /&gt;6)  Like less toxic/healthier alternatives than the power gel nails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The removal process isn&#x27;t too bad.  Just takes a few minutes and yes, you&#x27;ll need to use acetone.  Overall, I definitely would recommend and plan to purchase again (soon)!</li>
            <li> New , came in about a week.</li>
            <li> Still working with the polish to get it&#x27;s top performance. Use much more top coat to rest of kit. You will need much more top coat then the kit suggests.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews on this polish, I decided to go ahead and give it a try and I have not been disappointed.  I think CND makes a superb product and have found out that it definitely lasts the 2 weeks as advertised.  The pink is definitely a very sheer color as there isn&#x27;t much tint above a clear polish.  The white is not very opaque either so some might find that these colors are not as dramatic as they would like.  I found them to be perfect for my liking and also found it easy to apply and to achieve a great looking manicure both on my hands as well as my feet.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware: Fully read the description of this product and watch this video: [...] from CND nails to understand the proper technique to use this.  I am not a professional; and I have read all the reviews - and I see people upset because of wrinkling or color not being what they wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The Top and Base Coats are, of course - sheer.  The Clearly Pink is not an opaque pink - it is a sheer color.  The bottle is a brown bottle; painted pink; but is NOT reflective of the final color on the nail.  The Studio white is a semi-sheer.  I do wish the descriptions would include that (for future reference) for those wanting to know...all CND Nail colors are Sheer, Semi Sheer, or Opaque.&lt;br /&gt;However - following the instructions on the provided video link above from CND; I was able (as a complete newbie, and not a professional nail tech) to do a perfect french manicure on my own nails!  No wrinkling, absolutely beautiful.  And much easier than I thought...though we&#x27;ll see when I do the right hand if my left hand is as adept as my right!</li>
            <li> Love these colors for the french mani.  they make it look so very natural and elegant.  I love the CND Shellac system.  My nails look perfect for at least 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I love shellac,since I started do on my own,I don&#x27;t have to weaken my nail with shave them off now and don&#x27;t have to worry about chipping off neither.I am sure that I will use this product for long time now.</li>
            <li> Great product. My daughter uses it and highly recommended it.10 more words are required. Six more words are required for now.</li>
            <li> These gel nail polishes are awesome! No need to go to the salon, I just do them at home and the polish lasts. :)</li>
            <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this online along with two other items.  From one of the three items ordered, my credit card was compromised and within one day had 6 charges on my account that I did not make.  I had not used my card for at least 6 months prior to these purchases so I know it was because one of the three items.</li>
            <li> First time user of shellac nail polish and I loved the results. My nails looked good for several weeks. I would have given this a 5, but after several uses, the white polish was thicker and a little more difficult when trying to perfect the white tips.</li>
            <li> this is my first experience with Shellac, and I liked being able to get a complete manicure in one order!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I liked this a lot.  The shellac polish is much better than the gel polish.  It seems that the Shellac is less thick.  I had some trouble doing the tips, but it came out okay.  I also tried this using a pink polish and it was very cool.</li>
            <li> I only do my nails every 2 weeks now! And they are growing so long I have to cut them</li>
            <li> I was excited to recieve this but am only happy I bought this for the base and top coat.  The &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; is practically invisible (even after 3 coats) I am very diapointed</li>
            <li> It took me a while to change from Nail Gel to Shellac but l am converted. Its so easy to apply and lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> Pink is more clear than pink - otherwise a good set.</li>
            <li> Worked amazing and so much easier to get off then other shellac polishes.</li>
            <li> Great to use for a newbie. I do my own manicures now and save so much money! Must have for sure.</li>
            <li> The top coat and base coat works perfectly, but the white and pink is pretty useless. There&#x27;s barely any color in them. I would recommend anyone who&#x27;s thinking about buying Shellack to just but top- and base coat and use regular nail polish as well with the Shellack.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot I have several used once bottles, but I just can&#x27;t apply it right.  My nails must be too flat, or something. Anyway, I like it a lot, but had for me to use, lots of bottle of cnd.  I think I&#x27;m goin to try to sale it or something.</li>
            <li> Looks GREAT, and it is easy to use. Lasts at least two weeks before chipping/peeling by my cuticles. Quality product</li>
            <li> the pink colour is actually clear....it&#x27;s called clearly pink but almost no colour at all. The white is not too white...it&#x27;s almost not white enough!</li>
            <li> I LOVE love love this product!  The white isn&#x27;t a really BRIGHT white, but a soft natural.  There are no globs - and it goes on very smoothly and finishes just beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Currently using it exclusively and LOVING IT!  Sharing it with everyone I know!  A must have for sure!!!</li>
            <li> My only  complaint is that one of the bottles wasn&#x27;t in a box. Nt sure if it was new or not? Otherwise, I love it. Shellac is the best. The pink color is very close to clear but makes a beautiful French manicure. Received quickly.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have any complaints except for the white. The base and top coat seem fine. I have used them with other polishes and they worked fine. The pink is very clear and barely pink but I like it. The white on the other hand, I had to put 3-4 layers for it to look white and at that point it started looking bumpy. And even after several coals it looked more off white. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend just because or the white.</li>
            <li> The trick is to not put the coats on too thick.  I tried it once and they peeled off.  Then tried it again and it lasted a full week with no chips. (and I am hard on my nails).  It&#x27;s worth it to invest in the light ($40) and polish.  One trip to the salon is about $ 25 plus tip for this same manicure,.</li>
            <li> The top coat is too thick. I know that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s supposed to be,  because I&#x27;ve had professional CND Shellac manicures before. Having the top coat too thick leads to the polish peeling easily, which completely defeats the purpose of gel polish.</li>
            <li> I ordered a CND Shellac French Manicure Kit which was to include four bottles of shellac a top, base, white, and pink coat. Mine however only contained the Clearly Pink Color. The invoice receipt  I received with my order says that four bottles were included in the kit and shipped but I still received only one bottle. I am hoping this was an oversight on their part and once they receive my email they will correct my oorder. I will update once I hear back from Rock and Glamorize.</li>
            <li> Worked great I save money and no longer need to go to the nail salon and pay 25 to get my nails done..</li>
            <li> The white is light and hard to see, but the shipment arrived safe, and on time.  The product lasts about 3 weeks if your nails grow fast as mine do.  I would also purchase cuticle care kits as this makes your manicures look professional.  I would recommend buying this set but seeing if you can get the whitest white as a replacement.</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at home Shellac. The \\&quot;pink\\&quot; base is nearly transparent, which I liked very much (no worry about streaks), the white was a bit thin, which meant two coats.  That all worked great.  The trouble came with the top coat, which was thick and had actual gritty particles in it.  It is disheartening to do an entire great-looking pink and white French polish, only to have it ruined with a crummy top coat.  The packaging for the top coat was different from the other three, which led me to believe I had been sold an older bottle.  The whole Shellac process works great, and I&#x27;m a huge fan, just not a fan of whomever sold me the old polish.</li>
            <li> Great kit. It works just like the ones in the salon. If you have watched your manicurist carefully, you can do this yourself. It looks like a professional did my nails.</li>
            <li> this was the polish recommended (people often combine this along with the machine) was what came up when ordering so I bought them together, Machine doesn&#x27;t dry the polish. Polish was still tacky 2 hours later. Had to remove. was careful not to get the polish on to thick. Sooooooo dissappointd.</li>
            <li> The Bottles are very small and the powder white polish color was not white it was more of a pink color.</li>
            <li> sono molto soddisfatta sia del prodotto che del servizio di spedizione lo comprerò di nuovo quando sarà finito grazie .</li>
            <li> I ordered the French Manicure Kit. I have just been informed that the product will be here tomorrow. This is great being I just ordered 4 days ago. But I also received an email that the white is not available and they are sending me another pink. Now tell me how you can do a French Manicure with out the white? Not happy at all</li>
            <li> I love french manicures but love the bright white of French manicure :) this is more off white....I started using gel at first but shellac is sooo much easier and looks great!  I use regular white now and just ensure it is super dry before putting the shellac over it.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife to use with her shellac system.  She&#x27;s happy, we&#x27;re all happy!  They work well with her system.</li>
            <li> Came in fast! Great product from a great seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Shellac gel polish is one of the best you can find. Very happy with this product. If applied correctly it lasts for t least two weeks. Much better option to wrapping my nails in acrylic or fibre glass</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish I have ever used.  It does not chip and long lasting.  My at home manicure looks better than some I have had done professionally.  Going to save me a lot of money in salon manicures and I love the convenience of doing my nails on my own schedule.</li>
            <li> I got into doing my nails myself and it is an investment at first.  This CND shellac last longer than those you buy at Walmart or so.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really does last for 2 weeks looking shiny.  Does not rub off or chip in first 2 weeks.  Loved that after 5 days still looked like I just did my nails.  I really like that I can get this product to do my own shellacs at home and save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery, and very economical price</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It has taken some practice in perfecting the French manicure but, I am almost there.  The initial cost in ordering the products, including the lamp, is pricey but, it pays for itself after 4 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it takes me approximately 2 hours to do my own manicure, I am very happy that I took the step to start doing this in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> I was running out of my top and base coat and I was wanting to also buy french tip colors. So, I found this combination that went together perfectly for the price.. thanks.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works very well and looks great! I got the UV Lamp that dries both hands at once so it&#x27;s very fast.</li>
            <li> A wonderful kit  The base coat, the top coat, the white for the smile and clear pink for top.  a must have  looks very natural</li>
            <li> It is very decieving that the bottle color is a typical french manicure color, but ends up being just clear.</li>
            <li> I have not used the Shellac French Manicure yet, but I have the base/top coat.  I like that I can do my own nails and get the professional look.</li>
            <li> I love CND but this kit is disappointing.  The white is not white enough, and guide strips would make it easier to apply, or perhaps a tutorial would have helped.  In all fairness i am intimidate by French Manicures, and cant seem to get the white right, looks jaggity and not smooth</li>
            <li> I have been using CND for over a year. I love the products, they are perfect for doing salon quality manicures from the comfort of my own home. This is the first time I have had to replace the polishes in the year that I started using it. I love the french manicure set, it looks natural and gives my hands a &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Love all the cnd products I get except this white isn&#x27;t like the cream puff white.  It looks faded and not very white.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a beautiful color.  You won&#x27;t regret your purchase.  I was very pleased with how prompt the seller was in getting the merchandise out and it was as described.</li>
            <li> The pink bottle product was not as shiny as the last one that I bought.  The nails do not look as nice as before.  Will not purchase the combined products again. Barbara</li>
            <li> Love the product. I do my own nails, so the price was right and the set is complete to do your own french nails. But, i would have liked for the &amp;#34;Clearly pink&amp;#34; to be actually pink!</li>
            <li> Something is wrong, it must be old maybe, I can&#x27;t get it to dry. Prather than minutes, it is taking hours under the UV light to dry!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like it too much but its great! I am yet to use it for French manicure but I am motivated to. USe the rest very regularly.</li>
            <li> this kit is perfect if you start working with your shellac and want to start doing french manicure, go for it</li>
            <li> I love this product very much....I will be sure to order more in the future... Thank you so much for it all</li>
            <li> I do use this polish with a LED UV light (not from CND) and it works fine for me. My salon uses this same product with a LED UV light not CND and told me to up the time to 60 seconds. At home I like to finish with a coat or two of gelish top coat to create an even longer lasting nail generating more thickness. The white is not bright as others indicated and you get a more natural nail look with one coat but applying two to three coats of the white will make up for this if you like. Make sure you are not getting the polish on the cuticles as this will cause it to lift prematurely. Take your time and put a small amount on the tips as well. I get compliments on how long and beautiful my nails are all the time.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors and lasts.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome kit.  The polish is easy to apply and lasts for at least two weeks sometimes 3.</li>
            <li> wish it would last longer than two weeks</li>
