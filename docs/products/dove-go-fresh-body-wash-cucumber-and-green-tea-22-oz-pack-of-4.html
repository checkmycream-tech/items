            <li>I love this soap and I originally tried the shea butter one, and got this one because I wanted a different scent.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>so I did I love the way it smells and feels on my skin even though I miss my coco butter and red velvet by dove</li>

            <li>The scent is OK (strong for my taste), and the stuff will probably do, but I&#x27;m disappointed that the product in the photo and the product in the box were not the same.</li>
            <li>Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it does not clean very well.</li>

            <li> The photo led me to believe I had finally found my long-lost beloved Dove Cream Oil Body Wash in Rosewood and Cocoa. So I ordered. Upon opening the shipping box, I was crestfallen: This was not my old favorite, it was one of the newer Dove body washes that I could have bought today at the store! The scent is OK (strong for my taste), and the stuff will probably do, but I&#x27;m disappointed that the product in the photo and the product in the box were not the same.</li>
            <li> I like it but I doesn&#x27;t give you the silky skin you wish</li>
            <li> all of these Dove body wash are great..typically purchase enough for one year..try to vary the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; along with the price when it is discounted...would highly recommend..</li>
            <li> I love this soap and I originally tried the shea butter one, and got this one because I wanted a different scent. I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this specific kind but it leaves this gross residue on my skin and all over my tub. Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it does not clean very well. I scratched my armpit in the shower early on using this product and there was deodorant caked under my fingernails! Every time I shower with this now I have to do that in order to get the old deodorant off of my skin! So gross! I would recommend using this product maybe every other time you shower if you have dry skin, but otherwise skip it.</li>
            <li> The almond cream dove has a great scent. It smells similar to the shea butter scent. I like it and will order again.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and this is the second order I made.</li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft but the smell is too synthetic for me. Just a matter of personal preference. Others seem to really like it.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash!!! It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not what I wanted when I ordered this product I wanted another type I was going to return it when my fianc√© said try it so I did I love the way it smells and feels on my skin even though I miss my coco butter and red velvet by dove I really like this new sent and a plus he does too it smells great feels great and leaves you smooth</li>
