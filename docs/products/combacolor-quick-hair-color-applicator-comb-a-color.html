    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best part is that the color comes out of the tips of the comb.  </li>
            <li>and it distributes perfectly the product.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>The dye I use happens to have the perfect liquidity for the tines.</li>

            <li>Great product for do it yourself hair coloring.</li>
            <li>Especially nice if you are just touching up roots.</li>
            <li>I have to say for a plastic bottle with a comb on top, I can&#x27;t say how great this thing is!  </li>
            <li>The color comb does a good job</li>
            <li>so it is good for one application of whatever.  </li>
            <li>good product thank you</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have good arm endurance anymore</li>
            <li>good product, good price, does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>She was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>I find this application bottle indispensable, and would happily buy another if mine ever needed replacing.</li>
            <li>Anyone that does their own color at home should have one of these.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>I liked it, helped me separate my hair as I go.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use it as yet, but I can see that this product its best use on straight hair not curly hair.</li>
            <li>This product is nice to have if you are into coloring hair.</li>
            <li>i do not use this for color although I can see how it would be effective.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to use shipping</li>
            <li>This applicator is excellent for even application of store-bought hair glaze and liquid coffee natural hair color recipes!</li>
            <li>I fill the haircolor bottle with warm water, apply the comb top, shake it vigorously a couple times then squeeze the water through the comb tips.</li>
            <li>and it works amazingly its easy to use and</li>
            <li>I have only used it 4 timesâ€¦ but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I am really pleased.</li>
            <li>This makes much more sense.     </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with its performance.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the even better, unmentioned use is for root touch up.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a better tool to touch up the roots of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this applicator I use it to apply oils to my hair and  scalp after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>The trick is making sure the dye has the correct thickness.</li>
            <li>that are designed to be squeezed and they work much better.  </li>
            <li>I would love this product if they could make a better quality version of it.</li>
            <li>but I was able to do it myself with this.</li>
            <li>It was also more cumbersome then an applicator bottle and a perm brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps better if company had a demonstration video with it...</li>
            <li>Besides its a lovely shade of violet (one of my favorite colors).  </li>
            <li>The dye flowed out more freely than I would have liked it to, resulting in color dripping all over the place.</li>
            <li>more durable then then its competitors</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I would not store product in this (mostly because I&#x27;d be concerned about leakage).</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product and happy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice now and find that I am able to get the roots much more thoroughly with this applicator, for some reason the front (which is most important) seems to be covered &amp; colored more thoroughly too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The comb top itself is easily applied to most home hair color bottles that come in a store bought kit.</li>
            <li>Instead of using it for color, I use it for oiling my scalp and the combs really make it easy to do so!!</li>
            <li>After thoroughly mixing the color in its original bottle and cap, I would remove the cap and replace it with the comb top.</li>
            <li>It is a great product to have especially if you are touching up roots.</li>
            <li>relatively easy to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Saved me a lot of time as I have hair to my rear and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was able to get full coverage and had no issues using it at all.  </li>
            <li>(I just warm it by setting it in a cup of hot water)</li>
            <li>and you can fine tune your application each time.  </li>
            <li>Light and easy to press and the comb makes it even easier to apply the color.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and saves so much time!  </li>
            <li>This makes doing roots super quick and easy!</li>
            <li>For the price, they should work smoothly and clean up easy.  </li>
            <li>The packaging makes it appear fit for a child but dye is not.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, but I would have like the bottle a bit narrower, I don&#x27;t have too much strength in my hands.</li>
            <li>This product feels really cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Cheap product.</li>
            <li>Good for oil directly to scalp.</li>
            <li>but you may find you need extra time to clean the top but worked like a dream!!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also a pain in the butt to clean.</li>
            <li>No problem with clean up.  </li>
            <li>the bottle and squeeze so the channels inside the comb clean out.  </li>
            <li>Makes the process go much quicker and more smoothly.</li>
            <li>It was also pretty easy to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li>it got to the root, and gave me full coverage...</li>
            <li>Distributed the color really well and combed it down my head for great coverage!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Perfect for root touch-up, especially with long hair.</li>
            <li>She was very pleased with the results.llow comb could contaminate fresh color used in your next application.</li>
            <li>As far as its cleaning goes, just make sure you rinse it as soon as you finish, fill it up with water and squeeze through the holes so they don&#x27;t get clogged.</li>
            <li>You may see that the tips go completely through the section of hair and end up touching nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using mine and suggest that It is really worth a try for anyone doing home</li>
            <li>On the side of the tube, there is a measuring scale, very useful to measure how much cream you have.</li>
            <li>Also, in response to cleaning complaints: this gadget is easy to clean if you clean it immediately after use by squeezing water through the tines, and if necessary, using a Q-tip.</li>
            <li>Works wonders for making sure my scalp gets as clean as possible</li>
            <li>right where you need it</li>
            <li>The product lets you squirt the hair color in right at the roots.  </li>
            <li>This fits most bottles from hair color kits used by Vidal Sassoon, Clairol, and L&#x27;oreal Feria.&lt;br /&gt;Before even opening the haircolor box kit, I already have my work area/surface prepared and am dressed appropriately for the mess to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle holds exactly one package of hair dye, though it would be very easy to refill mid-stream if necessary.  </li>
            <li>and when I saw her recently her hair color was beautiful, even, with no untouched spots of grey showing.</li>
            <li>Reduced my time spent in touching up roots from 30 min to 15 min!  </li>
            <li>She likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The hollow comb is challenging to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  Approximately 4 years after purchasing the Combacolor I still say it does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>However, I was using a cream-texture dye, so it is very possible that the size will be better suited to liquid hair dyes.</li>
            <li>This comb does exactly as it says it does.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it did exactly what it was suppose to do...</li>
            <li>OK if you have short hair, and/or not too dense.</li>
            <li>When you color length it does a much better job than using a brush and constantly dipping it into a bowl of color.  </li>
            <li>I use this to do hot oil treatments on my hair and it squeezes the oil out with ease.</li>
            <li>Someone made a logical review about it coming out of the points instead of the sides, but I had already bought it so I had to find out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll fill it with warm water again, but this time add a teaspoon of table salt which will help remove the color from the inside of the bottle and hollow comb.</li>
            <li>She thought it made the task much easier, and when I saw her recently her hair color was beautiful, even, with no untouched spots of grey showing.</li>
            <li>The comb holes do not seem to allow much product to get out onto the hair!  </li>
            <li>I wish they would of included some kind of small bristle brush to make it easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>I remove the comb top from the bottle, and place onto a paper towel to dry.</li>
            <li>The bottle from the boxed kit goes into recycling, as does the original cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being able to remove all the color from the hollow comb could contaminate fresh color used in your next application.</li>
            <li>I cut the tips back to make larger holes and the color goes on so easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t apply the dye evenly, so some parts were much darker than others and some weren&#x27;t colored at all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I thought it would, so I had to refill it to cover all my hair.</li>
            <li>This product works perfectly to do a whole head of color as shown.</li>
            <li>was fast.</li>
            <li>This makes coloring my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>this appicator makes it so much easier and faster too.  </li>
            <li>Walmart used to carry a simiilar bottle that worked very well.  </li>
            <li>This product worked very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for at least 20 years, but just started coloring it myself with Superior Preference about 3 years ago (damned economy).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times now, and it still rinses out easily and looks new.</li>
            <li>Not useful for cream type of hair color, only good for liquid hair color.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it is good to drag through your hair and get the mixture throughout with no tangle.</li>
            <li>I did drip a little bit onto the floor (and my toes, and my shoulder, and...), but that was most certainly user error.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that this cheapie little item would do the trick, but it really was all I needed.  </li>
            <li>Clever gadget.</li>
            <li>sent CombaColor Quick Hair Color Applicator to a friend who hasn&#x27;t seemed to master overall even color.</li>
            <li>I sent CombaColor Quick Hair Color Applicator to a friend who hasn&#x27;t seemed to master overall even color.</li>
            <li>i highly recomend it</li>
            <li>I can easily pour some shampoo (which I usually dilute with a little water) and can push the applicator close to my scalp and easily distribute it and can clean the length as normal.</li>
            <li>I also recommend that you get an old toothbrush that you aren&#x27;t going to use on anything else to clean it out once you are done so it can be re-used next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of the small size, it is pretty easy to hold onto, but I did have to refill the bottle midway through application.  </li>
            <li>The comb made it easy to apply color to a very controlled area without buildup or product waste.  </li>
            <li>This works well but does not guarantee all the color will come clean from the hollow comb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and convenient to use and does not produce mess.</li>
            <li>I used a lot less hair dye than I usually do and got great coverage.</li>
            <li>I had attempted many times to color my hair in the past, but every time it was a disaster.</li>
            <li>It was tricky getting used to it at first because it doesn&#x27;t feel like a regular comb</li>
            <li>The only draw back, which does not seem to be a big deal so far, is getting all the dye out of the corners of the top piece.</li>
            <li>The bottle part could have been a little more better, because it&#x27;s medium to hard plastic where you can&#x27;t squeeze enough out come out of the comb.</li>
            <li>Using it the opposite direction of hair growth (for instance going up the side of the head versus down) allows for perfect root touch up in less than half the time of parting segments.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it does not work well for henna, but great for regular color.</li>
            <li>The volume/size of the bottle is much too big for the amount of color I use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a completely backwards design.    </li>
            <li>Is is by far the easiest way to touch up your roots or if you are going for all over color.</li>
            <li>This way you know you are applying the coloring directly where you are placing the teeth and</li>
            <li>My only real problem was the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It is so much easier to use than the bottles that come with color because of the extra holes in the applicator.  </li>
            <li>As a natural hair gal, my scalp often needs oiling..</li>
            <li>Only one problem, it really tool some effort and patience to get it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>so you know you are applying the coloring directly where you place the teeth and the color will spread itself as you pass the comb through your hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, low price</li>
            <li>I did find that the comb portion was a little tricky to clean, but if you leave it to soak, it helps.  </li>
            <li>Today, for the first time, I managed to get the coloring perfecty thanks to this little gadget.</li>
            <li>no mess</li>
            <li>but I had no mess this time.</li>
            <li>The reason for two stars is because the product looks exactly like in the picture and secondly for the benefit of doubt that perhaps I might not have know how to use it properly.</li>
            <li>If one is coloring their own hair with a downward motion, the tines at the very least apply color only to the roots near the scalp as the tines push through the hair.</li>
            <li>It would be much better to have a wide neck with a tight seal.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t fount it difficult to clean, just use very hot water immediately after use.</li>
            <li>Trying to apply henna mud to just your roots is a major pain, until now.</li>
            <li>It occurred to me that since gray roots were the main thing I wanted to cover up, this type of applicator should be a standard thing in my regular coloring routine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>took a star off because the top part with the comb was a little difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li>If you were to use this for a dark color, then onto a much lighter color ( Black to Blonde ) I would have mild concerns.</li>
            <li>If you were to use this for a dark color, then onto a much lighter color ( Black to Blonde ) I would have mild concerns.</li>
            <li>A couple months ago I tried a root touch-up product for the first time and it had a very small brushy comblike applicator to really get at the roots</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>Not too hard to clean.</li>
            <li>First, the threads do not make a tight seal</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;re using the same (or similar) color, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, especially since the dye loses its magical properties after a couple of hours left out.  </li>
            <li>Rinse with hot water, put in a little soap and water</li>
            <li>Since I am using this for the same general color family and level ( 3VR/5VR )</li>
            <li>Since I am using this for the same general color family and level ( 3VR/5VR )</li>
            <li>hollow comb top has made home hair coloring easier, with less time spent on detailed application with one inch sections craning my neck, or looking behind me into a mirror.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers have said the dye comes out too slowly; some have said the dye come out too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Improperly designed as one review suggests (should have holes at base instead of tips), material doesn&#x27;t come out easily, material is cheap.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to use shipping</li>
            <li> This applicator is excellent for even application of store-bought hair glaze and liquid coffee natural hair color recipes!</li>
            <li> I fill the haircolor bottle with warm water, apply the comb top, shake it vigorously a couple times then squeeze the water through the comb tips.</li>
            <li> and it works amazingly its easy to use and</li>
            <li> I have only used it 4 timesâ€¦ but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased.</li>
            <li> This makes much more sense.     </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with its performance.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the even better, unmentioned use is for root touch up.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a better tool to touch up the roots of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this applicator I use it to apply oils to my hair and  scalp after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> The trick is making sure the dye has the correct thickness.</li>
            <li> that are designed to be squeezed and they work much better.  </li>
            <li> I would love this product if they could make a better quality version of it.</li>
            <li> but I was able to do it myself with this.</li>
            <li> It was also more cumbersome then an applicator bottle and a perm brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps better if company had a demonstration video with it...</li>
            <li> Besides its a lovely shade of violet (one of my favorite colors).  </li>
            <li> The dye flowed out more freely than I would have liked it to, resulting in color dripping all over the place.</li>
            <li> more durable then then its competitors</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I would not store product in this (mostly because I&#x27;d be concerned about leakage).</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this product and happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now and find that I am able to get the roots much more thoroughly with this applicator, for some reason the front (which is most important) seems to be covered &amp; colored more thoroughly too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The comb top itself is easily applied to most home hair color bottles that come in a store bought kit.</li>
            <li> Instead of using it for color, I use it for oiling my scalp and the combs really make it easy to do so!!</li>
            <li> After thoroughly mixing the color in its original bottle and cap, I would remove the cap and replace it with the comb top.</li>
            <li> It is a great product to have especially if you are touching up roots.</li>
            <li> relatively easy to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Saved me a lot of time as I have hair to my rear and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was able to get full coverage and had no issues using it at all.  </li>
            <li> (I just warm it by setting it in a cup of hot water)</li>
            <li> and you can fine tune your application each time.  </li>
            <li> Light and easy to press and the comb makes it even easier to apply the color.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and saves so much time!  </li>
            <li> This makes doing roots super quick and easy!</li>
            <li> For the price, they should work smoothly and clean up easy.  </li>
            <li> The packaging makes it appear fit for a child but dye is not.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but I would have like the bottle a bit narrower, I don&#x27;t have too much strength in my hands.</li>
            <li> This product feels really cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Cheap product.</li>
            <li> Good for oil directly to scalp.</li>
            <li> but you may find you need extra time to clean the top but worked like a dream!!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also a pain in the butt to clean.</li>
            <li> No problem with clean up.  </li>
            <li> the bottle and squeeze so the channels inside the comb clean out.  </li>
            <li> Makes the process go much quicker and more smoothly.</li>
            <li> It was also pretty easy to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li> it got to the root, and gave me full coverage...</li>
            <li> Distributed the color really well and combed it down my head for great coverage!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Perfect for root touch-up, especially with long hair.</li>
            <li> She was very pleased with the results.llow comb could contaminate fresh color used in your next application.</li>
            <li> As far as its cleaning goes, just make sure you rinse it as soon as you finish, fill it up with water and squeeze through the holes so they don&#x27;t get clogged.</li>
            <li> You may see that the tips go completely through the section of hair and end up touching nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using mine and suggest that It is really worth a try for anyone doing home</li>
            <li> On the side of the tube, there is a measuring scale, very useful to measure how much cream you have.</li>
            <li> Also, in response to cleaning complaints: this gadget is easy to clean if you clean it immediately after use by squeezing water through the tines, and if necessary, using a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for making sure my scalp gets as clean as possible</li>
            <li> right where you need it</li>
            <li> The product lets you squirt the hair color in right at the roots.  </li>
            <li> This fits most bottles from hair color kits used by Vidal Sassoon, Clairol, and L&#x27;oreal Feria.&lt;br /&gt;Before even opening the haircolor box kit, I already have my work area/surface prepared and am dressed appropriately for the mess to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle holds exactly one package of hair dye, though it would be very easy to refill mid-stream if necessary.  </li>
            <li> and when I saw her recently her hair color was beautiful, even, with no untouched spots of grey showing.</li>
            <li> Reduced my time spent in touching up roots from 30 min to 15 min!  </li>
            <li> She likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The hollow comb is challenging to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  Approximately 4 years after purchasing the Combacolor I still say it does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> However, I was using a cream-texture dye, so it is very possible that the size will be better suited to liquid hair dyes.</li>
            <li> This comb does exactly as it says it does.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it did exactly what it was suppose to do...</li>
            <li> OK if you have short hair, and/or not too dense.</li>
            <li> When you color length it does a much better job than using a brush and constantly dipping it into a bowl of color.  </li>
            <li> I use this to do hot oil treatments on my hair and it squeezes the oil out with ease.</li>
            <li> Someone made a logical review about it coming out of the points instead of the sides, but I had already bought it so I had to find out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll fill it with warm water again, but this time add a teaspoon of table salt which will help remove the color from the inside of the bottle and hollow comb.</li>
            <li> She thought it made the task much easier, and when I saw her recently her hair color was beautiful, even, with no untouched spots of grey showing.</li>
            <li> The comb holes do not seem to allow much product to get out onto the hair!  </li>
            <li> I wish they would of included some kind of small bristle brush to make it easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> I remove the comb top from the bottle, and place onto a paper towel to dry.</li>
            <li> The bottle from the boxed kit goes into recycling, as does the original cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being able to remove all the color from the hollow comb could contaminate fresh color used in your next application.</li>
            <li> I cut the tips back to make larger holes and the color goes on so easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t apply the dye evenly, so some parts were much darker than others and some weren&#x27;t colored at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I thought it would, so I had to refill it to cover all my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly to do a whole head of color as shown.</li>
            <li> was fast.</li>
            <li> This makes coloring my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> this appicator makes it so much easier and faster too.  </li>
            <li> Walmart used to carry a simiilar bottle that worked very well.  </li>
            <li> This product worked very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for at least 20 years, but just started coloring it myself with Superior Preference about 3 years ago (damned economy).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times now, and it still rinses out easily and looks new.</li>
            <li> Not useful for cream type of hair color, only good for liquid hair color.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it is good to drag through your hair and get the mixture throughout with no tangle.</li>
            <li> I did drip a little bit onto the floor (and my toes, and my shoulder, and...), but that was most certainly user error.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that this cheapie little item would do the trick, but it really was all I needed.  </li>
            <li> Clever gadget.</li>
            <li> sent CombaColor Quick Hair Color Applicator to a friend who hasn&#x27;t seemed to master overall even color.</li>
            <li> I sent CombaColor Quick Hair Color Applicator to a friend who hasn&#x27;t seemed to master overall even color.</li>
            <li> i highly recomend it</li>
            <li> I can easily pour some shampoo (which I usually dilute with a little water) and can push the applicator close to my scalp and easily distribute it and can clean the length as normal.</li>
            <li> I also recommend that you get an old toothbrush that you aren&#x27;t going to use on anything else to clean it out once you are done so it can be re-used next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of the small size, it is pretty easy to hold onto, but I did have to refill the bottle midway through application.  </li>
            <li> The comb made it easy to apply color to a very controlled area without buildup or product waste.  </li>
            <li> This works well but does not guarantee all the color will come clean from the hollow comb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and convenient to use and does not produce mess.</li>
            <li> I used a lot less hair dye than I usually do and got great coverage.</li>
            <li> I had attempted many times to color my hair in the past, but every time it was a disaster.</li>
            <li> It was tricky getting used to it at first because it doesn&#x27;t feel like a regular comb</li>
            <li> The only draw back, which does not seem to be a big deal so far, is getting all the dye out of the corners of the top piece.</li>
            <li> The bottle part could have been a little more better, because it&#x27;s medium to hard plastic where you can&#x27;t squeeze enough out come out of the comb.</li>
            <li> Using it the opposite direction of hair growth (for instance going up the side of the head versus down) allows for perfect root touch up in less than half the time of parting segments.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not work well for henna, but great for regular color.</li>
            <li> The volume/size of the bottle is much too big for the amount of color I use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a completely backwards design.    </li>
            <li> Is is by far the easiest way to touch up your roots or if you are going for all over color.</li>
            <li> This way you know you are applying the coloring directly where you are placing the teeth and</li>
            <li> My only real problem was the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It is so much easier to use than the bottles that come with color because of the extra holes in the applicator.  </li>
            <li> As a natural hair gal, my scalp often needs oiling..</li>
            <li> Only one problem, it really tool some effort and patience to get it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> so you know you are applying the coloring directly where you place the teeth and the color will spread itself as you pass the comb through your hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, low price</li>
            <li> I did find that the comb portion was a little tricky to clean, but if you leave it to soak, it helps.  </li>
            <li> Today, for the first time, I managed to get the coloring perfecty thanks to this little gadget.</li>
            <li> no mess</li>
            <li> but I had no mess this time.</li>
            <li> The reason for two stars is because the product looks exactly like in the picture and secondly for the benefit of doubt that perhaps I might not have know how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> If one is coloring their own hair with a downward motion, the tines at the very least apply color only to the roots near the scalp as the tines push through the hair.</li>
            <li> It would be much better to have a wide neck with a tight seal.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t fount it difficult to clean, just use very hot water immediately after use.</li>
            <li> Trying to apply henna mud to just your roots is a major pain, until now.</li>
            <li> It occurred to me that since gray roots were the main thing I wanted to cover up, this type of applicator should be a standard thing in my regular coloring routine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> took a star off because the top part with the comb was a little difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> If you were to use this for a dark color, then onto a much lighter color ( Black to Blonde ) I would have mild concerns.</li>
            <li> If you were to use this for a dark color, then onto a much lighter color ( Black to Blonde ) I would have mild concerns.</li>
            <li> A couple months ago I tried a root touch-up product for the first time and it had a very small brushy comblike applicator to really get at the roots</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> Not too hard to clean.</li>
            <li> First, the threads do not make a tight seal</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re using the same (or similar) color, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, especially since the dye loses its magical properties after a couple of hours left out.  </li>
            <li> Rinse with hot water, put in a little soap and water</li>
            <li> Since I am using this for the same general color family and level ( 3VR/5VR )</li>
            <li> Since I am using this for the same general color family and level ( 3VR/5VR )</li>
            <li> hollow comb top has made home hair coloring easier, with less time spent on detailed application with one inch sections craning my neck, or looking behind me into a mirror.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have said the dye comes out too slowly; some have said the dye come out too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Improperly designed as one review suggests (should have holes at base instead of tips), material doesn&#x27;t come out easily, material is cheap.  </li>
            <li> A light purple, soft flexible plastic bottle that holds approximately 2.1 ounces with a hollow cap in the shape of a comb.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that I recently misplaced the Combacolor cap during a move and decided just to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> I mix up my usual recipe, thin it out with just enough water to make it easy to squeeze out, comb it along my scalp, and I&#x27;m done in almost no time, with no mess!</li>
            <li> Also very helpful for even, all over coloring with minimal mess.</li>
            <li> Second, it has a narrow neck which makes it hard to clean the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Fill up with soapy water, carefully squeeze out and repeat as necessary.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it took a lot of rinsing to get the dye out of the comb portion (I stopped and had to come back to it later).</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to clean, but nothing some soapy water and patience can&#x27;t deal with!  </li>
            <li> Finally, the lid has a strange lip on it which traps a lot of the dye and it ends up going to waste.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to get my fiance to do the back of my hair because it&#x27;s so long</li>
            <li> To me the bottle part is too wide.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you empty both pieces of the dye immediately after applying the dye to your hair while you are waiting the allotted time before you can rinse it.  </li>
            <li> but you need to sort of wiggle it when you drag it across your roots to spread the color out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as I expected.</li>
            <li> so there is not much strain on your hands while squeezing the color out.</li>
            <li> Color does go on quickly, but is difficult to squeeze out, as the holes in the tines are quite small, and it is made so that the last several cc&#x27;s are wasted.</li>
            <li> I ended up not having a problem with it, using my other hand underneath the hair.</li>
            <li> The holes are a bit too small if you are trying to apply a hair pack which is slightly coarse.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected, would have preferred less holes</li>
            <li> I am complete rubbish when it comes to doing it myself, and not only because I&#x27;m blind as a bat without my glasses.  </li>
            <li> the negative side, the unit is difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> My purpose in buying this item was to help in the application of bleach to dark roots.  </li>
            <li> But if it were too thick, I would simple add water.</li>
            <li> I guess you just have to keep hitting the bottle upside down on the table to get the dye to reach the comb.</li>
            <li> It got so messy that I stopped and did the rest of my hair with a brush the conventional way.</li>
            <li> both times I ended up with just as much mess as I would if I had used the bottle applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neat little gadget -</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t do without this little gadget.</li>
            <li> Because there isn&#x27;t a tight seal, a lot of the product stays in the bottle and goes to waste.  </li>
            <li> I have always had trouble doing just my roots.</li>
            <li> It makes a world of difference if you are dying your hair at home by yourself and you have trouble getting even coverage on your roots.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money, do not even think about it.</li>
            <li> I learned not to use the bottle that comes with it (too messy to transfer color)</li>
            <li> Also, my gloves aren&#x27;t nearly as messy.  </li>
            <li> Would definately recommend this little gadget!</li>
            <li> Even though I allowed it to soak in very hot water, I could not remove all the color from cavity of the comb base.  </li>
            <li> Does take a little used to with how hard to squeeze to get the coloring product out but a time saver.  </li>
            <li> Although it does not include any dye, it should have a small sample of dye.  </li>
            <li> Messy, slow, does not do what it claims at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I couldn&#x27;t resist with this product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I feel I must try some of the similar products out there</li>
            <li> I have very thick and extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li> Our solution was to take a hot knife and burn small holes at the base of each tine.  </li>
            <li> The combs teeth are made of a hard plastic which makes it easier to comb through your hair.  </li>
            <li> Really hard to mix color in</li>
            <li> I can also reach hard to reach and often missed areas.</li>
            <li> So practical it is hard to write a review.  </li>
            <li> The comb&#x27;s teeth are a hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair and always used two bottles of color, but the Combacolor applicator it evenly applies the color throughout head without waste of product.  </li>
            <li> I have had a few of the tines clog up on occasion, and I may try cutting the tips off to make the openings a little larger, but it hasn&#x27;t been annoying enough to come to that yet.</li>
            <li> Upon inspecting the product we realized that it is made incorrectly...at least for what we see as correct application.      </li>
            <li> it did take some tweaking, at least for our purposes.</li>
            <li> I have a bad back and putting color on my hair was always a chore....</li>
            <li> Take a comb and rake it through a thin section your hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in the hopes that it would spare my poor boyfriend from having to help me color my hair every couple of months.  </li>
            <li> Any small, leftover color seems to get hung up in a small molded ledge at the base of the comb, close to where it attaches to the bottle.</li>
            <li> I also usually make an awful mess slinging hair dye everywhere</li>
            <li> I can flip my hair down and squeeze color where I need to at the base of my hairline at my neck and evenly retouch color at the roots instead of overapplying.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought it would make it easier to apply my hair color.  Not impressed.  Maybe if the bottle itself were smaller.  The volume/size of the bottle is much too big for the amount of color I use.</li>
            <li> This makes doing roots super quick and easy! Love it! The only draw back, which does not seem to be a big deal so far, is getting all the dye out of the corners of the top piece. I have only used it 4 timesâ€¦ but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I had attempted many times to color my hair in the past, but every time it was a disaster. I couldn&#x27;t apply the dye evenly, so some parts were much darker than others and some weren&#x27;t colored at all. Today, for the first time, I managed to get the coloring perfecty thanks to this little gadget. I am really pleased. As far as its cleaning goes, just make sure you rinse it as soon as you finish, fill it up with water and squeeze through the holes so they don&#x27;t get clogged.</li>
            <li> This is overpriced for what you get.  It&#x27;s pretty cheap. Although it does not include any dye, it should have a small sample of dye.  In fact, I thought it came with dye but I probably overlooked that part of it. The packaging makes it appear fit for a child but dye is not.</li>
            <li> Neat little gadget - By using this I can make a hair color purchase last for 2 color applications.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product for use with applying henna and indigo to hair.  Upon inspecting the product we realized that it is made incorrectly...at least for what we see as correct application.      The design of this product is made to excrete the coloring agent from the tips of the tines.  Take a comb and rake it through a thin section your hair (as would be done in the application of hair color), where do the tips of the comb&#x27;s tines fall? You may see that the tips go completely through the section of hair and end up touching nothing. The hair only touches the body of the comb itself.     If one is coloring their own hair with a downward motion, the tines at the very least apply color only to the roots near the scalp as the tines push through the hair. This doesn&#x27;t make sense.  It&#x27;s a completely backwards design.    Our solution was to take a hot knife and burn small holes at the base of each tine.  We then placed superglue into the tips of the tines, preventing them from excreting the coloring agent.  In our re-vamped design, the tines comb through the hair.  The coloring agent emerges from the base of the tine - applying it on the surface of the hair section as the tines pull through the hair.  This makes much more sense.     While the product is still usable...it did take some tweaking, at least for our purposes. I would encourage the manufacturer to alter the design accordingly.</li>
            <li> Is is by far the easiest way to touch up your roots or if you are going for all over color. The combs teeth are made of a hard plastic which makes it easier to comb through your hair.  The teeth do not flex or bend.  The bottle itself is made of a soft squeezable plastic, this way there is not much strain on your hands while squeezing the color out.  The best part is that the color comes out of the tips of the comb.  This way you know you are applying the coloring directly where you are placing the teeth and the color will spread itself as you pass the comb through your hair.  I have VERY thick hair and always used two bottles of color, but the Combacolor applicator it evenly applies the color throughout head without waste of product.  Now I only use one bottle of color with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, the unit is difficult to clean.  Even though I allowed it to soak in very hot water, I could not remove all the color from cavity of the comb base.  I had to use a wooden spoon handle to scrap the color off the sides of the bottle which did not rinse away.  I wish they would of included some kind of small bristle brush to make it easier to clean.  Even with that being said, I will continue to use it because it does make the \\&quot;dreaded\\&quot; once every 6 weeks routine easier and faster to accomplish.</li>
            <li> My purpose in buying this item was to help in the application of bleach to dark roots.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with its performance.  The comb made it easy to apply color to a very controlled area without buildup or product waste.  It is a little difficult to clean, but nothing some soapy water and patience can&#x27;t deal with!  My only real problem was the size of the bottle.  Because of the small size, it is pretty easy to hold onto, but I did have to refill the bottle midway through application.  However, I was using a cream-texture dye, so it is very possible that the size will be better suited to liquid hair dyes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I thought it would, so I had to refill it to cover all my hair. Really hard to mix color in (I would suggest shaking/mixing in another bottle and then transferring it to this one.) Otherwise, worked great and I had no patchy color!</li>
            <li> I guess if you know what you are doing, maybe it would work.&lt;br /&gt;I used it two times.  both times I ended up with just as much mess as I would if I had used the bottle applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a pain in the butt to clean.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but I would have like the bottle a bit narrower, I don&#x27;t have too much strength in my hands. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly to do a whole head of color as shown. Perhaps the even better, unmentioned use is for root touch up. Using it the opposite direction of hair growth (for instance going up the side of the head versus down) allows for perfect root touch up in less than half the time of parting segments.</li>
            <li> Works great. Get the hair color right where you need it</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a better tool to touch up the roots of my hair.  I like this.&lt;br /&gt;The comb feature spreads the hair color evenly and I can control the flow&lt;br /&gt;of color.  No problem with clean up.  Rinse with hot water, put in a little soap and water&lt;br /&gt;shake the bottle and squeeze so the channels inside the comb clean out.  I&#x27;d recommend&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a gadget I use all the time now when I colour my hair. Very easy to use and it distributes perfectly the product.  On the side of the tube, there is a measuring scale, very useful to measure how much cream you have.</li>
            <li> I thought the container part where the dye is poured into would be squeezable, but it&#x27;s not. I guess you just have to keep hitting the bottle upside down on the table to get the dye to reach the comb. To me the bottle part is too wide. The bottle part could have been a little more better, because it&#x27;s medium to hard plastic where you can&#x27;t squeeze enough out come out of the comb.</li>
            <li> This applicator is excellent for even application of store-bought hair glaze and liquid coffee natural hair color recipes! Engineered well.</li>
            <li> I had heard about this comb from various sites around the internet and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. This comb does exactly as it says it does. I have always had trouble doing just my roots. Not anymore!! This comb fits all applicator bottles also. Anyone that does their own color at home should have one of these.</li>
            <li> I didnt buy it for putting color in my hair i actually got it so i can moisturize my hair easier and it works amazingly its easy to use and no mess im soo happy with it i highly recomend it</li>
            <li> This is like having an extra pair of hands.  It makes a world of difference if you are dying your hair at home by yourself and you have trouble getting even coverage on your roots.  This is especially helpful if you have gray roots, which are more difficult to color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a star off because the top part with the comb was a little difficult to clean.  I recommend that you empty both pieces of the dye immediately after applying the dye to your hair while you are waiting the allotted time before you can rinse it.  DO NOT give it any chance to set.  I also recommend that you get an old toothbrush that you aren&#x27;t going to use on anything else to clean it out once you are done so it can be re-used next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t do this, you could end up with dye stain that has dripped out onto a bathroom surface after you thought it may have hardened.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it did exactly what it was suppose to do... it got to the root, and gave me full coverage... I would use it again and again... and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I have used this to color and touch up the color of my hair.  It is so much easier to use than the bottles that come with color because of the extra holes in the applicator.  I cut the tips back to make larger holes and the color goes on so easily and smoothly.  Couldn&#x27;t do without this little gadget.</li>
            <li> I henna my hair, and I need a touch up on just my roots about once a month. Trying to apply henna mud to just your roots is a major pain, until now. I mix up my usual recipe, thin it out with just enough water to make it easy to squeeze out, comb it along my scalp, and I&#x27;m done in almost no time, with no mess! I have had a few of the tines clog up on occasion, and I may try cutting the tips off to make the openings a little larger, but it hasn&#x27;t been annoying enough to come to that yet. I find this application bottle indispensable, and would happily buy another if mine ever needed replacing. I&#x27;ve used it several times now, and it still rinses out easily and looks new. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this applicator I use it to apply oils to my hair and  scalp after I wash my hair. Very easy to use shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Not useful for cream type of hair color, only good for liquid hair color.</li>
            <li> This makes coloring my hair so much easier. Unfortunately it does not work well for henna, but great for regular color.</li>
            <li> Color does go on quickly, but is difficult to squeeze out, as the holes in the tines are quite small, and it is made so that the last several cc&#x27;s are wasted. OK if you have short hair, and/or not too dense. Especially nice if you are just touching up roots.Difficult to use for a full-head application.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected, would have preferred less holes</li>
            <li> Clever gadget. Perfect for root touch-up, especially with long hair. Some reviewers have said the dye comes out too slowly; some have said the dye come out too quickly.  The trick is making sure the dye has the correct thickness. The dye I use happens to have the perfect liquidity for the tines. But if it were too thick, I would simple add water. Also, in response to cleaning complaints: this gadget is easy to clean if you clean it immediately after use by squeezing water through the tines, and if necessary, using a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> I liked it but you may find you need extra time to clean the top but worked like a dream!!</li>
            <li> The idea of this is great if you do root touchups.  The product lets you squirt the hair color in right at the roots.  I use the tool to get the dye all over my head and then use my fingers to spread it around.  This product feels really cheaply made.  This product has several problems.  First, the threads do not make a tight seal so when you squeeze the bottle, lots of air comes out before any dye does.  Because there isn&#x27;t a tight seal, a lot of the product stays in the bottle and goes to waste.  Second, it has a narrow neck which makes it hard to clean the bottle.  It would be much better to have a wide neck with a tight seal.  Third, the bottle does not lend itself well to being squeezed.  I have several travel bottles for shampoo, lotion, etc. that are designed to be squeezed and they work much better.  This bottle is too rigid to be squeezed.  Finally, the lid has a strange lip on it which traps a lot of the dye and it ends up going to waste.  It&#x27;s also hard to clean.  I would love this product if they could make a better quality version of it.</li>
            <li> I have to say for a plastic bottle with a comb on top, I can&#x27;t say how great this thing is!  Distributed the color really well and combed it down my head for great coverage! Would definately recommend this little gadget!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in the hopes that it would spare my poor boyfriend from having to help me color my hair every couple of months.  I am complete rubbish when it comes to doing it myself, and not only because I&#x27;m blind as a bat without my glasses.  I wasn&#x27;t sure that this cheapie little item would do the trick, but it really was all I needed.  I was able to get full coverage and had no issues using it at all.  I did drip a little bit onto the floor (and my toes, and my shoulder, and...), but that was most certainly user error.  The bottle holds exactly one package of hair dye, though it would be very easy to refill mid-stream if necessary.  I did find that the comb portion was a little tricky to clean, but if you leave it to soak, it helps.  Also, if you&#x27;re using the same (or similar) color, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, especially since the dye loses its magical properties after a couple of hours left out.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product and happy I didn&#x27;t spend thirty bucks on the fancier alternative.</li>
            <li> Definitely reduces the amount of stains you would get on your hands.  Does take a little used to with how hard to squeeze to get the coloring product out but a time saver.  Not too hard to clean. Fill up with soapy water, carefully squeeze out and repeat as necessary.</li>
            <li> Good for oil directly to scalp. When you dont want to use alot</li>
            <li> It is a great product to have especially if you are touching up roots.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  As a natural hair gal, my scalp often needs oiling.. this didn&#x27;t disappoint.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great for applying hair oil as well</li>
            <li> The color comb does a good job but you need to sort of wiggle it when you drag it across your roots to spread the color out. When you color length it does a much better job than using a brush and constantly dipping it into a bowl of color.  As for cleaning it, just soak the applicator tip in water for awhile and the hair color should just rinse out.  In all, this is a great product - just practice with it and you can fine tune your application each time.  It also works well in separating the hair into sections so you don&#x27;t need a separate tool for that - in all A GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. It was tricky getting used to it at first because it doesn&#x27;t feel like a regular comb but once you get the feel for it then it works great. I used a lot less hair dye than I usually do and got great coverage. I usually have to get my fiance to do the back of my hair because it&#x27;s so long but I was able to do it myself with this. I also usually make an awful mess slinging hair dye everywhere but I had no mess this time. It was also pretty easy to clean up afterwards. Would definitely buy again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as I expected. It was also more cumbersome then an applicator bottle and a perm brush. Which I switched back to using.</li>
            <li> Great product for do it yourself hair coloring.</li>
            <li> I use this to do hot oil treatments on my hair and it squeezes the oil out with ease. (I just warm it by setting it in a cup of hot water) It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Someone made a logical review about it coming out of the points instead of the sides, but I had already bought it so I had to find out. I ended up not having a problem with it, using my other hand underneath the hair. I liked it, helped me separate my hair as I go. Only complaint is it took a lot of rinsing to get the dye out of the comb portion (I stopped and had to come back to it later).</li>
            <li> Messy, slow, does not do what it claims at all.  Improperly designed as one review suggests (should have holes at base instead of tips), material doesn&#x27;t come out easily, material is cheap.  relatively easy to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps better if company had a demonstration video with it...</li>
            <li> Have already used it once and it worked great!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for root touch ups! Also very helpful for even, all over coloring with minimal mess.</li>
            <li> The actual bottle of this is not very big so it is good for one application of whatever.  I have long hair and it is good to drag through your hair and get the mixture throughout with no tangle.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and saves so much time!  I can also reach hard to reach and often missed areas.</li>
            <li> This works well for hair color. The holes are a bit too small if you are trying to apply a hair pack which is slightly coarse.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use it as yet, but I can see that this product its best use on straight hair not curly hair. But I will be using it soon on my mother hair.</li>
            <li> So practical it is hard to write a review.  I have a bad back and putting color on my hair was always a chore....this appicator makes it so much easier and faster too.  Besides its a lovely shade of violet (one of my favorite colors).  Only one problem, it really tool some effort and patience to get it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Description: Product Dimensions 1.8 x 1.8 x 6.2 inches ; 2.1 ounces. Shipping Weight: 3.2 ounces. A light purple, soft flexible plastic bottle that holds approximately 2.1 ounces with a hollow cap in the shape of a comb. The comb teeth have holes in the tip which allow for the flow of hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used for conditioning treatments if the conditioner is fluid enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb top itself is easily applied to most home hair color bottles that come in a store bought kit. After thoroughly mixing the color in its original bottle and cap, I would remove the cap and replace it with the comb top. This fits most bottles from hair color kits used by Vidal Sassoon, Clairol, and L&#x27;oreal Feria.&lt;br /&gt;Before even opening the haircolor box kit, I already have my work area/surface prepared and am dressed appropriately for the mess to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hollow comb top has made home hair coloring easier, with less time spent on detailed application with one inch sections craning my neck, or looking behind me into a mirror. I can flip my hair down and squeeze color where I need to at the base of my hairline at my neck and evenly retouch color at the roots instead of overapplying.&lt;br /&gt;The hollow comb is challenging to clean. I fill the haircolor bottle with warm water, apply the comb top, shake it vigorously a couple times then squeeze the water through the comb tips. I&#x27;ll fill it with warm water again, but this time add a teaspoon of table salt which will help remove the color from the inside of the bottle and hollow comb. Shake, then squeeze the water from the bottle. This works well but does not guarantee all the color will come clean from the hollow comb. Any small, leftover color seems to get hung up in a small molded ledge at the base of the comb, close to where it attaches to the bottle. I remove the comb top from the bottle, and place onto a paper towel to dry. The bottle from the boxed kit goes into recycling, as does the original cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being able to remove all the color from the hollow comb could contaminate fresh color used in your next application. Since I am using this for the same general color family and level ( 3VR/5VR ) I am not worried about it. If you were to use this for a dark color, then onto a much lighter color ( Black to Blonde ) I would have mild concerns. You could probably use a Qtip to get the stuck haircolor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent CombaColor Quick Hair Color Applicator to a friend who hasn&#x27;t seemed to master overall even color. She thought it made the task much&lt;br /&gt;easier, and when I saw her recently her hair color was beautiful, even, with no untouched spots of grey showing. I was very proud of her. She was very pleased with the results.llow comb could contaminate fresh color used in your next application.

            <li> The color applicator dint quite work the way it should. The dye flowed out more freely than I would have liked it to, resulting in color dripping all over the place. It got so messy that I stopped and did the rest of my hair with a brush the conventional way. The reason for two stars is because the product looks exactly like in the picture and secondly for the benefit of doubt that perhaps I might not have know how to use it properly. Either way I did not like the product and will not be buying anymore of these.</li>
            <li> more durable then then its competitors</li>
            <li> good product thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this comb for my mom.  She likes it very much.  It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> the combs are much too narrow for the hemp based hair dye I had purchased to use with this.  All of te hair dye was stuck and would not come out.</li>
            <li> I am a miserable colorist and for years had the &amp;#34;darker ends than roots&amp;#34; problem.  This helps me to color only my roots and then after the suggested time add the rest of the dye to the rest of my hair.  Makes the process go much quicker and more smoothly.</li>
            <li> The easiest way to color your hair. The comb&#x27;s teeth are a hard plastic.  That makes it easier to comb through your hair. The teeth do not flex or bend.

The color comes out of the tips of the comb so you know you are applying the coloring directly where you place the teeth and the color will spread itself as you pass the comb through your hair. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to color their hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I could color my hair at home.  Walmart used to carry a simiilar bottle that worked very well.  THIS applicator, however, has a problem.  The comb holes do not seem to allow much product to get out onto the hair!  For the price, they should work smoothly and clean up easy.  They do neither.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use. And, the remains of the hair color stay inside the comb, so lots of my color was lost.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is nice to have if you are into coloring hair. It&#x27;s easy and convenient to use and does not produce mess. Light and easy to press and the comb makes it even easier to apply the color. Although the material used might not be the best quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have good arm endurance anymore so this is THE best thing I have ever seen. I couldn&#x27;t have colored my hair without it. Fast shipping, low price... PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! Instead of using it for color, I use it for oiling my scalp and the combs really make it easy to do so!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and extremely curly hair. i do not use this for color although I can see how it would be effective. I often have difficulty getting shampoo and oils to my scalp/roots of my hair. I purchased this in hopes of it helping and it does. I can easily pour some shampoo (which I usually dilute with a little water) and can push the applicator close to my scalp and easily distribute it and can clean the length as normal. Works wonders for making sure my scalp gets as clean as possible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would not store product in this (mostly because I&#x27;d be concerned about leakage). I rinse it out well after each use.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, do not even think about it. Cheap product. I bought two n feel like a fool now</li>
            <li> good product, good price, does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I couldn&#x27;t resist with this product.  I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for at least 20 years, but just started coloring it myself with Superior Preference about 3 years ago (damned economy).  Anyway, I&#x27;ve always just used the applicator bottle that came with that hair color product.  A couple months ago I tried a root touch-up product for the first time and it had a very small brushy comblike applicator to really get at the roots---it worked quite well.  It occurred to me that since gray roots were the main thing I wanted to cover up, this type of applicator should be a standard thing in my regular coloring routine.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product and it does the trick!  I&#x27;ve used it twice now and find that I am able to get the roots much more thoroughly with this applicator, for some reason the front (which is most important) seems to be covered &amp; colored more thoroughly too.  I&#x27;m going to continue using mine and suggest that It is really worth a try for anyone doing home coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Approximately 4 years after purchasing the Combacolor I still say it does a very good job.  I learned not to use the bottle that comes with it (too messy to transfer color), I just use a box hair color which has a bottle it fits--I&#x27;m using Clairol Age-Defy.  My only problem is that I recently misplaced the Combacolor cap during a move and decided just to get a new one.  Imagine my shock and dismay to see how the price has skyrocketed!  In 2012 I purchased it for $8.99 and today it is $29.99!?!  I understand inflation, but that is just way greedy!  Unfortunately, I feel I must try some of the similar products out there that are a fraction of the price--too bad!</li>
            <li> This product worked very well. Would recommend to anyone doing it themselves. Saved me a lot of time as I have hair to my rear and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Reduced my time spent in touching up roots from 30 min to 15 min!  Also, my gloves aren&#x27;t nearly as messy.  I haven&#x27;t fount it difficult to clean, just use very hot water immediately after use.</li>
