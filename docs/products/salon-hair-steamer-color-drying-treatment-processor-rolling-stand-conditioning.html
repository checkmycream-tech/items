            <li>Can in really quick!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I put my hair mask on and got under the steamer, it was great!</li>
            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>Who knew?Steaming has been wonderful for my hair since then</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>The people at the salon supply store were great to work with, and delivered a quality product on time.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>She is happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy about the price.</li>
            <li>Love it!!  </li>
            <li>they were very nice about it</li>
            <li>It is a good thing that I did not have water in it, and that the water was not hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it works good</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the results.</li>
            <li>Shipping was exceptional, I ordered the steamer on Friday, April 13, around 4:00 p.m. and received it on Wednesday, April 18th.</li>
            <li>Steamer works fantastic, and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Nice price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Assembly: there were no instructions for putting it together or for use, but I put it together on my own using intuition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for individuals with natural hair who want to use conditioner on their hair while their hair is steamed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i bought this for her</li>
            <li>Seemed to make my hair more dry.&lt;br /&gt;Had</li>
            <li>My clients also love it.  </li>
            <li>Put on your favorite conditioner and sit under this for about 30 mins with NO bag on your head.  </li>
            <li>But, my best advice is to avoid this product and look for a similar model with a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the steamer.</li>
            <li>(like it is about to fall over), but it stands ok.</li>
            <li>I loved the way my hair turned out when I first got this product.</li>
            <li>it heats up quickly and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I completely filled the reservoir—to the level where the cap ends—and steamed for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have a pro and a con with the free standing steamer.  </li>
            <li>Does what it should worth my money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light and almost falls over when rolling it.</li>
            <li>I would’ve liked a clearly indicated OFF switch</li>
            <li>It gets SUPER STEAMY, so have a towel on hand to dab your forehead.  </li>
            <li>The other great thing was the price was reasonable and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Steamers are great because they really bring added moisture to the hair as well as keep dandruff away and dry scalp is virtually gone.</li>
            <li>The steamer arrives with the buttons in the right position.</li>
            <li>and I still felt like I really didn&#x27;t get the full effect.  </li>
            <li>The other problem is that the top (hood and basin) comes off easily when adjusting the height.</li>
            <li>The hood is bigger on this one,  the steam just billows out like clouds and it heats up quickly!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be using it for the first time this upcoming weekend to do my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>hot water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that I will not be paying $20 extra at the hair salon.</li>
            <li>and I used it for the first time on friday.  </li>
            <li>I thought it died after the first four weeks, but miraculously, it continued to work.  </li>
            <li>As the water heats, the unit makes a noticeable bubbling and whistling noise that sounds like a whistling teapot when it gets hot.</li>
            <li>: Hood covers the entire head, making it perfect for folks with big hair; it&#x27;s height-adjustable; and, has a burn guard for back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It lasted a few good months</li>
            <li>really pray that this product works well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eventually water poured straight through to floor.&lt;br /&gt;Ineffective.</li>
            <li>I really like this steamer and would recommend it to my friends/family.</li>
            <li>There are no screws or attachments to secure this, only a groove.</li>
            <li>and it is very sturdy and very affordable...</li>
            <li>Similarly, the water reservoir sits on top, secured only by the weight of the water.</li>
            <li>so I need to wait for little more time to see if that happens.</li>
            <li>It will make it too soft and could break off!!  </li>
            <li>I love the results, but after a few months, it breaks.  </li>
            <li>but if you’re leaning on it for more than a few seconds it probably will.</li>
            <li>The right button appears to control the heating element, while the left button seems to regulate water flow (maybe it opens a valve or something because no steam was released if this button was not pushed).</li>
            <li>I recieved my new one on 3/13/13</li>
            <li>I called about it and they&#x27;re sending me a new one.</li>
            <li>I have type 4A hair, super dry, and</li>
            <li>I have a pretty big afro and my hair never touched this rim.</li>
            <li>I barely had to do any detangling to my hair (which is a plus for me since I have very think natural hair.  </li>
            <li>It improves the clients hair, natural or treated.</li>
            <li>I recommend all salon have this produce, exspecially salons that work with natural hair.</li>
            <li>Mine felt like it was an old or used product:</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as loud as an actual teapot, but since you’ll be sitting right next to it, you will definitely notice it.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they sent me a new one the next day.  </li>
            <li>but recently it hasn&#x27;t been working consistently and now the compartment that the water flows into has completely rusted closed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used some other steamers you may be aware that some of them have a metal plate on the inside of the hood (where you might lean their head back) that heats up during the steaming session and can burn your neck or hair.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;ve used some other steamers you may be aware that some of them have a metal plate on the inside of the hood (where you might lean their head back) that heats up during the steaming session and can burn your neck or hair.</li>
            <li> However, there is black hard plastic bar that the steam comes through, and yes this gets very hot!</li>
            <li> So, if you have little ones or if you tend to bump into things frequently, you would want to be extra careful around this steamer.</li>
            <li> So I received my first steamer on 3/7/13 it was banged up pretty bad and had a couple of damage piece.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed that his dry scalp problem is gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging: The box the item was packed in was pretty thin, and arrived bent and tattered but in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only have owned it for less the 8 months now and it leaks water all the time.</li>
            <li> But,  that quickly faded as the product started randomly leaking water</li>
            <li> Vent adjustment on hood is so loose, looses steam even if vents are closed.</li>
            <li> My 4b hair was super-manageable, extremely moisturized, and I had curls</li>
            <li> It was not difficult to assemble at all, but may be difficult for people would insist on having instructions.</li>
            <li> it is not sturdy and leans as-if it is \\&quot;top heavy\\&quot; all of the time...making it very dangerous during operation.</li>
            <li> It kinda feels like you’re going to break it when tilting the hood forward or back, but in my experience it can extend at least 120 degrees.</li>
            <li> The timer continued to count down, but the steam and heat seemed to shut off.</li>
            <li> (I mean the entire amount I put into the reservoir!), and burning the plastic tip of the reservoir.</li>
            <li> (within 6 months) it broke apart due to the uneven weight</li>
            <li> The only problem is that there were no instructions included, as well as no address or phone number to call and ask for assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating this product as a two at the moment, because of those two issues, as well as the fact that the stand is rather weak.</li>
            <li> a little wobbly</li>
            <li> I will review this product again after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> It drips, and after a few minutes it stops steaming.</li>
            <li> If the buttons do not light up, they are not in the “on” position.</li>
            <li> Con... not easily stored.</li>
            <li> that is very thick and dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its specifically for women of color</li>
            <li> I bought one for my sister &amp; niece the past December for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I did email the company for instructions, but overall am not impressed.</li>
            <li> and I saved on what I would have spent in salon treatments but still a disappointment.</li>
            <li> : No instructions for setup or use; Hood sits insecurely on the pole; and, can be very difficult to adjustjustable; and, has a burn guard for back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst company ever.</li>
            <li> Because its plastic it is unlikely to scorch your hair like a metal plate</li>
            <li> The hood attachment (the part with the control switches) and water reservoir sit insecurely on the pole.</li>
            <li> : No instructions for setup or use; Hood sits insecurely on the pole; and, can be very difficult to adjust</li>
            <li> Water also drips out every time I use it which is dangerous.</li>
            <li> the lower rim of the hood (where your neck rests) was oily, and the metal pole was dirty inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this shipped to me out of the country, but was extremely disappointed and frustrated in the end.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Things I didn’t like: (1)</li>
            <li> and I must say I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> No instructions on assembly or use. Bent stand components, so steamer is not in a upright position. Vent adjustment on hood is so loose, looses steam even if vents are closed. However it was shipped in a timely manner and of course billed immediately. Now what, I have to try to fix it. Wish I could call them, but no phone information either.</li>
            <li> Shipping was exceptional, I ordered the steamer on Friday, April 13, around 4:00 p.m. and received it on Wednesday, April 18th. The only problem is that there were no instructions included, as well as no address or phone number to call and ask for assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating this product as a two at the moment, because of those two issues, as well as the fact that the stand is rather weak. The other problem is that the top (hood and basin) comes off easily when adjusting the height. It is a good thing that I did not have water in it, and that the water was not hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using it for the first time this upcoming weekend to do my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I will review this product again after a few uses.  The other great thing was the price was reasonable and free shipping.  I am praying that I will get my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really pray that this product works well.  I do not want to go back to paying $25 a pop at the hair salon.  Steamers are great because they really bring added moisture to the hair as well as keep dandruff away and dry scalp is virtually gone.</li>
            <li> Steamer works fantastic, and at a great price. The people at the salon supply store were great to work with, and delivered a quality product on time.  Thanks I will look forward to doing business with you again,  Andy Baker</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use. Great price. My wife uses twice a week. We had it for 4 weeks now. She is happy with it. I&#x27;m happy about the price.</li>
            <li> Can in really quick!!!!!!!!!!!! Does what it should worth my money! Will order again if I need anything. Nice price</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst company ever. They sent me disrespectful and unprofessional emails. Then, the product arrived damaged. Knobs had been removed and the cord had been cut. It was terrible. Save your money and avoid this company.</li>
            <li> I bought this steamer for my wife and she swears by it. I&#x27;m not sure if its specifically for women of color but she said that at the hair dressers they charge 25 dollars just to sit under the steamer.  I&#x27;m glad i bought this for her if i can save 25 bucks a visit.</li>
            <li> No instructions.&lt;br /&gt;No labels.&lt;br /&gt;Leans over from top.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually (within 6 months) it broke apart due to the uneven weight distribution.&lt;br /&gt;Dripped hot water.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually water poured straight through to floor.&lt;br /&gt;Ineffective. Seemed to make my hair more dry.&lt;br /&gt;Had this shipped to me out of the country, but was extremely disappointed and frustrated in the end.</li>
            <li> I have bought this item couple months ago. The steamer works well as promised. My husband uses it too and I have noticed that his dry scalp problem is gone. I bought this to stimulate hair growth so I need to wait for little more time to see if that happens. I would recommend this product. There were no problems with order and shipment.</li>
            <li> I received my steamer today and it was just in time!! I needed to wash my hair and strengthen it for the week. I put my hair mask on and got under the steamer, it was great! I love that I will not be paying $20 extra at the hair salon.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely matter, however there is no instruction booklet, no assembly instructions.  And when I did get it together it is not sturdy and leans as-if it is \\&quot;top heavy\\&quot; all of the time...making it very dangerous during operation.</li>
            <li> a little wobbly but it works good</li>
            <li> Love it!!  I bought this to replace my Melissa Steamer that broke.  The hood is bigger on this one,  the steam just billows out like clouds and it heats up quickly!!</li>
            <li> It works great! It improves the clients hair, natural or treated. I recommend all salon have this produce, exspecially salons that work with natural hair.</li>
            <li> This iten came with no assembly or use instructions. I figured out how to put it together  but then I burned the water container because it cannot be plugged up without water. Who knew?Steaming has been wonderful for my hair since then but recently it hasn&#x27;t been working consistently and now the compartment that the water flows into has completely rusted closed. Why would you build it with material that would rust if it is supposed to be used with water? It lasted a few good months and I saved on what I would have spent in salon treatments but still a disappointment. Refund please</li>
            <li> It drips, and after a few minutes it stops steaming.</li>
            <li> I have type 4A hair, super dry, and once a month I treat myself to this steamer.  My clients also love it.  It gets SUPER STEAMY, so have a towel on hand to dab your forehead.  Put on your favorite conditioner and sit under this for about 30 mins with NO bag on your head.  Your hair will thank you.  One thing for African American women, do not use this the same day you relax your hair!!  It will make it too soft and could break off!!  Use it 3 weeks and 2 shampoos after your relaxer.</li>
            <li> So I received my first steamer on 3/7/13 it was banged up pretty bad and had a couple of damage piece.  I contacted the seller and they sent me a new one the next day.  I recieved my new one on 3/13/13 and I used it for the first time on friday.  I LOVE IT!!! I deep conditioned under  it for 40 mins and my hair felt like butter once I was done.  I barely had to do any detangling to my hair (which is a plus for me since I have very think natural hair.  I really like this steamer and would recommend it to my friends/family.</li>
            <li> Total piece of junk. Just waiting for it to totally stop working so I can buy a different one. Only have owned it for less the 8 months now and it leaks water all the time. It&#x27;s super light and almost falls over when rolling it. Sometimes it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I love the results, but after a few months, it breaks.  Water also drips out every time I use it which is dangerous.</li>
            <li> I bought this steamer last year and it has been headaches galore.  It came without any instructions.  I thought it died after the first four weeks, but miraculously, it continued to work.  Then after five months of use, it stopped.  Water just pours through it.  I am so disappointed.  Now I have to start the shopping process all over again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a replacemaent water place for it.</li>
            <li> I luv my hair steamer &amp; so does my hair!  I use it to condition my hair every time I wash my hair! Luv, luv, luv it!  I bought one for my sister &amp; niece the past December for Christmas.  They luv it!</li>
            <li> I loved the way my hair turned out when I first got this product. My 4b hair was super-manageable, extremely moisturized, and I had curls I didn&#x27;t know I had. But,  that quickly faded as the product started randomly leaking water (I mean the entire amount I put into the reservoir!), and burning the plastic tip of the reservoir. Below are the details I wish that someone would&#x27;ve shared to help me avoid this purchase. The idea of a steamer with an adjustable hood is just what I was looking for. But, my best advice is to avoid this product and look for a similar model with a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: The box the item was packed in was pretty thin, and arrived bent and tattered but in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assembly: there were no instructions for putting it together or for use, but I put it together on my own using intuition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: I’ve experimented with the two push-buttons on the back. The right button appears to control the heating element, while the left button seems to regulate water flow (maybe it opens a valve or something because no steam was released if this button was not pushed). Therefore, both buttons should be “on” for the system to work. The steamer arrives with the buttons in the right position. To turn the unit on, plug in and set the timer.  If the buttons do not light up, they are not in the “on” position. As the water heats, the unit makes a noticeable bubbling and whistling noise that sounds like a whistling teapot when it gets hot. It isn&#x27;t as loud as an actual teapot, but since you’ll be sitting right next to it, you will definitely notice it. I had in earphones so it didn&#x27;t bother me. If you&#x27;ve used some other steamers you may be aware that some of them have a metal plate on the inside of the hood (where you might lean their head back) that heats up during the steaming session and can burn your neck or hair. This model has a burn guard and does not have a metal plate inside the rim. However, there is black hard plastic bar that the steam comes through, and yes this gets very hot! Because its plastic it is unlikely to scorch your hair like a metal plate but if you’re leaning on it for more than a few seconds it probably will. I have a pretty big afro and my hair never touched this rim. However, if you have longer or flowing hair you will probably need to put your hair up to avoid possible burning. The reservoir seems to hold enough water for a 60  minute session. I completely filled the reservoir—to the level where the cap ends—and steamed for 30 minutes. At the end, the water level was about half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I didn’t like: (1) No instructions for assembly, use, or manufacturer contact info. (2) The hood attachment (the part with the control switches) and water reservoir sit insecurely on the pole. There are no screws or attachments to secure this, only a groove. Similarly, the water reservoir sits on top, secured only by the weight of the water. So, if you have little ones or if you tend to bump into things frequently, you would want to be extra careful around this steamer. (3) I didn’t like the adjustment angle of the hood. It kinda feels like you’re going to break it when tilting the hood forward or back, but in my experience it can extend at least 120 degrees. (4) There isn’t necessarily an “off” button for the timer. When it arrives, the timer will activate the unit. I needed to interrupt my steaming session and couldn’t turn the timer dial to off. I pushed both the lighted buttons off (the water-flow and heating element). The timer continued to count down, but the steam and heat seemed to shut off. I would’ve liked a clearly indicated OFF switch but I guess this will do…along with pulling the plug. (5) Mine felt like it was an old or used product: the lower rim of the hood (where your neck rests) was oily, and the metal pole was dirty inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Hood covers the entire head, making it perfect for folks with big hair; it&#x27;s height-adjustable; and, has a burn guard for back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No instructions for setup or use; Hood sits insecurely on the pole; and, can be very difficult to adjustjustable; and, has a burn guard for back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No instructions for setup or use; Hood sits insecurely on the pole; and, can be very difficult to adjust</li>
            <li> i recieved my steamer December 27th I really enjoyed the steamer. I use it in my Hair salon and you notice a big differnce in the hair. It works wonders, but after using the steamer 4 times it started to leak. I called about it and they&#x27;re sending me a new one. they were very nice about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-american woman who 8 months ago decided to discontinue the use of chemical processes in my hair.  I purchased this steamer to help to restore moisture in my hair that is very thick and dry.  I like that it heats up quickly and very easy to use. I have a pro and a con with the free standing steamer.  Pro... no balancing act when in use.  Just sit in a chair and adjust the height.  Con... not easily stored.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a timely manner. The product was in new-like condition. One issue I had with the product was that it came with no instructions and I had to assemble it by looking at the picture on the box. It was not difficult to assemble at all, but may be difficult for people would insist on having instructions. Another issue I had with this product is after you assemble the product, it tends to lean forward (like it is about to fall over), but it stands ok. This is an excellent product for individuals with natural hair who want to use conditioner on their hair while their hair is steamed. I absolutely loved the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my steamer for years and it is very sturdy and very affordable...this is a must have for every woman.</li>
            <li> I got my hair steamer Wednesday and I must say I was disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t come with instructions on assembly or how to use it and I can&#x27;t adjust the bonnet (I am 5&amp;#34;4) so even lowering it, it still didn&#x27;t cover my head and I still felt like I really didn&#x27;t get the full effect.  I did email the company for instructions, but overall am not impressed.</li>
