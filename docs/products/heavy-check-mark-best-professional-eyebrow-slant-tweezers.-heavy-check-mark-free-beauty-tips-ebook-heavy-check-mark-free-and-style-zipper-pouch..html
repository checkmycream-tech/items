            <li>The tweezers and easy to pluck quickly and accurately without pulling many hairs at</li>
            <li>once I like the fine point tip of the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;The company</li>
            <li>It works fine but the one I have from Sally&#x27;s works just as well</li>
            <li>These and super cute</li>
            <li>The angle helps get at any eyebrow hairs you need to comfortably whether in your dominant or non dominant hand.</li>
            <li>company.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>These tweezers are fantastic in that respect.  </li>
            <li>A great quality tweezer is essential to have in everyones home.</li>
            <li>The tweezers come in a very nice case (I think this is where most of the money was spent in the making of this set)</li>
            <li>The special design gives you perfect control and professional results while the soft matt finish provides a non-slip grip.</li>
            <li>Nestled inside of the wonderful case are Tweezers that set a new standard for what tweezers should be.</li>
            <li>Wow these tweezers are pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>I received my Care excellency tweezers today and tried them right away!  </li>
            <li>so I tried with the Care Excellency tweezers and it came right out!  </li>
            <li>Mine is more coral-pink, and I personally like it even better.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy, and the tips are very precise and approximate perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love the quality and the attention to detail that went into these: from the German Stainless Steel to the amazing ergonomic design, every detail is spot on.</li>
            <li>First, these Tweezers (they deserve the first letter to be capitalized: it differentiates them from tweezer mutts) come in a beautiful pink zippered case.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how different plucking is with better equipment!</li>
            <li>This is a great little tweezers.</li>
            <li>Makes for fast precise tweezing.</li>
            <li>I love the pink the carrying case for them which I am beyond happy for because I can never find my loose tweezers.</li>
            <li>they came in a cute case as shown and are sharp easy to get the hairs you don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>Tweezers are a nice pink color and as a rubber type tip on the tip protecting them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different pairs of tweezers over the years</li>
            <li>I guess the difference is the case which I most likely will not use.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>These tweezers have a nice sharp point and work really well!</li>
            <li>Very fine control of pinching action due to accurate surface connection.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re both easy to spot in my makeup case or when I&#x27;ve left them in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I honestly could care less how a company dresses up a set of tweezers - the color, the packaging, etc...</li>
            <li>and I love the pink color  and case it comes In.</li>
            <li>This case is a lovely pink that matches the color of the tweezers identically</li>
            <li>Thanks Patricia 😊</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to grab the tiniest hair and remove it without breaking the hair or the tweezers slipping off.</li>
            <li>Very precise and sharp.</li>
            <li>The tips are excellent - precision-aligned, no splinter or stray hair is too small to be firmly grasped and there is zero sliding once grasped.</li>
            <li>It keeps my personal products clean &amp; organized.</li>
            <li>The pink allows me to really easily find them in the drawer too...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>They really are of professional quality.</li>
            <li>Angled and not dull.</li>
            <li>They grip, are long enough to hold easily, and come together with no gaps so they can grip and pluck to your hearts content.  </li>
            <li>With regular tweezers I have a hard time gripping what needs to be pulled....but not these!</li>
            <li>though these are top notch with the pink case and pink color.  </li>
            <li>My husband had a splinter in his finger for awhile, my old tweezers weren&#x27;t working to get it out</li>
            <li>It Also has different sections in the Ebook like &amp;#34;how to remove blackhead and whitehead pimples; a guide for fabulous skin: and pages of Beauty &amp; Skin Care tips&amp;#34;, which I find to be extremely helpful!  </li>
            <li>Okay, now I feel bad: before this week I had pretty much taken tweezers for granted.</li>

            <li> and I like the heavy duty fob on the zipper which makes it easier to unzip case.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection</li>
            <li> Tweezers have a very thin edge but wide enough to not get frustrated trying to get the tip to line up with what you are trying to remove.  </li>
            <li> This case seriously rocks:</li>
            <li> and I really hate when tweezers don&#x27;t have any resistance when you&#x27;re squeezing them.</li>

            <li> I received my Care excellency tweezers today and tried them right away!  I have to say they are easy to handle and very precise.  It was very easy doing my eyebrows with them.  What is also great, I received an email from the company and attached was the eBook showing how to use the tweezers for perfect eyebrows.  It&#x27;s was very easy to follow, it was step by step.  It Also has different sections in the Ebook like &amp;#34;how to remove blackhead and whitehead pimples; a guide for fabulous skin: and pages of Beauty &amp; Skin Care tips&amp;#34;, which I find to be extremely helpful!  There is a lot of good information in the Ebook!  I almost forgot to mention the cute case the tweezers came in.  Both the tweezers and case are pink, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say these tweezers are also great for pulling out splinters.  My husband had a splinter in his finger for awhile, my old tweezers weren&#x27;t working to get it out so I tried with the Care Excellency tweezers and it came right out!  I highly recommend these tweezers.  I did receive this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Okay, now I feel bad: before this week I had pretty much taken tweezers for granted. Tweezers were just .. well, tweezers. To me, tweezers just had a purpose and they either served that purpose well or they didn’t. Recently I was given the opportunity to receive these Care Excellency tweezers in exchange for evaluation and a review and guess what I learned? That HOLY HECK TWEEZERS CAN BE AWESOME! I was expecting tweezers: what I received were the Taj Mahal with a Porshe on top wrapped up in MagicOreosWithNoCalories of TWEEZERS. First, these Tweezers (they deserve the first letter to be capitalized: it differentiates them from tweezer mutts) come in a beautiful pink zippered case. This case seriously rocks: beautiful color, strong zipper, quality made case (I’ve had purses that aren’t made this well). Nestled inside of the wonderful case are Tweezers that set a new standard for what tweezers should be. A ton of R&amp;D must have gone into the design: perfectly weighted, perfectly sized and perfectly shaped for precision use. The tips are excellent - precision-aligned, no splinter or stray hair is too small to be firmly grasped and there is zero sliding once grasped. I love the quality and the attention to detail that went into these: from the German Stainless Steel to the amazing ergonomic design, every detail is spot on. My eyebrows have never had it so good. These Tweezers look amazing and work beautifully!</li>
            <li> Great tweezer. Very fine control of pinching action due to accurate surface connection.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite eyebrow tweezers that I have ever owned. The quality is great; they also come with a separate case,the quality of which I was pleasantly surprised by. It keeps my personal products clean &amp; organized.The color of the case is somewhat different from the picture. Mine is more coral-pink, and I personally like it even better.</li>
            <li> These tweezers have a nice sharp point and work really well!</li>
            <li> Angled and not dull. Makes for fast precise tweezing.</li>
            <li> These and super cute I love the pink the carrying case for them which I am beyond happy for because I can never find my loose tweezers. The tweezers and easy to pluck quickly and accurately without pulling many hairs at once I like the fine point tip of the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;The company also sent me a downloadable book of information and use of the product and company.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> I received these as a promotional deal. they came in a cute case as shown and are sharp easy to get the hairs you don&#x27;t want. Easy grip and slanted tip.  The special design gives you perfect control and professional results while the soft matt finish provides a non-slip grip. I would recommend to any of my family and/ or friends. These seem durable and will last without going dull.</li>
            <li> Omg I seriously love these tweezers! I can&#x27;t believe how different plucking is with better equipment!</li>
            <li> It works fine but the one I have from Sally&#x27;s works just as well and I paid $1.00 for it.. I guess the difference is the case which I most likely will not use.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great! Finally I have a great pair of quality tweezers that can get the  tiniest of hairs and a great price and it comes with a case. Thanks Patricia 😊</li>
            <li> This is a great little tweezers. You don&#x27;t have to be a muscle builder to keep them together.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers! They are very sturdy, and the tips are very precise and approximate perfectly. Also, the fact that they are pink keeps my husband from taking them</li>
            <li> Can I just say....these tweezers are awesome! First of all they come in their own case that zips up.....so losing them is a non factor here! Second I&#x27;m not one to tweeze her eyebrows. My use for these is embarrassing facial hair. These babies grip everything! With regular tweezers I have a hard time gripping what needs to be pulled....but not these! I grip and pull in an instant! Love them! Will need to get a second set to keep at work!</li>
            <li> Better than described!</li>
            <li> Gave these to my girlfriend and she said they&#x27;re the best tweezers she&#x27;s ever used...</li>
            <li> Very precise and sharp. Just what I needed. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this set of tweezers.  I honestly could care less how a company dresses up a set of tweezers - the color, the packaging, etc... though these are top notch with the pink case and pink color.  What I want out of them is a precise tip that grips and comes together flawlessly with a laser accuracy.  These tweezers are fantastic in that respect.  They grip, are long enough to hold easily, and come together with no gaps so they can grip and pluck to your hearts content.  The pink allows me to really easily find them in the drawer too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would mention the leather case, but truthfully I removed them from the case and aren&#x27;t keeping them in it.  I am not a patient person so a case just gets in my way when I need a set of tweezers.  I&#x27;m sure tons of folks would love them though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend these enough.  They are super great tweezers that really get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Wow these tweezers are pretty amazing! I have a popular brand name pair of tweezers and these compare to them. The slant tip on the tweezers provide very precise hair removal. I&#x27;m able to grab the tiniest hair and remove it without breaking the hair or the tweezers slipping off. A great quality tweezer is essential to have in everyones home. My husband is a welder and he is constantly having to remove metal shavings from his hands. The Care Excellency tweezers come in a beautiful zippered storage case with a cover that fits over the end. The case helps protect them while so you can travel with the tweezers and also for me when they are in the case I can find them alot easier in my bathroom. I got the light pink color (my favorite color) and it is so girly and beautiful! You will be more than happy with this purchase. They really are of professional quality.
