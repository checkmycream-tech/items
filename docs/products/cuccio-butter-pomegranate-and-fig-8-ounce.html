            <li>I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE AGAIN AFTER 60 YEARS OF MARRIAGE................</li>
            <li>AND REALLY LOVE THE PRODUCT  </li>

            <li>that I have tried--the smell is so nice, and it is very hydrating without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I live in a super dry climate and these butters are perfect!  </li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I bought one each for mom and dad as gifts for their dry skin and they are loving it!</li>
            <li>They keep my hands, feet and body moisturized for a long period of time and they smell good.</li>
            <li>Once I cut off the tip and used if for the first time, I thought the girl who sent it to me was Cray Cray!  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
            <li>And it really does make your hands (or wherever you choose to use it) feel SILKY smooth.  </li>
            <li>Def worth the bucks</li>
            <li>Everyone here is right-</li>

            <li>The first moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first jar at the dermatologist&#x27;s office and was hooked.</li>
            <li>I first rand into Cuccio lotion with having a hand massage at a nail salon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hydrating, feels silky smooth, and most importantly, is not greasy.</li>

            <li>but a LOT heavier and greasier than this), and also that Nivea cream that comes in a small blue tin (again- great but way</li>
            <li>this cream keeps my hands and face very soft!</li>
            <li>the smell is really nice and delicate</li>
            <li>/&gt;the texture is quickly absorbed by the skin and lets it tender, silky and hydrated at the same time..</li>
            <li>main thing is, without exception, when men touch my body they ALWAYs remark at how soft and sensuous my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin feels after just using one time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I use it everyday, it is rich but not sticky.</li>
            <li>and it really helps dry skin.</li>
            <li>first 2 ingredients), water, and other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>However, after using this creme, they quickly smell my fingers, and then it&#x27;s pets as usual. ;</li>

            <li> Both the papaya &amp; guava, and the body butter are amazing products.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has started to get that dry \\&quot;alligator\\&quot; look.  I use this line of butters on all body parts and it makes my skin look and feel youthful again.  A small amount goes a long way, so while it&#x27;s not cheap you do get your moneys worth.&lt;br /&gt;The main thing is, without exception, when men touch my body they ALWAYs remark at how soft and sensuous my skin feels.  That is the entire object of the exercise, now isn&#x27;t it?  :)</li>
            <li> I got a small .33oz tube of this as an extra in a nail polish swap!  Once I cut off the tip and used if for the first time, I thought the girl who sent it to me was Cray Cray!  This stuff rocks!  Everyone here is right- a little goes a LONG LONG way!  And it really does make your hands (or wherever you choose to use it) feel SILKY smooth.  I usually use a combination of things on my hands and cuticles- eucerin intensive repair hand creme (which is great- but a LOT heavier and greasier than this), and also that Nivea cream that comes in a small blue tin (again- great but way greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This butter is very luxurious feeling.  You notice a difference in your hands right away.  And the smell is nice (pomegranate &amp; fig). It&#x27;s not too overpowering- which I know not from my own nose, but those of my critters.  Usually after I use my lotions, they won&#x27;t let me pet them as I have what is known to kitties as \\&quot;lotion hands.\\&quot;  I reach down, and every time I get that \\&quot;do I smell something\\&quot; look as they turn their heads in disgust and walk away. \\&quot;You&#x27;re not touching ME with that stuff on your hands!\\&quot;  However, after using this creme, they quickly smell my fingers, and then it&#x27;s pets as usual. ;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it!  Not sure if I&#x27;ll go to the trouble of ordering some or not, we&#x27;ll see when my tube runs out! ;)  I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and it&#x27;s only half gone (like I said - very small .33oz tube).  That should tell you how little you need (I am only using this on my hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all- I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be disappointed if you tried it. In fact, I came online to check pricing- I was expecting it to be a LOT more expensive for what it does.  Oh- and the ingredients are awesome! Mostly Aloe, \\&quot;leaf juice\\&quot; (that&#x27;s what it says! first 2 ingredients), water, and other moisturizers. I wonder if the aloe is what gives your hands that feeling of literal silk when it dries down... hm... it&#x27;s nice whatever it is!</li>
            <li> Love, love love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin feels after just using one time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> they have this at my nail salon but it costs more there!!..I think this is very good.....like the way it smells and it really helps dry skin.</li>
