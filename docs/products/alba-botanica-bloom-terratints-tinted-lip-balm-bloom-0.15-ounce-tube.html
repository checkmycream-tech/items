    <ol>
            <li>AMAZING!!!!    </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is the best ever tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li>This color is perfect too.</li>
            <li>It was a good product otherwise.</li>
            <li>All around good purchase though.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely product with a great color.</li>
            <li>and we love it!</li>
            <li>This has always been my favorite lip balm and this purchase came in 3!</li>
            <li>The tint is not as good as it was, it is very very light and not noticeable at all.  </li>
            <li>I keep it handy in my purse and my medicin cabinets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that I can just smooth it on without checking in a mirror to make sure I didn&#x27;t smear or anything, since the color matches my lips</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a great lip balm, no &amp;#34;flavoring&amp;#34; and a great consistency and made with good ingredients, but I like that there is a bit of tint, and this one is so minimal that you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li>Per the Alba website, their products are 100% vegetarian and their lip balm has some impressive ingredients for those of us looking for a more natural product.</li>
            <li>I love that its natural and organic, perfect for day time</li>
            <li>I also own this product in Blaze color, and if I&#x27;m going out at night or just feel like it, I will smooth a light layer of Bloom on first, then top it with Blaze for a perfect pop.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but Bloom is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I switched from Neutrogena Revitalizing Lip Balm in Fresh Plum (which I loved</li>
            <li>Having so many allergies</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years now, and I can&#x27;t leave home without it.  </li>
            <li>It had a very nice tint, which matched my complexion very well.  </li>
            <li>This particular lip balm, Alba Botanica, color \\&quot;Bloom\\&quot;, is easy to use and gives good color and softness to lips.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has both sunscreen and natural ingredients, and it glides on smoothly with a nice sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do like the light color it adds to my lips</li>
            <li>Using this every day, my lips stay moist and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and the scent is lovely and fresh.</li>
            <li>Alba Bloom is comparable in color to the Lip Tone, reasonable in price, has just a hint of refreshing mint that does not linger and it is not waxy or greasy.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that you need to reapply fairly often.</li>
            <li>This balm has a sweet, minty scent and taste.  </li>
            <li>I usually love Alba products but this one is sticky, hard to \\&quot;roll\\&quot; on, and does not leave a good color.  </li>
            <li>I have red hair and fair skin and am really</li>
            <li>I bought this some time last year, and I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>If it helps you decide which shade to buy, I&#x27;m of Scottish/Polish descent, dark blonde hair, brown eyes, skin tans before it burns, and this color, Bloom, matches my lip tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is very easy to put on and adds just enough color.  </li>
            <li>I am at an age when I don&#x27;t wear lipstick anymore, but this nice, soft color looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I personally find the Blaze too bright on its own for my tastes, but that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m not a huge makeup fan to begin with, I suppose!     </li>
            <li>There is a definite odor which is certainly not awful</li>
            <li>I love this product, used to get it locally in lots of colors.</li>
            <li>I like the soft color and smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>so it threw me off at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also allergic to many of the dyes in various makeup products, but this one works fine for me (have been using it for several years).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now, I used to have to make a special trip to a store pretty far away to get this, I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon!    </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a slight, pleasant, natural minty taste.</li>
            <li>If lipstick is too much color, this Alba Botanica Bloom Terratints Tinted Lip Balm may work well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m trying to choose more natural beauty products) and there is simply no</li>
            <li>The first set I got, I could actually see it on the balm, the new one is now smooth.  </li>
            <li>When I got it this time around, the packaging was slightly different, however, the color was Bloom (the original color I purchased).  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same thing though, will check the ingredients later...)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to have in a pocket and keeps my lips from getting dry.</li>
            <li>I love the little touch of Peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li>This product uses natural sunscreens, and you seriously DO NOT taste anything!</li>
            <li>I will have to look for a new brand.</li>
            <li>I live in West Africa and I stock up in the US every summer before I return.</li>
            <li>It might as well be called Clear.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of flavored lip products and am sensitive to some fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using alba for years because of the natural ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li>I am quite surprised to hear that.</li>
            <li>I like the more subtle color of this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d be willing to try other shades in this line, but I won&#x27;t be returning to Bloom.</li>

            <li> and I wear this instead of lipstick which makes my lips dry.  </li>

            <li> it is made from natural ingredients but the taste of this lip balm is hard to get past.</li>
            <li> It feels like a lip balm (less waxy than Chapstick) and also adds a touch of color.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips tingle slightly</li>
            <li> It enhances what color I already have, plus a little added umph.</li>
            <li> but I do like a little color.  </li>
            <li> There is a very slight medicated feeling, but I can&#x27;t taste anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Terra tints for a long time and the only time I had a problem was when the shipper sent expired product and it had dried out and become waxy and impossible to put on.</li>
            <li> I like a little color with lip gloss and this is it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m huge into wearing sunscreen, but couldn&#x27;t ever find lip balm sunscreen that didn&#x27;t taste horrible.    </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and there are no parabens or other nasty ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that mentioned going on clumpy - or having a bad texture.</li>
            <li> but I find it unpleasant.</li>
            <li> but again, it leaves an unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> disappointed--</li>
            <li> Either way, try this product out, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> I bought two of these, I found them to feel a bit gritty and they go on sort of dry. There is a definite odor which is certainly not awful but I find it unpleasant. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now, I used to have to make a special trip to a store pretty far away to get this, I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon!    I&#x27;m huge into wearing sunscreen, but couldn&#x27;t ever find lip balm sunscreen that didn&#x27;t taste horrible.    This product uses natural sunscreens, and you seriously DO NOT taste anything! There&#x27;s a slight, pleasant, natural minty taste. AMAZING!!!!    If it helps you decide which shade to buy, I&#x27;m of Scottish/Polish descent, dark blonde hair, brown eyes, skin tans before it burns, and this color, Bloom, matches my lip tone perfectly. It enhances what color I already have, plus a little added umph. It&#x27;s great that I can just smooth it on without checking in a mirror to make sure I didn&#x27;t smear or anything, since the color matches my lips so darn well! :) I also own this product in Blaze color, and if I&#x27;m going out at night or just feel like it, I will smooth a light layer of Bloom on first, then top it with Blaze for a perfect pop.

            <li> I like a little color with lip gloss and this is it! I&#x27;ve ordered it before and continue to be impresses. It&#x27;s easy to have in a pocket and keeps my lips from getting dry. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using Blistex Lip Tone for years and now that it is no longer made started searching for a replacement. I just received my first order of 3 tubes of Alba Bloom and am sorry I didn&#x27;t find this product sooner. I am not a fan of flavored lip products and am sensitive to some fragrances.  Alba Bloom is comparable in color to the Lip Tone, reasonable in price, has just a hint of refreshing mint that does not linger and it is not waxy or greasy. Per the Alba website, their products are 100% vegetarian and their lip balm has some impressive ingredients for those of us looking for a more natural product. I know this will be on my Amazon subscribe and save. I&#x27;ve already ordered some extra tubes to share.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever tinted lip balm. My daughters and i use it daily and we love it! This color is perfect too.</li>
            <li> I bought this some time last year, and I liked it very much.  It had a very nice tint, which matched my complexion very well.  The lip balm itself worked well and I wear this instead of lipstick which makes my lips dry.  When I got it this time around, the packaging was slightly different, however, the color was Bloom (the original color I purchased).  The tint is not as good as it was, it is very very light and not noticeable at all.  The mineral extracts also seems to have been eliminated from the lip balm.  The first set I got, I could actually see it on the balm, the new one is now smooth.  I will have to look for a new brand.</li>
            <li> This product gives you a hint of color while providing sun protection. The price is reasonable and there are no parabens or other nasty ingredients. My only issue is that you need to reapply fairly often.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear lipstick but I do like a little color.  This lip balm is very easy to put on and adds just enough color.  I tried several colors but Bloom is my favorite.  It&#x27;s not too pink.  I like the more subtle color of this one.</li>
            <li> This balm has a sweet, minty scent and taste.  I love that it has both sunscreen and natural ingredients, and it glides on smoothly with a nice sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on me, Bloom has no tint to it whatsoever.  It might as well be called Clear.  I have red hair and fair skin and am really disappointed-- I switched from Neutrogena Revitalizing Lip Balm in Fresh Plum (which I loved but I&#x27;m trying to choose more natural beauty products) and there is simply no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be willing to try other shades in this line, but I won&#x27;t be returning to Bloom.</li>
            <li> I love this product, used to get it locally in lots of colors. This seems to be the only one on Amazon, and it&#x27;s the weakest. It&#x27;s still a great lip balm, no &amp;#34;flavoring&amp;#34; and a great consistency and made with good ingredients, but I like that there is a bit of tint, and this one is so minimal that you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> This tinted lip balm came in a pack of three.  I like the soft color and smooth feeling.  I am at an age when I don&#x27;t wear lipstick anymore, but this nice, soft color looks natural.  There is a very slight medicated feeling, but I can&#x27;t taste anything.  If lipstick is too much color, this Alba Botanica Bloom Terratints Tinted Lip Balm may work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using alba for years because of the natural ingredients in it.  However, they have now added sunscreen elements in it.  I don&#x27;t want to have this chemical on my lips.  Having so many allergies I don&#x27;t want to chance this added stress on my system.  Too bad.  It was a good product otherwise.</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite lip balm and this purchase came in 3! Only thing is the tube has a different cover on it so it threw me off at first (I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same thing though, will check the ingredients later...) All around good purchase though.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product with a great color. I love that its natural and organic, perfect for day time</li>
            <li> I like that it is made from natural ingredients but the taste of this lip balm is hard to get past. I do like the light color it adds to my lips but again, it leaves an unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> The lip balm I got has a different label and and is obviously a different formula. Unlike the bloom terratints I&#x27;ve bought before, this doesn&#x27;t relieve chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I like this tinted lip balm to keep my lips moist and add a hint of color.  It feels like a lip balm (less waxy than Chapstick) and also adds a touch of color. I keep it handy in my purse and my medicin cabinets. I&#x27;m also allergic to many of the dyes in various makeup products, but this one works fine for me (have been using it for several years).</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years now, and I can&#x27;t leave home without it.  I live in West Africa and I stock up in the US every summer before I return. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that mentioned going on clumpy - or having a bad texture. I am quite surprised to hear that.

Using this every day, my lips stay moist and smooth.  I love the little touch of Peppermint oil.  It makes my lips tingle slightly and the scent is lovely and fresh.</li>
            <li> I usually love Alba products but this one is sticky, hard to \\&quot;roll\\&quot; on, and does not leave a good color.  I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t a gift.</li>
