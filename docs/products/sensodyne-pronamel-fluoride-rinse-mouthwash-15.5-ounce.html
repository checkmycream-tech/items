            <li>awesome product a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>An excellent product very hard to find in the U.S.</li>
            <li>Really helps with sensitive teeth issues and gives a very fresh feeling to the mouth after use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad because it was a great product and loved the features, especially rebuilding the enamel and no sting formula.</li>
            <li>For some reason I thought there were two bottles in the package, so the price looked reasonable.</li>
            <li>I am unsure why this product made in Germany is no longer available at local stores</li>

            <li>It really helps with tooth sensitivity and doesn&#x27;t taste as bitter as many other mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries this, because it&#x27;s increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li>Luckily there are other products on the market now</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable eating and drinking acidic foods and drinking coffee and other such like products knowing I am protecting my enamel.  </li>
            <li>this is definitely the size necessary, keeps your mouth feeling clean long after use.</li>
            <li>I caught this exact size for buy one get the second one half off at rite aid.</li>

            <li> Using it for a year now. Works.</li>
            <li> Love this product as well as the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries this, because it&#x27;s increasingly hard to find. Although it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s definitely a step above Listerine and other competitors that I&#x27;ve tried. It really helps with tooth sensitivity and doesn&#x27;t taste as bitter as many other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This an excellent product, recommended by my dentist. The price is extremely high. I caught this exact size for buy one get the second one half off at rite aid. I paid less for those then one bottle from Amazi. Now I can&#x27;t find it nowhere but Amazon. I guess I&#x27;m gonna be a returning custtomer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but I could have sworn it&#x27;s cheaper in-store.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the mouthwash in the world and this is the only one that works for me in keeping my teeth white and mouth fresh and clean.</li>

            <li> An excellent product very hard to find in the U.S. Really helps with sensitive teeth issues and gives a very fresh feeling to the mouth after use.  Less stinging than a lot of other mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this product but sadly it has become difficult to find.  It is not available in any store and the Amazon supply is dwindling.  Spoke to the manufacturer and they advised that they were having production issues but it&#x27;s been months now and still no luck.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a clear difference between this product and other fluoride rinses.  It is way over priced for the lack of results.  It does have a pleasant taste and your teeth do feel clean after brushing and rinsing.  But other lest costly rinses do the same.  Time will tell on the issue of cavities and enamel errosion.</li>
            <li> Great deal for a great product! Took a few weeks to get the product though so a lot longer than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Great product! Buying another one again.</li>
            <li> This product has helped strengthen my enamel along with the sensodyne toothpaste. It is so difficult to buy in the stores which tells me it is a very popular item. I  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought there were two bottles in the package, so the price looked reasonable. When I realized that there was only ONE bottle, the price became ridiculous. The product is OK, but I will not be buying it this way again.</li>
            <li> great new product.  this is definitely the size necessary, keeps your mouth feeling clean long after use.</li>
            <li> Pricing was a rip off, but I can&#x27;t find this in regular stores anymore.  Guess I&#x27;ll be going without once I run out.</li>
            <li> Product was received and was as pictured. Delivered very fast and satisfied with purchase. However, knowing I used to buy this item at a reasonable cost ($6.98 @ bottle) at local stores until a few months ago, I cannot justify the cost with shipping and handling to continue using. I am unsure why this product made in Germany is no longer available at local stores but like all the products discontinued, I will find a more affordable replacement. It&#x27;s too bad because it was a great product and loved the features, especially rebuilding the enamel and no sting formula. Luckily there are other products on the market now that have similar features as this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash.  Thank you, Amazon.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find any where.  I am so happy you carry it.  It is worth the little extra price from other mouthwashes.  I feel comfortable eating and drinking acidic foods and drinking coffee and other such like products knowing I am protecting my enamel.  Also, it tastes Great.</li>
            <li> I purchased (2) 15.5oz bottles @ $24.50 ea. This product was recommended by my dentists office for dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The product works no better than Biotene and the cost for a 16oz bottle of Biotene at our  local Walgreens is around $8.00&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great rinse, it does not stain your teeth.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Waiting for it  to hit the shelves again</li>
            <li> awesome product a little pricey but worth it.</li>
