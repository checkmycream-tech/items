            <li>If you are looking for moisturizer for your sensitive skin, this one is your best bet.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I have been happy with Cremo brand products so far, trying the shave cream and being happy with it</li>
            <li>Very nice moisturizer, it absorbs into the skin quickly and does not leave an oily shine.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job of keeping my skin looking healthy.  </li>
            <li>Very light and not oily for summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and not cakey.</li>
            <li>and I love that they have no scent.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Cremo is my favorite moisturizer, alongside CeraVe.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions, including that excellent udder moisturizer and a valon aloe lotion.</li>
            <li>Not overly viscous, so it goes on and penetrates easily, which is especially nice when you add some facial hair to the mix.</li>
            <li>It has a very clean feel and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband since he loved the shaving cream so much.  </li>
            <li>Great light moisturizer that does not leave face feeling oily or clogged, would love to see natural vitamins added to the formula but this is overall great stuff.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>Cremo moisturizer is light, goes on easily, and immediately leaves your face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>It is very light on me, not greasy but brings the right light and evens out the tone after a couple of weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>What I like about this product is that it feels really light on the skin and does not leave that sticky feel or shiny apperance after application.</li>
            <li>Hope it&#x27;s always available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the shave creme; leaves my skin soft and hydrated and lasts all day...</li>
            <li>Slap this stuff on my face right after I use Cremo Face wash, and right before I rub in my Honest Amish Beard Conditioner.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer applies easily and absorbs quickly into my skin without any oily feel and my skin feels softer.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy, super light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My face feels more refreshed and doesn&#x27;t flake as much.</li>
            <li>I tried it and loved it as a facial moisturizer before putting on makeup!!</li>
            <li>This product works very gently to keep my skin hydrated throughout the day, and helps my face stay cool!</li>
            <li>Works great and costs a fraction of some of the other mansturizers out there.</li>
            <li>After that I would say Cremo or Lucky Tiger Face Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Non greasy and absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, absorbs quickly and does its job.</li>
            <li>It is super absorbent for my skin.</li>
            <li>It spreads so easily you don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>This is far and away my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>have pretty sensitive skin and many o moisturizers leave my face itchy.</li>
            <li>Its nice and light with a little bit of a scent, but</li>
            <li>During drier weather, I&#x27;ll need to reapply multiple times since it&#x27;s very light, but--</li>
            <li>My only two complaints are that it makes my face a bit &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; &amp; it has a very light residual odor.</li>
            <li>My facial skin is ultra sensitive, got burns/stings easily with most 86% of products out there.</li>
            <li>This lotion hydrates pretty well but didn&#x27;t relieve some of my skin issues (eczema) on side of face.  </li>
            <li>It may make a better summer lotion as I&#x27;ve only tried it during the winter.  </li>
            <li>I will update my review over long term use but so far this has been a good men’s moisturizer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good everyday moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing yet not greasy and leaves nothing but a soft, smooth face.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it all the time, but when your face is subject to dry weather, it&#x27;s a very good product in conjunction with the Cremo face wash.</li>
            <li>I have used many moisturizers over the years, most of which were thick, almost greasy, and did not leave my face feeling much of anything.</li>
            <li>Cremo wins as far as price goes.</li>
            <li>Really like their shave cream too.</li>
            <li>but this moisturizer is gentle and nurturing to my skin.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is a white in color and a light liquid that doesn’t have any scent that I could detect.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this the last few days on my face and so far I have been happy with it.  </li>
            <li>My personal favorite is Clinque Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion.</li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, but is not greasy and leaves my face smooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff absorbs fairly quickly and leaves little if any residue.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34; the underside of an old mattress&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve thought about adding some essential oil but haven&#x27;t gotten this far yet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought tons of drugstore brands, tried independent brands, and most are too thick, sticky, or sting.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone, especially for those with sensitive skin that don&#x27;t like the residue left by some after-shave products.</li>
            <li>My skin was a little bumpy after I first started using it</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Dope. Not too greasy, not too oily, not too thick, and not too runny. No SPF, so I use it as a night creme. Slap this stuff on my face right after I use Cremo Face wash, and right before I rub in my Honest Amish Beard Conditioner. I like it better than all the fancy expensive crap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like moisturizers gooping you up, but need some help in the dry winter air? Here&#x27;s your answer. Doesn&#x27;t smell terrible like so many others - a big plus.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and after shaving my skin is starving for some soothing moisturizer. My personal favorite is Clinque Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion. After that I would say Cremo or Lucky Tiger Face Moisturizer. All work incredibly and I love that they have no scent. I hate to use several different products all with their own scents. Cremo wins as far as price goes. I will buy this product for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it feels really light on the skin and does not leave that sticky feel or shiny apperance after application. A good product for a price.</li>
            <li> I love the face cream and especially love the shave cream.  The shave cream is the BEST I have ever used.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Cremo Cream Face Moisturizer is all that it&#x27;s touted to be. Feels good and works great. Hope it&#x27;s always available.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for Men</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Cremo Cream Face Moisturizer for 2 years now and it&#x27;s the only moisturizer that I will use now. I&#x27;ve bought tons of drugstore brands, tried independent brands, and most are too thick, sticky, or sting. The Cremo Moisturizer is really lightweight and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause any breakouts and soothes any raw patches I have without burning. During drier weather, I&#x27;ll need to reapply multiple times since it&#x27;s very light, but-- I&#x27;d rather reapply the Cremo Moisturizer rather than reaching for a thick cream that suffocates my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Non greasy and absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it all the time, but when your face is subject to dry weather, it&#x27;s a very good product in conjunction with the Cremo face wash.</li>
            <li> Cremo makes the best shave creme, so I tried the face lotion. It&#x27;s just as good as the shave creme; leaves my skin soft and hydrated and lasts all day...the best!</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer, it absorbs into the skin quickly and does not leave an oily shine.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer - use also on sunburns with excellent results</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy, super light moisturizer. Love it.</li>
            <li> Cremo is my favorite moisturizer, alongside CeraVe. It&#x27;s lightweight, absorbs quickly and does its job. My face feels more refreshed and doesn&#x27;t flake as much. I&#x27;m on retinoids for acne so dryness is a big concern for me.</li>
            <li> This is a good everyday moisturizer.  It does a nice job of keeping my skin looking healthy.  My only two complaints are that it makes my face a bit &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; &amp; it has a very light residual odor.</li>
            <li> This is far and away my favorite moisturizer. Not overly viscous, so it goes on and penetrates easily, which is especially nice when you add some facial hair to the mix. Works great and costs a fraction of some of the other mansturizers out there.</li>
            <li> Best face lotion and after shave cream I have ever used (have tried Nivea, Gilette, Dove... etc)  Leaves your face feeling great but leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> My facial skin is ultra sensitive, got burns/stings easily with most 86% of products out there. This product works very gently to keep my skin hydrated throughout the day, and helps my face stay cool! I even replace it with my night cream now. It is very light on me, not greasy but brings the right light and evens out the tone after a couple of weeks of using it. It is super absorbent for my skin. If you are looking for moisturizer for your sensitive skin, this one is your best bet.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Well it is certainly one of the best face moisturizers I have used and I have tried many.  No fragrance.  No shiny oiliness.  No breakouts.  Perfect post shave.  I have been using now for over a year.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I have ever used !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have used many moisturizers over the years, most of which were thick, almost greasy, and did not leave my face feeling much of anything. Cremo moisturizer is light, goes on easily, and immediately leaves your face feeling refreshed. This initial sensation is followed by a soothing feeling which lingers for a while. No fragrance, no shiny face, no greasy feeling. A little goes a long way. Stop checking out other moisturizers- this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. This paired with the face wash has made my skin clearer and softer. 4 stars because there is no SPF.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best face moisturizer I have ever used.  Its not easy and won&#x27;t clog your pores.  If you have problem skin this product is perfect for that...</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cream! Very light and not oily for summer. Will definitely keep purchasing it. Good price too.</li>
            <li> This really is different. It spreads so easily you don&#x27;t use much. It has a very clean feel and dries very quickly. Yet it works! I have extremely dry calves and ankles that require constant moisturizing all winter. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions, including that excellent udder moisturizer and a valon aloe lotion. This works best for me.  My only complaint is they don&#x27;t sell it in bigger bottles. I got a 2-pack.</li>
            <li> I found this moisturizer to be the best I&#x27;ve tried.  Very soothing yet not greasy and leaves nothing but a soft, smooth face.  I would recommend this to anyone, especially for those with sensitive skin that don&#x27;t like the residue left by some after-shave products.</li>
            <li> It works as good as their shaving cream. It is smooth,moist, and just three or four drops will do the job. Great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> My skin was a little bumpy after I first started using it but after a couple weeks, it works well.  A little goes a long way so that&#x27;s nice.  It&#x27;s very light and not cakey.</li>
            <li> Really like their shave cream too. This stuff absorbs fairly quickly and leaves little if any residue. A winner.</li>
            <li> This lotion hydrates pretty well but didn&#x27;t relieve some of my skin issues (eczema) on side of face.  It may make a better summer lotion as I&#x27;ve only tried it during the winter.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell but my wife seems to think it smells like dust.  &amp;#34; the underside of an old mattress&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve thought about adding some essential oil but haven&#x27;t gotten this far yet.  To me the &amp;#34;non-smell&amp;#34; is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Great light moisturizer that does not leave face feeling oily or clogged, would love to see natural vitamins added to the formula but this is overall great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty sensitive skin and many o moisturizers leave my face itchy. Cremo moisturizer doesn&#x27;t make me itchy. A little goes a long way. It takes a few minutes to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, but is not greasy and leaves my face smooth. Cremo moisturizer has become my go-to after shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since he loved the shaving cream so much.  I tried it and loved it as a facial moisturizer before putting on makeup!!</li>
            <li> I have the Cremo Shave cream and face wash and think both of those are great, but the moisturizer just isn&#x27;t quite as good.  Its nice and light with a little bit of a scent, but after I put it on and it dries it feels like my face is still dry/tight and I need to keep reapplying it.  I don&#x27;t have that feeling with the other moisturizers I use.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with Cremo brand products so far, trying the shave cream and being happy with it and now this moisturizer.  Since I have sensitive skin I have to be careful with the products I try but this moisturizer is gentle and nurturing to my skin.  The moisturizer is a white in color and a light liquid that doesn’t have any scent that I could detect.  I have been using this the last few days on my face and so far I have been happy with it.  The moisturizer applies easily and absorbs quickly into my skin without any oily feel and my skin feels softer.  I will update my review over long term use but so far this has been a good men’s moisturizer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  One bottle lasts a long time so value for the price is very  good</li>
