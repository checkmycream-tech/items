            <li>I use it sometimes even when I&#x27;m not tanning, to give a nice warm glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>great, all as stated, fast shipping, good tanning lotion, prefer tingle</li>
            <li>so for me (and I tan very easily)</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li>Cant get better then this.</li>

            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have had no issues with streaking, and best of all, after a month of use, there is absolutely no orange color appearing.</li>
            <li>The best part is the bronzer, which adds a little color.  </li>
            <li>Its also streak free and a god price.</li>
            <li>I was looking for product that was DHA free and after reading the reviews I thought I found the product for me.</li>
            <li>I love this product because of results you see right away.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise lid still closes securely and bottle is full.</li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant scent, not nearly as strong as most tanning products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true tanner.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft and tanned, with no streaks,  It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>is very good considering how pale I am.</li>
            <li>Shipment arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Great results less than a month of use and can tell a deeper tan.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>lotion does smell very good and the consistency of it is not too thick..</li>
            <li>It smells great when applying and after tanning, it doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks, and you do notice color after a few uses.</li>
            <li>This made my skin golden and helped with firming also.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this again in the future:)</li>
            <li>Have only used the product twice so far, but I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have DHA and the smell if fresh without sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>Received it on the exact day I was promised.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, smells fab and leaves your skin dark, smooth and streak free!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes so nice with all the natural oils in it and gets a white freckly person brown!!  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and have been able to use this product with no trouble.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product a few times now and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>but I dont know if I really tanned on</li>
            <li>Really does get noticeably darker tanning on the sunbed.</li>
            <li>I also really like that there is skin firming ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>This tanner feels very silky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will keep using it though mainly because I like the smell</li>
            <li>Seemed to give me some decent color</li>
            <li>I have a severe allergy to DHA - I was hospitalized after using some fancy overpriced lotion they sell at the salon and had no idea I was allergic to the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li>have been tanning since high school, so I&#x27;ve gone through all kinds of lotions.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>

            <li> your money, dont even bother I tan so fast usually.</li>
            <li> the results were not as dark as they usually are in my first couple sessions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was also void of a lot of other chemicals you find in your standard tanning lotions, which is what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li> I paid $40 for it, and it is not worth that.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday for a week</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still as pale as the day I started.</li>
            <li> and I look just as pale....</li>
            <li> Fake EdHardy lotion.....</li>
            <li> and they reassured me its fake and a non autorized seller!!!&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> But if you have time to get some results then this one isn&#x27;t a bad choice.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells wonderful and product arrived quickly. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I use this at the pool because I do not go to a tanning bed.  It has not made break out, it has a good smell but I dont know if I really tanned on it.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it though mainly because I like the smell and I suppose it couldnt hurt.</li>
            <li> Seemed to give me some decent color and I got compliments on how it smelled.  The texture is good too, would buy again.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, and I&#x27;ve received plenty of complements on the glow it leaves after using it. Its also streak free and a god price. Cant get better then this.</li>
            <li> Cant use because it stains my skin an orange color. Throwing it away. Buy Coconut Kisses from Ed Hardy instead.</li>
            <li> great, all as stated, fast shipping, good tanning lotion, prefer tingle but this is a good product as it is stated</li>
            <li> I have a severe allergy to DHA - I was hospitalized after using some fancy overpriced lotion they sell at the salon and had no idea I was allergic to the main ingredient.  Not only did I put it on my skin but I baked it in!  This lotion was perfect - I got dark brown just as I would with an expensive tanning lotion with no hives!  The smell is absolutely wonderful, but if you don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; smells it&#x27;s probably not for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent no streak coverage that smells great and glides on smooth. I will purchase this again in the future:)</li>
            <li> I was looking for product that was DHA free and after reading the reviews I thought I found the product for me. I love the scent, but as for color where is it? I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday for a week and I&#x27;m still as pale as the day I started. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Smells wonderful and does the job! Will buy more when I run out! Thank you for the great product!</li>
            <li> Fake EdHardy lotion.....Called Ed hardy and they reassured me its fake and a non autorized seller!!!&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, dont even bother I tan so fast usually.I have been four times in a row to tan with this lotion and I look just as pale....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true tanner. Already was brown. This made my skin golden and helped with firming also. Love it!</li>
            <li> I give this lotion a solid 3 and I&#x27;ll tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;First off, def. buy it somewhere other than a tanning place. I paid $40 for it, and it is not worth that. If I had bought on here like I should have I might have given the product a 4.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does smell very good and the consistency of it is not too thick..so you will get a good amount of use out of it since you don&#x27;t have to apply as much.&lt;br /&gt;I have been tanning since high school, so I&#x27;ve gone through all kinds of lotions. This one does not have any &#x27;black bronzers&#x27; in it..so for me (and I tan very easily) the results were not as dark as they usually are in my first couple sessions. It did take a while for me to see darker results in my arms.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re only tanning a couple times for an occassion I would go with another lotion. But if you have time to get some results then this one isn&#x27;t a bad choice.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it. But next time I will likely choose something else.</li>
            <li> Was new to tanning when I bought this. Love the smell. Does not turn you that rusty color, got a nice gloden brown.</li>
            <li> I tan faithfully and really enjoyed this lotion.  It felt really good and didn&#x27;t have a smell after I tanned.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the results and the smell of this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product because of results you see right away.  It makes your skin soft and tanned, with no streaks,  It smells nice too. I use it sometimes even when I&#x27;m not tanning, to give a nice warm glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion. Great aroma, texture and good strong bronzers. Will rerorder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of self tanners and this one has yummy cocoa butter scent!!!..It moisturizes so nice with all the natural oils in it and gets a white freckly person brown!!  I Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was very moisturizing and gave me great color!&lt;br /&gt;It was also void of a lot of other chemicals you find in your standard tanning lotions, which is what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;This is very good considering how pale I am.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, however it does NOT work as a self- tanner...gives no color whatsoever after several applications.  I believe it was designed to accelerate a tan when using a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Great results less than a month of use and can tell a deeper tan.&lt;br /&gt;Like the smell of the product. And doesn&#x27;t linger the smell after.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I love this product.I used it at the tanning salon and it works.Just needs a better smell bc after the tanning salon it smells like burnt pop corn. yuck.but i guess some things stink but work good</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived quickly. Have only used the product twice so far, but I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have DHA and the smell if fresh without sickly sweet. Left my skin moisturized and the inexpensive price is a plus. Would definitely pitches again.</li>
            <li> does not provide any tan color but smells wonderful.  I could have eaten it! lol  I would buy it again just for the smell!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Reasonably priced, smells fab and leaves your skin dark, smooth and streak free! Really does get noticeably darker tanning on the sunbed. Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else now!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that great. Kinda stinky. Will stain hands and nails.</li>
            <li> Smells great, good price, definitely got darker using this.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this lotion. It smells great when applying and after tanning, it doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks, and you do notice color after a few uses. I also really like that there is skin firming ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Received it on the exact day I was promised.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. I&#x27;ve used it for years and get a dark tan quickly. It smells awesome. Giving 4 stars just because the product came with the front of the lid cracked. Otherwise lid still closes securely and bottle is full.</li>
            <li> This tanner feels very silky.  No streaking.  It also smells pretty good too! Reasonable price compared to other tanning products.</li>
            <li> Tried this at my tanning salon and loved it. Gives you a nice tan and it smells good as well</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and have been able to use this product with no trouble.  It has a light pleasant scent, not nearly as strong as most tanning products.  The best part is the bronzer, which adds a little color.  I have had no issues with streaking, and best of all, after a month of use, there is absolutely no orange color appearing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times now and absolutely love it! It smells wonderful and does not leave any streaks! Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a week and can tell a big difference.  This lotion smells so amazing, I want to eat it!</li>
