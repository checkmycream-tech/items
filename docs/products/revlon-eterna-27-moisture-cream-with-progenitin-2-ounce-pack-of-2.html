            <li>Please keep it on the  market for all loyal customers.  </li>
            <li>Much better than those high priced items.  </li>
            <li>The best cream on the market, I&#x27;ve used it for years, it&#x27;s my secret to younger looking skin, no matter which other cream I try, I keep coming back to  Revlon Eterna 27,  great for under the eyes and neck as well, perfect day and night.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I learned how good it was since my Mom used it for as long as I could remember seeing her use a moistureizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally purchased at Chain Store, not always available and when available priced too high</li>
            <li>My mother has used Eterna 27 for most of her adult</li>
            <li>worth) because I use a 6 0z jar every month.  </li>
            <li>This cream is the best kept secret Revlon owns.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it just soaks right in my pores leaving my complexion so soft &amp; ready to apply a light foundation without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I always come back to this stuff, as it is superior for my particular face.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right ...</li>
            <li>i bought this because my 87 year old aunt has been using it for 15 years and her skin is super smooth with not a lot of wrinkles</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>So that is my first tip:  </li>
            <li>All-Day Moisture Cream\\&quot; that is packaged exactly like the&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this at night and also put it on my face when I take a hot shower.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!  </li>
            <li>and it is becoming more and more difficult to find ...</li>
            <li>The one with Progenitin goes on and feels kind of heavy but is quickly absorbed into your skin.  </li>
            <li>; but found this to be the most nourishing for her (dry) skin.  </li>
            <li>This is an absolutely outstanding product for people with dry skin ...</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years to combat dry skin.</li>
            <li>THANKS,  ekfarris@aol.com&lt;</li>
            <li>what the ads say a product will do&amp;#34; and what they really do.  </li>
            <li>It has worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>and I have used it too more than i expected!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very rich cream, and while I try other products now</li>
            <li>Last year I found a shelf full at Walgreens and bought all of the 6 0z jars that they had (over $200.</li>
            <li>might have to save this until i get older.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products over the past 3 decades but keep coming back to this as the best.</li>
            <li>I wish Revlon had not discontinued the larger sizes, as those were more economical than these little jars.</li>
            <li>I have even tried more expensive face creams, but am still very loyal the Eterna 27 with Progentin.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer!!  Very thick and heavy, so if you don&#x27;t like that you will not be a fan.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this product that I have been using since I was 27.</li>
            <li>and they were shipped directly to her door!</li>
            <li>I have used this product since, well, I was 27 years old and am now 68!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and love it ,,hard to find ...would lijke the 6 ounce jar ...</li>
            <li>I thought she was about sixty years old.  </li>
            <li>After I use it my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and often have comments about how my skin is not that wrinkled.  </li>
            <li>I am 59yrs old &amp; have been using this since I can recall.</li>
            <li>I am 76 yrs old and have been using Revlons Eterna 27 twice a day since I was 28 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>I like Revlon products so this was a natural for me to try.</li>
            <li>I also use it on the backs of my hands (I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s), and on my chest.</li>
            <li>Other moisture creams just weren&#x27;t as good - too greasy, too long to be absorbed in my skin, not pleasant.</li>
            <li>My skin is still smooth and supple with very few wrinkles after all these years.</li>
            <li>it replaces moisture (water) to dry skin and wrinkles relax and my face is much smoother almost immediately ...</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and use it as a day and night cream.</li>
            <li>But if you have dry skin and cannot find anything that leaves your skin feeling supple and soft, then this is the product for you.</li>

            <li> I also use it on the backs of my hands (I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s), and on my chest.</li>
            <li> Other moisture creams just weren&#x27;t as good - too greasy, too long to be absorbed in my skin, not pleasant.</li>
            <li> My skin is still smooth and supple with very few wrinkles after all these years.</li>
            <li> it replaces moisture (water) to dry skin and wrinkles relax and my face is much smoother almost immediately ...</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and use it as a day and night cream.</li>
            <li> But if you have dry skin and cannot find anything that leaves your skin feeling supple and soft, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> But if you have dry skin and go bare skinned, give it a try.</li>
            <li> It is becoming increasingly difficult to find anymore.  </li>
            <li> A tiny dab goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> The product has been available for 50 years and Revlon doesn&#x27;t spend any money on advertizing and sometimes it is difficult to find locally</li>
            <li> Actually, I even use it in winter under my makeup, when the inside air is really dry from the heat running all the time.</li>
            <li> If you are of a certain age and are acquiring the dreaded &amp;#34;expression lines&amp;#34; (and you know what I mean, ladies), try this cream out for seven days and you WILL see a difference.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ve tried other (usually more expensive) face creams from other companies.</li>
            <li> My sisters don&#x27;t care for it and say it&#x27;s too thick, but I think they are just applying too much.  </li>
            <li> Eterna has been around for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> We both have VERY dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> A few &amp;#34;drug stores&amp;#34; carry it, but are few and far between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy cream, not light and softly-creamy as the old CHR cream.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other moisturizing products but they are made for replacing \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in the skin ...</li>
            <li> Then for some reason I started using other products.  </li>
            <li> Since this is so hard to find, i have now tried several other products.  </li>
            <li> you have very dry skin because it is heavy and a little greasy -</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding the Eterna 27 lately and was relieved to find it on Amazon as I had used my last jar.</li>
            <li> I do not wear face make up, or it may be considered a little too heavy to go under foundation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day and night.</li>
            <li> cream should not be confused with Revlon Eterna 27 All Day Moisture Cream; it is a different product!  </li>
            <li> If you put it on at night, it soaks in if you give it a few minutes so not to get cream on the pillow.  </li>
            <li> It used to go on sale once a year for half price!  </li>
            <li> It is not easy to find, however.</li>
            <li> but no more.  </li>
            <li> However, when I do find it, it no longer is on sale as it has been in the past years.  </li>
            <li> I have very few wrinkles and everyone</li>
            <li> I am in my 80&#x27;s and have very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Protects against the harsh cold and dry air.</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin</li>
            <li> This cream has not been made for years and is very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I have used Eterna 27 with progenitin for approximately 40 years.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every expensive product out there.  </li>
            <li> I think it is the secret to her youthful-looking skin!</li>

            <li> I met a woman with beautiful wrinkle-free skin.  I thought she was about sixty years old.  She told me she was turning eighty&lt;br /&gt;in a month!  She told me she used this Eterna 27 on her face and had been a make up sales person.  She said she&lt;br /&gt;had &amp;#34;tried them all&amp;#34; but found this to be the most nourishing for her (dry) skin.  I immediately found it on Amazon, and&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for almost a week.  It is wonderful.  It goes on smoothly and my skin feels so soft.  My husband thought&lt;br /&gt;it really looks great, even without a foundation.  For me, I think my moisturizer quest is over.</li>
            <li> I used CHR moisturizer for years but Revlon discontinued production.  When I inquired, they recommended Eterna 27 as a good substitute; it&#x27;s not.  This is a very heavy cream, not light and softly-creamy as the old CHR cream.  It&#x27;s not awful and it is cheap --- guess it&#x27;s the adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My mother has used Eterna 27 for most of her adult life(she&#x27;s 84).  She was dismayed that recently she could not find it in the stores.  I checked out Amazon and found packs of 2 and they were shipped directly to her door!</li>
            <li> This is the only product my wife uses and Amazon was the only place I could find it.  It use to be sold through our local pharmacy but no more.  She&#x27;s happy so am I.</li>
            <li> My mom swore by Eterna 27.  We both have VERY dry skin.  So that is my first tip:  Only use this is you have very dry skin because it is heavy and a little greasy - I actually use this day and night.  But if you have dry skin and cannot find anything that leaves your skin feeling supple and soft, then this is the product for you. After I use it my skin feels so soft and I think it minimizes the appearance of my fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since this is so hard to find, i have now tried several other products.  None compare to this.  If they ever discontinue this product, I don&#x27;t know what I will do.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely outstanding product for people with dry skin ... it replaces moisture (water) to dry skin and wrinkles relax and my face is much smoother almost immediately ... my face drinks this stuff and my skin looks 10 years younger than I am.  I have been using this product for 50 years ... that&#x27;s right ... 50 years and it is becoming more and more difficult to find ... I can no longer find the 6 0z jar any more.  Last year I found a shelf full at Walgreens and bought all of the 6 0z jars that they had (over $200. worth) because I use a 6 0z jar every month.  I have tried other moisturizing products but they are made for replacing \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in the skin ... my skin need WATER and it soaks up Eterna 27 with Progenitin almost immediately, and my skin feels and looks wonderful after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, FIND THE 6 0Z JARS FOR ME AND I SHALL SUBSCRIBED TO A YEAR&#x27;S SUPPLY AT A TIME ...THANKS,  ekfarris@aol.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me add something important ... there is a product \\&quot;Eterna 27 All-Day Moisture Cream\\&quot; that is packaged exactly like the&lt;br /&gt; Eterna 27 with Progenitin, and many more times than once I have accidentally purchased the All-Day Moisture Cream because it is mixed in with the Eterna 27 with Progenitin. It would be an easy mistake for the people stocking the shelves to mix them because the packages are almost identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eterna 27 All-Day Moisture Cream is a VERY DIFFERENT product because it is somewhat oily ... and my skin needs to be moisturized with water rather than oil ... I cannot use the All-Day Moisture Cream ... but some persons might be able to.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using this cream for years and I started to use it myself at night... you will notice the difference... would recomend to every woman out there over 27 ... Works wonders for your face.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years and love it because it is never greasy.  I am 71 years old and often have comments about how my skin is not that wrinkled.  I have had trouble finding the Eterna 27 lately and was relieved to find it on Amazon as I had used my last jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and I still love it.  I just wish I could find it in my local drug store.</li>
            <li> My mother used this most of her life and the smell always reminds me of her. I bought the first jar just for that fragrance but then started using it and now understand why she loved it. I live in a very dry climate and use it as a day and night cream. It&#x27;s not too heavy and keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day and night.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years and can no longer find it in my local stores therefore I order it over the internet. Best cream I have ever used, highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years to combat dry skin. I wish Revlon had not discontinued the larger sizes, as those were more economical than these little jars. Occasionally I&#x27;ve tried other (usually more expensive) face creams from other companies. I always come back to this stuff, as it is superior for my particular face.</li>
            <li> Eterna 27 is a product I have used for many years and for the quality and price is best night cream on the market.  It is odor free and absorbs quickly. The product has been available for 50 years and Revlon doesn&#x27;t spend any money on advertizing and sometimes it is difficult to find locally so I was very happy when it became available on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> The best cream on the market, I&#x27;ve used it for years, it&#x27;s my secret to younger looking skin, no matter which other cream I try, I keep coming back to  Revlon Eterna 27,  great for under the eyes and neck as well, perfect day and night.&lt;br /&gt;Love it Love  Love it..</li>
            <li> I am 59yrs old &amp; have been using this since I can recall. Let some media tell you that you need to spend $100 on a tiny tube of snake oil to maintain youth! HA! Revlon E 27 is a wonderful product. I love the fact that it just soaks right in my pores leaving my complexion so soft &amp; ready to apply a light foundation without a greasy feel. After I wash &amp; exfoliate I apply this to damp skin~this is tried &amp; true..@ 59 I pass as 10 yrs younger</li>
            <li> I have been using Revlon Eterna 27 since I was 24. I learned how good it was since my Mom used it for as long as I could remember seeing her use a moistureizer.</li>
            <li> I am 76 yrs old and have been using Revlons Eterna 27 twice a day since I was 28 yrs old.  My skin is still smooth and supple with very few wrinkles after all these years. Thank you Revlon Eterna 27.</li>
            <li> Eterna has been around for a very long time.  It&#x27;s a very rich cream, and while I try other products now and then, I always come back to Eterna.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife and she use it daily, likes the results and I agree with her totally .&lt;br /&gt;Normally purchased at Chain Store, not always available and when available priced too high&lt;br /&gt;Much better price at Amazon</li>
            <li> I have used this product since, well, I was 27 years old and am now 68!  I cannot go without it!  It is becoming increasingly difficult to find anymore.  However, when I do find it, it no longer is on sale as it has been in the past years.  It used to go on sale once a year for half price!  Every year!  Penney&#x27;s carried it as did Bullock&#x27;s, May Co, and Robinson&#x27;s.  (The latter 3 dept stores are, of course, no longer in business.)  A few &amp;#34;drug stores&amp;#34; carry it, but are few and far between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream should not be confused with Revlon Eterna 27 All Day Moisture Cream; it is a different product!  It is a good product, but I prefer the one with Progenitin.  The one with Progenitin goes on and feels kind of heavy but is quickly absorbed into your skin.  Love it!  It is the only product manufactured with this ingredient!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 20 or more years. I have very few wrinkles and everyone says what beautiful skin I have</li>
            <li> This cream has not been made for years and is very hard to find.  Make sure you get the kind with the Progenetin - it is a much heavier cream than the kind without it.</li>
            <li> My mother in law has used it for the last 30 years and she looks great!!! This is a gift for her and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I swear by this. I have used it for 30 years and my skin looks great. My step mother turned me on to this. She lived to be 93 and looked about 60 when she passed.&lt;br /&gt;DJW</li>
            <li> Great product as expected</li>
            <li> Very good product, even I am now 78 year old, my face look still very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Revlon company !&lt;br /&gt;PD</li>
            <li> I used this all through the 70s.  Then for some reason I started using other products.  I have fallen into the &amp;#34;believe what the ads say a product will do&amp;#34; and what they really do.  I have tried every expensive product out there.  When my daughter found that Revlon still made Eterna 27 I ordered it.  It is as good as any over $100 product out there.  I will continue to use it and wish I had never stopped.</li>
            <li> I have used this Revlon product for well over 30 years.  You can&#x27;t get any better in an arid climate yet it isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs well.  Much better than those high priced items.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have Been using this cream on my face daily for years.  I love it.  My sisters don&#x27;t care for it and say it&#x27;s too thick, but I think they are just applying too much.  A tiny dab goes a very long way.  I love the smell and texture.  I do not wear face make up, or it may be considered a little too heavy to go under foundation - I don&#x27;t know.  But if you have dry skin and go bare skinned, give it a try.</li>
            <li> i bought this because my 87 year old aunt has been using it for 15 years and her skin is super smooth with not a lot of wrinkles but it made me break out immediately. might have to save this until i get older.</li>
            <li> Have been using this item for over 5 years. I love how it makes my skin feels when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eterna 27 since college - 44 years ago - and I still love it.  My mother had used it for years before that, so I followed her example.  Other moisture creams just weren&#x27;t as good - too greasy, too long to be absorbed in my skin, not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I like Revlon products so this was a natural for me to try. It&#x27;s light and soaks in quickly but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as the old &amp;#34;Moon Drops&amp;#34; I used to use.</li>
            <li> Pretty good moisturizer. Don&#x27;t use if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It soaks in and prevents wrinkles.  I have used it for years.  I started many years ago when I met a woman in her 50s who looked like 30s and asked her what she used for her skin.  If you put it on at night, it soaks in if you give it a few minutes so not to get cream on the pillow.  I wear the night cream in the day as it soak in and you can wear your cover sticks over it.  Protects against the harsh cold and dry air.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and also put it on my face when I take a hot shower.  I am 63 and have been told that I look like I am in my 50&#x27;s.  Can&#x27;t say it is all from Eterna 27...but who&#x27;s to say it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> My mom was a fashion model for years and a teacher of skin care etc.  She used this for years so I started. I&#x27;ve tried other products over the past 3 decades but keep coming back to this as the best. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use Revlon&#x27;s Eterna 27 Moisture cream with Progenitin for many years and just love it.  The service was great and I intend to continue on ordering when needed.  Thank you for making everything so easy.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Lorraine Babak</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and love it ,,hard to find ...would lijke the 6 ounce jar ... i will keep my eyes open ...</li>
            <li> Have use it Eterna 27 since I was in my late 20Â´s and after 40 years is still a great product!</li>
            <li> Great skin care product. Walgreens said you took it off the market.  I went on line to find &amp; purchase more Product.  Please keep it on the  market for all loyal customers.  THANKS!  Lois B. Hood.</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin this is all I can use.I haved it for more thsn 20 years.</li>
            <li> I have used Eterna 27 for about 30 years and was distressed when it disappeared&lt;br /&gt;from my local retailers. For a couple of years I tried every moisturizer I could find, from&lt;br /&gt;name brands in department stores to lower cost ones in my grocery store.  Nothing has&lt;br /&gt;helped my skin like Eterna 27...now I know why my Mom was such a fan too! I&#x27;m so glad to&lt;br /&gt;have found it again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face cream for years and haven&#x27;t found anything I like better. I have even tried more expensive face creams, but am still very loyal the Eterna 27 with Progentin.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best kept secret Revlon owns. If you are of a certain age and are acquiring the dreaded &amp;#34;expression lines&amp;#34; (and you know what I mean, ladies), try this cream out for seven days and you WILL see a difference. Forget all those $100 creams that promise line reduction - this stuff is cheap, easy to use, smells good, and most importantly, it WORKS. Now, it&#x27;s not going to make you look like you&#x27;re 21 again, but you will see a vast improvement. The only downside I can see to using this cream is - if Revon EVER discontinues this, I&#x27;m going to age 20 years in about two weeks. I use it at night after washing and toning my face - it&#x27;s a great deep moisturizer. Actually, I even use it in winter under my makeup, when the inside air is really dry from the heat running all the time. I also use it on the backs of my hands (I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s), and on my chest. It makes such a difference, and is so inexpensive, I hope Revlon NEVER discontinues it.</li>
            <li> I have a friend in Greece who swears by Eterna 27 for her skin care.  She has used it for about 40 years and has very nice skin.  She lived in the States for many years but returned to Greece about 20 years ago.  I send her Eterna 27 because it is one of 3 things she views as necessary to her life that she can&#x27;t get there.  I buy a couple of jars now and then and ship them to her.  She is 81, lives at her beach house in the summer,  in Athens in the winter, and travels around Europe continually.  She looks and acts youthful.  She gives Eterna 27 5 stars for performance.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream for my Mom who has been using it for years! I think it is the secret to her youthful-looking skin! The order was handled wonderfully; I received it quickly and the creams were new and fresh! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!!  Very thick and heavy, so if you don&#x27;t like that you will not be a fan.  I love it as a night cream:)</li>
            <li> use this every day. a wonderful moisture cream</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this product gives my skin the softness it needs.  I couldn&#x27;t live without this product that I have been using since I was 27.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and it is excellent for a sensitive skin.  It is not easy to find, however. I am pleased that it is available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it and I have used it too more than i expected! thanks so much for your fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> I have used Eterna 27 with progenitin for approximately 40 years.  It has worked very well for me.  I use it as both a night cream and a foundation for daytime use.  I am in my 80&#x27;s and have very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream almost 30 years I hope Revlon never discontinues this item!!! I will buy this again.</li>
