            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>have only good things to say about this product</li>
            <li>((water) eau), paraffinum liquidum ((mineral oil) huile minerale), cera alba ((beeswax) cire d&#x27;abelle), propylene glycol, petrolatum isopropyl myristate, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)</li>

            <li>Tried much more expensive creams and this one is still the best.</li>
            <li>All other reviews were very positive and the price was is great.  </li>
            <li>Skin was very shiny after application but cream absorbed quickly and easily without clumping.</li>
            <li>- the product arrived right on</li>
            <li>Fortunately companies like Vanicream and CeraVe and ThinkBaby have started to break the &amp;#34;cosmetic cartel&amp;#34; and offer the same or better ingredients at a much reduced price without the fancy celebrity endorsements.</li>
            <li>Fabulous cream, non pore clogging, turns my dry skin into soft dewy complexion like it was many years ago!</li>
            <li>So I tried it and like it very much.</li>

            <li>I think it is the best beauty secret ever!  </li>

            <li>I just love this product and have been using it since I was 24 - long before I needed it.</li>
            <li>I have some dry patches no moisturizer seemed to be able to control over the course of a day.  </li>
            <li>Very good results for the past 50 years ! ! !</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but I just didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my apperance.</li>
            <li>It lasted forever, and there was so much, I used it all</li>
            <li>would HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone at any age!</li>
            <li>Or if you are on a &amp;#34;one natural ingredient&amp;#34; kick you can put grape seed oil on your face fresh out the shower.</li>
            <li>It is really eyeopening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ordering it on-line was a real time saver</li>
            <li>scent and just seemed very &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; to me.</li>
            <li>but I does work very well for me as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>So much for this.</li>
            <li>its an old cream but a really good one been using it at least 40 years</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly advise anyone who is using this product to look at CeraVe Moisture Cream which is about $15 for 16 Oz.</li>
            <li>It is great in all types of climates - I used it when I lived overseas in the tropics, and it works  wonders, both in the hot and cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok with me not bad and not great.</li>
            <li>Now in my low sixties my skin is dry, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth and soft and of course with just a few wrinkles .</li>
            <li>It seems it blends in nicely with a little moderate rubbing</li>
            <li>I first used this product in 1991, when you could only purchase an industrial size jar (it was appx.</li>
            <li>As is the norm in the &amp;#34;Beauty&amp;#34; industry, this is just another product full of empty claims and insignificant terms.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Revlon box had clearly been opened.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 74 years old</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a 75 year old woman who uses it every day.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old, I used this cream for years when I was in my 30&#x27;s and always got compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>Probably too greasy for young skin, but at my age (47)</li>
            <li>My skin is dewy, soft and brightened by this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>When I woke up in the morning, my skin wasn&#x27;t particularly soft or hydrated.</li>
            <li>So far, it is not moisturizing as well as I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>After application, skin felt soft, supple and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I am 78 yrs old...</li>
            <li>People are mildly surprised when I tell them my age.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin look younger in about 10 days - and at a steal of a price.</li>
            <li>It is just the right creaminess for dry facial skin.  </li>
            <li>No other cream will do...</li>
            <li>Start early and lasting results.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on smoothly and is fairly thick.</li>
            <li>Lightly scented white cream which applied thick but rubbed into skin well.</li>
            <li>No stinging, which my sensitive skin typically experiences when introducing new products.</li>
            <li>how little I used or how much I tried to rub/pat it into my skin, there was a greasy layer on my skin.</li>

            <li> People are mildly surprised when I tell them my age.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used  Revlon Eterna 27 for about 30 years.  I&#x27;m 74 years old and I get compliments on how nice my skin looks all the time.</li>
            <li> As is the norm in the &amp;#34;Beauty&amp;#34; industry, this is just another product full of empty claims and insignificant terms.</li>
            <li> Favorite stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this product and have bought from this seller before 2nd time buying again and I am happy quick and simple got it quickly and in nice packing looks always brand new and best price on here.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years without fear of an allergic reaction to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a 75 year old woman who uses it every day.  I have used it for 5 years and have controlled any winkles that at 72 should be showing up.  I would highly recommend it.  Start early and lasting results.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 45 years ago and it shows.    My mom who is 96 and I will soon be 65 have only good things to say about this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revlon Eterna 17 with Progenitin for years.  As I&#x27;ve aged I find I need the extra moisture that Eterna w/progenitin provides.  I wear it every day under my make up, and I use it every night after I clean my face.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product!!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I use it in the AM after Retin-A.  Super moisturizer that leaves my skin plump and supple.</li>
            <li> I have used the Revlon Eterna 27 product for years.  It is reasonably priced and a great night cream. Tried much more expensive creams and this one is still the best.</li>
            <li> I read the rave reviews about using it for years through many generations and the benefits of using it. I am in my early 50&#x27;s so I wanted to get rid of forehead wrinkles and facial lines. I think I got better results in Ponds. This rich cream may need to sit on the face at night but I don&#x27;t do night creams-messy. It seems it blends in nicely with a little moderate rubbing but I just didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my apperance. It&#x27;s just ok with me not bad and not great.</li>
            <li> This face cream is so great. I am 68 years old, I used this cream for years when I was in my 30&#x27;s and always got compliments on my skin. Then several years ago I was having a problem finding it and started using very expensive creams but I got what I call &amp;#34;Howdy Doody&amp;#34; mouth. I found Eterna 27 again on Amazon and just using this cream 1 week started making a difference and after 1 month the creases at the corners of my mouth are almost gone,,,unbelievable ! I thought you had to spend a lot of money to get this kind of results but you just have to use Eterna 27!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years and love it. It moisturizes without leaving a greasy feeling. Recommend it for face and hands.</li>
            <li> I first used this product in 1991, when you could only purchase an industrial size jar (it was appx. $25.00 in 1991). It lasted forever, and there was so much, I used it all over!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used so many products, in all price ranges, over the years and none can compare to Eterna 27. I have extremely dry skin due to thyroid disease, which would normally cause patches of flaking. When I found Eterna 27 (AGAIN, FINALLY) a few months back, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It cleared my dry patches and rejuvenated my skin. At 45, I look 10 years younger because of my skin. I am not giving all the credit to Eterna 27 (I&#x27;ve always taken care of my skin and stay out of the sun), but since using it again, my skin has the resilience and tone it had way back when.&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone at any age!</li>
            <li> Wonderful face cream. I have used it for years and have great skin.  It is very rich and has a nice smell too!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. I need to give it time to soak in, but it works well. Probably too greasy for young skin, but at my age (47) it feels great.</li>
            <li> This face cream is great!  My mom has been using it for 30 years, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10.  It&#x27;s not only for dry skin at all.  I&#x27;ve got somewhat oily skin and this does a great job keeping wrinkles at bay. I&#x27;m 37 and haven&#x27;t been the best with sunscreen over the years.  This cream helps tremendously!  Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My skin is dewy, soft and brightened by this moisturizer.  I wake up looking younger, with a glow, as if I&#x27;ve gotten a great night&#x27;s sleep, even when I haven&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Am enjoying this product!</li>
            <li> Oily residue don&#x27;t care for but good results in helping with dryness.</li>
            <li> If you read the ingredients list you will see that this cream has pretty good ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua ((water) eau), paraffinum liquidum ((mineral oil) huile minerale), cera alba ((beeswax) cire d&#x27;abelle), propylene glycol, petrolatum isopropyl myristate, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, cetyl esters, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil, sorbitan oleate, lanolin cera ((lanolin wax) cire de lanoline), sunflower seed oil, glyceride, pregenolone acetate, lanolin alcohol, sorbitan trioleate, tocopherol, niacinamide, cholesterol, cetyl alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oils are all very good and plant derived/plant based. Lanolin, unless you have a lanolin reaction/allergy is wonderful for most people. Cholesterol is great for your skin. Tocopherol (vitamin E) is a cosmetic rock star with substance (Beetles rather then Reality T.V. to use the rock music analogy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, wonderful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is dreadful. About $15 dollars for 2 ounces is the cosmetic equivalent  of cattle rustling. I would highly advise anyone who is using this product to look at CeraVe Moisture Cream which is about $15 for 16 Oz. and features the following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Purified), Glycerin, Ceteareth 20, Capric/Caprylic Stearic Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methylsulfate/Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6 11, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone with any paraben allergies you can try Aquaphor. Or if you are on a &amp;#34;one natural ingredient&amp;#34; kick you can put grape seed oil on your face fresh out the shower. Google the cosmetic cop and check out the ingredients dictionary. It is really eyeopening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother swears by Revlon Eterna 27 (for decades) and I&#x27;m educating her on being ingredients driven because the price per ounce of this product is obscene. Fortunately companies like Vanicream and CeraVe and ThinkBaby have started to break the &amp;#34;cosmetic cartel&amp;#34; and offer the same or better ingredients at a much reduced price without the fancy celebrity endorsements.</li>
            <li> my mom started me on tis wonder cream ad ayoung woman which was many many uears ago.  i have tried other brands but always come back to this one. skin os supple and glowhing.  wish it wss o subscribe and save</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel!  My grandmother swore by this cream, and she never, every looked her age.  I want to continue the tradition !!!</li>
            <li> Arrived perfectly ontime, good package. fully satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eterna &amp;#34;27&amp;#34; for a long time, and my skin loves it!  Ordering it on-line was a real time saver - the product arrived right on&lt;br /&gt;time.</li>
            <li> Great product--definitely moisturizes well and turns back the hands of time. A little goes a long way....this is a staple in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Every time I buy this cream someone else always uses it.  I have to hide it the next time.  Excellent cream.</li>
            <li> My wife has used it for over 40 years. Loves it and she looks 20 years younger....No other cream will do...</li>
            <li> Not enough moisture! My skin felt sooooo DRY!!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing cream ever. Great for after peel ( use NCN Peel...The best!). Cant use during the day unless I put on olay regenerist over the top to combat the greasiness. Love,Love,Love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s. I was introduced to Eterna 27 when my mother-in-law passed away 3 years ago (loved and miss her).  She had a tube of this so I took it home and tried it.  When I ran out I went on a mission to find more.  Although it is \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; and it has a scent that while not unpleasant is not the nicest, it really makes my face feel good.  I have a bit of a rosacia problem, and while I wouldn&#x27;t say if helps, I doesnt irritate or make it worse at all.  When I looked for this at Amazon i accidentally ordered the day cream--not the one with progenitin.  I am also using it and do not consider it a \\&quot;bad mistake\\&quot;, however for day moisturizer I have other favorites.  Make note there is a difference between the two.</li>
            <li> It is hydrating and my skin definitely feels smoother. It is greasy though and I use it only at night.</li>
            <li> its an old cream but a really good one been using it at least 40 years</li>
            <li> Fabulous cream, non pore clogging, turns my dry skin into soft dewy complexion like it was many years ago!</li>
            <li> I love this face cream.  I Have used it for decades.  It is just the right creaminess for dry facial skin.  It has a pleasant smell, but not too fragrant.  It lasts a long time and the price is very reasonable.  It only takes a tiny little bit once a day - under make up or at night.  Try it.  Your face will love  you for it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  Saw it in your website looking for a different moisturizer.  I read reviews and saw that only one person was indifferent to it.  All other reviews were very positive and the price was is great.  So I tried it and like it very much. Now in my low sixties my skin is dry, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff was expensive and didn&#x27;t absorb with a darn. No mater how little I used or how much I tried to rub/pat it into my skin, there was a greasy layer on my skin. When I woke up in the morning, my skin wasn&#x27;t particularly soft or hydrated. It has an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; scent and just seemed very &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; to me., Like something my grandmother would use. There are better products out there for my money.</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  I use it before bed. Too heavy for day time. Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have some dry patches no moisturizer seemed to be able to control over the course of a day.  I know this is a night cream, however, I&#x27;ve been using it in the day mixed in with my sunblock and it lasts all day.  I haven&#x27;t seen those dry patches in the last month or so since I started using it.  I don&#x27;t know about wrinkle control just yet but I does work very well for me as a moisturizer.  It does have a scent to it, I don&#x27;t consider it offensive but I grew up in a time when most beauty products had some scent to them some more than others so I don&#x27;t mind it.  It doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories of my mom.  She loved this face cream and we would often go to the store together&lt;br /&gt;to buy it.  All my sisters use it and love the results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I was 32. I will 68 in September. No one believes my age. I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years, following my mother&#x27;s example.  I think it is the best beauty secret ever!  For VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly and is fairly thick. It coats my face and I use it only at night. In the morning my face is smooth and moisturized and I do notice a minimizing of fines line after prolonged use. I will continue to use this cream. I love it.</li>
            <li> This cream has been around a long time and is not normally found in drugstores. It is one of the few night creams that contain lanolin and is very soothing and moisturizing to the skin. I use it several times a week, not all the time,  for dry skin and as it did for my grandmother who had beautiful skin, I still think it&#x27;s a good skin cream.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer and I decided to try this cream. I have a dry skin, especially during the winter time. So far, it is not moisturizing as well as I wanted it to do. Hope it will, at lease, do its job during the summer time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived before expected delivery date. Revlon box had clearly been opened. There was no safety seal on product. Inner white plastic lid underneath jar cap was crushed and product was oozing outside of jar. Lightly scented white cream which applied thick but rubbed into skin well. Skin was very shiny after application but cream absorbed quickly and easily without clumping. Prior to application, skin around chin &amp; mouth was very dry and tight. After application, skin felt soft, supple and refreshed. No stinging, which my sensitive skin typically experiences when introducing new products. The final test will be to see if it causes blemishes. There is an odor which I can&#x27;t quite place. It&#x27;s neither medicinal nor pleasant but it&#x27;s definitely lingering; almost a smell I&#x27;d equate with that of a nursing home. Well; I woke up with 3 large, angry red pimples and several smaller blemishes. This product is definitely aggravating to acne-prone skin. So much for this. In the garbage it goes.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have used it for 35 yrs..I hope they never stop making it...It has kept my skin soft and practically wrinkle free...I am 78 yrs old...</li>
            <li> I used this for 50 years. Enough said! Very good cream. The best cream on the market. What else can I say.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream when I was 18. I am now retired and the cream has worked wonderfully. My skin is very smooth and soft and of course with just a few wrinkles . People are mildly surprised when I tell them my age. I have used other&lt;br /&gt;brands that are more expensive and newer in the market but Eterna  27 makes me my skin feel twenty seven every time. I&lt;br /&gt;will not stop using it.</li>
            <li> Very good results for the past 50 years ! ! !</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST. Every person I&#x27;ve gotten to try it LOVES it. It really makes your skin look younger in about 10 days - and at a steal of a price. I hope they never stop making it. This cream outdoes all the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; creams, serums, lotions, what have you that cost $100 and more. Don&#x27;t waste your money on those - get this Eterna 27 (it has to be the one with Progenitin, not the All Day Moisture Cream), and look MUCH younger in about 10 - 14 days. No, I don&#x27;t work for Revlon. I just love this product and have been using it since I was 24 - long before I needed it. As a result, people tell me I look like I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s - and I&#x27;m 62! Who wouldn&#x27;t love that?</li>
            <li> I have been using Eterna-27 for YEARS - this cream is really fantastic! It is great in all types of climates - I used it when I lived overseas in the tropics, and it works  wonders, both in the hot and cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me - Eterna-27 is fabulous!</li>
