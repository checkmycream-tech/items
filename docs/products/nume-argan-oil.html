            <li> I like it, it is amazing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it, it didn&#x27;t treat my acne as I expected but gives such a good feeling on skin, I use it everyday and am more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this for 5 bucks on the website. There are all kinds of codes to use for awesome deals. I got a curling wand for 28 dollars, and a big bottle of leave in conditioner for 9. Now that&#x27;s a deal!!</li>
            <li> This is the only Argon Oil I will use on my hair. Keeps it healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this product, because it makes your hair shiny and silky smooth, it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itchy and that&#x27;s very important to me.</li>
            <li> I live this product! Goes on light and feels great on my hair! I haven&#x27;t used it for my skin because the bottle says it&#x27;s for the hair but I even use it on my daughters hair and it leaves it looking healthy!</li>
            <li> I had got this for shine but gives no shine. But it does make my hair feel very soft and no matter how much you put in your hair it never gets greasy. And I like putting it on my skin because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!!! Noticed a difference right away...hair is silky soft and this has a great scent!!! Will buy for life..lol.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff, smells amazing</li>
            <li> I like this oil a a lot. It makes my hair so nice when I&#x27;m curling it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and makes my hair look healthy! üëç Would recommend it and well worth the cost. Love it!</li>
            <li> This was on my granddaughter&#x27;s Xmas list. No complaints.  She is using this product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was excellent and I&#x27;m pleased with this product. Withing minutes my hands don&#x27;t have a greasy feeling after using it and my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> I actually first got this on Nume&#x27;s site when it was part of a kit. I&#x27;ve had the bottle for about two years and I use it almost every time I take a shower. I put my wet hair in a towel for a little bit then while it is still damp, I put a quarter size through my hair. I LOVE this stuff! Makes my hair so soft and shiny without being oily. It feels healthy and strong. The smells is pleasant as well. Very nice stuff and lasts for a good while. The price here is much better than anywhere else!</li>
            <li> Very nice product but a bit expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used at least three different argan oil brands, and this is the BEST in regard to penetration, scent, and shine. Use it on my skin to moisturize and hair for shine. Had to share it with my husband until he finally bought his own. Arganics is THE best!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product! I first tried it in 2012 when I got a sample of it in my GlossyBox! Since then, I use it every time I style my hair or whenever my hair just needs a boost of shine! I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle but I also use it as a moisturizer! I will be buying this again! Also, buying this product from the official site may be a bit of a hassle as they seem to sell out quite often.</li>
            <li> Excellent I absolutly love this oil. It was delivered before the delivery date. I will purchase again.</li>
