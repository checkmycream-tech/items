            <li>when I recieved it there were alot of chemicals on the ingredients list that weren&#x27;t on Amazon and it doesnt have a good score on the EWG.I wonder</li>
            <li>lol.:)</li>
            <li>I liked this stuff but can&#x27;t say I loved it.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is great easy going face cream.  </li>
            <li>Kind of chemical or rancid.</li>
            <li>By far the best best facial moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>if not&lt;br /&gt;better than moisturizers that cost ALOT more.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve never found anything better.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, but moisturizes beautifully.</li>
            <li>I really like it because it is a heavy-duty moisturizer, not greasy and the smell is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I received my order quickly!</li>
            <li>I know it is fragrance free</li>
            <li>No obnoxious perfume, lasting moisturizing and no animal testing make this a great product.  </li>
            <li>I told them to enjoy the money</li>
            <li>Thank you for being cruelty free</li>
            <li>and my skin looked smooth.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive my cream however..</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to love this</li>
            <li>Every product I&#x27;ve tried has performed better than I&#x27;d come to expect from a natural skincare product.</li>
            <li>Non greasy , leaves skin soft, fresh looking and ultra smooth !</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t bring myself to put it only face and will be making my own moisturizer from now on, using the first 4-5 ingredients on the label.</li>
            <li>It is a great value and at $12, it beats any $50 creme I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I love this cream; and I am a former Chanel Lift user.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is one of my favorite BWC products and I have purchased several in a row (something I never did before).</li>
            <li>I broke out with many pimples the very next day after applying it at night.</li>
            <li>It is also cruelty free which is getting harder to find and is important to me.</li>
            <li>Wow I contacted the seller and told them I was pregnant</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>I like this, but it would probably be too much for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li>It is at least as good</li>
            <li>For the price, this was a much better solution for us than the premium products from companies like Dermalogica which were the other option.</li>
            <li>Healthy ingredients in BWC and less costly</li>
            <li>I spent years looking for a product line I liked enough to stick with</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the organic..natural world</li>
            <li>I admit to having sensitive skin but have never seen overnight reaction with ANY product.</li>
            <li>but I apparently had a reaction to it.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to odors and was surprised to hear that one user thought it had a heavy odor.  </li>

            <li> and this is very much like Ponds (at least to me)</li>
            <li> my dry patches did go away that 1 day</li>
            <li> w/out a single blemish since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and am over 50</li>
            <li> it can turn dry, rough heels into baby bottom softness!</li>
            <li> Only thing I was not comfortable is the smell of the cream.  </li>
            <li> It has a slightly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell, it may not have a very long shelf life, we will see as we go.</li>
            <li> I have tried other moisturizers and they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> UNLIKE my other cream I used (Chanel).  </li>
            <li> This is wonderful....have used on my psoriasis on my elbow and makes it softer, less dry and less itchy.......</li>
            <li> This is not the thickest, but it is thick enough and works well for her.</li>
            <li> but it could be blended with little bit lavender or orange oil to neutralize the smell of it.</li>
            <li> and it never clogs my pores or feels heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy duty but takes a little rubbing in for it to absorb.</li>
            <li> packs a lot of moisture in a small amount.</li>
            <li> I reordered this when I ran out, but for some reason this latest jar smells awful.</li>
            <li> This product works well for my elderly mother, who has very thin and delicate dry skin.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to use Pond&#x27;s and this is very much like Ponds (at least to me) and I like the fact that there is no animal testing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 years. Beauty Without Cruelty has been making products that don&#x27;t test on animals before it was PC to do it and they make great products! I have tried other moisturizers and they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great going on, smells great.  It is at least as good if not&lt;br /&gt;better than moisturizers that cost ALOT more.  I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is great easy going face cream.  Only thing I was not comfortable is the smell of the cream.  I know it is fragrance free but it could be blended with little bit lavender or orange oil to neutralize the smell of it.</li>
            <li> No obnoxious perfume, lasting moisturizing and no animal testing make this a great product.  I have used it for several years.</li>
            <li> This product works well for my elderly mother, who has very thin and delicate dry skin. It was recommended that she use the thickest face cream we could find, with a lot of emollients. This is not the thickest, but it is thick enough and works well for her. It has a slightly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell, it may not have a very long shelf life, we will see as we go. For the price, this was a much better solution for us than the premium products from companies like Dermalogica which were the other option.</li>
            <li> Great vegan moisturizer</li>
            <li> this is too oily for my skin, caused break outs and feels too think</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive my cream however..when I recieved it there were alot of chemicals on the ingredients list that weren&#x27;t on Amazon and it doesnt have a good score on the EWG.I wonder why hmmmm Phenoxyethanol...I&#x27;m new to the organic..natural world but Ive done my research and the jury is still out on this one.Wow I contacted the seller and told them I was pregnant so I&#x27;m trying to stay away from chemicals and I would like to return the item they responsed and told me I would have to pay for shipping. I never return items but its not my fault all of the chemicals were conveniently left off of the ingredients list! I just wanted my cream I told them to enjoy the money and that&#x27;s no way to conduct business..oh well on to the next product ...there&#x27;s plenty of creams in the sea lol.:)</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  It is very similar to ponds and not tested on animals.  A++++ seller</li>
            <li> I love this cream; and I am a former Chanel Lift user.  This makes my skin supple and glowing.  Healthy ingredients in BWC and less costly UNLIKE my other cream I used (Chanel).  A+</li>
            <li> I spent years looking for a product line I liked enough to stick with and I&#x27;ve found just that with Beauty Without Cruelty. Every product I&#x27;ve tried has performed better than I&#x27;d come to expect from a natural skincare product. This moisturizer is one of my favorite BWC products and I have purchased several in a row (something I never did before). My combination/dry skin is flawless w/out a single blemish since I began using this product. It is not heavy, but moisturizes beautifully. It smells great too! I cannot say enough about this product line! It is a great value and at $12, it beats any $50 creme I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Thank you for being cruelty free</li>
            <li> packs a lot of moisture in a small amount. i use bwc body lotion, too. have been since 2007. found it in safeway on kauai and i&#x27;ve never found anything better. it can turn dry, rough heels into baby bottom softness!</li>
            <li> By far the best best facial moisturizer I have ever used. Non greasy , leaves skin soft, fresh looking and ultra smooth ! I love it! It is also cruelty free which is getting harder to find and is important to me.</li>
            <li> After trying several moisturizers, I finally found one that my skin loves!  I always feel like my skin in breathe and it never clogs my pores or feels heavy or greasy.  Would buy this product again. I received my order quickly!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to love this but I apparently had a reaction to it. I broke out with many pimples the very next day after applying it at night. I admit to having sensitive skin but have never seen overnight reaction with ANY product. Bummer... my dry patches did go away that 1 day and my skin looked smooth. But, I can tell the moment I sweat (heat or workout) if a prodict will irritate me because it will burn or itch, and this did allot!</li>
            <li> I reordered this when I ran out, but for some reason this latest jar smells awful. Kind of chemical or rancid. I can&#x27;t bring myself to put it only face and will be making my own moisturizer from now on, using the first 4-5 ingredients on the label. Reading the label, you can see it contains synthetic chemicals (which aren&#x27;t mentioned in the description listing).</li>
            <li> I liked this stuff but can&#x27;t say I loved it. It moisterizes but it seems to clog my pores. It&#x27;s very heavy duty but takes a little rubbing in for it to absorb. Not my favorite. I recommend the BWC alpha hydroxy lotion over this one.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and am over 50 and I have been using this cream for about 10 years.  I really like it because it is a heavy-duty moisturizer, not greasy and the smell is pleasant.  I am very sensitive to odors and was surprised to hear that one user thought it had a heavy odor.  I like this, but it would probably be too much for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful....have used on my psoriasis on my elbow and makes it softer, less dry and less itchy.......I also use it on my face and I highly recommend it.</li>
