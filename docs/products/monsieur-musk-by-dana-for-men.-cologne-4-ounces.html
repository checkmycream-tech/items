            <li>I love it, this happened to be one of my favorite COLOGNE ever, I&#x27;ll always buy it....</li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>I have been buying and using this cologne for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have received more compliments on the way I smell when wearing it.  </li>
            <li>Now, most of the Monsieur Musk I find is made in China under license from Dana.  </li>
            <li>The memories it brings back is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Love using it.  </li>
            <li>I guess this is the end of my love affair with</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is a very clean smell.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Cologne much more, the After Shave feels oily, both though smell uniquely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>good price, fast delivery....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had both the Houbigant Musk, and light Musk.</li>
            <li>and I still use it daily as an underarm deodorant (it is great for this, and contains no aluminum).  </li>
            <li>aroma vanishes after 3-4 hours, it ok freshly out of the shower,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as long-lasting as the original either.    </li>
            <li>I used the original scent for 30 years.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>i miss the original</li>
            <li>Unique scent.</li>
            <li>Dana, if you care, please return to the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel</li>
            <li>Will need more real soon.</li>
            <li>that woman find attractive an makes other man want to use.</li>
            <li>clean and fresh leaving no mistake that it is a mans cologne</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and get good results with it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>My husband has worn this for years he always smells good, nice subtle scent that never offends it is just right.</li>
            <li>And, Worth Checking Out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving Monsieur Musk by Dana three stars, because the aroma is nice, but the cologne is just not the same.</li>
            <li>It appears Dana has changed the formula for success.  </li>
            <li>but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I used this cologne faithfully for many years, but upon moving to Florida I could not find it for many years and ordered it as quickly as I could type and made the error of ordering the splash on instead of the spray, although they both leave you with a clean manly sent that I am complimented on by many, the spray is much easier to use putting on just the right amount and avoids over usage because not much is need to last all day without be over powering and having your 4 oz.</li>
            <li>This is a major improvement in the packaging and represents much more than a cosmetic overhaul.    </li>
            <li>knowingly, new there is no after shave available.</li>
            <li>This is the cologne my husband wore when we first met.  </li>
            <li>As many reviewers commented, this is not the same Monsieur Musk.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Monsieur Musk for many years and this product is not the same.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent especially after a time, how it blended with my body scent.  </li>
            <li>As a Disabled Vet, I spend wisely.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It used to be known as \\&quot;Monsieur Houbigant,\\&quot; and it got discontinued, much to my dicontent.  </li>
            <li>Throughout this period, the scent was reasonably close and not yet too diluted.  </li>
            <li>They sell for as much as $80/bottle, but all the ones I have found are still from the PA Dana.  </li>
            <li>The paint/ink is very soluble in alcohol, and the majority of the liquid in the bottle is SD alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It is one scent that takes it&#x27;s own character according to the skin it is applied on: it smells uniquely different with each individual.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when my most recent order arrived.  </li>
            <li>I will use it just because I can&#x27;t get the real thing anymore, but in the interim I will search for a new higher quality scent than this.</li>
            <li>Still, Monsieur Musk is a unique fragrance, and I continue to receive occasional compliments for wearing it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is different from the original.</li>
            <li>I have been a Musk customer for over 20 years before Dana started creating this scent which is very different than original</li>
            <li>When my husband put the cologne on, the scent was much more subtle than the original</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was very pleased when I opened the bottle, and got my first whiff, but having used it a few times since then I have to say that it does fall short.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic.  </li>
            <li>It is not enough to change my 5-star rating, but I do feel I am using a bit more than I was with even the last batch I purchased.  </li>
            <li>My husband is a special ed preschool teacher and he uses this scent as a positive association for the children, so he didn&#x27;t want to switch to some other cologne that would confuse them.  </li>
            <li>and I had to get right next to him to smell it.  </li>
            <li>The scent is close, but not quite right, and it doesn&#x27;t have near the staying power that the original had, which when used for an evening out could last all night long, and well into morning.</li>
            <li>my husband has used this coogne scince 1980s and when it became unavalible in stores where we live</li>
            <li>I started wearing this fragrance in 1974 when it was manufactured in New York, Paris and Montreal (Laval) by Houbigant as Monsieur Houbigant Musk.  </li>
            <li>The new stuff smells quite a bit different than the cologne made by Dana in PA, and a lot different than the original.  </li>
            <li>And at such a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li>Apparently, Dana bought out much of the company and started selling the product as Monsieur Musk.  </li>
            <li>The first day I met the man I would later marry, he was wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li>The first several orders I received were from either New York or Laval, presumably from the old Houbigant houses.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is now clear glass except for an apx. 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very well it&#x27;s the only cologne</li>
            <li>wow they should test products they let people sell here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many bottles through Amazon and this is the first one that failed.</li>
            <li>My wife is very sensitive to scents and this product is the only cologne that my wife likes.</li>
            <li>that stayed apparent on the wearer.</li>
            <li>By this time I had become skin sensitive and quickly developed contact dermatitis to other scents.  </li>
            <li>Touching the bottle with fragrance wet hands causes the paint/ink to dissolve leading to a hard to clean black mess.  </li>
            <li>I began shopping for a new one having no idea that the company had closed up.</li>
            <li>Also, I have been using the new bottle long enough to notice if the contact dermatitis I develop within a couple days following use of other fragrances developed, and it has not.</li>

            <li> Beside the considerable dilution of the scent since it has been bottled in China, a major aggravation of the product was the black paint/ink that covered the bottle.  </li>
            <li> If you are a long time user, you might want to look for 8oz bottles on the internet.  </li>
            <li> The other thing you might look out for is the Chinese spray 4oz bottles that have the removable atomizer.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product since the 1970s and the quality/strength of this particular item is weak and does not last.  </li>
            <li> My friend as used  this for several years and likes the cologne as an aftershave which is  not  too heavy</li>
            <li> Also, the ink/paint that is the label does not dissolve when wet with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> When I did an internet search I ended up here, and was pleased, then disappointed when I realized that this is a \\&quot;clone\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I know it is an old product and very hard to find</li>
            <li> Dana bought the rights and formula for this cologne and watered it down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is HOUBIGANT - less.</li>
            <li> It is also less fragrant.  </li>
            <li> No longer is the bottle painted/inked black.  </li>
            <li> black label that bears the information for the product.  </li>
            <li> My dad has been using this cologne since I was little.  </li>
            <li> Sometime in the late 80s, Houbigant closed its doors.  </li>
            <li> I still have a couple of those bottles, but I have amassed a number of 4oz bottles over the past 12 years.  </li>
            <li> Blast from the past.</li>
            <li> Then, sometime in the late 90s, Dana moved to somewhere in PA.  </li>
            <li> At some point in the late 90s</li>
            <li> No More!  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, any of the product that drips down the bottle will leave a very hard to remove black stain at the bottle&#x27;s base.  </li>
            <li> Took it on a trip and it leaked again so there must be something wrong with the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Dana had changed the product and the result is a vegetable mustiness that is unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed and probably will not reorder.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that I can no longer have this product as it was.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I love it, this happened to be one of my favorite COLOGNE ever, I&#x27;ll always buy it....good price, fast delivery....thanks</li>
            <li> One of the bottles leaked b4 getting here.  Took it on a trip and it leaked again so there must be something wrong with the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using Monsieur MUSK for years.  It used to be known as \\&quot;Monsieur Houbigant,\\&quot; and it got discontinued, much to my dicontent.  It is one scent that takes it&#x27;s own character according to the skin it is applied on: it smells uniquely different with each individual.  Women have consistetly and unabashedly tell me it smells \\&quot;great\\&quot; and ask me for the its name for their men.  I prefer the Cologne much more, the After Shave feels oily, both though smell uniquely fantastic.  I can only find it nowadays on the internet, and I hope I keep finding it: people know me with this Musk coogne.</li>
            <li> My dad loves it he&#x27;s been wearing it for decades</li>
            <li> Not my favorite but they were to give as a present to someone who loves it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 30 years. I still get complements about how good it smells.</li>
            <li> I Have Been Using This Cologne For Over 35 Years. It&#x27;s A Great Product, And, Worth Checking Out.</li>
            <li> This is the cologne my husband wore when we first met.  I have been unable to find it anywhere.  Was very pleased to locate it!  And at such a reasonable price!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Fragrance of this product is short lived.&lt;br /&gt;It is HOUBIGANT - less.</li>
            <li> When I was unable to locate my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne at our local mall, I began searching online to find it.  My husband is a special ed preschool teacher and he uses this scent as a positive association for the children, so he didn&#x27;t want to switch to some other cologne that would confuse them.  I was so happy to find what I thought to be Houbigant&#x27;s Musk from this seller.  When my husband put the cologne on, the scent was much more subtle than the original and I had to get right next to him to smell it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as long-lasting as the original either.    I&#x27;m giving Monsieur Musk by Dana three stars, because the aroma is nice, but the cologne is just not the same.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers commented, this is not the same Monsieur Musk.  The scent does not last as it used to.  Likely go back to Halston 1-12</li>
            <li> Still among my favorites after all these years.</li>
            <li> my husband has used this coogne scince 1980s and when it became unavalible in stores where we live I did not&lt;br /&gt;know I could order it on line it made a really great chrismas gift he was very happy to us it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is the best smelling of all colognes to my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been buying and using this cologne for many years. It is a big turn on for my wife. I love it. When I do not wear it my wife can tell and she will ask me about it. LOL.</li>
            <li> All went well with this order. I have used this product for a long time and get good results with it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> The product was advertised as cologne but arrived as cologne spray. I have used this product since the 1970s and the quality/strength of this particular item is weak and does not last.  Very disappointed.  I&#x27;ve purchased many bottles through Amazon and this is the first one that failed.</li>
            <li> My dad has been using this cologne since I was little.  You can&#x27;t find it anywhere! And we&#x27;ve been looking for years.  When he asked for more for Father&#x27;s Day, I was amazed to find it here on Amazon! It&#x27;s a classic.  I&#x27;m so glad I could make my dad happy... and nice smelling!</li>
            <li> Very nice I recomended this product because its an excelent cologne for men You can buy it when you want</li>
            <li> this was a gift for a friend that could no longer find this cologne in stores.  given as Christmas gift and they loved it.</li>
            <li> My friend as used  this for several years and likes the cologne as an aftershave which is  not  too heavy</li>
            <li> The best  Cologne  for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tulio</li>
            <li> I used the original scent for 30 years. I&#x27;ve had both the Houbigant Musk, and light Musk. As my last bottle started getting low I began shopping for a new one having no idea that the company had closed up. When I did an internet search I ended up here, and was pleased, then disappointed when I realized that this is a \\&quot;clone\\&quot; product. Regardless, I ordered two. I have to say that I was very pleased when I opened the bottle, and got my first whiff, but having used it a few times since then I have to say that it does fall short. The scent is close, but not quite right, and it doesn&#x27;t have near the staying power that the original had, which when used for an evening out could last all night long, and well into morning. I will use it just because I can&#x27;t get the real thing anymore, but in the interim I will search for a new higher quality scent than this.</li>
            <li> Very well it&#x27;s the only cologne my partner wears.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years.  I have received more compliments on the way I smell when wearing it.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I started wearing this fragrance in 1974 when it was manufactured in New York, Paris and Montreal (Laval) by Houbigant as Monsieur Houbigant Musk.  I read a review of it in Playboy that said it smelled slightly different on every male that wears it.  When I started dating the woman who would eventually become my wife in 1975, she used to tell me that both of her two roommates would continually smell the arms of the chair I was sitting in when I left their apartment.  Sometime in the late 80s, Houbigant closed its doors.  Apparently, Dana bought out much of the company and started selling the product as Monsieur Musk.  The first several orders I received were from either New York or Laval, presumably from the old Houbigant houses.  Then, sometime in the late 90s, Dana moved to somewhere in PA.  Throughout this period, the scent was reasonably close and not yet too diluted.  At some point in the late 90s I bought twelve 8oz bottles of cologne from the PA Dana. By this time I had become skin sensitive and quickly developed contact dermatitis to other scents.  So, literally, I was hooked on Monsieur Musk.  I still have a couple of those bottles, but I have amassed a number of 4oz bottles over the past 12 years.  Now, most of the Monsieur Musk I find is made in China under license from Dana.  The new stuff smells quite a bit different than the cologne made by Dana in PA, and a lot different than the original.  It is also less fragrant.  However, it still does not produce dermatitis and I still use it daily as an underarm deodorant (it is great for this, and contains no aluminum).  Even today, women at checkout counters, etc, compliment me on my cologne and want to know its name and where they can get it.  If you are a long time user, you might want to look for 8oz bottles on the internet.  They sell for as much as $80/bottle, but all the ones I have found are still from the PA Dana.  The other thing you might look out for is the Chinese spray 4oz bottles that have the removable atomizer.  Now I stock up on the 8oz bottles and just decant the 8oz bottles into the Chinese 4oz bottle with the removable atomizer.  I am ordering a couple bottles of this Amazon product now, just to see what I actually get.  Update (05/25/2017):  Beside the considerable dilution of the scent since it has been bottled in China, a major aggravation of the product was the black paint/ink that covered the bottle.  The paint/ink is very soluble in alcohol, and the majority of the liquid in the bottle is SD alcohol.  When using the splash on product, it is unavoidable that the liquid goes on your hands, and some remains after you &amp;#34;splash on&amp;#34; the fragrance.  Touching the bottle with fragrance wet hands causes the paint/ink to dissolve leading to a hard to clean black mess.  Furthermore, any of the product that drips down the bottle will leave a very hard to remove black stain at the bottle&#x27;s base.  I was pleasantly surprised when my most recent order arrived.  The product has been updated.  No longer is the bottle painted/inked black.  The bottle is now clear glass except for an apx. 2&amp;#34; black label that bears the information for the product.  Also, the ink/paint that is the label does not dissolve when wet with the fragrance.  This is a major improvement in the packaging and represents much more than a cosmetic overhaul.    As for the fragrance itself, my subjective opinion is that there has been a further dilution.  It is not enough to change my 5-star rating, but I do feel I am using a bit more than I was with even the last batch I purchased.  Still, Monsieur Musk is a unique fragrance, and I continue to receive occasional compliments for wearing it. Also, I have been using the new bottle long enough to notice if the contact dermatitis I develop within a couple days following use of other fragrances developed, and it has not.</li>
            <li> One of the best ever!</li>
            <li> I recomend it it was delivered on time keep doing the good work and effort it is worthy</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this for years he always smells good, nice subtle scent that never offends it is just right.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I have used it as an aftershave since 1982</li>
            <li> It appears Dana has changed the formula for success.  I&#x27;ve used Monsieur Musk for many years and this product is not the same.  The fragrance is different from the original.</li>
            <li> The first day I met the man I would later marry, he was wearing this cologne. That was 26 yrs ago. I bought it for him for yrs until I could no longer find it. I was so excited to find it on Amazon and it was cheaper than I used to pay for it. The memories it brings back is wonderful.  I only have one concern when he wears it. Women likes to smell him.</li>
            <li> I used this cologne faithfully for many years, but upon moving to Florida I could not find it for many years and ordered it as quickly as I could type and made the error of ordering the splash on instead of the spray, although they both leave you with a clean manly sent that I am complimented on by many, the spray is much easier to use putting on just the right amount and avoids over usage because not much is need to last all day without be over powering and having your 4 oz. last longer.&lt;br /&gt;For me this sent helps me smell clean and fresh leaving no mistake that it is a mans cologne that woman find attractive an makes other man want to use.</li>
            <li> Dana bought the rights and formula for this cologne and watered it down. I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> aroma vanishes after 3-4 hours, it ok freshly out of the shower,......no you do use it too shower....i miss the original</li>
            <li> Blast from the past. Brought back memories from the 70s. Unique scent.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t keep the women off of me.</li>
            <li> This cologne is wonderful! Have used it for 25 years.This was a great price and will order again if the price is right!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for thirty plus years. My wife is very sensitive to scents and this product is the only cologne that my wife likes. Enough said.</li>
            <li> This musk has changed,  the formula must&#x27;ve changed. Also, the after shave, by the same manufacturer has disappeared from the market. Amazon played a trick in that, they advertised they had the after shave but knowingly, new there is no after shave available. Bottom line, totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for well over30years.  It used to be called Mons. Musk by HOUBIGANT;  now by Dana.  Still get compliments on this all the time  Some of the ladies just like to hug me for the cologne alone.  Oh well........</li>
            <li> Love using it.  Would appreciate it if they would reduce the price some.  As a Disabled Vet, I spend wisely.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful gift to all of your (male) beloved ones. My husband always gets asked about the fragrance he uses.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it is the best fragrance for men.</li>
            <li> Husband has been using this for about 35 years.  He will not use anything else. The smell is just him! Order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Scent does not last. Was disappointed and probably will not reorder. I have been a Musk customer for over 20 years before Dana started creating this scent which is very different than original that stayed apparent on the wearer. This one only last about 2 hours. I guess this is the end of my love affair with once was Monsieur Musk.</li>
            <li> I used Monsieur Houbiugant Musk cologne for thirty years.  I love the scent especially after a time, how it blended with my body scent.  People always told me I smelled like a just got out of the shower.  No More!  Dana had changed the product and the result is a vegetable mustiness that is unpleasant.  I am so disappointed that I can no longer have this product as it was.  Dana, if you care, please return to the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It is a very clean smell. I know it is an old product and very hard to find but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> scent is gone in fifteen minutes. not as good as it was when i used it fifteen years ago. will not buy again.</li>
            <li> this item had no smell to it-- cologne that you cant smell wow they should test products they let people sell here</li>
