            <li>While I did not receive as drastic results as the product picture shows, I was very happy with the volume enhancement that I was able to achieve.</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite fiber lash, doesn&#x27;t run or leak and looks GREAT!</li>
            <li>Pictures speak for themselves :o)</li>
            <li>I had many compliments of my lashes n the best part of this product</li>
            <li>it helped in how successful I am in applying it.</li>
            <li>Loving this product!  </li>
            <li>I liked this product!  </li>
            <li>Just need more practice to be perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for the best mascara and length lengthing product and this was better than Younique.</li>
            <li>I really liked this eyelash curler!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a process, but they look nice on!</li>
            <li>I really liked this mascara!</li>
            <li>Like I said, It&#x27;s Great! :) ...</li>
            <li>Very nice worked good.</li>
            <li>I am SURE glad I did!!!  </li>
            <li>Gives nice length and volume for a good price!</li>
            <li>Well worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>This 3D fiber lash mascara from Mia Adora is truly amazing and has gave me hope I could have beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product I have ever use!!</li>
            <li>Easy and beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li>I was truly impressed how easy it was to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, you just have to learn how it works best for you.</li>
            <li>It was also very easy to remove with a make up cleansing cloth!</li>
            <li>I was impressed that she would call me directly, and as a result, I chose to let everyone know that I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li>Works good but when putting it on the fibers fall in ur eye and burn</li>
            <li>good  100%</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of any good reason why the spring is there.</li>
            <li>instead it&#x27;s just as good and lasts wayyyy longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lengthens and thickens about as good as Covergirl Bombshell, but it is a lot easier to get off.  </li>
            <li>The mascara colors them well, and thickens them a good bit.</li>
            <li>The product is good.</li>
            <li>so this is a good solution.</li>
            <li>It is really good.</li>
            <li>After step three, things are good and stay put until end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>case you need to separate your lashes after application but over all good product</li>
            <li>For the price point a good choice if you&#x27;re not looking to spend a lot.</li>
            <li>That can also be a good thing you don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off during the day.</li>
            <li>but hey the price is fair as it lasts all day until you take it off.</li>
            <li>Good product, does lengthen and thicken the lashes without using the fibers.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>

            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>For me, a good buy.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product if you want people to notice how beautiful and sexy lashes you have.</li>
            <li>was impressed with my finished look and with just one full coat (all three steps equals one coat)</li>
            <li>I would assume my lashes will get longer and even more beautiful</li>
            <li>Thank you, sweet, wonderful angel of beauty.</li>
            <li>I dont deal with irritation in the eyes, and it also gives a wonderful full look.</li>
            <li>The mascara set comes in a beautiful box, satin lined, just stunning.</li>
            <li>Amazing result and amazing company!</li>
            <li>:) it arrived before time and it works great! :)</li>
            <li>Packaging is exceptional.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it is the cheapest out of all the ones i have tried, which makes it that much better!</li>
            <li>Also, the merchant is very good with follow up e-mails to see if I was happy along with a mini makeup help download which is very helpful!</li>
            <li>The tube of mascara and fibers came in a very cute packaging as shown.</li>
            <li>Younique&#x27;s gel is thicker(makes for more clumps), also gives that spider legs appearance and the brush comes in a wavy pattern which is great, but softer bristles(so</li>
            <li>and so I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>Great mascara - does what it says, but it takes many coats to get the desired results.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this mascara.</li>

            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li>However, I am very pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li>I am more than happy with it</li>
            <li>Adds great length,  like this product way better than Younique .</li>
            <li>My lashes look great and it lasts most of the day</li>
            <li>It makes this penny pincher want to spend every penny on it for gorgeously gorgeous lashes that *everyone* compliments... because you&#x27;re worth it!!!</li>
            <li>It works fantastic and makes my eye lashes look gorgeous!</li>
            <li>As you can see from the pictures, it does a great job of coating my lashes and makes them very full.  </li>
            <li>now i am up to 3 and what a huge difference!!</li>

            <li>It‚Äôs amazing.</li>
            <li>Looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I like this mascara the best but wanted to find one that mimics real lash extension.  </li>
            <li>after I applied just a dab of coconut oil and warm water.</li>
            <li>They called to see if I liked it and how it was working.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>I liked this product because it did extend my lashes</li>
            <li>Just use warm soap water to remove</li>
            <li>It has the wax in it, and will color lashes fairly nice just by itself.  </li>
            <li>It stayed on nicely all day and didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>am buying my own soon.</li>
            <li>Now if it stayed on my lashes, I&#x27;d  be thrilled.</li>
            <li>i received this prosuct at a promotional price to give my honest opinion..</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>But it does make it longer than my own lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be honest here</li>
            <li>I purchased this mascara on a discount for giving my honest opinion on the product.</li>
            <li>Let me just say I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and will be using it again.</li>
            <li>They came nicely packaged from the company and the results on my eyelashes is (as my co-workers say) luscious.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m picky about mascara brushes) and it has a nice suction-type feel coming out of the tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li>I am loving this, and I look forward to using it each morning.</li>
            <li>but she is loving the result.</li>
            <li>I received these products at a reduced price to test and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Every time I have worn this on my eyes I am always given compliments which is always nice.</li>
            <li>and it looks nice sitting on my vanity</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice case and the tubes feel like metal.</li>

            <li>This mascara is great to achieve a nice full eyelash to top of your look.</li>
            <li>love this, way better than younique!</li>
            <li>look!!&lt;br /&gt;I find that Midora goes on smoother, right amount of fiber, and does not migrate to skin surrounding eyes!!!  </li>
            <li>But the best part is the fact that the instructions are clearly printed on the inside lid.</li>
            <li>When I use a mascara that has its own thickening and lengthening features to it, it seems to provide much better coverage than the mascara included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and it is still the most amazing mascara ever.</li>
            <li>This was by far the best deal i have gotten yet.</li>
            <li>On top of that it is so amazing.</li>
            <li>Everyone said they liked it better.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>The packaging though, was frayed and ripped and just not in the best condition, which clearly didn&#x27;t effect the product, but wanted to note it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a professional 53 year that still enjoys trying to look her best for her age.</li>
            <li>Most amazing product I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but when I put on the Mia Adora...bammm I had the most amazing longest looking eye lashes....</li>
            <li>It was easy as pie!</li>
            <li>So easy!  </li>
            <li>It came on time and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts all day, but washes off with ease too!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have become very fine &amp; sparse, but with the Mia Adora Fiber Lash Mascara</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love it and get many, many compliments on it!</li>
            <li>Love love love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>love love love it!</li>
            <li>but for special occasions &amp; date nights, it&#x27;s a good product..</li>
            <li>Also, the company is amazing and really makes an effort to make sure you are happy with your product.</li>
            <li>My first experience was great.  </li>
            <li>I‚Äôm so happy I did because I‚Äôm not a fake lashes girl.</li>
            <li>You know me if it looks to good to be true</li>
            <li>Super easy and great results</li>
            <li>It has rubber rings in the finger holes that make it very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Overall is a great price for this kind of mascara!</li>
            <li>Amazing results, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day, it removes easily, as they state that it would, with warm water.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>Love the mascara; it is easy to apply, great results, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It does take a minute to apply but it is worth it especially on a special night out.</li>
            <li>I do love the mascara though as it does somewhat lengthen the lashes on its own and curls my lashes just fine.</li>
            <li>Its ok not as Good as original one but not bad!</li>
            <li>my lashes were huge!</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m a HUGE stickler for clumpy lashes!</li>
            <li>This product has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Apply mascara on top.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments from customers and coworkers.</li>
            <li>I love it......</li>
            <li>they make your eyes pop :)</li>
            <li>I think I do better with reg mascara than with this product quite frankly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still deciding if I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li>Love the product will reorder.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much better then</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the product I have for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Great, really boosts your lashes.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ve lost too many.</li>
            <li>This product lasts longer and is much better to apply.  </li>
            <li>My real lashes has grown out more, making the 3D fibers look great with each use.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>They all love it.</li>
            <li>These 3D fiber lashes are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I feel the most this product did was add volume</li>
            <li>so i was really pleased with that.</li>
            <li>More so than with my go to mascara.</li>
            <li>It adds more volume than L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic because of the crumbs.  </li>
            <li>This time, it was even better.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it looks.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to seal the lashes well or they can flake off and irritate the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Anyways.. I absolutely LOVE my Mia</li>
            <li>You will love this product</li>

            <li>Ok, ok...</li>
            <li>The Too Faced version of this was much better.  </li>
            <li>Ive used cheaper ones that worked better.</li>

            <li>I truly love this mascara.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>Another thing that i love is that it doesn&#x27;t clump or smuge.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not that skilled and have had no problems with it</li>
            <li>so it looks more appealing.</li>
            <li>I really love this 3d fiber mascara......</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I would think the gel would have more in it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who like me has almost no eyelashes ... will be purchasing :-)</li>
            <li>It does provide some length to your eyelashes and well as volume for sure</li>
            <li>I noticed that the effects are greater if you apply 2 coats of fiber lashes instead of just one coat.  </li>
            <li>and so glad I don&#x27;t have to pay for eyelash extensions!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I do feel that the yonuinque lasts longer as I am almost needing to order more already of Mia brand.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones.  </li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed for my first go-around with a Fiber Lash mascara.  </li>
            <li>It subsided after a while, when I was able to blink them out.  </li>
            <li>When I sit in front of my mirror and take my time - it looks a lot better than when I am rushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara--</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best mascara I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li>Most important this WORKS!</li>
            <li>my lashes were touching my eyelids</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara and agree that it&#x27;s a better, cheaper, and faster alternative to applying falsies.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to spend more time to practice it.</li>
            <li>And the best of all: after buying the first kit, they sent me another one as a way to thank me for buying it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product, my eyelashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure buying mascara</li>
            <li>Love this mascara...works better than my MAC</li>

            <li>I love this mascara...</li>
            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>and I did apply the gel more than once to get the desired look, but when I was done my lashes were FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>I love fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>You will need to make sure that there is no mascara in your eye at all when you apply it.</li>

            <li>I must say I love it.</li>
            <li>I do apply 2 coats of the gel before applying fibers for a more luxurious look.  </li>
            <li>and now i Love the 3d mascara</li>
            <li>It was OK..</li>
            <li>All of my friends love it.</li>

            <li>I love how they make my lashes pop.  </li>
            <li>If I keep practicing, I should be able to get longer lashes.</li>
            <li>This product allows for instant volume and most importantly awesome length!!</li>
            <li>You follow the instructions of putting the gel on to your eyelashes with about 15 strokes to make sure it&#x27;s on evenly.</li>
            <li>I am getting so many compliments.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen many of my friends using the younique brand and their lashes look like how mine did when I used the cheaper brand.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t so cute.</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments ever since I started using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sure to please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I believe this product is better all around.</li>
            <li>I had the lovely opportunity to try out the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More so for curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I guarantee it will get better with time.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>This seems okay.</li>
            <li>Happy to have the real deal.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s okay - I don&#x27;t seem to get the results they show.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>you need to make sure you wipe the top of the brush off.  </li>
            <li>I also tend to focus more on the outer corners for a flared look.</li>
            <li>Also it lasted most of the day for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I like! :)</li>
            <li>I applied the product 3 times on each side to achieve my desired look and then applied mascara on top of that.  </li>
            <li>Love this, have not had any problems like some of the users.  </li>
            <li>Seriously glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I personally think easier on your own lashes!!!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>It did great my lashes where much longer..</li>
            <li>It made my eyelashes longer and gave more volume</li>
            <li>Maybelline has better alternatives for under $10.</li>
            <li>This was simple and looked great after a couple practice rounds - didn&#x27;t flake off!</li>
            <li>The price is so much better than the name brand.</li>
            <li>I love the way my eye lashes look fuller and longer.  </li>
            <li>how much more it opens up your eyes without it looking clumpy or overdone.</li>
            <li>Love this 3D mascara.</li>
            <li>And quite frankly I think it looks a lot better</li>
            <li>If you have never used a 3D Fiber Lash Mascara reading the reviews and product information will probably leave you with more questions than answers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora.</li>
            <li>hope you enjoyed this review.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>it will just make them more voluminous and long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I definitely love mascara.</li>
            <li>Too many steps in the process.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing extensions on my top lashes for years now, finding a mascara that matches the volume and length for my lower lashes is a challenge.</li>
            <li>I use Mia Adorable mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li>but I read the reviews on this and took a chance that it was better.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wear into the pool!  :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Have gotten much better fiber mascara at sephora at a better price.  </li>
            <li>Younique product is much better</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying this kind of mascara, but I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>So much fuller and longer!!!!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over a year now since I stopped and had been using various lash growing serums which worked wonderfully but didn&#x27;t give my lashes that nice, full look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not smudge easily!  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and customer service was prompt in checking up to make sure I was satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s and my lashes are becoming more and more sparse.  </li>
            <li>It is nice for a special occasion but not for every day.</li>
            <li>I also love how I can easily wash it off and it&#x27;s easy on my lashes :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>Received at discount for review, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried, makes my lashes beautiful and long.</li>
            <li>But I had great success with my very first use.</li>
            <li>On the first attempt, I got a good result.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with how full my lashes look.</li>
            <li>I tried the Younique brand for my first fiber lash product, in comparison to that, I feel this is just as good.  </li>
            <li>Long beautiful lashes!</li>
            <li>My lashes have thinned out and now they look the best they have in a long time</li>
            <li>I have another brand which is pretty good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited I bought them!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>So easy to use and my lashes and my eyes look better than ever.</li>
            <li>The quality is outstanding, and it was so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Item came quickly and in a nice carrying case.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to remove any mistakes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use love the way my lashes look it looks as if I&#x27;m wearing lash extensions.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is free of so many things I try to avoid.  </li>
            <li>One of the things I really like about this is it is a buildable product, as in you can literally use as much as you want &amp; it still looks great!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great so far!</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply and my lashes look amazing</li>
            <li>- but the plus side is that means they clean up easily off your face at the end of the day!</li>
            <li>Upon first try, the mascara clumped up really easily, but after using the product 3-4 more times (&amp; got more practice!)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, no fibers in my eyes, and they look fantastic - definately switching.</li>
            <li>The application is smooth, I love the brush and packaging,fast shipping, and this mascara has not caused any eye irritation or sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and this product works great for me.</li>
            <li>This product does a better job at keeping the eyelashes separated/looking full, however Younique does a MUCH better job at making the eyelashes look longer.  </li>
            <li>The most important step Is to curl your eyelashes before applying.</li>
            <li>I was contacted to review this product for free, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, the more practice you have, the better it looks.</li>
            <li>so far that&#x27;s also worked great.  </li>
            <li>so happy my eye looks nice and long a day.thank u.from.samia v .</li>

            <li>What impressed me most was the e-book that is included that not only tells you how to use the product, but also how to structure your eyebrows for your face shape and a whole bunch more.</li>
            <li>Great product I see a major difference!  </li>
            <li>Doesnt feel like its working at first but a huge differencw!!</li>

            <li>i liked it A LOT when i first got it.</li>
            <li>have found the first step of this product does not work as well as if I use my own mascara with it.</li>
            <li>I use a layer of my own mascara underneath first.</li>
            <li>It is an absolutely fine mascara.</li>
            <li>, I had to remove the mascara and fibers because they were still on my lashes, and still looked perfectly fine.</li>

            <li>After trying this mascara, I&#x27;ll say that I&#x27;m pretty well pleased, and very excited to use it again -- in the fall and winter.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it is easily washed off when I was ready to remove it.</li>
            <li>This is the best Mascara I ever had hands down!</li>
            <li>I am a huge makeup junkie</li>
            <li>HUGE BUMMER</li>
            <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li>I ordered this from a promotional event and got it free to try.</li>
            <li>You need to follow directions precisely.</li>
            <li>and I can get the same results with Maybelline great las.  </li>
            <li>I also own the competitor&#x27;s product that costs around 10x as much.</li>
            <li>I also received this product free or discounted from the company for a review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better success with Younique.</li>
            <li>It worked Wonderfulllllll no clumping smooth transition</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product and the price is so cheap for such fantastic results.</li>
            <li>When on smoothly,  didn&#x27;t clump, lasted.</li>
            <li>Tried a lot of times following instructions but never got great results.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few of these fiber lashes and this one is the best one of all.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t help but wonder how this got such great reviews.</li>
            <li>I received this at for free or at a reduced price in exchange a review; regardless all opinions are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing product, fast shipping, defiantly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>the mascara set glides smoothly onto my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t leave no clumps, gunk or stick my lashes together.</li>
            <li>Honestly now that I know what this product is capable of</li>
            <li>Just so you know, I did get a free fiber mascara to review this product.</li>
            <li>I finish it with a light coat of waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>My lashes look fabulous.</li>
            <li>My lash is really short &amp; when i started using this, i get a lot of comments from my friends about how great my eyelash looked.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for extra volume.</li>
            <li>and afterwards they look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is fabulous</li>
            <li>It does what it says, overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves me with absolutely gorgeous lashes that still look natural and not too over-the-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such an INCREDIBLE Mascara!!</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are long with volume and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I tried a similar product by recommendation of a friend, and although I loved how much better my lashes looked, the fibers kept getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply and made a big difference i will continue to purchase this product for sure!</li>
            <li>Easy to use to create beautiful, long, full eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara is awesome, so much cheaper than other brands:-)</li>
            <li>I hope my review will help you better understand if 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, cannot beat the price you pay much more at the cosmetic counters and this is that quality!</li>
            <li>My lashes look very long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I think the picture they show is a bit over dramatic of the results that you get unless you keep re applying, but you get a great full lengthy looking set of eyelashes that look beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was great at fist but its very repetitive and does do a good job.</li>
            <li>Thank you soooo much!!!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but able to get the same results with my Better Than Sex mascara by Too Faced.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the eyelash curler works great, looks great, &amp; is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Ordering with Mia Adora was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Removal is super easy.</li>
            <li>The 3 step process is super easy and not time consuming at all.</li>
            <li>, I will be purchasing this again &amp; paying full price is more than worth it.</li>
            <li>(btw I was super nervous about it being waterproof, it was actually so easy to remove</li>
            <li>I LOVE my new mascara!!!</li>
            <li>All in all is was very easy to use and did make my eyelashes look very nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this mascara very much.</li>
            <li>Love it and it really works and its easy to use.  </li>
            <li>love the look it gives my lashes, easy to apply, makes lashes so much fuller</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mascara was the one thing in my beauty bag that I could never hit a happy medium with (much less love).  </li>
            <li>On the second eye I new better and with practice from my first eye my lashes looked perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have really short eye lashes and these works amazing for me!</li>
            <li>I shouldn‚Äôt have to purchase an additional product to get my money‚Äôs worth!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>If ur lashes are not to long this is a great product to lengthen ur lashes.</li>
            <li>but I am more than willing to do them because of the end result.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that i started recomending it to all my friends n coworkers!</li>
            <li>I prefer Unique.</li>
            <li>I wear mascara daily, love love LOVE the look of this product.  </li>
            <li>I definitely need more practise with this, but even on my first try, my lashes still look AMAZING!</li>
            <li>These Fiber Lashes are totally worth your money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Unique 3D fiber lash mascara for over a year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a but pricey but has more gel and fiber consistently coming out than another brand I was using.  </li>
            <li>Received this and was excited to try.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this</li>
            <li>I did try many  time and it does make my lash longer but to me its not so pretty looking.</li>
            <li>Be sure to curl lashes first.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about it that I gave my daughter in law some for her Birthday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and super cool.  </li>
            <li>This probably works for those that have nicer lashes but for fine and fair haired gals, I think building lashes with mascara is the only way to get the look you want.  </li>
            <li>The color is perfect black and my lashes look good all day long</li>
            <li>The springy mechanism feels quality but the handles aren&#x27;t super cushy like some other brands I looked at.</li>
            <li>It has easy to follow directions, and comes in a lovely little box that is really handy to keep them together.&lt;br /&gt;You can also build up your length with more coats to get your desired length.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with Mia Adora 3D fiber lashes and decided to buy this brand because it has natural and safe ingredients (compared to other brands).</li>
            <li>but it looks AMAZING when it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>this one-3d fiber lash works very well and is much more comfortable that youngique (spelling?)</li>
            <li>Collection by Bunny, I simply only liked their fibers and gel better then Younique.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve seen my lashes look so big and natural</li>
            <li>Much more effective than regular mascara.</li>
            <li>plus I clean houses after work five nights a week.</li>
            <li>Just dab some water on a cotton swab and clean the area.</li>
            <li>but so far I love the way it makes my lashes look!</li>
            <li>Tried Younique - loved it, so was not too excited to try another a different brand, but Younique isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;available&amp;#34; as I want it to be.  </li>
            <li>I would use it for special date night with husband.</li>
            <li>I use this for date nights or special occasions.</li>
            <li>Top with large tube&lt;</li>
            <li>Well I found just the right one!</li>
            <li>with the box, it‚Äôs a great box with a magnet that keeps the box closed.</li>
            <li>Mia Adora&#x27;s Fiber Lash Mascara, so far, has not caused any kind of irritation on my eyes</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>I should have know the comments about fiber fallout were true.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are longer, fuller and full of volume.</li>
            <li>Will order again and thank you seller for such good follow-up and resolution of the issue</li>
            <li>Overall good product</li>
            <li>You have to expend some amount of time layer after layer to get the full benefits from it</li>
            <li>As a glasses wearer, I love that my lashed are very visible and</li>
            <li>They really do make your eyelashes longer and add a lot more volume to your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much.</li>
            <li>When adding the fibers, just make sure not to get them in your eye because they do fall sometimes and it really irritates.</li>
            <li>One coat is good for the simple days</li>
            <li>this fiber lash mascara made my lashes look think and full.  </li>
            <li>I love my real nails.  </li>
            <li>I put in on the second time and loved it.</li>
            <li>It really worked I love it.</li>
            <li>It smeared so badly no matter what I did.</li>
            <li>I already have long lashes but it extends them so much more and makes them look so much more full!</li>
            <li>was delivered quickly, have only tried it a couple of times since getting it, but it does seem good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to apply, though I&#x27;m still working on perfecting my technique.</li>
            <li>I wear mascara every day and found the first coat easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It comes in a beautiful black silk-like material lined box with a magnetic closure that makes it immediately feel luxurious.</li>
            <li>It works great just as expected!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation at all and after applying very carefully, I haven&#x27;t had any shedding from the lash booster.</li>
            <li>when I use my favorite way of combining the fiber lashes with my regular mascara, they are even more dramatic!&lt;br</li>
            <li>when I use my favorite way of combining the fiber lashes with my regular mascara, they are even more dramatic!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next time I made sure to do more of the &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; coat after applying the fibers, and that helped a lot.</li>
            <li>but now I can apply it quickly &amp; efficiently.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Sandra K.</li>
            <li>The model in the picture must have on atleast five coats-which would use it up quickly.</li>
            <li>Not complicated to apply and super quick!</li>
            <li>Definitely need practice applying it correctly but overall excellent product.</li>
            <li>The items arrived quickly and were well packaged.</li>
            <li>super clumpy &amp;#62;_&amp;#60</li>
            <li>/&gt;These micro fibers will adhere to the Magnifying Gel when applied quickly, before the Magnifying Gel dries.</li>
            <li>The company was able to send a replacement and the second was wayyyy better.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, I will definitely purchase again once I run out of my initial tube.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this mascara and will be replacing my old product!!</li>
            <li>My drugstore mascaras get me results that I can enjoy just as much!</li>
            <li>Im like hello thick long lashes now :) Happy and satisfied costumer here :)</li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased &amp; would recommend Mia Adora to anyone who needs the extra length &amp; thickness as I do.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes as normal, but I always wanted to see what I would look like with beautiful full eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes and when I use the mascara I loved it</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs quite large and it‚Äôs easy to accidentally hit your eyelid while applying this.</li>
            <li>Came super fast!!</li>
            <li>It came with clear instructions, products were label,  and it was easy to apply!  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes that it would be AMAZING and make my lashes appear longer than they really are.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ve read so many others that really do like it very much</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I love trying new products</li>
            <li>This will be my new every day look, but I&#x27;ll still wear falsies for the occasions when I want to look extra beautiful and natural :)</li>
            <li>is that it made my real lashes strong and fuller.</li>
            <li>This is just slightly more work then normal mascara, and is worth it.</li>
            <li>I really like it... easy to apply...</li>
            <li>They are pretty simple to put on, the box does good at explains the instructions.</li>
            <li>Apply a coat of good lengthening mascara (I use Guerlain) and allow to dry.  </li>
            <li>They can look very natural with just one layer or you can go for more and glam it up.</li>
            <li>I no longer feel the need to wear falsies anymore due to this amazing mascara!</li>
            <li>and you brush that on then seal it again with the first one!</li>
            <li>If I had to put in order of use, it was Younique first, then I went looking for another brand which was CBB(used the most) and now starting to use Mia Adora more.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>I think I actually prefer the Mia Adora mascara more!</li>
            <li>I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY when I tried it!!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying fiber mascara, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I like it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first step mascara goes on smooth and light, and the fiber mascara sticks really well.</li>
            <li>It really does work!!</li>
            <li>It is exactly how it is advertised!  </li>
            <li>This product really does extend the lashes!!</li>
            <li>It comes off very easily with warm water, and there are no black smudges around my eyes the next morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super easy to apply for a first timer and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>If I had to make one change it would be to make it a little bit more of a curve to fit the eye better.</li>
            <li>I only use one application of the gel and fibers as instructed, followed by my mascara -- amazing results.  </li>
            <li>My lashes looked amazing and my eyes looked so big!</li>
            <li>The process takes longer than I&#x27;d like, but you can end up with amazing lashes that last all day if you take the time to apply it correctly.</li>
            <li>Not only was the product amazing</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the concept of fiber mascaras and really liked the green tea fibers as they are more natural.  </li>
            <li>It took me about three days to play with the wand and to remember to put the clear gel on to seal the fibers on (I would get side-tracked and would forget) that I really noticed that it would look amazingly thicker.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product- it takes a few practice runs to get the hang of it, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>They have an amazing customer service who contact you the entire way of your process.</li>
            <li>i love the fact there marked 1,2,3, then the trial of the lashes i</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews on here</li>
            <li>But using this product has given me better eyelashes than ever, including when I was young.</li>
            <li>I feel more natural with fibers then with individuals.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the practice.</li>
            <li>worth the $</li>
            <li>i just don&#x27;t think its as good as i had expected.</li>
            <li>Why is it that they always seem to have the long, beautiful, natural lashes?</li>
            <li>So since I&#x27;m having problems with the glue the fibers get in my eyes more frequently.</li>
            <li>The product is great, and I have not gone back to my old mascara and never plan</li>
            <li>This product was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat time consuming, about 5 minutes for me, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>i liked because it work at the same they show on the picture</li>
            <li>I loved this mascara because it really gives your lashes instant length.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money and</li>
            <li>I noticed her lashes are longer and look more natural with this mascara.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Take your time in applying the steps and the result worth it.</li>
            <li>just moisten them with warm water, and then they wash off just like regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>So far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>However, at over $20 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>The last step makes the fibers appear like my own lashes and smooths the clumping if any.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Plus it came it a classic container for easy storage.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please remember this is my own personal opinion &amp; not all of you will agree.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve included a photo to give you a better idea of what the Natural Fiber look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>loving the outcome overall.</li>
            <li>I also the love the fact that this mascara is made with natural ingredients,paraben free,and is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had to wait to write a review because i wanna see just how effective this is based on a daily wear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do well with false lashes so these are a great alternative!</li>
            <li>it didnt irritate my eyes which is good because my eyes are sensitive and it blends right in with my natural eyelashes..would def recommend</li>
            <li>I have never been more pleased with any other mascara.</li>
            <li>Through my own personal experience with applying this mascara, I&#x27;ve discovered that long, slow strokes work best for me :).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many high end mascaras that claim to do the same thing that cost a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as good as my other brand.</li>
            <li>But in order to achieve lashes as long as the picture, many applications fo the product are needed!</li>
            <li>Okay for special occasions but not something I will keep up daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about getting the right stroke.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need it right then.  </li>
            <li>and it swipes right off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced right also.</li>
            <li>so you get the fibers on right.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m just OCD about it looking right).</li>
            <li>Right now I would recommend this product and promote this brand.</li>
            <li>Received today and tried it right away..</li>
            <li>I just got this today and had to try it right away.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple times of using to get the right effect and results.</li>
            <li>but I caught on right away</li>
            <li>Another thing I could not stand was the Younique seemed to make my eyes itchy &amp; with this my eyes feel fine, just like if I was using a normal mascara.</li>
            <li>I like that its easy to put on, and the color looks very natural...</li>
            <li>I have to say  as big PRO that last for the all day, no messy and the best that made it superior to any other mascara use before, it is when you washed it</li>
            <li>Then after waiting 20 seconds for the fibers to dry you add more of the gel to seal them in place and voila!</li>
            <li>It really does give the full look shown.</li>
            <li>you love your lashes, like the natural look, don&#x27;t have time to apply lashes (individuals or strips) daily, love emphasizing your eyes, then this is the 3D lash mascara for you.</li>
            <li>but it gives you full and long lashes and so easy to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also liked how long they were.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and that means I have fine light eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably tried almost every main brand of mascara and normally have a routine of having to use more then one mascara to get the look I want, but this mascara makes it</li>
            <li>I am now a committed and faithful user and will highly recommend this product to other women who desire beautiful eye lashes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>IT looks great when applied properly my lashes look super think and long.</li>
            <li>I have always had beautiful lashes, but the older one gets the less you have, well for all of you ladies who are experiencing what I have do not hesitate!</li>
            <li>My mother loves the 3D lashes, she got it right on the first try.</li>
            <li>First you add step on and right after you add step 2</li>
            <li>Also, I was surprised at how easy the mascara washed off with my face wash and water.</li>
            <li>Love my Mia Dora fiber lash kit very natural looking and brings out my beauty highly recommend it for all women.  </li>
            <li>All sometimes irritates after long wear, but using 3D Fibers has been much better than individuals, a lot cheaper, and more natural attraction.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how this Mascara makes such a difference on ones face and can bring out your eyes so much and make you feel so pretty.  </li>
            <li>and I love how the directions are right on box as soon as you open it.</li>
            <li>(Right eye, top lashes first, then left eye top lashes, followed by right eye bottom lashes, and finally left eye bottom lashes).  </li>
            <li>magnifying gel is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>u guy very much...</li>
            <li>She loves this product very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very gentle on my eyes-</li>
            <li>While the product wasn&#x27;t great their customer service was, so while I would say steer clear of this product I would say give other products from the company a chance.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and so dramatically effective; I&#x27;ll never go back to regular mascara again.  </li>
            <li>Lasts long, removes very easily, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes at all.</li>
            <li>Its simple quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I personally found this super easy to apply, Lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The fibers go on with little to no mess and when you apply the last coat of gel the magic starts to come together and pow your eyelashes go from fair to fab!</li>
            <li>Layering different mascara adds little more length and good volume.  </li>
            <li>It does take a little while to apply, But lets be real if you want to look your best when it comes to makeup the last thing you want to do is rush!</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on special occasions and it works just as expected and makes my eyelashes fuller and more pronounced.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product‚Ä¶I have very short wispy lashes and my bottom lashes are virtually non-existent.  </li>
            <li>If you want to give it an additional boost, you can use your favorite traditional mascara‚Ä¶</li>
            <li>Takes a cpl mins more than just regular mascara</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews first before buying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than those big brand name mascara.</li>
            <li>I get double again the length with one of my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li>When I first used the enclosed mascara, I noticed it was quite a bit drier than my holy grail mascara.  </li>
            <li>Lashes appear thicker and longer exactly as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this Mascara at a very deep discount to give a review.</li>
            <li>This leaves your lashes pretty and flair;not clumped together.</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>It works better if you apply a regular mascara before the first coat of gel &amp; fibers.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li>but this is pretty close.</li>
            <li>I can achieve better results with standard prestige mascara.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time to use fiber lash mascara but do see a difference.</li>
            <li>Overall I like this brand better,</li>
            <li>It has fibers that you apply, then you cover that with another coat of the first tube to &#x27;seal&#x27; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only concern is that it takes so many cost to finish the process</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be a continued customer.</li>
            <li>I have use a lot of mascaras, this one makes your eyelashes a lot longer and not fake</li>
            <li>I used my first brand up and wanted to try this brand to see the difference.</li>
            <li>im Definitely getting more after it&#x27;s done</li>
            <li>It REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>Tricky at first</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the product overall.</li>
            <li>I YouTubed several videos of several different brands and felt Mia would be my best option.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this it was an OMG moment.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the fullness, but I am completely satisfied with the final results.</li>
            <li>It comes in a pretty box and is two steps to apply.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li>So much better than regular mascara...</li>
            <li>make sure you wash it off at the end of the night because if you leave it on you might end up with fibers in your eyes the next morning and its not too comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>It really does extend the eyelashes!</li>
            <li>The first night I used it, he was like, &amp;#34;WOW</li>
            <li>This is the first fiber lash mascara I&#x27;ve tried and I like the results.</li>
            <li>I get better results from regular mascara!</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>First time I tried it</li>
            <li>I have never purchased a mascara before that came in such an elegant package.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of makeup remover cleanser and hot water.</li>
            <li>younique was just better in my personal comparison).</li>
            <li>Lasher are much longer and thicker!  </li>
            <li>You use the longer tube first.</li>
            <li>I was very sceptical about buying it but moonstruck is worth the price .  </li>
            <li>The best part is, they don&#x27;t look fake at all.  </li>
            <li>Overall an okay product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying 2 to 3 rounds of the gel and fiber and it extends my lashes pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The end result was not any better than regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly the look</li>
            <li>My mom tried it, too and this is the first mascara EVER that didn&#x27;t cause her issues.</li>
            <li>I will not reorder this product and suggest the Younginque product to someone interested in trying out a Fiber Mascara.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to enhance their lash look!</li>
            <li>Then I coat it with the first step mascara again to keep the fibers in place.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>I first started with clumpy lashes</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try for the first time when you are heading to work and on a time crush.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast also!</li>
            <li>You could do one layer or several of coats to add more drama.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using this</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t count on all those five star stellar reviews.</li>
            <li>Yes, I kept the box because it&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>It is my first experience with this type of product.</li>
            <li>The first is called Magnifying Gel.</li>
            <li>but I did such a better job on her&#x27;s that I&#x27;m going to use her before and after and after photo as my example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It does seem to work better if you apply one coat of your regular mascara first then first coat of gel.</li>
            <li>I have tried another similar product and this one performs better.</li>
            <li>I will admit that I jumped the gun and skimmed the instructions the first time I put the 3D Fiber Lashes by Mia Adora on.</li>
            <li>I did exactly what it said not to do, which was to put the fibers too close to your eye ball.</li>
            <li>The first time  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the discount!</li>
            <li>I posted a video of me using the product and after one layer of coating you can really see the difference!</li>
            <li>They definitely look longer and more &amp;#34;luscious&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I had tried any of the fiber lash mascaras</li>
            <li>Love this 3D fiber lash mascara and wish I discovered it earlier.</li>
            <li>You could do one layer or several of coats to add more drama.</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm for me the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I have to say my paltry old lashes really looked thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li>this makes my very short lashes long, I love it!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for special occassions when you want a little extra BAM to your gorgeous eyes!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this product and read about the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Work great, leaves your eye lashes twice as long as before you put it on and stays pretty all day long.</li>
            <li>However, the step 1 applicator was dried up and barely coated my lashes no matter how many strokes I brush, resulting in the step 2 not being effective because they will not adhere.</li>
            <li>I used everyday and all my friends say that really natural and great.</li>
            <li>I really like short bristles on the mascara applicator wand for more control.  </li>
            <li>I used to wear lash extensions which I loved but after a year started getting tired of the monthly upkeep, plus it wasn&#x27;t exactly cheap.</li>
            <li>its ok, What i really like about the mascara is that can last all day.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best 3D fiber mascara out there, People ask me if I&#x27;m warring false lashes</li>
            <li>It really works love how the mascara set gives me eyelashes that extra boost and volume!</li>
            <li>I love how much of a difference it made &amp; I only applied two coats.</li>
            <li>The mascara makes my lashes gorgeous, especially since I have skimpy Asian lashes.</li>
            <li>I have very fine short lashes, and this makes my lashes look long and full!</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s started to run out (pretty fast)</li>
            <li>I have relatively long lashes already so was looking for something giving me more volume.</li>
            <li>When I use the first stick the stick doesn&#x27;t have as much glue on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product and although I don&#x27;t planning on wearing it every day due to time, I will definitely wear it when I want to impress.</li>
            <li>but this one I love my eyelashes look long</li>
            <li>When I do apply the fibers, I work on one eye at a time because the mascara dries pretty fast and the fibers need to attach to the mascara to stay put before I apply another coat of the mascara to seal in the fibers.  </li>
            <li>The first one I received didn&#x27;t have much product in the gel portion or the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>This product is superior to the 3D lashes from Younique that I have ordered in the past.  </li>
            <li>They look like my own eyelashes only long, full and beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who has been struggling with finding the right product for their eyelashes.</li>
            <li>such a surprise i have never tried fiber lashes and went this cant be true!</li>
            <li>This is such a cool product!</li>
            <li>Love how long it makes my lashes look!</li>
            <li>I love how long it makes my lashes!</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much of the fiber, curl your lashes first and be ready to separate them with a lash brush or comb to avoid any clumps.</li>
            <li>The Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lashes went on easily - just follow the simple steps in the product guide.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to remove, unlike regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Previously, I&#x27;ve used dollar brands, so this is a nice upgrade.</li>
            <li>However, it is easy to remove with my facial wash and it does not burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to try the lash mascara, but seems easy enough to use.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product first on clean lashes and it looked like regular mascara.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>i dnt have long thick lashes so this 3d fiber mascarra is so perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Only thing that worried me was the strong odor.</li>
            <li>Only thing is getting over the strong smell</li>
            <li>The first tube that you use is also kind of messy</li>
            <li>I would like a little less clumpy but that would be perfect mascara that I don&#x27;t think exists yet</li>
            <li>I had previously used a different brand of 3D Fiber lashes and loved them, so I was excited when I saw a decent price on this product.  </li>
            <li>I think the manufacturer&#x27;s description is accurate and, like other reviewers noted, you get the hang of the application procedure pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am not trying for a fake-lash-catwalk look, but those who want that will certainly get it with this product.  </li>
            <li>Large tube, put 15-20 strokes on one eye&lt;</li>
            <li>I was genuinely impressed by how long it made my lashes, but after using the product for about 2-3 weeks the natural fibers dried up.</li>
            <li>it looks very pretty and natural.  </li>
            <li>I went back and coated the fibery lashes with one more coat of the mascara - and WOW!  </li>
            <li>My lashes are fine and short.</li>
            <li>I was very thrilled when I got the chance to try this 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora, as it&#x27;s as good as putting on false eyelashes, if not better.</li>
            <li>for extra volume top with your favorite mascara (Mine is Cinique High Impact Extreme Volume)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice in a little box.</li>
            <li>I have used so many other mascaras and not had the same affect as this one does so easily to apply.  </li>
            <li>I love fiber lashes and not too long ago discovered them!!!  </li>
            <li>Not only does it make my eyelashes look amazing but saving $300 on eyelash extensions with the same result couldn&#x27;t make me happier.</li>
            <li>My lashes are light and scarce, but farely long and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, I had to clean up a few of the fibers in my waterline but</li>
            <li>I can really see the huge difference between a regular mascara and a 3D mascara.</li>
            <li>and it does take a bit longer to apply than regular mascara, but really does make a huge difference when I do.</li>
            <li>i am the person who wants to know the truth,</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, makes your eyes pop , but product was soso.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really amazed me to see my lashes curl up ...</li>
            <li>and I am very picky with products and brands I use on and around my eye area.</li>
            <li>I really reall like it....</li>
            <li>I spend too much time applying make up as it is.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>They look real.</li>
            <li>and you really want some added length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a wee bit uneasy about taunt spring aimed straight at my eye.</li>
            <li>And i wouldn&#x27;t really have minded that had i felt it made a drastic improvement.</li>
            <li>If it bothers you too much, I recommend holding a tissue or oil sheet under your eye to catch any fibers that don&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li>They really did look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more!t wear much makeup.  </li>
            <li>That was very helpful for me.&lt;br /&gt;Mia</li>
            <li>But i started experimenting, and the ebook they send you really does help with giving you some tips and techniques to try.</li>
            <li>This product worked really well.</li>
            <li>I prefer to remove my eye makeup with coconut oil since it soothes my skin/eye-lids and this mascara wiped off really well</li>
            <li>so, I guess my eyes really stand out once I apply things like eyeshadow and shape my eyebrows well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mia Adora</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am very pleases with this product.</li>

            <li>I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li>I do notice fall out during the day but that could be my fault for applying too much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>oh so real on youth eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is NOT waterproof, and can&#x27;t really survive a nap or roll in the hay-</li>
            <li>It might not work well for contact lens wearers though - the fibers might be a real issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore my Mia Adora.</li>
            <li>Really see the difference immediately</li>
            <li>The fibers did not come off in my eyes, even during intense gym workouts.</li>
            <li>I really like this fiber lashes made my eye really stand out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lasts all day until I&#x27;m ready to remove at night.</li>
            <li>I was really truly expecting.</li>
            <li>I really like the 3D lash mascara...</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look much fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>This stuff really lengthens and plumps lashes.</li>
            <li>This really does work and enables my zero lashes to appear as if falsies.  </li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I budget 10 minutes in for my whole morning routing</li>
            <li>you have ever used the Younique Fiber Lashes, I would say this product is very compareable.  </li>
            <li>This product made my lashes look much longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>it comes with the box which is very fancy and neat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely loooooved this mascara...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend !</li>
            <li>it makes my real lashes look longer without the clumpiness&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>too much of stress for a mascara</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s going to purchase thanks for this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks again, Tammy</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Really liking it.</li>
            <li>These fiber lash mascara truly does make your lashes so much longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t really exist.</li>
            <li>Then apply the fibers just as much as the gel, which is about 15 strokes.</li>
            <li>Cant believe there my lashes finally a real mascara.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money on it while perfecting the look of the lashes.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t let myself spend that much on a 3D mascara as I&#x27;m novice to using it.</li>
            <li>it really lengthens and thickens my lashes</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking to spruce up their eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It really thickens my lashes.</li>
            <li>all, I really like this mascara and the concept.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like it isn&#x27;t even applying, and then the fibers don&#x27;t seem to really come off of the wand.  </li>
            <li>Does not last throughout the day, initially looks great but just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>- These are going to take some getting used to, but they were MUCH easier than I feared.</li>
            <li>I never wanted to spend much money on makeup</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t tell the makers, but I would pay 3x as much for this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I could see the differenceand they&#x27;re want much of one..</li>
            <li>no matter how much of the gel I use.</li>
            <li>It has lasted much longer &amp; I will continue to order this</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference in the way that my eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Over the years my lashes have become much thinner.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I would and do highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to try one.</li>
            <li>but I think that is to be expected with as many coats as I used.</li>
            <li>really like the look that the mascara gives you and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was very noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Kudos to the seller: fast delivery&lt;</li>
            <li>is very helpful to see tips.</li>
            <li>If you want to save on 3D mascara, I highly recommend Mia adora!</li>
            <li>will really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to.</li>
            <li>And, you basically can choose how much thickness you want to add to your lashes by repeating steps.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>The fibers do sometimes get somewhat clumped up but running a lash comb through them really helps.</li>
            <li>This mascara works very well.</li>
            <li>so this product is my absolute favorite&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very blond eye lashes and using the 3D fiber lash mascara</li>
            <li>I just really like this product.</li>
            <li>and these really do make your eyelashes look</li>
            <li>lashes do look longer and much fuller after use.  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product I can&#x27;t use it everyday because of the price.</li>
            <li>Warm water on a round cotton pad</li>
            <li>I personally like not using my own mascara at the start and the third time I tried the mascara</li>
            <li>I received this mascara a few days ago and i am LOVING it.</li>
            <li>This mascara works great making your lashes longer giving you that false lash impression</li>
            <li>It definitely holds up far better than the Younique in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of fiber lashes and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>Nice fiber lash mascara - very similar to the ones being sold by independent distributors.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised when I applied only one coat that it did such a good job of coating my lashes, I haven&#x27;t even tried doing all 3 steps.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try that later this week for date night, but so far, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this.</li>
            <li>and it actually looked even more natural than with just the liner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fallen in love with using false eyelashes to amp up my eye makeup, but they are time consuming and just not always appropriate for all occasions for me.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to hassle with applying false lashes, this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Where I live, spring and summer are both hot and very humid.</li>
            <li>It really does add dimension to your eye lashes, It&#x27;s going to take some practice to get it just right, but I like how it looks so far</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike some of the reviewers, I applied it right from the beginning with no trouble.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and easily comes off at the end of the day with eyemakeup remover.  </li>
            <li>Love my new mascara its exactly what i expected!</li>
            <li>Most things come with very little information and leave you hanging for even the most basic instructions</li>
            <li>Love my long lashes!!!!</li>
            <li>The more you layer the product, the more of a dramatic look you will get.</li>
            <li>, the first looks that way sure the second had me stunned for a second</li>
            <li>Yayyy so excited to be using this mascara FINALLY!!</li>
            <li>I like it better than any other brand I have used before.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the Youngique Fiber Lash Mascara from a distributor last Fall.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and even looks great the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can use out with my other mascara as well.</li>
            <li>Went back to original.</li>
            <li>It definitely brings significant volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have so many other mascaras that I didn‚Äôt want to spend another $30 buying some.</li>
            <li>I like this product better than other fiber lashes I have used because lash fibers don&#x27;t get in my eyes while applying and during the day.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was amazed at how long and full it made them look.</li>
            <li>Clean your make up of your eyes totally and don&#x27;t rush using the mascara.</li>
            <li>I wanted to update my review after the company actually contacted me and provided a full refund very promptly.</li>
            <li>I get so much volume and a decent amount of length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always love the natural look whenever I applied lashes, but still it took too long applying individuals.</li>
            <li>I loved the dark lash, I only had to put in on once in a 8 hour day</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a great alternative to false lashes as they normally irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>am giving this a big 5 star rating because I have only positive, fantastic things to say about the Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lash Mascara Set!</li>
            <li>I usually only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>The fiber addition is not as thick or as long as I&#x27;ve experienced but overall great improvements to my thin and light lashes.</li>
            <li>Great product, a bit unusual to apply at first, but the results speak for themselves,  no flakes and big, long, full, thick lashes.</li>
            <li>Mia Adora&#x27;s gel is not as thick(makes for less clumps), the brush bristles are firmer causing to straighten out your lashes keeping them from clumpingm and head is more straight then wavy.</li>
            <li>At first I was little intimidated because of my personal experience with the Younique brand, But after applying it &amp; trying it out, I can absolutely say I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Lately I do not use the step 2 much.</li>
            <li>and this is by far, not only the most natural looking but</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that there were more than just your average mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than your average mascara though.</li>
            <li>in all a good product, needs a bit of work to learn how to use it properly, but definitely gave me bigger and longer lashes.</li>
            <li>I was truly surprised but absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, maybe not worth the money.</li>
            <li>With this product, it makes me feel beautiful every time I use it without applying fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara does what it says, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li>You can apply more or less for the look you&#x27;re trying to obtain.</li>
            <li>I love that the gel layer is black.</li>
            <li>you have to be careful with the fiber part though cause it will spill easily.</li>
            <li>These are your fibers.&lt;br /&gt;While the Magnifying Gel is still wet, apply 10-15 strokes of the Natural Fiber Lashes from mid-lash to the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too clumpy, and on top of that a small amount of the fibers consistently fall off while you&#x27;re applying it and got into my eyes and onto my face.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>Comparable to orher name brand products in this particular category.</li>
            <li>when Im using This product I love to see how thick and long I can get my lashes, Wipes off pretty easy with make-up wipes.</li>
            <li>I personally have very short eyelashes, and with one coat of my favorite mascara and these fiber lashes, I always get the results I want.</li>
            <li>So far this product is a great alternative to the damaging false lashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  need to wear  fake lashes  any more :)</li>
            <li>Overall, a great few new concept  - definitely cheaper than some of the others out there, but this is my first fiber mascara</li>
            <li>Firstly, the case itself is super fancy, a box with magnets to keep it closed and lined with silk.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone that wears mascara.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>Younique is highly overrated, and to me, does not compete with Mia Adora.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this mascara.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I purchase both inexpensive and high end makeup.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>In the videos and on the photos this particular brand shows, the ladies who are trying the mascara on already have longer than normal eyelashes</li>
            <li>Too many of the little fibers end up on my cheekbones.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, the little satin-lined box that mascara comes in from Mia Adora is absolutely ADORABLE.  </li>
            <li>It opened up my eyes a little more.</li>
            <li>I have very short lashes and this has made them Really stand out!!</li>
            <li>I love the little case that contains the mascara set, but it&#x27;s kinda bulky if you plan to bring it along anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;BASE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove unlike other fiber lash mascara that required you to use a type of make up remover.</li>
            <li>This was a big deal for me because I had been using lash extensions for 4 ¬Ω years and have lost a ton of my real lashes,but you can&#x27;t tell any breakage of my real lashes thanks to my 3D lashes, I highly recommend Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lashes</li>
            <li>I really like how the instructions on how to use the product are clearly printed on the inside of the case.</li>
            <li>experience with it was that it really doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>I like using this product before I go out with my friends on weekends, but this mascara can also be used along with your normal makeup routine.</li>
            <li>I would rather use normal mascara</li>
            <li>and she normally buys a cheaper version for $8.00 and saw the difference with this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also done one layer of my regular mascara underneath the first layer of Mia Adora, and that works very well.</li>
            <li>It made my lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look so long and full</li>
            <li>I am impatient when I am applying it and don&#x27;t put on as many layers as one is advised</li>
            <li>So I was kind of naively expecting to get close to that look.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>With Mia Adora I feel like I am wearing normal mascara and can‚Äôt tell that there is a difference.</li>
            <li>I put it on  and wait a few seconds and put more at the tips of my lashes and do it again .</li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;d look more voluminous than they do long.</li>
            <li>so worth the extra length that they have me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used the same brand of mascara for years and just for fun</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the extra minutes to apply.</li>
            <li>I use Latisse and Guerlain, and that is typically enough, but with the addition of this, they get mega long :)</li>
            <li>Of all the different 3D fiber lash mascaras I have tried in the past, the Mia Adora brand is vastly superior than all of them.  </li>
            <li>It also volumizes your lashes, giving them that long full look.</li>
            <li>It definitely requires time to &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; the technique with lower lashes, it&#x27;s worth it at the end!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>my lashes are pretty short and straight</li>
            <li>Good, but not great.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good alternative to false eye lashes this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>It is not the easiest to put on, but it&#x27;s not really hard either.  </li>
            <li>I found it worked better for me when I first curled my eyelashes &amp; applied my black mascara (which is only optional).  </li>
            <li>I really love this mascara, it is very long lasting.</li>
            <li>The instructions were incredibly easy to follow and application was simple enough.  </li>
            <li>So, other than the fear of a spring flinging at my eye like a tiny cosmetic medieval battering ram , this is a really good product.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes full and long and doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li>right regular mascara</li>
            <li>Makes my lashed super long</li>
            <li>They were amazing and a little different but</li>
            <li>, i wish they were water proof since i live in a rainy area where in winter it always rains</li>
            <li>Well this was definitely a new experience for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using 3D mascara</li>
            <li>I will now order their eyelash curler to compliment my new purchase.</li>
            <li>Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is my new go to mascara.  </li>
            <li>and this is now my new fav.</li>
            <li>Im new to using fiber lashes</li>
            <li>One of my favorite new beauty products in a long, long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow - they are easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t really find them messy.</li>
            <li>The next week they sent me an entire tube for free.</li>
            <li>Looks like I spent way more time than I actually have.</li>
            <li>Even the box the mascara is in is this high quality cardboard with a soft silky lining.</li>
            <li>- I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually very surprised at how well these mascaras work.</li>
            <li>This product is very natural looking</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural in my opinion</li>
            <li>Maybe I got a very old stock.</li>
            <li>I already have lashes that are pretty full and a decent length, this did enhance them but not much more than my $7 drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li>the left of my photo are my daughter&#x27;s natural lashes and on the right are her lashes with Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara applied.</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve spend so much money on special mascara promising volumized lashes</li>
            <li>I really expected these to be messy and complicated, but found them to be easy to use and look great!  </li>
            <li>but wow the compliments i get are blowing my mind away!</li>
            <li>i started off with only 2 coats of the first</li>
            <li>my eye lashes are naturally pretty big as is</li>
            <li>That said, during the cooler months when the humidity is lower, I&#x27;ll definitely be reaching for this mascara first.</li>
            <li>It has fibers that go on your lashes, that appear like hair that you apply after first priming with the larger mascara then again after fiber mascara to lock in.</li>
            <li>Wow, was I amazed at the difference this has made!  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, I&#x27;ve definitely gotten better with practice.</li>
            <li>Her lashes are simply angelic ;)</li>
            <li>One tube is the &#x27;gel&#x27; that you apply first and last.  </li>
            <li>I usually apply 3 coats of both and made sure it&#x27;s  sealed by the step 1 and 3 mascara</li>
            <li>On my FIRST try my lashes look a LOT fuller and longer than with ANY traditional mascara.  </li>
            <li>Applying my mascara first and then following the steps and just applying the gel and the fibers without my mascara.</li>
            <li>Even came a day early!</li>
            <li>Followed the directions exactly and definitely have noticeably longer lashes.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that on the first application, following the directions, my eyelashes looked like they grew overnight!  </li>
            <li>I just double check to make sure it doesn&#x27;t smudge in other areas on my face.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy it again once I&#x27;m done with my first set c:</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd Fiber Lash Mascara I&#x27;ve tried; first was Younique.</li>
            <li>To use them, you simply use the mascara first, followed by the fiber wand, then finish again with the mascara.</li>
            <li>She has really sensitive eyes and can&#x27;t wear anything else!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually never wear mascara.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I was hopeful this product would eliminate my 25 coats of mascara and the time spent applying and reapplying eyeliner to look like I have full set of lashes.  </li>
            <li>Ive always loved the look of lashes because they are full and long but is scared to wear them because i dont want to look fake.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean them to be, but a q-tip takes care of it pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my lashes longer and everyone thinks i&#x27;m wearing false lashes, and it comes off pretty easy</li>
            <li>I would only use three coats for a special occasion but, on a daily basis one or two coats works well too.</li>
            <li>since my lashes are already extremely long that i didn&#x27;t see such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough - even to people who normally don&#x27;t wear much makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other fiber mascaras and this one is just right!  </li>
            <li>The mascara is definitely worth buying if you need to boost the look of false lashes or if you don&#x27;t have much long lashes of your own.</li>
            <li>I have super short lashes that are blonde and</li>
            <li>Mia Adora helps me have the length and look of false eyelashes,  but they&#x27;re my own natural lashes!  </li>
            <li>it definitely did make a large improvement of the length.</li>
            <li>If your lashes aren&#x27;t dark, full or long enough after the first application, I suggest putting more gel on and applying the dark coating again until your lashes are at their fullest.</li>
            <li>It comes in such a cute little box.</li>
            <li>But I started applying a little more gel in the second coat and that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.</li>
            <li>I had previously been using unique mascara.  </li>
            <li>After reading the directions, I thought it might be a bit difficult to use, but it really was just as easy as using any other mascara, but with a better end result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear coat gel.</li>
            <li>These made my lashes look much longer and thicker than regular mascara.</li>
            <li>But this mascara gives me lashes that nearly hit my brow bone.</li>
            <li>I ordered this mascara and tried it today, wow</li>
            <li>This product gave me a natural look, but it enhanced my existing lashes.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>is the Natural Fiber Lashes.</li>
            <li>However,  i didnt see much of a difference in lenghth as when i use my regular mascara.</li>
            <li>One tube of Magnifying Gel and one tube of Natural Fiber Lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Starting</li>
            <li>Made with 100% Green Tea, Paraben and SLS Free.</li>
            <li>This really works on my sparse, short lashes.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I have very short straight lashes and have always used an eyelash curler along with waterproof mascara and my lashes always stayed curled.</li>
            <li>I have lots of eye allergies and this mascara is gentle enough that it does not bother me.</li>
            <li>One thing that surprised me though, is that my eyes didnt feel irritable at all</li>
            <li>Unlike a similar product I have used, it stays on all day, but comes off much easier comparably speaking.</li>
            <li>but it never looks complete since i don&#x27;t like wearing falsies.</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive and itch with a lot of eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I only need to do one application to get long full natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>have sensitive eyes and Mia Adora</li>
            <li>I gave 3 stars because I did not get the wow factor</li>
            <li>So far, no irritation to my eyes/contacts.</li>
            <li>I also wear contacts, so I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had pretty long lashes</li>
            <li>complete rip off</li>
            <li>and I completely understand why.</li>
            <li>The formula covers well and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Thy look natural.</li>
            <li>I have short, straight lashes and this product</li>
            <li>I think my eyelashes still look natural when I use this mascara</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the volume and length this mascara added to my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>but really, I am BUSY</li>
            <li>Irritated my eyes and my eyes are far from sensitive.</li>
            <li>I believe I will just stick with my old mascara.</li>
            <li>The mascara is creamy and the fibers are feathery soft.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a month so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real girly girl and have makeup to last me for years.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the advertisement said.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes AND wear contacts.</li>
            <li>The Natural Fiber Lashes wand doesn&#x27;t have bristles.</li>
            <li>When you apply the Natural Fibers you may have excess fibers that give a clumped like look.</li>
            <li>I like the natural look.</li>
            <li>my eyes are sensitive.</li>
            <li>Not spectacular,  but ok.</li>
            <li>I instantly have full and long lashes.</li>
            <li>Took a few tries to get it how i liked it</li>
            <li>The product gives the appearance of full thick lashes - the exact look we were going for.</li>
            <li>This one is not as clumpy and thick as most.</li>
            <li>I have just used the base before and it worked great!</li>
            <li>I can get better results with my favorite mascara in less time, and less mess.</li>
            <li>I have simply said, short stubbly eyelashes and have tried for years to find a mascara that I could use right out of the box without putting layer after layer</li>
            <li>A little time consuming to apply but worth it!</li>
            <li>Curl your lashes first, follow the instructions, then let the product dry.</li>
            <li>The first few times, they looked a little gunky, but then somehow you just get better at applying.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter noticed how long and pretty my lashes looked and had to try it for herself!</li>
            <li>the only draw back is to get the full effect it takes several applications</li>
            <li>No mess when applying the fibers</li>
            <li>I wear one layer for work for a more subtle look and 3 or 4 layers when I go out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both a pricier one, and one less expensive and the Mia one takes the top post for sure.  </li>
            <li>I decided to actually read the instructions and applied the fibers for the second time to the top half of my lashes and it was glorious.</li>
            <li>The first time, you may not get the results you want, but after by the second or third try you will start seeing the results you need.</li>
            <li>In fact I just ordered a second set because I don&#x27;t want to be caught short when I start running out of my first set.</li>
            <li>I have used younique lash prior to this and this product is pretty similar.</li>
            <li>The first step is just like mascara and its applied the same, the second step is to add the fibers.</li>
            <li>I just got this today and quickly tried it, following the directions carefully.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily because it does take a little extra time (though, not too much more than normal daily mascara application)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item if you are looking for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>They are, however, naturally fairly long, but because of their color, you can&#x27;t really see that.  </li>
            <li>The fibers do flake off if you mess with them too much, or if you don&#x27;t set them well with the gel, but I didn&#x27;t find them getting into my eyes much.</li>
            <li>I have nearly non existent eyelashes, this product increased the length an volume of my lashes so much that my blonde short lashes stand out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really make  my lashes so long</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go back to normal mascara again after using this fiber mascara.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to normal mascara after using this.</li>
            <li>I HARDLY have ANY lashes, they are extremely short and very sparse, but this 3-D Mascara really did make my eyes pop out even without any eyeshadow at ALL!!!  </li>
            <li>to love is the fact that you can start your base coat with your own mascara for an even more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>As a contact lens wearer I was a little hesitant but it quickly subsided after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li>Mia Adora does say that this can be worn over your normal mascara for an even more dramatic look, but I wanted to test it alone.</li>
            <li>I have naturally dark blonde hair and light eyelashes, so these made them super dark which brought out my blue eyes!</li>
            <li>The brush shape is a little funky - the bristles on the gel wand don&#x27;t go all the way around, so I have to be careful of where on the brush is touching my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for long, and natural looking eyelashes!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dell</li>
            <li>Sometimes you want a bit more for the club or less for some other event.</li>
            <li>It leaves my eyelashes thick and full!</li>
            <li>After using up my mascara, I looked on Amazon to replace my mascara as I had moved to a different area of the country and needed a new supplier.  </li>
            <li>I recently vacationed in New Orleans where the heat index got up to 107 on some days.  </li>
            <li>If you actually already have decent lashes then this stuff is REALLY going to make them long and luscious !!!</li>
            <li>The gel tube is practically dry and the fibers go on very sparsely, which means I have to  go through the process</li>
            <li>My lashes are already pretty long naked</li>
            <li>So sad really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product as a person with short curly lashes I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a product that I really wanted to love, but unfortunately I returned it as I would consider it to be rather defective.</li>
            <li>You can really tell a differents and it feels better than fake eye lashes.</li>
            <li>In other words, those mascaras won&#x27;t be long and clean like what lash extension does.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are printed simply on the inside of the box so the outside of it looks simple and pretty.  </li>
            <li>and I had no other influences.</li>
            <li>First of a few new fiber lash products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>find that I usually have to clean my eye area up a bit after application -</li>
            <li>not bad for the price, however my comments on using that brand was &amp;#34;wow long lashes&amp;#34; with the comment following &amp;#34;your lashes look dry and flaky&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I dont have eyelashes just little ones, this product is incredibly worth it.</li>
            <li>I love dramatic yet natural looking lashes -</li>
            <li>I love how my eyelashes look both dramatic yet natural.</li>
            <li>The color is black and bold enough.</li>
            <li>The only minor problem I&#x27;ve had so far is that the little &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; you apply in &amp;#34;step 2&amp;#34; seem to end up above and below your eyelid throughout the day, but since I use a magnifying makeup mirror, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m the only one who notices.</li>
            <li>The price is not that expensive but the quality is so amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Magnifying gel and fiber lashes are NOT clumpy if you do a smooth application and lasts all day (12-16 hours at least).  </li>
            <li>I had never heard of fiber mascara but discovered it existed when I did a general search for mascara in preparation for replacing my existing mascara that was about to run out.  </li>
            <li>It is made very sturdy and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It was a nice surprise as I don‚Äôt generally wear waterproof mascara because it‚Äôs so difficult to get off, but these came off with no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The natural fiber lashes (second applicator) sheds all over and gets in your eye and burns!</li>
            <li>The Magnifying Gel looks like regular mascara except this gel separates your lashes and primes them for the Natural Fibers Lashes.</li>
            <li>and after all, the benefits are not so far from the one you can get from regular and cheaper brand like covergirl, marbelline or so.</li>
            <li>I have only used this 3D fiber lash mascara once so far</li>
            <li>Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is the complete opposite experience for me.</li>
            <li>2nd tube is called Natural Fiber Lashes.</li>
            <li>wand used in the Natural Fiber Lashes is different than the wand in the Magnifying Gel.</li>
            <li>I was also happily surprised that it does not clump, even with multiple coats.</li>
            <li>so this is not a review by a young girl who still has lots of lashes left.  </li>
            <li>In normal wear though - like to go to town or out to eat, the mascara performs well as long as you don&#x27;t cry.</li>
            <li>I have long and thick lashes now :)</li>
            <li>I honestly think they applyed it wrong.</li>
            <li>The fiber lashes are natural but are thick and full.</li>
            <li>Looks like false eyelashes, Just stunning.</li>
            <li>The results: I love the length, they don&#x27;t look like mangled spider legs and kinda give that false eyelash look.</li>
            <li>The Gel slides right on with little to no clumping.</li>
            <li>this stuff really does work...may make my eyes just a tid bit dry (contact wearer) but not enough to not use it.  </li>
            <li>I have super long dark lashes as it is.  </li>
            <li>I have short lashes, and was looking for the drama that this type of mascara promotes but it looks very natural, almost as if I&#x27;m using my regular Maybelline.</li>
            <li>The fibers are a bit messy, but nothing that doesn&#x27;t wipe right off.</li>
            <li>I tried on my left eyelash first and although the instructions clearly tell you not to get too close to your eye with the step 2 fibers, I did and got an eyeful of little fuzzy fibers.  </li>
            <li>The fibers clung to the lashes quite easily, however there was a little bit of fall out - but that is to be expected!  </li>
            <li>I was asked to try the new 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora since I have such fine, thin lashes</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put an extra heavy application on and it really gave me a normal appearance.  </li>
            <li>I love dramatic lashes</li>
            <li>can add 2 or even 3 coats for more of a dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more of a dramatic look and thought I had found it.</li>
            <li>If I sat there and played with it and applied more I would get some dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li>I was waiting for more dramatic change</li>
            <li>I love the dramatic look.</li>
            <li>If its not thick or long enough repeat.</li>
            <li>But it was actually much easier than expected to place the fibers where I actually wanted them.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that its like wearing false (and I love my falsies), but it gives me a lot of lash, enough to stop wearing falsies in the daytime and on dates.</li>
            <li>Practice is definitely the key to get the right technique down.</li>
            <li>the packaging is completely cute with the pink and white with black background, course the bottles were a bit hard to get out of the case the first time, when i did get them out</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I noticed a lot of the little fibers falling on my under eye/cheek area throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I was also say it does take a little practice at first so do not become discouraged</li>
            <li>I was also say it does take a little practice at first so do not become discouraged</li>
            <li>I have also spent a lot of money on high end mascara&#x27;s and have yet to find one that does what it says.</li>
            <li>Go back to other eye and apply large tube then</li>
            <li>The fibers give you a full and long dramatic look, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Seems to achieve the exact same result for less money.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>Easy application produces thick and long eyelashes without any  eye irritation.  </li>
            <li>used other mascaras and with my puny Asian lashes, I doubted that it would affect my lashes that much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this is any different from any other fiber lash mascara, including the much cheaper version by maybelline.</li>
            <li>Want ridiculously long, lush lashes?</li>
            <li>Wow, I was amazed at how long my lashes became with this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>with that said i found the truth a few things is  first</li>
            <li>The first few times I kept getting fibers in my eyes</li>
            <li>She had some trouble using it at first</li>
            <li>The 3D Fiber Lash is not as messy as I thought it might be and stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li>I came home later that night and added a few more coats for my night on the town, I went from long natural looking lashes to full long dramatic lashes in about ten six minutes!</li>
            <li>The tubes are silver with black writing and so far they still look brand new with no fading in sight.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that I do need to do some clean up after step two...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little clumpy but not more than most mascaras.</li>
            <li>Although it is a little spendy, it lasts a long time and is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>and wow my eyelashes were long!</li>
            <li>for the top lashes, I practiced on my 7 years old daughter, her 9 years old brother and the &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; (sorry bae!).</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the other highly named brands of tea fiber mascara, like Younique.</li>
            <li>I take pride in my natural hair, it&#x27;s very long and all mine.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference with how long and thick my eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li>It takes time to put on as it requires multiple layers, but definitely gives quite a dramatic effect if you want to spend the time putting many layers on.</li>
            <li>It really lengthened my lashes and gave them a slightly fuller appearance.  </li>
            <li>I would much rather do this than get extensions put on , faster, less money</li>
            <li>Concentrate on lashes about half way up straight to the tips.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;base and finishing mascara&amp;#34; part of this set is not thick, or nearly wet and sticky enough to hold and build the fibers correctly.</li>
            <li>It could also be that I&#x27;m applying them too late and letting &amp;#34;step 1&amp;#34; dry too quickly so the fibers have nothing to stick to!</li>
            <li>I suffer from abnormally short sparse lashes that are weak as heck but for some reason strong enough to fight any curling mechanism known to man.  </li>
            <li>The magnifying gel applicator really allows for the separation of the lashes which subsequently causes less clumping.</li>
            <li>The wet lashes grabbed every little fiber they could off of the wand, making my lashes look even more volumous (but honestly, a little too clumpy).  </li>
            <li>As much as I paid I was hoping for a product that lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic makes lashes look long and clean, yet it makes lashes look like thick threads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hard to get off, but worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Not sure if its worth the money only because if you love long thick lashes you have to keep applying &amp; building up your lashes, which may lead to little fibers flaking &amp; ending up all over your face by the end of the day..</li>

            <li> Just need more practice to be perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for the best mascara and length lengthing product and this was better than Younique.</li>
            <li> I really liked this eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a process, but they look nice on!</li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara!</li>
            <li> Like I said, It&#x27;s Great! :) ...</li>
            <li> Very nice worked good.</li>
            <li> I am SURE glad I did!!!  </li>
            <li> Gives nice length and volume for a good price!</li>
            <li> Well worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> This 3D fiber lash mascara from Mia Adora is truly amazing and has gave me hope I could have beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever use!!</li>
            <li> Easy and beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li> I was truly impressed how easy it was to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, you just have to learn how it works best for you.</li>
            <li> It was also very easy to remove with a make up cleansing cloth!</li>
            <li> I was impressed that she would call me directly, and as a result, I chose to let everyone know that I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> Works good but when putting it on the fibers fall in ur eye and burn</li>
            <li> good  100%</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of any good reason why the spring is there.</li>
            <li> instead it&#x27;s just as good and lasts wayyyy longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lengthens and thickens about as good as Covergirl Bombshell, but it is a lot easier to get off.  </li>
            <li> The mascara colors them well, and thickens them a good bit.</li>
            <li> The product is good.</li>
            <li> so this is a good solution.</li>
            <li> It is really good.</li>
            <li> After step three, things are good and stay put until end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> case you need to separate your lashes after application but over all good product</li>
            <li> For the price point a good choice if you&#x27;re not looking to spend a lot.</li>
            <li> That can also be a good thing you don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off during the day.</li>
            <li> but hey the price is fair as it lasts all day until you take it off.</li>
            <li> Good product, does lengthen and thicken the lashes without using the fibers.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gina C.</li>
            <li> Switched from another brand, this was not as good.</li>
            <li> They looked just as good before and after.</li>
            <li> Loved itt and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Speedy shopping and good quality.</li>
            <li> good product.  </li>
            <li> loved this product and will continued ordering from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Younique</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  </li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> For me, a good buy.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you want people to notice how beautiful and sexy lashes you have.</li>
            <li> was impressed with my finished look and with just one full coat (all three steps equals one coat)</li>
            <li> I would assume my lashes will get longer and even more beautiful</li>
            <li> Thank you, sweet, wonderful angel of beauty.</li>
            <li> I dont deal with irritation in the eyes, and it also gives a wonderful full look.</li>
            <li> The mascara set comes in a beautiful box, satin lined, just stunning.</li>
            <li> Amazing result and amazing company!</li>
            <li> :) it arrived before time and it works great! :)</li>
            <li> Packaging is exceptional.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it is the cheapest out of all the ones i have tried, which makes it that much better!</li>
            <li> Also, the merchant is very good with follow up e-mails to see if I was happy along with a mini makeup help download which is very helpful!</li>
            <li> The tube of mascara and fibers came in a very cute packaging as shown.</li>
            <li> Younique&#x27;s gel is thicker(makes for more clumps), also gives that spider legs appearance and the brush comes in a wavy pattern which is great, but softer bristles(so</li>
            <li> and so I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Great mascara - does what it says, but it takes many coats to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed so far and the packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> However, I am very pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li> I am more than happy with it</li>
            <li> Adds great length,  like this product way better than Younique .</li>
            <li> My lashes look great and it lasts most of the day</li>
            <li> It makes this penny pincher want to spend every penny on it for gorgeously gorgeous lashes that *everyone* compliments... because you&#x27;re worth it!!!</li>
            <li> It works fantastic and makes my eye lashes look gorgeous!</li>
            <li> As you can see from the pictures, it does a great job of coating my lashes and makes them very full.  </li>
            <li> now i am up to 3 and what a huge difference!!</li>

            <li> This gives me amazing results.</li>
            <li> A great PLUS is that this product is available for a price lower than Younique.</li>
            <li> I think it looks amazing on both of our eyes</li>
            <li> I get amazing results with that one.</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs amazing.</li>
            <li> Looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara the best but wanted to find one that mimics real lash extension.  </li>
            <li> after I applied just a dab of coconut oil and warm water.</li>
            <li> They called to see if I liked it and how it was working.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it did extend my lashes</li>
            <li> Just use warm soap water to remove</li>
            <li> It has the wax in it, and will color lashes fairly nice just by itself.  </li>
            <li> It stayed on nicely all day and didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> am buying my own soon.</li>
            <li> Now if it stayed on my lashes, I&#x27;d  be thrilled.</li>
            <li> i received this prosuct at a promotional price to give my honest opinion..</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> But it does make it longer than my own lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest here</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara on a discount for giving my honest opinion on the product.</li>
            <li> Let me just say I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and will be using it again.</li>
            <li> They came nicely packaged from the company and the results on my eyelashes is (as my co-workers say) luscious.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m picky about mascara brushes) and it has a nice suction-type feel coming out of the tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I am loving this, and I look forward to using it each morning.</li>
            <li> but she is loving the result.</li>
            <li> I received these products at a reduced price to test and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Every time I have worn this on my eyes I am always given compliments which is always nice.</li>
            <li> and it looks nice sitting on my vanity</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice case and the tubes feel like metal.</li>

            <li> Great product, easy to use with adorable packaging.</li>
            <li> Practice makes perfect but what I can tell you this is a great alternative to eye lash extensions, but the same fantastic result !</li>

            <li> Very easy to apply and take off.</li>

            <li> This mascara is great to achieve a nice full eyelash to top of your look.</li>
            <li> love this, way better than younique!</li>
            <li> look!!&lt;br /&gt;I find that Midora goes on smoother, right amount of fiber, and does not migrate to skin surrounding eyes!!!  </li>
            <li> But the best part is the fact that the instructions are clearly printed on the inside lid.</li>
            <li> When I use a mascara that has its own thickening and lengthening features to it, it seems to provide much better coverage than the mascara included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and it is still the most amazing mascara ever.</li>
            <li> This was by far the best deal i have gotten yet.</li>
            <li> On top of that it is so amazing.</li>
            <li> Everyone said they liked it better.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> The packaging though, was frayed and ripped and just not in the best condition, which clearly didn&#x27;t effect the product, but wanted to note it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a professional 53 year that still enjoys trying to look her best for her age.</li>
            <li> Most amazing product I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but when I put on the Mia Adora...bammm I had the most amazing longest looking eye lashes....</li>
            <li> It was easy as pie!</li>
            <li> So easy!  </li>
            <li> It came on time and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts all day, but washes off with ease too!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have become very fine &amp; sparse, but with the Mia Adora Fiber Lash Mascara</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love it and get many, many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara!  </li>
            <li> love love love it!</li>
            <li> but for special occasions &amp; date nights, it&#x27;s a good product..</li>
            <li> Also, the company is amazing and really makes an effort to make sure you are happy with your product.</li>
            <li> My first experience was great.  </li>
            <li> I‚Äôm so happy I did because I‚Äôm not a fake lashes girl.</li>
            <li> You know me if it looks to good to be true</li>
            <li> Super easy and great results</li>
            <li> It has rubber rings in the finger holes that make it very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Overall is a great price for this kind of mascara!</li>
            <li> Amazing results, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day, it removes easily, as they state that it would, with warm water.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> Love the mascara; it is easy to apply, great results, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It does take a minute to apply but it is worth it especially on a special night out.</li>
            <li> I do love the mascara though as it does somewhat lengthen the lashes on its own and curls my lashes just fine.</li>
            <li> Its ok not as Good as original one but not bad!</li>
            <li> my lashes were huge!</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m a HUGE stickler for clumpy lashes!</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Apply mascara on top.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments from customers and coworkers.</li>
            <li> I love it......</li>
            <li> they make your eyes pop :)</li>
            <li> I think I do better with reg mascara than with this product quite frankly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still deciding if I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> Love the product will reorder.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much better then</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product I have for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great, really boosts your lashes.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ve lost too many.</li>
            <li> This product lasts longer and is much better to apply.  </li>
            <li> My real lashes has grown out more, making the 3D fibers look great with each use.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> They all love it.</li>
            <li> These 3D fiber lashes are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I feel the most this product did was add volume</li>
            <li> so i was really pleased with that.</li>
            <li> More so than with my go to mascara.</li>
            <li> It adds more volume than L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic because of the crumbs.  </li>
            <li> This time, it was even better.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it looks.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to seal the lashes well or they can flake off and irritate the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Anyways.. I absolutely LOVE my Mia</li>
            <li> You will love this product</li>
            <li> You can apply as many coats as you want to achieve your desired length and fullness.</li>

            <li> Ok, ok...</li>
            <li> The Too Faced version of this was much better.  </li>
            <li> Ive used cheaper ones that worked better.</li>
            <li> but after some time she was able to build the look she wanted.</li>

            <li> I gave 5 star because i love the product...</li>
            <li> Before im using another brand famous brand but it doest have the result like this 3d fiber lash.</li>

            <li> Really enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> I truly love this mascara.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li> Another thing that i love is that it doesn&#x27;t clump or smuge.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not that skilled and have had no problems with it</li>
            <li> so it looks more appealing.</li>
            <li> I really love this 3d fiber mascara......</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I would think the gel would have more in it.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who like me has almost no eyelashes ... will be purchasing :-)</li>
            <li> It does provide some length to your eyelashes and well as volume for sure</li>
            <li> I noticed that the effects are greater if you apply 2 coats of fiber lashes instead of just one coat.  </li>
            <li> and so glad I don&#x27;t have to pay for eyelash extensions!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I do feel that the yonuinque lasts longer as I am almost needing to order more already of Mia brand.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better ones.  </li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed for my first go-around with a Fiber Lash mascara.  </li>
            <li> It subsided after a while, when I was able to blink them out.  </li>
            <li> When I sit in front of my mirror and take my time - it looks a lot better than when I am rushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara--</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best mascara I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li> Most important this WORKS!</li>
            <li> my lashes were touching my eyelids</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara and agree that it&#x27;s a better, cheaper, and faster alternative to applying falsies.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to spend more time to practice it.</li>
            <li> And the best of all: after buying the first kit, they sent me another one as a way to thank me for buying it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, my eyelashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure buying mascara</li>
            <li> Love this mascara...works better than my MAC</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara because I had tried the Younique Brand and didn&#x27;t love it like</li>
            <li> love the mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara</li>
            <li> I love this mascara...</li>
            <li> i love them</li>
            <li> and I did apply the gel more than once to get the desired look, but when I was done my lashes were FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> I love fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> You will need to make sure that there is no mascara in your eye at all when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> Never used a 3D lash product before but love the way my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I must say I love it.</li>
            <li> I do apply 2 coats of the gel before applying fibers for a more luxurious look.  </li>
            <li> and now i Love the 3d mascara</li>
            <li> It was OK..</li>
            <li> All of my friends love it.</li>
            <li> Not completely terrible, but I still use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara....</li>
            <li> update: sent me a free set just because!</li>
            <li> I love how they make my lashes pop.  </li>
            <li> If I keep practicing, I should be able to get longer lashes.</li>
            <li> This product allows for instant volume and most importantly awesome length!!</li>
            <li> You follow the instructions of putting the gel on to your eyelashes with about 15 strokes to make sure it&#x27;s on evenly.</li>
            <li> I am getting so many compliments.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many of my friends using the younique brand and their lashes look like how mine did when I used the cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t so cute.</li>
            <li> Love this brand.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments ever since I started using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sure to please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did build length better than any mascara product that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I believe this product is better all around.</li>
            <li> I had the lovely opportunity to try out the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More so for curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I guarantee it will get better with time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> This seems okay.</li>
            <li> Happy to have the real deal.</li>
            <li> Love this product, went from shabby to chic</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :) :)</li>
            <li> Love my lashes</li>

            <li> This is a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> I really love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay - I don&#x27;t seem to get the results they show.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> you need to make sure you wipe the top of the brush off.  </li>
            <li> I also tend to focus more on the outer corners for a flared look.</li>
            <li> Also it lasted most of the day for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I like! :)</li>
            <li> I applied the product 3 times on each side to achieve my desired look and then applied mascara on top of that.  </li>
            <li> Love this, have not had any problems like some of the users.  </li>
            <li> Seriously glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I personally think easier on your own lashes!!!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> It did great my lashes where much longer..</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes longer and gave more volume</li>
            <li> Maybelline has better alternatives for under $10.</li>
            <li> This was simple and looked great after a couple practice rounds - didn&#x27;t flake off!</li>
            <li> The price is so much better than the name brand.</li>
            <li> I love the way my eye lashes look fuller and longer.  </li>
            <li> how much more it opens up your eyes without it looking clumpy or overdone.</li>
            <li> Love this 3D mascara.</li>
            <li> And quite frankly I think it looks a lot better</li>
            <li> If you have never used a 3D Fiber Lash Mascara reading the reviews and product information will probably leave you with more questions than answers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora.</li>
            <li> hope you enjoyed this review.</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> it will just make them more voluminous and long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I definitely love mascara.</li>
            <li> Too many steps in the process.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing extensions on my top lashes for years now, finding a mascara that matches the volume and length for my lower lashes is a challenge.</li>
            <li> I use Mia Adorable mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li> but I read the reviews on this and took a chance that it was better.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear into the pool!  :)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Have gotten much better fiber mascara at sephora at a better price.  </li>
            <li> Younique product is much better</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying this kind of mascara, but I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> So much fuller and longer!!!!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a year now since I stopped and had been using various lash growing serums which worked wonderfully but didn&#x27;t give my lashes that nice, full look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not smudge easily!  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and customer service was prompt in checking up to make sure I was satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s and my lashes are becoming more and more sparse.  </li>
            <li> It is nice for a special occasion but not for every day.</li>
            <li> I also love how I can easily wash it off and it&#x27;s easy on my lashes :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> Received at discount for review, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried, makes my lashes beautiful and long.</li>
            <li> But I had great success with my very first use.</li>
            <li> On the first attempt, I got a good result.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with how full my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I tried the Younique brand for my first fiber lash product, in comparison to that, I feel this is just as good.  </li>
            <li> Long beautiful lashes!</li>
            <li> My lashes have thinned out and now they look the best they have in a long time</li>
            <li> I have another brand which is pretty good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited I bought them!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and my lashes and my eyes look better than ever.</li>
            <li> The quality is outstanding, and it was so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and in a nice carrying case.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to remove any mistakes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use love the way my lashes look it looks as if I&#x27;m wearing lash extensions.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is free of so many things I try to avoid.  </li>
            <li> One of the things I really like about this is it is a buildable product, as in you can literally use as much as you want &amp; it still looks great!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great so far!</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply and my lashes look amazing</li>
            <li> - but the plus side is that means they clean up easily off your face at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> Upon first try, the mascara clumped up really easily, but after using the product 3-4 more times (&amp; got more practice!)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, no fibers in my eyes, and they look fantastic - definately switching.</li>
            <li> The application is smooth, I love the brush and packaging,fast shipping, and this mascara has not caused any eye irritation or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and this product works great for me.</li>
            <li> This product does a better job at keeping the eyelashes separated/looking full, however Younique does a MUCH better job at making the eyelashes look longer.  </li>
            <li> The most important step Is to curl your eyelashes before applying.</li>
            <li> I was contacted to review this product for free, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, the more practice you have, the better it looks.</li>
            <li> so far that&#x27;s also worked great.  </li>

            <li> I decided to try out Mia Adora because the price was pretty amazing</li>
            <li> i liked it A LOT when i first got it.</li>
            <li> have found the first step of this product does not work as well as if I use my own mascara with it.</li>
            <li> I use a layer of my own mascara underneath first.</li>
            <li> It is an absolutely fine mascara.</li>
            <li> , I had to remove the mascara and fibers because they were still on my lashes, and still looked perfectly fine.</li>

            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I love the bold effect of my lashes</li>
            <li> Shipping came in quick, too!</li>
            <li> After trying this mascara, I&#x27;ll say that I&#x27;m pretty well pleased, and very excited to use it again -- in the fall and winter.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it is easily washed off when I was ready to remove it.</li>
            <li> This is the best Mascara I ever had hands down!</li>
            <li> I am a huge makeup junkie</li>
            <li> HUGE BUMMER</li>
            <li> monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li> I ordered this from a promotional event and got it free to try.</li>
            <li> You need to follow directions precisely.</li>
            <li> and I can get the same results with Maybelline great las.  </li>
            <li> I also own the competitor&#x27;s product that costs around 10x as much.</li>
            <li> I also received this product free or discounted from the company for a review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better success with Younique.</li>
            <li> It worked Wonderfulllllll no clumping smooth transition</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product and the price is so cheap for such fantastic results.</li>
            <li> When on smoothly,  didn&#x27;t clump, lasted.</li>
            <li> Tried a lot of times following instructions but never got great results.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of these fiber lashes and this one is the best one of all.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t help but wonder how this got such great reviews.</li>
            <li> I received this at for free or at a reduced price in exchange a review; regardless all opinions are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing product, fast shipping, defiantly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> the mascara set glides smoothly onto my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t leave no clumps, gunk or stick my lashes together.</li>
            <li> Honestly now that I know what this product is capable of</li>
            <li> Just so you know, I did get a free fiber mascara to review this product.</li>
            <li> I finish it with a light coat of waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look fabulous.</li>
            <li> My lash is really short &amp; when i started using this, i get a lot of comments from my friends about how great my eyelash looked.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for extra volume.</li>
            <li> and afterwards they look fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It is fabulous</li>
            <li> It does what it says, overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with absolutely gorgeous lashes that still look natural and not too over-the-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such an INCREDIBLE Mascara!!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are long with volume and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I tried a similar product by recommendation of a friend, and although I loved how much better my lashes looked, the fibers kept getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to apply and made a big difference i will continue to purchase this product for sure!</li>
            <li> Easy to use to create beautiful, long, full eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome, so much cheaper than other brands:-)</li>
            <li> I hope my review will help you better understand if 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, cannot beat the price you pay much more at the cosmetic counters and this is that quality!</li>
            <li> My lashes look very long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I think the picture they show is a bit over dramatic of the results that you get unless you keep re applying, but you get a great full lengthy looking set of eyelashes that look beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was great at fist but its very repetitive and does do a good job.</li>
            <li> Thank you soooo much!!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but able to get the same results with my Better Than Sex mascara by Too Faced.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the eyelash curler works great, looks great, &amp; is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Ordering with Mia Adora was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Removal is super easy.</li>
            <li> The 3 step process is super easy and not time consuming at all.</li>
            <li> , I will be purchasing this again &amp; paying full price is more than worth it.</li>
            <li> (btw I was super nervous about it being waterproof, it was actually so easy to remove</li>
            <li> I LOVE my new mascara!!!</li>
            <li> All in all is was very easy to use and did make my eyelashes look very nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this mascara very much.</li>
            <li> Love it and it really works and its easy to use.  </li>
            <li> love the look it gives my lashes, easy to apply, makes lashes so much fuller</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mascara was the one thing in my beauty bag that I could never hit a happy medium with (much less love).  </li>
            <li> On the second eye I new better and with practice from my first eye my lashes looked perfect.  </li>
            <li> I have really short eye lashes and these works amazing for me!</li>
            <li> I shouldn‚Äôt have to purchase an additional product to get my money‚Äôs worth!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> If ur lashes are not to long this is a great product to lengthen ur lashes.</li>
            <li> but I am more than willing to do them because of the end result.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that i started recomending it to all my friends n coworkers!</li>
            <li> I prefer Unique.</li>
            <li> I wear mascara daily, love love LOVE the look of this product.  </li>
            <li> I definitely need more practise with this, but even on my first try, my lashes still look AMAZING!</li>
            <li> These Fiber Lashes are totally worth your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Unique 3D fiber lash mascara for over a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a but pricey but has more gel and fiber consistently coming out than another brand I was using.  </li>
            <li> Received this and was excited to try.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this</li>
            <li> I did try many  time and it does make my lash longer but to me its not so pretty looking.</li>
            <li> Be sure to curl lashes first.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about it that I gave my daughter in law some for her Birthday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and super cool.  </li>
            <li> This probably works for those that have nicer lashes but for fine and fair haired gals, I think building lashes with mascara is the only way to get the look you want.  </li>
            <li> The color is perfect black and my lashes look good all day long</li>
            <li> The springy mechanism feels quality but the handles aren&#x27;t super cushy like some other brands I looked at.</li>
            <li> It has easy to follow directions, and comes in a lovely little box that is really handy to keep them together.&lt;br /&gt;You can also build up your length with more coats to get your desired length.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with Mia Adora 3D fiber lashes and decided to buy this brand because it has natural and safe ingredients (compared to other brands).</li>
            <li> but it looks AMAZING when it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> this one-3d fiber lash works very well and is much more comfortable that youngique (spelling?)</li>
            <li> Collection by Bunny, I simply only liked their fibers and gel better then Younique.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve seen my lashes look so big and natural</li>
            <li> Much more effective than regular mascara.</li>
            <li> plus I clean houses after work five nights a week.</li>
            <li> Just dab some water on a cotton swab and clean the area.</li>
            <li> but so far I love the way it makes my lashes look!</li>
            <li> Tried Younique - loved it, so was not too excited to try another a different brand, but Younique isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;available&amp;#34; as I want it to be.  </li>
            <li> I would use it for special date night with husband.</li>
            <li> I use this for date nights or special occasions.</li>
            <li> Top with large tube&lt;</li>
            <li> Well I found just the right one!</li>
            <li> with the box, it‚Äôs a great box with a magnet that keeps the box closed.</li>
            <li> Mia Adora&#x27;s Fiber Lash Mascara, so far, has not caused any kind of irritation on my eyes</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> I should have know the comments about fiber fallout were true.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are longer, fuller and full of volume.</li>
            <li> Will order again and thank you seller for such good follow-up and resolution of the issue</li>
            <li> Overall good product</li>
            <li> You have to expend some amount of time layer after layer to get the full benefits from it</li>
            <li> As a glasses wearer, I love that my lashed are very visible and</li>
            <li> They really do make your eyelashes longer and add a lot more volume to your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much.</li>
            <li> When adding the fibers, just make sure not to get them in your eye because they do fall sometimes and it really irritates.</li>
            <li> One coat is good for the simple days</li>
            <li> this fiber lash mascara made my lashes look think and full.  </li>
            <li> I love my real nails.  </li>
            <li> I put in on the second time and loved it.</li>
            <li> It really worked I love it.</li>
            <li> It smeared so badly no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes but it extends them so much more and makes them look so much more full!</li>
            <li> was delivered quickly, have only tried it a couple of times since getting it, but it does seem good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to apply, though I&#x27;m still working on perfecting my technique.</li>
            <li> I wear mascara every day and found the first coat easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It comes in a beautiful black silk-like material lined box with a magnetic closure that makes it immediately feel luxurious.</li>
            <li> It works great just as expected!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation at all and after applying very carefully, I haven&#x27;t had any shedding from the lash booster.</li>
            <li> when I use my favorite way of combining the fiber lashes with my regular mascara, they are even more dramatic!&lt;br</li>
            <li> when I use my favorite way of combining the fiber lashes with my regular mascara, they are even more dramatic!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next time I made sure to do more of the &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; coat after applying the fibers, and that helped a lot.</li>
            <li> but now I can apply it quickly &amp; efficiently.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Sandra K.</li>
            <li> The model in the picture must have on atleast five coats-which would use it up quickly.</li>
            <li> Not complicated to apply and super quick!</li>
            <li> Definitely need practice applying it correctly but overall excellent product.</li>
            <li> The items arrived quickly and were well packaged.</li>
            <li> super clumpy &amp;#62;_&amp;#60</li>
            <li> /&gt;These micro fibers will adhere to the Magnifying Gel when applied quickly, before the Magnifying Gel dries.</li>
            <li> The company was able to send a replacement and the second was wayyyy better.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I will definitely purchase again once I run out of my initial tube.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this mascara and will be replacing my old product!!</li>
            <li> My drugstore mascaras get me results that I can enjoy just as much!</li>
            <li> Im like hello thick long lashes now :) Happy and satisfied costumer here :)</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased &amp; would recommend Mia Adora to anyone who needs the extra length &amp; thickness as I do.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes as normal, but I always wanted to see what I would look like with beautiful full eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes and when I use the mascara I loved it</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs quite large and it‚Äôs easy to accidentally hit your eyelid while applying this.</li>
            <li> Came super fast!!</li>
            <li> It came with clear instructions, products were label,  and it was easy to apply!  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes that it would be AMAZING and make my lashes appear longer than they really are.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve read so many others that really do like it very much</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I love trying new products</li>
            <li> This will be my new every day look, but I&#x27;ll still wear falsies for the occasions when I want to look extra beautiful and natural :)</li>
            <li> is that it made my real lashes strong and fuller.</li>
            <li> This is just slightly more work then normal mascara, and is worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like it... easy to apply...</li>
            <li> They are pretty simple to put on, the box does good at explains the instructions.</li>
            <li> Apply a coat of good lengthening mascara (I use Guerlain) and allow to dry.  </li>
            <li> They can look very natural with just one layer or you can go for more and glam it up.</li>
            <li> I no longer feel the need to wear falsies anymore due to this amazing mascara!</li>
            <li> and you brush that on then seal it again with the first one!</li>
            <li> If I had to put in order of use, it was Younique first, then I went looking for another brand which was CBB(used the most) and now starting to use Mia Adora more.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I think I actually prefer the Mia Adora mascara more!</li>
            <li> I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY when I tried it!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying fiber mascara, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I like it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first step mascara goes on smooth and light, and the fiber mascara sticks really well.</li>
            <li> It really does work!!</li>
            <li> It is exactly how it is advertised!  </li>
            <li> This product really does extend the lashes!!</li>
            <li> It comes off very easily with warm water, and there are no black smudges around my eyes the next morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super easy to apply for a first timer and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> If I had to make one change it would be to make it a little bit more of a curve to fit the eye better.</li>
            <li> I only use one application of the gel and fibers as instructed, followed by my mascara -- amazing results.  </li>
            <li> My lashes looked amazing and my eyes looked so big!</li>
            <li> The process takes longer than I&#x27;d like, but you can end up with amazing lashes that last all day if you take the time to apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> Not only was the product amazing</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the concept of fiber mascaras and really liked the green tea fibers as they are more natural.  </li>
            <li> It took me about three days to play with the wand and to remember to put the clear gel on to seal the fibers on (I would get side-tracked and would forget) that I really noticed that it would look amazingly thicker.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product- it takes a few practice runs to get the hang of it, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> They have an amazing customer service who contact you the entire way of your process.</li>
            <li> i love the fact there marked 1,2,3, then the trial of the lashes i</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on here</li>
            <li> But using this product has given me better eyelashes than ever, including when I was young.</li>
            <li> I feel more natural with fibers then with individuals.</li>
            <li> but it was worth the practice.</li>
            <li> worth the $</li>
            <li> i just don&#x27;t think its as good as i had expected.</li>
            <li> Why is it that they always seem to have the long, beautiful, natural lashes?</li>
            <li> So since I&#x27;m having problems with the glue the fibers get in my eyes more frequently.</li>
            <li> The product is great, and I have not gone back to my old mascara and never plan</li>
            <li> This product was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat time consuming, about 5 minutes for me, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> i liked because it work at the same they show on the picture</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara because it really gives your lashes instant length.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money and</li>
            <li> I noticed her lashes are longer and look more natural with this mascara.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Take your time in applying the steps and the result worth it.</li>
            <li> just moisten them with warm water, and then they wash off just like regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> So far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> However, at over $20 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> The last step makes the fibers appear like my own lashes and smooths the clumping if any.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus it came it a classic container for easy storage.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please remember this is my own personal opinion &amp; not all of you will agree.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve included a photo to give you a better idea of what the Natural Fiber look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> loving the outcome overall.</li>
            <li> I also the love the fact that this mascara is made with natural ingredients,paraben free,and is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had to wait to write a review because i wanna see just how effective this is based on a daily wear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do well with false lashes so these are a great alternative!</li>
            <li> it didnt irritate my eyes which is good because my eyes are sensitive and it blends right in with my natural eyelashes..would def recommend</li>
            <li> I have never been more pleased with any other mascara.</li>
            <li> Through my own personal experience with applying this mascara, I&#x27;ve discovered that long, slow strokes work best for me :).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many high end mascaras that claim to do the same thing that cost a lot more money.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as good as my other brand.</li>
            <li> But in order to achieve lashes as long as the picture, many applications fo the product are needed!</li>
            <li> Okay for special occasions but not something I will keep up daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about getting the right stroke.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need it right then.  </li>
            <li> and it swipes right off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced right also.</li>
            <li> so you get the fibers on right.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m just OCD about it looking right).</li>
            <li> Right now I would recommend this product and promote this brand.</li>
            <li> Received today and tried it right away..</li>
            <li> I just got this today and had to try it right away.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple times of using to get the right effect and results.</li>
            <li> but I caught on right away</li>
            <li> Another thing I could not stand was the Younique seemed to make my eyes itchy &amp; with this my eyes feel fine, just like if I was using a normal mascara.</li>
            <li> I like that its easy to put on, and the color looks very natural...</li>
            <li> I have to say  as big PRO that last for the all day, no messy and the best that made it superior to any other mascara use before, it is when you washed it</li>
            <li> Then after waiting 20 seconds for the fibers to dry you add more of the gel to seal them in place and voila!</li>
            <li> It really does give the full look shown.</li>
            <li> you love your lashes, like the natural look, don&#x27;t have time to apply lashes (individuals or strips) daily, love emphasizing your eyes, then this is the 3D lash mascara for you.</li>
            <li> but it gives you full and long lashes and so easy to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also liked how long they were.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and that means I have fine light eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably tried almost every main brand of mascara and normally have a routine of having to use more then one mascara to get the look I want, but this mascara makes it</li>
            <li> I am now a committed and faithful user and will highly recommend this product to other women who desire beautiful eye lashes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> IT looks great when applied properly my lashes look super think and long.</li>
            <li> I have always had beautiful lashes, but the older one gets the less you have, well for all of you ladies who are experiencing what I have do not hesitate!</li>
            <li> My mother loves the 3D lashes, she got it right on the first try.</li>
            <li> First you add step on and right after you add step 2</li>
            <li> Also, I was surprised at how easy the mascara washed off with my face wash and water.</li>
            <li> Love my Mia Dora fiber lash kit very natural looking and brings out my beauty highly recommend it for all women.  </li>
            <li> All sometimes irritates after long wear, but using 3D Fibers has been much better than individuals, a lot cheaper, and more natural attraction.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how this Mascara makes such a difference on ones face and can bring out your eyes so much and make you feel so pretty.  </li>
            <li> and I love how the directions are right on box as soon as you open it.</li>
            <li> (Right eye, top lashes first, then left eye top lashes, followed by right eye bottom lashes, and finally left eye bottom lashes).  </li>
            <li> magnifying gel is very gentle.  </li>
            <li> u guy very much...</li>
            <li> She loves this product very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very gentle on my eyes-</li>
            <li> While the product wasn&#x27;t great their customer service was, so while I would say steer clear of this product I would say give other products from the company a chance.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and so dramatically effective; I&#x27;ll never go back to regular mascara again.  </li>
            <li> Lasts long, removes very easily, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Its simple quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I personally found this super easy to apply, Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The fibers go on with little to no mess and when you apply the last coat of gel the magic starts to come together and pow your eyelashes go from fair to fab!</li>
            <li> Layering different mascara adds little more length and good volume.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little while to apply, But lets be real if you want to look your best when it comes to makeup the last thing you want to do is rush!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on special occasions and it works just as expected and makes my eyelashes fuller and more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product‚Ä¶I have very short wispy lashes and my bottom lashes are virtually non-existent.  </li>
            <li> If you want to give it an additional boost, you can use your favorite traditional mascara‚Ä¶</li>
            <li> Takes a cpl mins more than just regular mascara</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews first before buying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than those big brand name mascara.</li>
            <li> I get double again the length with one of my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li> When I first used the enclosed mascara, I noticed it was quite a bit drier than my holy grail mascara.  </li>
            <li> Lashes appear thicker and longer exactly as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this Mascara at a very deep discount to give a review.</li>
            <li> This leaves your lashes pretty and flair;not clumped together.</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> It works better if you apply a regular mascara before the first coat of gel &amp; fibers.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> but this is pretty close.</li>
            <li> I can achieve better results with standard prestige mascara.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use fiber lash mascara but do see a difference.</li>
            <li> Overall I like this brand better,</li>
            <li> It has fibers that you apply, then you cover that with another coat of the first tube to &#x27;seal&#x27; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only concern is that it takes so many cost to finish the process</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be a continued customer.</li>
            <li> I have use a lot of mascaras, this one makes your eyelashes a lot longer and not fake</li>
            <li> I used my first brand up and wanted to try this brand to see the difference.</li>
            <li> im Definitely getting more after it&#x27;s done</li>
            <li> It REALLY works!  </li>
            <li> Tricky at first</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product overall.</li>
            <li> I YouTubed several videos of several different brands and felt Mia would be my best option.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this it was an OMG moment.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the fullness, but I am completely satisfied with the final results.</li>
            <li> It comes in a pretty box and is two steps to apply.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> So much better than regular mascara...</li>
            <li> make sure you wash it off at the end of the night because if you leave it on you might end up with fibers in your eyes the next morning and its not too comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It really does extend the eyelashes!</li>
            <li> The first night I used it, he was like, &amp;#34;WOW</li>
            <li> This is the first fiber lash mascara I&#x27;ve tried and I like the results.</li>
            <li> I get better results from regular mascara!</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> First time I tried it</li>
            <li> I have never purchased a mascara before that came in such an elegant package.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of makeup remover cleanser and hot water.</li>
            <li> younique was just better in my personal comparison).</li>
            <li> Lasher are much longer and thicker!  </li>
            <li> You use the longer tube first.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical about buying it but moonstruck is worth the price .  </li>
            <li> The best part is, they don&#x27;t look fake at all.  </li>
            <li> Overall an okay product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying 2 to 3 rounds of the gel and fiber and it extends my lashes pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The end result was not any better than regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly the look</li>
            <li> My mom tried it, too and this is the first mascara EVER that didn&#x27;t cause her issues.</li>
            <li> I will not reorder this product and suggest the Younginque product to someone interested in trying out a Fiber Mascara.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to enhance their lash look!</li>
            <li> Then I coat it with the first step mascara again to keep the fibers in place.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> I first started with clumpy lashes</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try for the first time when you are heading to work and on a time crush.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast also!</li>
            <li> You could do one layer or several of coats to add more drama.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t count on all those five star stellar reviews.</li>
            <li> Yes, I kept the box because it&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> It is my first experience with this type of product.</li>
            <li> The first is called Magnifying Gel.</li>
            <li> but I did such a better job on her&#x27;s that I&#x27;m going to use her before and after and after photo as my example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It does seem to work better if you apply one coat of your regular mascara first then first coat of gel.</li>
            <li> I have tried another similar product and this one performs better.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I jumped the gun and skimmed the instructions the first time I put the 3D Fiber Lashes by Mia Adora on.</li>
            <li> I did exactly what it said not to do, which was to put the fibers too close to your eye ball.</li>
            <li> The first time  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the discount!</li>
            <li> I posted a video of me using the product and after one layer of coating you can really see the difference!</li>
            <li> They definitely look longer and more &amp;#34;luscious&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I had tried any of the fiber lash mascaras</li>
            <li> Love this 3D fiber lash mascara and wish I discovered it earlier.</li>
            <li> You could do one layer or several of coats to add more drama.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm for me the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and I have to say my paltry old lashes really looked thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> this makes my very short lashes long, I love it!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for special occassions when you want a little extra BAM to your gorgeous eyes!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this product and read about the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Work great, leaves your eye lashes twice as long as before you put it on and stays pretty all day long.</li>
            <li> However, the step 1 applicator was dried up and barely coated my lashes no matter how many strokes I brush, resulting in the step 2 not being effective because they will not adhere.</li>
            <li> I used everyday and all my friends say that really natural and great.</li>
            <li> I really like short bristles on the mascara applicator wand for more control.  </li>
            <li> I used to wear lash extensions which I loved but after a year started getting tired of the monthly upkeep, plus it wasn&#x27;t exactly cheap.</li>
            <li> its ok, What i really like about the mascara is that can last all day.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best 3D fiber mascara out there, People ask me if I&#x27;m warring false lashes</li>
            <li> It really works love how the mascara set gives me eyelashes that extra boost and volume!</li>
            <li> I love how much of a difference it made &amp; I only applied two coats.</li>
            <li> The mascara makes my lashes gorgeous, especially since I have skimpy Asian lashes.</li>
            <li> I have very fine short lashes, and this makes my lashes look long and full!</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s started to run out (pretty fast)</li>
            <li> I have relatively long lashes already so was looking for something giving me more volume.</li>
            <li> When I use the first stick the stick doesn&#x27;t have as much glue on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product and although I don&#x27;t planning on wearing it every day due to time, I will definitely wear it when I want to impress.</li>
            <li> but this one I love my eyelashes look long</li>
            <li> When I do apply the fibers, I work on one eye at a time because the mascara dries pretty fast and the fibers need to attach to the mascara to stay put before I apply another coat of the mascara to seal in the fibers.  </li>
            <li> The first one I received didn&#x27;t have much product in the gel portion or the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> This product is superior to the 3D lashes from Younique that I have ordered in the past.  </li>
            <li> They look like my own eyelashes only long, full and beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone who has been struggling with finding the right product for their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> such a surprise i have never tried fiber lashes and went this cant be true!</li>
            <li> This is such a cool product!</li>
            <li> Love how long it makes my lashes look!</li>
            <li> I love how long it makes my lashes!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much of the fiber, curl your lashes first and be ready to separate them with a lash brush or comb to avoid any clumps.</li>
            <li> The Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lashes went on easily - just follow the simple steps in the product guide.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to remove, unlike regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve used dollar brands, so this is a nice upgrade.</li>
            <li> However, it is easy to remove with my facial wash and it does not burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to try the lash mascara, but seems easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product first on clean lashes and it looked like regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> i dnt have long thick lashes so this 3d fiber mascarra is so perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Only thing that worried me was the strong odor.</li>
            <li> Only thing is getting over the strong smell</li>
            <li> The first tube that you use is also kind of messy</li>
            <li> I would like a little less clumpy but that would be perfect mascara that I don&#x27;t think exists yet</li>
            <li> I had previously used a different brand of 3D Fiber lashes and loved them, so I was excited when I saw a decent price on this product.  </li>
            <li> I think the manufacturer&#x27;s description is accurate and, like other reviewers noted, you get the hang of the application procedure pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am not trying for a fake-lash-catwalk look, but those who want that will certainly get it with this product.  </li>
            <li> Large tube, put 15-20 strokes on one eye&lt;</li>
            <li> I was genuinely impressed by how long it made my lashes, but after using the product for about 2-3 weeks the natural fibers dried up.</li>
            <li> it looks very pretty and natural.  </li>
            <li> I went back and coated the fibery lashes with one more coat of the mascara - and WOW!  </li>
            <li> My lashes are fine and short.</li>
            <li> I was very thrilled when I got the chance to try this 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora, as it&#x27;s as good as putting on false eyelashes, if not better.</li>
            <li> for extra volume top with your favorite mascara (Mine is Cinique High Impact Extreme Volume)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice in a little box.</li>
            <li> I have used so many other mascaras and not had the same affect as this one does so easily to apply.  </li>
            <li> I love fiber lashes and not too long ago discovered them!!!  </li>
            <li> Not only does it make my eyelashes look amazing but saving $300 on eyelash extensions with the same result couldn&#x27;t make me happier.</li>
            <li> My lashes are light and scarce, but farely long and the first time I used it</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, I had to clean up a few of the fibers in my waterline but</li>
            <li> I can really see the huge difference between a regular mascara and a 3D mascara.</li>
            <li> and it does take a bit longer to apply than regular mascara, but really does make a huge difference when I do.</li>
            <li> i am the person who wants to know the truth,</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, makes your eyes pop , but product was soso.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really amazed me to see my lashes curl up ...</li>
            <li> and I am very picky with products and brands I use on and around my eye area.</li>
            <li> I really reall like it....</li>
            <li> I spend too much time applying make up as it is.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> They look real.</li>
            <li> and you really want some added length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a wee bit uneasy about taunt spring aimed straight at my eye.</li>
            <li> And i wouldn&#x27;t really have minded that had i felt it made a drastic improvement.</li>
            <li> If it bothers you too much, I recommend holding a tissue or oil sheet under your eye to catch any fibers that don&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li> They really did look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more!t wear much makeup.  </li>
            <li> That was very helpful for me.&lt;br /&gt;Mia</li>
            <li> But i started experimenting, and the ebook they send you really does help with giving you some tips and techniques to try.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well.</li>
            <li> I prefer to remove my eye makeup with coconut oil since it soothes my skin/eye-lids and this mascara wiped off really well</li>
            <li> so, I guess my eyes really stand out once I apply things like eyeshadow and shape my eyebrows well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mia Adora</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleases with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!!&lt;br /&gt;Ashley</li>

            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li> I do notice fall out during the day but that could be my fault for applying too much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> oh so real on youth eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is NOT waterproof, and can&#x27;t really survive a nap or roll in the hay-</li>
            <li> It might not work well for contact lens wearers though - the fibers might be a real issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore my Mia Adora.</li>
            <li> Really see the difference immediately</li>
            <li> The fibers did not come off in my eyes, even during intense gym workouts.</li>
            <li> I really like this fiber lashes made my eye really stand out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasts all day until I&#x27;m ready to remove at night.</li>
            <li> I was really truly expecting.</li>
            <li> I really like the 3D lash mascara...</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look much fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> This stuff really lengthens and plumps lashes.</li>
            <li> This really does work and enables my zero lashes to appear as if falsies.  </li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I budget 10 minutes in for my whole morning routing</li>
            <li> you have ever used the Younique Fiber Lashes, I would say this product is very compareable.  </li>
            <li> This product made my lashes look much longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> it comes with the box which is very fancy and neat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loooooved this mascara...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> it makes my real lashes look longer without the clumpiness&lt;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> too much of stress for a mascara</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s going to purchase thanks for this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks again, Tammy</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Really liking it.</li>
            <li> These fiber lash mascara truly does make your lashes so much longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t really exist.</li>
            <li> Then apply the fibers just as much as the gel, which is about 15 strokes.</li>
            <li> Cant believe there my lashes finally a real mascara.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money on it while perfecting the look of the lashes.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t let myself spend that much on a 3D mascara as I&#x27;m novice to using it.</li>
            <li> it really lengthens and thickens my lashes</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking to spruce up their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It really thickens my lashes.</li>
            <li> all, I really like this mascara and the concept.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like it isn&#x27;t even applying, and then the fibers don&#x27;t seem to really come off of the wand.  </li>
            <li> Does not last throughout the day, initially looks great but just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> - These are going to take some getting used to, but they were MUCH easier than I feared.</li>
            <li> I never wanted to spend much money on makeup</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t tell the makers, but I would pay 3x as much for this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I could see the differenceand they&#x27;re want much of one..</li>
            <li> no matter how much of the gel I use.</li>
            <li> It has lasted much longer &amp; I will continue to order this</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference in the way that my eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Over the years my lashes have become much thinner.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I would and do highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to try one.</li>
            <li> but I think that is to be expected with as many coats as I used.</li>
            <li> really like the look that the mascara gives you and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was very noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Kudos to the seller: fast delivery&lt;</li>
            <li> is very helpful to see tips.</li>
            <li> If you want to save on 3D mascara, I highly recommend Mia adora!</li>
            <li> will really see a difference.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to.</li>
            <li> And, you basically can choose how much thickness you want to add to your lashes by repeating steps.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> The fibers do sometimes get somewhat clumped up but running a lash comb through them really helps.</li>
            <li> This mascara works very well.</li>
            <li> so this product is my absolute favorite&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very blond eye lashes and using the 3D fiber lash mascara</li>
            <li> I just really like this product.</li>
            <li> and these really do make your eyelashes look</li>
            <li> lashes do look longer and much fuller after use.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product I can&#x27;t use it everyday because of the price.</li>
            <li> Warm water on a round cotton pad</li>
            <li> I personally like not using my own mascara at the start and the third time I tried the mascara</li>
            <li> I received this mascara a few days ago and i am LOVING it.</li>
            <li> This mascara works great making your lashes longer giving you that false lash impression</li>
            <li> It definitely holds up far better than the Younique in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of fiber lashes and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Nice fiber lash mascara - very similar to the ones being sold by independent distributors.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I applied only one coat that it did such a good job of coating my lashes, I haven&#x27;t even tried doing all 3 steps.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try that later this week for date night, but so far, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this.</li>
            <li> and it actually looked even more natural than with just the liner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with using false eyelashes to amp up my eye makeup, but they are time consuming and just not always appropriate for all occasions for me.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to hassle with applying false lashes, this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Where I live, spring and summer are both hot and very humid.</li>
            <li> It really does add dimension to your eye lashes, It&#x27;s going to take some practice to get it just right, but I like how it looks so far</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike some of the reviewers, I applied it right from the beginning with no trouble.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and easily comes off at the end of the day with eyemakeup remover.  </li>
            <li> Love my new mascara its exactly what i expected!</li>
            <li> Most things come with very little information and leave you hanging for even the most basic instructions</li>
            <li> Love my long lashes!!!!</li>
            <li> The more you layer the product, the more of a dramatic look you will get.</li>
            <li> , the first looks that way sure the second had me stunned for a second</li>
            <li> Yayyy so excited to be using this mascara FINALLY!!</li>
            <li> I like it better than any other brand I have used before.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Youngique Fiber Lash Mascara from a distributor last Fall.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and even looks great the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can use out with my other mascara as well.</li>
            <li> Went back to original.</li>
            <li> It definitely brings significant volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have so many other mascaras that I didn‚Äôt want to spend another $30 buying some.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than other fiber lashes I have used because lash fibers don&#x27;t get in my eyes while applying and during the day.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was amazed at how long and full it made them look.</li>
            <li> Clean your make up of your eyes totally and don&#x27;t rush using the mascara.</li>
            <li> I wanted to update my review after the company actually contacted me and provided a full refund very promptly.</li>
            <li> I get so much volume and a decent amount of length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love the natural look whenever I applied lashes, but still it took too long applying individuals.</li>
            <li> I loved the dark lash, I only had to put in on once in a 8 hour day</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a great alternative to false lashes as they normally irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> am giving this a big 5 star rating because I have only positive, fantastic things to say about the Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lash Mascara Set!</li>
            <li> I usually only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> The fiber addition is not as thick or as long as I&#x27;ve experienced but overall great improvements to my thin and light lashes.</li>
            <li> Great product, a bit unusual to apply at first, but the results speak for themselves,  no flakes and big, long, full, thick lashes.</li>
            <li> Mia Adora&#x27;s gel is not as thick(makes for less clumps), the brush bristles are firmer causing to straighten out your lashes keeping them from clumpingm and head is more straight then wavy.</li>
            <li> At first I was little intimidated because of my personal experience with the Younique brand, But after applying it &amp; trying it out, I can absolutely say I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Lately I do not use the step 2 much.</li>
            <li> and this is by far, not only the most natural looking but</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that there were more than just your average mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than your average mascara though.</li>
            <li> in all a good product, needs a bit of work to learn how to use it properly, but definitely gave me bigger and longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I was truly surprised but absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, maybe not worth the money.</li>
            <li> With this product, it makes me feel beautiful every time I use it without applying fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara does what it says, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li> You can apply more or less for the look you&#x27;re trying to obtain.</li>
            <li> I love that the gel layer is black.</li>
            <li> you have to be careful with the fiber part though cause it will spill easily.</li>
            <li> These are your fibers.&lt;br /&gt;While the Magnifying Gel is still wet, apply 10-15 strokes of the Natural Fiber Lashes from mid-lash to the top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too clumpy, and on top of that a small amount of the fibers consistently fall off while you&#x27;re applying it and got into my eyes and onto my face.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> Comparable to orher name brand products in this particular category.</li>
            <li> when Im using This product I love to see how thick and long I can get my lashes, Wipes off pretty easy with make-up wipes.</li>
            <li> I personally have very short eyelashes, and with one coat of my favorite mascara and these fiber lashes, I always get the results I want.</li>
            <li> So far this product is a great alternative to the damaging false lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  need to wear  fake lashes  any more :)</li>
            <li> Overall, a great few new concept  - definitely cheaper than some of the others out there, but this is my first fiber mascara</li>
            <li> Firstly, the case itself is super fancy, a box with magnets to keep it closed and lined with silk.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone that wears mascara.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> Younique is highly overrated, and to me, does not compete with Mia Adora.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchase both inexpensive and high end makeup.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> In the videos and on the photos this particular brand shows, the ladies who are trying the mascara on already have longer than normal eyelashes</li>
            <li> Too many of the little fibers end up on my cheekbones.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the little satin-lined box that mascara comes in from Mia Adora is absolutely ADORABLE.  </li>
            <li> It opened up my eyes a little more.</li>
            <li> I have very short lashes and this has made them Really stand out!!</li>
            <li> I love the little case that contains the mascara set, but it&#x27;s kinda bulky if you plan to bring it along anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;BASE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove unlike other fiber lash mascara that required you to use a type of make up remover.</li>
            <li> This was a big deal for me because I had been using lash extensions for 4 ¬Ω years and have lost a ton of my real lashes,but you can&#x27;t tell any breakage of my real lashes thanks to my 3D lashes, I highly recommend Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lashes</li>
            <li> I really like how the instructions on how to use the product are clearly printed on the inside of the case.</li>
            <li> experience with it was that it really doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> I like using this product before I go out with my friends on weekends, but this mascara can also be used along with your normal makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I would rather use normal mascara</li>
            <li> and she normally buys a cheaper version for $8.00 and saw the difference with this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also done one layer of my regular mascara underneath the first layer of Mia Adora, and that works very well.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look so long and full</li>
            <li> I am impatient when I am applying it and don&#x27;t put on as many layers as one is advised</li>
            <li> So I was kind of naively expecting to get close to that look.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> With Mia Adora I feel like I am wearing normal mascara and can‚Äôt tell that there is a difference.</li>
            <li> I put it on  and wait a few seconds and put more at the tips of my lashes and do it again .</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;d look more voluminous than they do long.</li>
            <li> so worth the extra length that they have me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used the same brand of mascara for years and just for fun</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the extra minutes to apply.</li>
            <li> I use Latisse and Guerlain, and that is typically enough, but with the addition of this, they get mega long :)</li>
            <li> Of all the different 3D fiber lash mascaras I have tried in the past, the Mia Adora brand is vastly superior than all of them.  </li>
            <li> It also volumizes your lashes, giving them that long full look.</li>
            <li> It definitely requires time to &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; the technique with lower lashes, it&#x27;s worth it at the end!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> my lashes are pretty short and straight</li>
            <li> Good, but not great.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good alternative to false eye lashes this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> It is not the easiest to put on, but it&#x27;s not really hard either.  </li>
            <li> I found it worked better for me when I first curled my eyelashes &amp; applied my black mascara (which is only optional).  </li>
            <li> I really love this mascara, it is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> The instructions were incredibly easy to follow and application was simple enough.  </li>
            <li> So, other than the fear of a spring flinging at my eye like a tiny cosmetic medieval battering ram , this is a really good product.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes full and long and doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li> right regular mascara</li>
            <li> Makes my lashed super long</li>
            <li> They were amazing and a little different but</li>
            <li> , i wish they were water proof since i live in a rainy area where in winter it always rains</li>
            <li> Well this was definitely a new experience for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using 3D mascara</li>
            <li> I will now order their eyelash curler to compliment my new purchase.</li>
            <li> Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is my new go to mascara.  </li>
            <li> and this is now my new fav.</li>
            <li> Im new to using fiber lashes</li>
            <li> One of my favorite new beauty products in a long, long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow - they are easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t really find them messy.</li>
            <li> The next week they sent me an entire tube for free.</li>
            <li> Looks like I spent way more time than I actually have.</li>
            <li> Even the box the mascara is in is this high quality cardboard with a soft silky lining.</li>
            <li> - I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually very surprised at how well these mascaras work.</li>
            <li> This product is very natural looking</li>
            <li> It looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural in my opinion</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a very old stock.</li>
            <li> I already have lashes that are pretty full and a decent length, this did enhance them but not much more than my $7 drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li> the left of my photo are my daughter&#x27;s natural lashes and on the right are her lashes with Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara applied.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve spend so much money on special mascara promising volumized lashes</li>
            <li> I really expected these to be messy and complicated, but found them to be easy to use and look great!  </li>
            <li> but wow the compliments i get are blowing my mind away!</li>
            <li> i started off with only 2 coats of the first</li>
            <li> my eye lashes are naturally pretty big as is</li>
            <li> That said, during the cooler months when the humidity is lower, I&#x27;ll definitely be reaching for this mascara first.</li>
            <li> It has fibers that go on your lashes, that appear like hair that you apply after first priming with the larger mascara then again after fiber mascara to lock in.</li>
            <li> Wow, was I amazed at the difference this has made!  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, I&#x27;ve definitely gotten better with practice.</li>
            <li> Her lashes are simply angelic ;)</li>
            <li> One tube is the &#x27;gel&#x27; that you apply first and last.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply 3 coats of both and made sure it&#x27;s  sealed by the step 1 and 3 mascara</li>
            <li> On my FIRST try my lashes look a LOT fuller and longer than with ANY traditional mascara.  </li>
            <li> Applying my mascara first and then following the steps and just applying the gel and the fibers without my mascara.</li>
            <li> Even came a day early!</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly and definitely have noticeably longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that on the first application, following the directions, my eyelashes looked like they grew overnight!  </li>
            <li> I just double check to make sure it doesn&#x27;t smudge in other areas on my face.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy it again once I&#x27;m done with my first set c:</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Fiber Lash Mascara I&#x27;ve tried; first was Younique.</li>
            <li> To use them, you simply use the mascara first, followed by the fiber wand, then finish again with the mascara.</li>
            <li> She has really sensitive eyes and can&#x27;t wear anything else!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually never wear mascara.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful this product would eliminate my 25 coats of mascara and the time spent applying and reapplying eyeliner to look like I have full set of lashes.  </li>
            <li> Ive always loved the look of lashes because they are full and long but is scared to wear them because i dont want to look fake.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean them to be, but a q-tip takes care of it pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my lashes longer and everyone thinks i&#x27;m wearing false lashes, and it comes off pretty easy</li>
            <li> I would only use three coats for a special occasion but, on a daily basis one or two coats works well too.</li>
            <li> since my lashes are already extremely long that i didn&#x27;t see such a huge difference.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough - even to people who normally don&#x27;t wear much makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other fiber mascaras and this one is just right!  </li>
            <li> The mascara is definitely worth buying if you need to boost the look of false lashes or if you don&#x27;t have much long lashes of your own.</li>
            <li> I have super short lashes that are blonde and</li>
            <li> Mia Adora helps me have the length and look of false eyelashes,  but they&#x27;re my own natural lashes!  </li>
            <li> it definitely did make a large improvement of the length.</li>
            <li> If your lashes aren&#x27;t dark, full or long enough after the first application, I suggest putting more gel on and applying the dark coating again until your lashes are at their fullest.</li>
            <li> It comes in such a cute little box.</li>
            <li> But I started applying a little more gel in the second coat and that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using unique mascara.  </li>
            <li> After reading the directions, I thought it might be a bit difficult to use, but it really was just as easy as using any other mascara, but with a better end result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear coat gel.</li>
            <li> These made my lashes look much longer and thicker than regular mascara.</li>
            <li> But this mascara gives me lashes that nearly hit my brow bone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara and tried it today, wow</li>
            <li> This product gave me a natural look, but it enhanced my existing lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> is the Natural Fiber Lashes.</li>
            <li> However,  i didnt see much of a difference in lenghth as when i use my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> One tube of Magnifying Gel and one tube of Natural Fiber Lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Starting</li>
            <li> Made with 100% Green Tea, Paraben and SLS Free.</li>
            <li> This really works on my sparse, short lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I have very short straight lashes and have always used an eyelash curler along with waterproof mascara and my lashes always stayed curled.</li>
            <li> I have lots of eye allergies and this mascara is gentle enough that it does not bother me.</li>
            <li> One thing that surprised me though, is that my eyes didnt feel irritable at all</li>
            <li> Unlike a similar product I have used, it stays on all day, but comes off much easier comparably speaking.</li>
            <li> but it never looks complete since i don&#x27;t like wearing falsies.</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive and itch with a lot of eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I only need to do one application to get long full natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> have sensitive eyes and Mia Adora</li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars because I did not get the wow factor</li>
            <li> So far, no irritation to my eyes/contacts.</li>
            <li> I also wear contacts, so I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had pretty long lashes</li>
            <li> complete rip off</li>
            <li> and I completely understand why.</li>
            <li> The formula covers well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Thy look natural.</li>
            <li> I have short, straight lashes and this product</li>
            <li> I think my eyelashes still look natural when I use this mascara</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the volume and length this mascara added to my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> but really, I am BUSY</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes and my eyes are far from sensitive.</li>
            <li> I believe I will just stick with my old mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara is creamy and the fibers are feathery soft.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a month so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real girly girl and have makeup to last me for years.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the advertisement said.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes AND wear contacts.</li>
            <li> The Natural Fiber Lashes wand doesn&#x27;t have bristles.</li>
            <li> When you apply the Natural Fibers you may have excess fibers that give a clumped like look.</li>
            <li> I like the natural look.</li>
            <li> my eyes are sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not spectacular,  but ok.</li>
            <li> I instantly have full and long lashes.</li>
            <li> Took a few tries to get it how i liked it</li>
            <li> The product gives the appearance of full thick lashes - the exact look we were going for.</li>
            <li> This one is not as clumpy and thick as most.</li>
            <li> I have just used the base before and it worked great!</li>
            <li> I can get better results with my favorite mascara in less time, and less mess.</li>
            <li> I have simply said, short stubbly eyelashes and have tried for years to find a mascara that I could use right out of the box without putting layer after layer</li>
            <li> A little time consuming to apply but worth it!</li>
            <li> Curl your lashes first, follow the instructions, then let the product dry.</li>
            <li> The first few times, they looked a little gunky, but then somehow you just get better at applying.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter noticed how long and pretty my lashes looked and had to try it for herself!</li>
            <li> the only draw back is to get the full effect it takes several applications</li>
            <li> No mess when applying the fibers</li>
            <li> I wear one layer for work for a more subtle look and 3 or 4 layers when I go out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both a pricier one, and one less expensive and the Mia one takes the top post for sure.  </li>
            <li> I decided to actually read the instructions and applied the fibers for the second time to the top half of my lashes and it was glorious.</li>
            <li> The first time, you may not get the results you want, but after by the second or third try you will start seeing the results you need.</li>
            <li> In fact I just ordered a second set because I don&#x27;t want to be caught short when I start running out of my first set.</li>
            <li> I have used younique lash prior to this and this product is pretty similar.</li>
            <li> The first step is just like mascara and its applied the same, the second step is to add the fibers.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and quickly tried it, following the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily because it does take a little extra time (though, not too much more than normal daily mascara application)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item if you are looking for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> They are, however, naturally fairly long, but because of their color, you can&#x27;t really see that.  </li>
            <li> The fibers do flake off if you mess with them too much, or if you don&#x27;t set them well with the gel, but I didn&#x27;t find them getting into my eyes much.</li>
            <li> I have nearly non existent eyelashes, this product increased the length an volume of my lashes so much that my blonde short lashes stand out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really make  my lashes so long</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to normal mascara again after using this fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to normal mascara after using this.</li>
            <li> I HARDLY have ANY lashes, they are extremely short and very sparse, but this 3-D Mascara really did make my eyes pop out even without any eyeshadow at ALL!!!  </li>
            <li> to love is the fact that you can start your base coat with your own mascara for an even more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> As a contact lens wearer I was a little hesitant but it quickly subsided after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li> Mia Adora does say that this can be worn over your normal mascara for an even more dramatic look, but I wanted to test it alone.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark blonde hair and light eyelashes, so these made them super dark which brought out my blue eyes!</li>
            <li> The brush shape is a little funky - the bristles on the gel wand don&#x27;t go all the way around, so I have to be careful of where on the brush is touching my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for long, and natural looking eyelashes!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dell</li>
            <li> Sometimes you want a bit more for the club or less for some other event.</li>
            <li> It leaves my eyelashes thick and full!</li>
            <li> After using up my mascara, I looked on Amazon to replace my mascara as I had moved to a different area of the country and needed a new supplier.  </li>
            <li> I recently vacationed in New Orleans where the heat index got up to 107 on some days.  </li>
            <li> If you actually already have decent lashes then this stuff is REALLY going to make them long and luscious !!!</li>
            <li> The gel tube is practically dry and the fibers go on very sparsely, which means I have to  go through the process</li>
            <li> My lashes are already pretty long naked</li>
            <li> So sad really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product as a person with short curly lashes I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a product that I really wanted to love, but unfortunately I returned it as I would consider it to be rather defective.</li>
            <li> You can really tell a differents and it feels better than fake eye lashes.</li>
            <li> In other words, those mascaras won&#x27;t be long and clean like what lash extension does.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are printed simply on the inside of the box so the outside of it looks simple and pretty.  </li>
            <li> and I had no other influences.</li>
            <li> First of a few new fiber lash products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> find that I usually have to clean my eye area up a bit after application -</li>
            <li> not bad for the price, however my comments on using that brand was &amp;#34;wow long lashes&amp;#34; with the comment following &amp;#34;your lashes look dry and flaky&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I dont have eyelashes just little ones, this product is incredibly worth it.</li>
            <li> I love dramatic yet natural looking lashes -</li>
            <li> I love how my eyelashes look both dramatic yet natural.</li>
            <li> The color is black and bold enough.</li>
            <li> The only minor problem I&#x27;ve had so far is that the little &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; you apply in &amp;#34;step 2&amp;#34; seem to end up above and below your eyelid throughout the day, but since I use a magnifying makeup mirror, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m the only one who notices.</li>
            <li> The price is not that expensive but the quality is so amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Magnifying gel and fiber lashes are NOT clumpy if you do a smooth application and lasts all day (12-16 hours at least).  </li>
            <li> I had never heard of fiber mascara but discovered it existed when I did a general search for mascara in preparation for replacing my existing mascara that was about to run out.  </li>
            <li> It is made very sturdy and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It was a nice surprise as I don‚Äôt generally wear waterproof mascara because it‚Äôs so difficult to get off, but these came off with no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The natural fiber lashes (second applicator) sheds all over and gets in your eye and burns!</li>
            <li> The Magnifying Gel looks like regular mascara except this gel separates your lashes and primes them for the Natural Fibers Lashes.</li>
            <li> and after all, the benefits are not so far from the one you can get from regular and cheaper brand like covergirl, marbelline or so.</li>
            <li> I have only used this 3D fiber lash mascara once so far</li>
            <li> Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is the complete opposite experience for me.</li>
            <li> 2nd tube is called Natural Fiber Lashes.</li>
            <li> wand used in the Natural Fiber Lashes is different than the wand in the Magnifying Gel.</li>
            <li> I was also happily surprised that it does not clump, even with multiple coats.</li>
            <li> so this is not a review by a young girl who still has lots of lashes left.  </li>
            <li> In normal wear though - like to go to town or out to eat, the mascara performs well as long as you don&#x27;t cry.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick lashes now :)</li>
            <li> I honestly think they applyed it wrong.</li>
            <li> The fiber lashes are natural but are thick and full.</li>
            <li> Looks like false eyelashes, Just stunning.</li>
            <li> The results: I love the length, they don&#x27;t look like mangled spider legs and kinda give that false eyelash look.</li>
            <li> The Gel slides right on with little to no clumping.</li>
            <li> this stuff really does work...may make my eyes just a tid bit dry (contact wearer) but not enough to not use it.  </li>
            <li> I have super long dark lashes as it is.  </li>
            <li> I have short lashes, and was looking for the drama that this type of mascara promotes but it looks very natural, almost as if I&#x27;m using my regular Maybelline.</li>
            <li> The fibers are a bit messy, but nothing that doesn&#x27;t wipe right off.</li>
            <li> I tried on my left eyelash first and although the instructions clearly tell you not to get too close to your eye with the step 2 fibers, I did and got an eyeful of little fuzzy fibers.  </li>
            <li> The fibers clung to the lashes quite easily, however there was a little bit of fall out - but that is to be expected!  </li>
            <li> I was asked to try the new 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora since I have such fine, thin lashes</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put an extra heavy application on and it really gave me a normal appearance.  </li>
            <li> I love dramatic lashes</li>
            <li> can add 2 or even 3 coats for more of a dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more of a dramatic look and thought I had found it.</li>
            <li> If I sat there and played with it and applied more I would get some dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for more dramatic change</li>
            <li> I love the dramatic look.</li>
            <li> If its not thick or long enough repeat.</li>
            <li> But it was actually much easier than expected to place the fibers where I actually wanted them.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that its like wearing false (and I love my falsies), but it gives me a lot of lash, enough to stop wearing falsies in the daytime and on dates.</li>
            <li> Practice is definitely the key to get the right technique down.</li>
            <li> the packaging is completely cute with the pink and white with black background, course the bottles were a bit hard to get out of the case the first time, when i did get them out</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I noticed a lot of the little fibers falling on my under eye/cheek area throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was also say it does take a little practice at first so do not become discouraged</li>
            <li> I was also say it does take a little practice at first so do not become discouraged</li>
            <li> I have also spent a lot of money on high end mascara&#x27;s and have yet to find one that does what it says.</li>
            <li> Go back to other eye and apply large tube then</li>
            <li> The fibers give you a full and long dramatic look, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Seems to achieve the exact same result for less money.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> Easy application produces thick and long eyelashes without any  eye irritation.  </li>
            <li> used other mascaras and with my puny Asian lashes, I doubted that it would affect my lashes that much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is any different from any other fiber lash mascara, including the much cheaper version by maybelline.</li>
            <li> Want ridiculously long, lush lashes?</li>
            <li> Wow, I was amazed at how long my lashes became with this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> with that said i found the truth a few things is  first</li>
            <li> The first few times I kept getting fibers in my eyes</li>
            <li> She had some trouble using it at first</li>
            <li> The 3D Fiber Lash is not as messy as I thought it might be and stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> I came home later that night and added a few more coats for my night on the town, I went from long natural looking lashes to full long dramatic lashes in about ten six minutes!</li>
            <li> The tubes are silver with black writing and so far they still look brand new with no fading in sight.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that I do need to do some clean up after step two...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little clumpy but not more than most mascaras.</li>
            <li> Although it is a little spendy, it lasts a long time and is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> and wow my eyelashes were long!</li>
            <li> for the top lashes, I practiced on my 7 years old daughter, her 9 years old brother and the &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; (sorry bae!).</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the other highly named brands of tea fiber mascara, like Younique.</li>
            <li> I take pride in my natural hair, it&#x27;s very long and all mine.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference with how long and thick my eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li> It takes time to put on as it requires multiple layers, but definitely gives quite a dramatic effect if you want to spend the time putting many layers on.</li>
            <li> It really lengthened my lashes and gave them a slightly fuller appearance.  </li>
            <li> I would much rather do this than get extensions put on , faster, less money</li>
            <li> Concentrate on lashes about half way up straight to the tips.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;base and finishing mascara&amp;#34; part of this set is not thick, or nearly wet and sticky enough to hold and build the fibers correctly.</li>
            <li> It could also be that I&#x27;m applying them too late and letting &amp;#34;step 1&amp;#34; dry too quickly so the fibers have nothing to stick to!</li>
            <li> I suffer from abnormally short sparse lashes that are weak as heck but for some reason strong enough to fight any curling mechanism known to man.  </li>
            <li> The magnifying gel applicator really allows for the separation of the lashes which subsequently causes less clumping.</li>
            <li> The wet lashes grabbed every little fiber they could off of the wand, making my lashes look even more volumous (but honestly, a little too clumpy).  </li>
            <li> As much as I paid I was hoping for a product that lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic makes lashes look long and clean, yet it makes lashes look like thick threads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to get off, but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its worth the money only because if you love long thick lashes you have to keep applying &amp; building up your lashes, which may lead to little fibers flaking &amp; ending up all over your face by the end of the day..</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing an additional natural creamy mascara just to have a good base for the fiber mascara.  </li>
            <li> This is a revolutionary product that solves many issues we all have; no need for eyelash dye, certainly no need for false lashes, and no smudge.</li>
            <li> They even throw in a pretty pink and black lash brush to help with any clumps..</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look super thick and long.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this being that my eye lashes are blonde and some what short and thin.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the fact that you can create a dramatic look for nights out by just adding an additional coat or two; or keep it simple for the day with just one application.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to what other reviewers have said, I do agree that the product MAGNIFIES your natural lashes by 300%.</li>
            <li> I have fine, short, asian eyelashes, so I envy anyone with long, thick, dark eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I intended to buy this to use only for special occassions to replace using and dealing with false lashes.</li>
            <li> I only use it on special occasions due to how hard it is to remove.</li>
            <li> It give me the full look as if I was wear fake natural lashes.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t as thick as Younique and others I&#x27;ve tried, but i actually like it!</li>
            <li> The first step is to apply the Magnifying Gel from base of your lashes to top; 15-20 strokes.</li>
            <li> As good as the expensive one, if not better.</li>
            <li> Tough to get right apparently.</li>
            <li> The gel was very dry and the fibers barely came off the brush.</li>
            <li> therefore lashes are minimal and goes straight down.</li>
            <li> It might take a little longer to apply than the normal mascara</li>
            <li> sent back, it really didn&#x27;t make my lashes look longer, and was very messy.</li>
            <li> This tube is where I had a hard time wrapping my mind around what exactly it was.</li>
            <li> After ready some of the reviews, I half way expected that when I first applied this mascara system that I&#x27;d have a hard time perfecting it.  </li>
            <li> only thing i have to say is it is time consuming waiting for the fibers to dry when doing multiple coats.</li>
            <li> I think the key is to let the fibers dry before applying the final coat of mascara.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look much longer than usual mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I usually use yonuinque mascara and this is very close to it.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Younique brand and it really and truly works.</li>
            <li> I actually have long lashes already but with MiaAdora it made it extra long.  </li>
            <li> I can keep adding fibers until my lashes are so long that I can&#x27;t open my eyes fully??</li>
            <li> I have placed my second order now and will be ordering this mascara as long as it is produced by the company.  </li>
            <li> Made my short lashes look long and voluminous.</li>
            <li> This was actually a bit more complicated than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to put on false lashes in my whole life there always coming up at the ends or worse</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but definitely worth the price if you want that striking false lash-look.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t care much for is how hard it is to get off.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box and tried to use it for the first time it was dried up!!  </li>
            <li> This gives me extra long, borderline extension status lashes!</li>
            <li> I could only do one set of lashes at a time, or it&#x27;d be completely dry before I even got the fibers up to it</li>
            <li> The Natural Fiber Lashes looks like black lint stuck to a mascara wand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using my fiber lashes as much recently because I haven&#x27;t had as much time lately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to make it look natural, yet it gives me the long, dark lashes I want.</li>
            <li> I love the look of individially applied false eyelashes, but usually don&#x27;t have the time it takes to get them on properly.</li>
            <li> use it for special events because it is too dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> like I said, my lashes are thin and traditional mascaras just never looked right.  </li>
            <li> The small black and pink box the tubes are stored in is very pretty with a simple yet sleek logo design.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Admittedly, my first attempt was comically bad, but I got the hang of it really quickly.</li>
            <li> I normally use false eye lashes that look very natural, each lash separated and all, as though I&#x27;m not wearing a mascara.  </li>
            <li> If it was just the dried up gel that was causing the problem, then I might try it, but the whole application process is too time consuming compared to the other brand.</li>
            <li> There was little to no irritation to my eyes and it took me no time at all to complete from start to finish.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin coat of mascara first!</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the set, my eyes got a little irritated by the end of the day from the fibers flaking off.</li>
            <li> This is a little bit more complicated than regular mascara because you need to coat lashes, apply fibers, then seal with another coat of mascara.  </li>
            <li> And it stayed that way all day long.  </li>
            <li> The wand bristles were too long.  </li>
            <li> my eye lashes look long</li>
            <li> mascaras won&#x27;t extend lashes forever long.  </li>
            <li> Just not for all day long.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this product for so long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long lashes and when i use this product</li>
            <li> contains all natural green tea fibers.</li>
            <li> I already feel like it almost empty after one month of daily, one layer use.  </li>
            <li> Makes lashes twice as long and volumious.</li>
            <li> long lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not only that but when they get wet the mascara bleeds.</li>
            <li> Mascara alone minimally has helped, but this product actually makes my eyelashes appear longer.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t wait too long.</li>
            <li> But to my surprise, the fibers stuck to my lashes so long that it took time for me to get used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always wanted to have long lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much better than some of the volumizing mascara from the drug store that I normally wear</li>
            <li> Next while the gel is still wet, you brush on the fibers which add volume and length until you decide you&#x27;ve reached the look you want</li>
            <li> Took my a couple of tries to get the hang of proper application.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of minor things are an issue -- nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also makes your lashes appear naturally long vs falsely long.  </li>
            <li> if im not extra careful</li>
            <li> My lashes used to be thick but as I got older (I&#x27;m 54), my lashes seemed thinner and less lush.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look thick &amp; very glamorous.</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with these, no more false</li>
            <li> Thick and full like false ones, yet very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few in the past and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Very clumpy uneven, just a mess.</li>
            <li> the only other mascara like this that i have tried is youngique.</li>
            <li> Extend on the other, both looked very similar.</li>
            <li> Second order and I have tried other brands...</li>
            <li> Anyways the other brand I had initially purchased came with 2 sets for $14.99.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes aren&#x27;t clumpy at all, and they are SO long!</li>
            <li> It made my lashes look lusciously long!</li>
            <li> My lashes are already very long do i was expecting them to be even longer.</li>
            <li> To me, that makes my lashes look disproportionate with the ends being very full looking and the base looking like my normal lashes.</li>
            <li> I went back through with a pin to separate any huge clumps of lashes that just looked awkward - and then finished up with Mia Adora&#x27;s mascara.  </li>
            <li> , It doesn&#x27;t dry out at all.</li>
            <li> Wait for 20 seconds for the fibers to dry.</li>
            <li> The stick seems almost dry except for the end of the stick.</li>
            <li> The fibers are supposed to be dry.</li>
            <li> and they were dry all day.</li>
            <li> It is different and I had to get use to it after few application it became simple to apply.</li>
            <li> The second tube has green tea fibers, and comes with a extremely short bristled brush.  </li>
            <li> It gives me long full lashes without the fake gawdy look.  </li>
            <li> I have stick straight Asian eyelashes and have tried a lot of mascaras but wanted the look of false lashes without the hassle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of mascara and even wear fake lashes for special occasions</li>
            <li> when used it feels like sand in the eye, the lashes are uncomfortable, nothing special about this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have been cursed with short asian lashes and this mascara adds so much length and volume to your eyelashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a red head and wear dark brown mascara.</li>
            <li> Forgive the pictures below, I was pretty tired when I took them.  </li>
            <li> I even have to be careful because I wear glasses that I don&#x27;t get them too long.</li>
            <li> First application was a little hard.  </li>
            <li> I had the mascara on all day and it didn&#x27;t smudge or loose its volume&lt;</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on the idea of applying loose fibers onto my lashes.</li>
            <li> It does not leave clumbs like Younique does and the fiber is not as loose that gets into your eyes.</li>
            <li> The third application really makes lashes stand out although I think it takes practice to get that dramatic look.</li>
            <li> It took me several trys to get my technique down</li>
            <li> Just a few little fibers fell off during the day, but other than that, it does make your eyelashes much prettier.  </li>
            <li> Live a little and try it!!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t as amazing as I&#x27;d expected considering the rating and other reviews.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the fibers are black and not white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly it only comes in black.</li>
            <li> Although the task of applying the product is quite a bit tedious its absolutely worth it since this mascara stays on all day long and doesnt smudge.</li>
            <li> I had tried eyelash extensions in the past and found the glue/ adhesive really irritated my eyes, they were also quite pricey to maintain every few weeks.</li>
            <li> No more need for fake lashes that make me paranoid about the glue falling off :)</li>
            <li> It looks like your traditional black mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They would clump, smudge, flake, or just not be black enough.  </li>
            <li> When have you ever bought mascara that wasn‚Äôt just thrown in some plastic that was super difficult to remove?&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the tube with the gel in it seemed a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I would never live without Mia Adore Fiber lash!</li>
            <li> Their brush head is straight, narrow, with less bristles, but somewhat firm.</li>
            <li> The second wand takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> The mascara was clumped and even after trying to apply left little clumps which got into my eye.</li>
            <li> I did have a little bit of flaking later in the day</li>
            <li> The first couple times it didn&#x27;t come out as expected, but when you get the trick you can get as dramatic results as you want.</li>
            <li> After breaking the habit of making small strokes right to left when applying regular mascara and just applying from the base to the tip of the lash in a straight, upward motion, I had minimal to no clumping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy at first because i was worried that either it wouldnt work or it would make my lashes look spidery... not good.</li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive fiber lash massacras and this one works just as well for a little less of the price.</li>
            <li> But def not as long as the picture!!!</li>
            <li> The fiber part of this product is great, the gel is horrible.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I really enjoyed how long my lashes were.</li>
            <li> I tried to contact the company directly via their website on the business card they included in my order (rather than post a negative review)</li>
            <li> Needless to say, no issues (although I&#x27;ve only really used this for a couple of days).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Apply the \\&quot;lashes\\&quot; while mascara is still wet.</li>
            <li> so I did not really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> Fibers only stayed on for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Only have to apply one round for longer lashes, but will apply two if going out.</li>
            <li> &amp; I didn&#x27;t find the fibers in my eye every five minutes like I expected to.</li>
            <li> Maybe not for everyday but definitely to go out and celebrations.</li>
            <li> but that is as expected.</li>
            <li> That said, that may be a partial explanation for the cause of the eye irritation that occurs after a couple of hours of wearing (fibers start falling in your eyes).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really not working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, but I&#x27;m really not into make up.</li>
            <li> I actually wear everyday is mascara</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected as I have never used this type of mascara.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the fiber and read directions so that they won&#x27;t get in your eye.</li>
            <li> It looks just the same but without the cost and heavy feeling</li>
            <li> but it is so worth it to keep from buying fake lashes, plus you&#x27;re not applying any glue to your eyelids.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on regular mascara , this is way better.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> It stays throughout the whole day and I have not experienced any irritations.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I spent years looking for &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; lash lengthening mascara and tried everything known to man.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t quite do what I expected.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to send back if not.</li>
            <li> A lot easier to work with than expected, and</li>
            <li> The fibers are a bit darker than expected</li>
            <li> I found that you need to be really careful or else</li>
            <li> I am addicted to getting individual lashes and since I have been so busy a friend recommended these.</li>
            <li> but mine was missing the extra pink curling pad.</li>
            <li> I would much rather take the time to put on false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It really looks like your wearing false lashes .</li>
            <li> And it doesnt rip my real lashes out like false lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who could not get into false lashes, the glue and putting them on and some looking wayyyy too much for my taste</li>
            <li> and then the other one adds these tiny little fibers onto your lashes.</li>
            <li> and although it did not give me super crazy long eyelashes</li>
            <li> I usually like a dramatic look, so I apply the fibers twice, and then with the eyelash brush I clean away any bumps.</li>
            <li> I could not use fake lash could never get them to look right.</li>
            <li> I have small thin eyelashes that wouldnt get much volume with regular mascaras until I came across this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent loads of money on other 3D Fiber Lash Mascaras, like Yonique, and other ones.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It did specifically say to not get the fibers close to the eye (stay above half way of lashes), but I still had a few fiber pieces fall into my eye which caused irritation.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the gel is watery, not creamy and fails to adequately coat the lash in order to adhere the green tea fibers.  </li>
            <li> pretty expensive though</li>
            <li> This set comes with two tubes ‚Äì one is the Magnifying Gel and the other</li>
            <li> so it takes 10 to 15 min to apply, other than that it</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other fiber mascaras, and found that the fibers ended up around the skin surrounding your eyes...</li>
            <li> I have tried other fiber mascara</li>
            <li> This brand does not flake but it does not give me the volume the other does,</li>
            <li> I have tried Younique and just about every other fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try other 3d fiber lash products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As with all fiber lash mascara it has a tube with the gel and the other tube</li>
            <li> The gel has no odor like other products I have tried and no flaking or smudging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> (one eye is before application, the other is after)  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that I had to check under my eyes several times a day because the small fibers kept falling off my lashes.</li>
            <li> The book you get with it is extremely helpful on how to apply it.</li>
            <li> repeat on other eye</li>
            <li> find if I don&#x27;t apply the other brand of mascara, my lashes aren&#x27;t as thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m not satisfied, and won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;(PS</li>
            <li> Regular polish was a waste of $$; I tried them all!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no clumping at all!</li>
            <li> One is the mascara, the other is the fibers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes sticky like some other fiber-mascaras do.</li>
            <li> but my lashes look no longer then when I use other mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> plus they recommend on there packaging that you don&#x27;t wear with contacts due to the fibers getting under contact s and possibility damaging eye.</li>
            <li> My husband accused me of getting fake lashes the first time I wore them.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it because it does make a difference between other mascara that I have used.</li>
            <li> Other than that I wouldn&#x27;t change anything.</li>
            <li> My mascara remover doesn&#x27;t work on it although it works with all my other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer getting any other brand of mascara except for 3D fiber lash.</li>
            <li> Compared to other lash fiber systems this one doesn&#x27;t leave fallout fibers all over your face.</li>
            <li> With all that,  it&#x27;s also cheaper than other brands that I have used.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used any of my other mascaras since I purchased this product</li>
            <li> atleast 3 times to get the effect I get with one application of my other brand.  </li>
            <li> when Mia Adora approached me to try out their 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, there was absolutely no way that I&#x27;d turn down that opportunity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The base coat can easily be worn alone!</li>
            <li> so be very careful to NOT get it at the &#x27;root&#x27; of your lashes/near your eyeball&lt;</li>
            <li> Very messy, flaky and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I used to buy only another expensive brand in order to get thicker blacker eyelashes, and then I&#x27;ve decided to spend less money into something new when I was searching on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After all my extensions fell out all were left were skimpy, short, broken lashes.</li>
            <li> I suffer from short thin lashes and also different lash length.</li>
            <li> The Natural Fibers looks like a small mascara wand that‚Äôs covered in small fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suffer from short thin lashes and also different lash length.  </li>
            <li> Its lined with a black satin material that started fraying in a small area due to me opening the box daily.</li>
            <li> They give a dramatic enough look that I actually felt like I didn&#x27;t need any other make up on.</li>
            <li> And  mascara help a little but not much.</li>
            <li> I wore this product a total of four times, but I never felt like the affects were dramatic enough for me to switch to this full-time.</li>
            <li> the fibers usually flake a little bit onto my upper cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical at first....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product  to anyone who has trouble with false lashes and wishes to have the effects Falsies have.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it says on packaging that it is waterproof, but it comes off in water.</li>
            <li> my only complaint would be that it dries out your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Sooo much easier than fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Did not come out as dark as the picture.  </li>
            <li> I would say I have average</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use an expensive mascara, but I really prefer the look of my mascara over the look of this product.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are average length</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product to anyone that wants longer lashes without the hassle of putting on fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall rating:  25 out of 25 stars / 5 Star Average</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall rating:  25 out of 25 stars / 5 Star Average</li>
            <li> I am not a big makeup wearer, but I do like to at least do my eyes in some way.  </li>
            <li> , at least that‚Äôs what Brooke Shields told me in her Lattise commercial.  </li>
            <li> This is average.</li>
            <li> so it can make them pretty itchy and red and painful</li>
            <li> I have been SUPER skeptical about fiber lash mascara because of the negative experiences I&#x27;ve had with MLM reps contacting me about theirs.</li>
            <li> I was cursed to be born with lashes that grow down and do not curl up.</li>
            <li> I have had the pleasure of reviewing Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara and Eyelash Curler, and I have no longing for any other product!</li>
            <li> so I am extremely picky!  </li>
            <li> My lashes have never appeared so long and thick, not from any other mascara previously.</li>
            <li> and then you end up messing up ur makeup half the time</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic is about $7-13, 1/3 to a half of 3D Fiber Lash.  </li>
            <li> I of course jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;Nestled in a black box are two silver tubes.</li>
            <li> However, it does not come close to working as well as my previous brand.</li>
            <li> Fibers will flake off into your eyes if there is even a slight breeze blowing on your face.</li>
            <li> Not pitch black.</li>
            <li> Picture below is me wearing two coats of Mia and the fibers in BLACK</li>
            <li> The instructions say not to apply the fibers closer to your eye than half the distance of your lashes.</li>
            <li> typically use a coconut oil to remove my eye makeup, and the 3D Fiber</li>
            <li> I had previously considered getting eyelash extensions done at a salon, now that is no longer a consideration with Mia Adora.  </li>
            <li> I have been getting quite a few in my eyes and under my bottom lid, but I think maybe I didn&#x27;t put a thick enough sealing coat after the fibers.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I personally was unable to achieve the pictured results.  </li>
            <li> It also burned my eyes when my eyes teareds slightly from weariness by end of day.</li>
            <li> but I had black fibers all over my face and decided to return it</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve to putting these on.</li>
            <li> I hate using fake lashes so this is a great alternative.  </li>
            <li> When I placed my order I have imagined the mess I would make all over my face and counter trying to apply the fibers</li>
            <li> I did get a lot of mess and fibers in my eyes.</li>
            <li> It didn‚Äôt run nor did it mess up the lashes.</li>
            <li> i did one eye first and the difference was crazy-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had long lashes, but they weren&#x27;t necessarily thick</li>
            <li> Instead of producing long and luscious lashes, I got a thick and clumpy mess.  </li>
            <li> I was so blown away at how thick and long my lashes got.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted long thick lashes, now I have them.  </li>
            <li> my experience is that I end up, not with flaking, but fibers of black, like little hairs, on my face.  </li>
            <li> Voluminous mascaras are too heavy and weigh my lashes down, lengthening mascaras aren&#x27;t noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it might be irritating but have found it just as comfortable as any other mascara.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s embarrassing to discover half of it hanging off one eye after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to get use to.</li>
            <li> The little fibers do irritate my eyes a bit, so I don&#x27;t wear it</li>
            <li> I used little brush to separate lashes.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth $30!</li>
            <li> It took a little practice</li>
            <li> : my eyelashes in the corner of my eyes did appear a little longer.</li>
            <li> Perfectly dark!</li>
            <li> small tube&lt;br /&gt;5, repeat other eye&lt;</li>
            <li> i could do without the little flakes falling on my face</li>
            <li> Like others have posted it does take a little practice to get the hang of application.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I do feel some irritation on my eyes and also some of the little hairs of the fibers sometimes get inside my eye while applying it.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I was a little sketchy about this product, But of course when it arrived I immediately had to try it.</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to try this because everyone was talking about the difficulty of application.</li>
            <li> My lashes are thin and not very long.</li>
            <li> I prefer a natural look and applying only this mascara made my eyes look dramatic, but naturally dramatic.  </li>
            <li> but you have to work with the dark coating, just use clean strokes from the base of your lashes to the tips.</li>
            <li> but I have very dark lashes anyway.  </li>
            <li> Having breast cancer is hard but losing all your hair is even harder.</li>
            <li> and this product is significantly less expensive than other similar options!  </li>
            <li> and this product is significantly less expensive than other similar options!  </li>
            <li> As in, I use a pin to separate my lashes from one another (dangerous, I know, but the struggle is real).</li>
            <li> The fibers are also somewhat of a messy application, and for someone who wears contacts, this may be an issue.</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde lashes.</li>
            <li> It holds the curler open when you are not using it and is totally unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Both looks messy, but..</li>
            <li> It takes a few applications to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> After I used up the mascara I was using, I opened up this one (1 1/2 months after purchase) and got dried up flakes.  </li>
            <li> It contains beeswax and green tea fibers.  </li>
            <li> as in literally im using it everyday...</li>
            <li> It did take a few trys to get it</li>
            <li> Still did well for a night out, but not for everyday</li>
            <li> I purchased Younique through one of their Younique representatives but found it to be heavy and while it added length I didn&#x27;t care for the spidery look it gave to my lashes.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too messy for me</li>
            <li> I was nervous it would be clumpy and messy</li>
            <li> It took me a few minutes to get used to the length becuase</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I had trouble placing the order and the representative I spoke with</li>
            <li> Does not leave your lashes dried out nor crunchie&lt;</li>
            <li> I use it just about everyday.</li>
            <li> The actual mascara is so thin</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have found a few drugstore brands of mascara that I like that</li>
            <li> My biggest flaw on the mascara, is that I keep having a few fiber lashes fall on my face,</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so thin but by using this I actually look like I have lashes.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t get caught crying with them</li>
            <li> I received my order yesterday and was so upset when I tried to use it and one of the tubes were completely dried out.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> Although the fibers will washout when you wash your face, I found no issues when I was perspiring or even crying.</li>
            <li> This 3D Fiber Lash Mascara gives you the same look of false eyelashes, literally in just seconds!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a big fan of using false lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Volume: the ultra thin and short fibers of 3D fiber lash makes lots of bulky crumbs and creates messy look.  </li>
            <li> i have been asked several times if i wear false eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> I will go back to my false lashes.</li>
            <li> I wore them that same day, and my sister even asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Works just as well, if not better than other brands!</li>
            <li> This product truly works and cost less than others!</li>
            <li> Long and thick lashes!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because I had recently purchased another brand of 3D Fiber Lash Mascara that cost a lot less than this.</li>
            <li> i cut them to short, but thankfully false is the thing of the past fiber lashes who knew?</li>
            <li> the fibers didnt fall into my eye and there was ZERO mess!</li>
            <li> This mascara is a little unbelievable in its performance.</li>
            <li> but what a disappointment when the bottle of fibers is completely dry and would only leave clumps of fibers falling onto my lashes!  </li>
            <li> I have tired several different brands and some of them flake throughout the day and leave behind stuff that smears when you go to wipe it off but not this one!</li>
            <li> The others are messy and the you end up with small fiber lashes everywhere.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my fibers were dried out or what</li>
            <li> You get the look of long, glamorous lashes without having to deal with false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical about plopping down $30.00 for some MASCARA, but with the 60 day money back guarentee, I figured I had nothing to loose!  </li>
            <li> I got a little carried away when applying it and put everything on way too thick.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very little</li>
            <li> I seriously have very short and thin lashes.</li>
            <li> Apply mascara as usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the curlers no more, noticed they were pulling my lashes out smh.</li>
            <li> One gift that was on my wishlist this past Christmas was a fiber mascara.  </li>
            <li> No more glue or irritated eye with this product.  </li>
            <li> So I usually use one of my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mascaras with it instead.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product initially.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few 3d mascaras, including Younique 3d fiber lash and none of them compare!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is a way to fix that problem without ruining the product</li>
            <li> and I was looking for an everyday mascara that would give me fab lashes!</li>
            <li> Immediately, small tube (fibers) rub brush around tube to get fibers on, apply on 1/2 of the length of lashes&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I was assuming they would make my lashes look big and fake</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever go back to fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried a well known 3D mascara in the past and prefer this product.</li>
            <li> but not sure if I&#x27;d purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> Mascara usually irritates my eyes and makes my lashes fall out.</li>
            <li> When I first got the mascara, I put it on without reading the directions, and I must say, I was quite disappointed.  </li>
            <li> no more falsies for me.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> No better than my drugstore mascara, but three times the price and requires three times the effort.</li>
            <li> I usually just apply some liner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Some of the fibers will fall out, so keep a small tissue under the eye when applying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very thin and short eye lashes!</li>
            <li> but they were either very messy or didn&#x27;t give me length</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of fake eyelashes, they&#x27;re too hard to apply and it&#x27;s embarrassing if they come off in public.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. :o</li>
            <li> Some of the other 3D lashes I was thinking of getting had a clear base coat and suggested that you use your &amp;#34;regular marcara&amp;#34; under everything.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are just as long as if I had used fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I usually use another brand, but tried this because it was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> After applying the black powder smudged bad even after following directions with gel.</li>
            <li> So mascara has always been hard for me.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too hard to wash off either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s late afternoon and mascara still holds on the curl, volume and length.</li>
            <li> To get the results I want I have to do the steps at least 2 times.  </li>
            <li> I tried these 3D fiber lashes and they extended and filled out my lashes like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> There was always at least one thing that would disappoint me about all of them.  </li>
            <li> A few people have asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> The fibers are thick and do not irritate your eye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to it, wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> the 2nd step is fiber so while applying it they do tend to drop on the check or bottom of the eye, My fix to this is use paper towel or apply the 3d fiber before you add base or any other makeup on face</li>
            <li> I tried the other brand (Younique) and was not impressed at all...</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get the hang of with the fibers, but don&#x27;t give up!!</li>
            <li> Thankfully I went into remission an my hair returned, except my eyelashes were very sparse an almost impossible to see, even with over the counter mascara an fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I got very ordinary results from this product.  </li>
            <li> It does add some time to your makeup routine, and clean-up is very messy because the fibers go everywhere!</li>
            <li> I have thin and small eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are small and I don&#x27;t like false lashes</li>
            <li> This mascara is very expensive and is basically useless because it cannot be applied correctly without a decent brush.</li>
            <li> With two girls who wear fake eyelashes for dance performances - we were looking for a product that would replace the need for constantly buying the fake lashes and glue.</li>
            <li> Seriously get this</li>
            <li> Horrible for short Asian eyelashes.</li>
            <li> There may be less expensive fiber lash mascara but trust me they will damage your lashes.</li>
            <li> a LOT less hassle than applying fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it is THAT</li>
            <li> I hate clumpy, spider looking lashes and my eyes are sensitive to everything!</li>
            <li> Also, sunglasses are a little uncomfortable to wear while using this product because the added length pushes against the lense.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve always had a hard time wearing fake eyelashes because they make my eyes feel tired and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I used to wear fake eyelashes everyday n</li>
            <li> I will say I don&#x27;t wear make-up everyday and was skeptical of everyone promoting this lashes</li>
            <li> No more fake eye lashes, you wont need them, all you need is this</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well the mascara held up, even during my long, sweaty work days, my lashes remained looking</li>
            <li> So, on first attempt I hated these!</li>
            <li> No more false lashes for me!</li>
            <li> No more false lashes for me!</li>
            <li> My husband was shocked when he saw how long they were!</li>
            <li> The fibers end up irritating the eyes.</li>
            <li> so, that was another reason behind me getting this</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any burning or irritation.  </li>
            <li> the one that is non irritating.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are on the thin sparse side</li>
            <li> I found it really annoying actually.</li>
            <li> I have thin eyelashes and wanted them too look longer.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product to enhance my lashes because I didn&#x27;t want to get extensions or put irritating grow serums on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 with  thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> I was going to put on false lashes for my nephews wedding this weekend, now I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> I had a friend who asked me if I was wearing false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes pop without having to add false lases.</li>
            <li> will not wear false eyelashes ever again .my</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the way false lashes feel, so this will be my go to glam mascara if I have some time to spare to put it on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried false lash sets and just could not get the hang of putting them on.</li>
            <li> The false fiber irritated my eyes since it did not stay on.</li>
            <li> but for an alternative to false lashes</li>
            <li> People ask if I have false eyelashes all the time.  </li>
            <li> and I just can&#x27;t get the hang of false lashes</li>
            <li> At the end of which, it produced dramatic results even on my bottom lashes‚Ä¶</li>
            <li> even makeup newbies can achieve a dramatic look with this brand.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that dramatic as I&#x27;m expecting.</li>
            <li> so you can make your eyes look really dramatic, or just stand out without over doing it for the office.</li>
            <li> this was hard to rate, its not that its a horrible product, but for me not worth the money .</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed I actually want a refund.</li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes look longer and thicker than mascara does without looking completely fake.</li>
            <li> Also, fake eyelashes have a tendency to not stay in place during the hours and hours of performances on stage.</li>
            <li> I get asked if I am wearing fake lashes all the time.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews I thought it&#x27;d be difficult to learn to apply.</li>
            <li> nothing  too difficult.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I could not stand this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry to say that I just do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just looks like I may have fake eyelashes on my</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time consuming and tedious to achieve ANY results, as well as remove.</li>
            <li> but this compares to fake lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the really expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Performs like a mediocre mascara.</li>
            <li> No need for fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do fake lashes or extensions.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> and it does not look fake.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and was so sad to see that after one week they were out of them..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so weird that you need &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; to remove &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to return this ridiculously expensive mascara.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about this.</li>
            <li> Since then I learned what works for my lashes and thin is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced any of those drawbacks with this product!  </li>
            <li> They‚Äôre luscious and not at all fake?  </li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said it was difficult to apply....</li>
            <li> Sorry, won&#x27;t be getting this one again.  </li>
            <li> the fibers kept falling in my eyes and when I&#x27;d try to correct any mistakes above my eyes with a Q-Tip, it would clump them together, then I would have to separate them, which would cause them to fall off, so I&#x27;d have to reapply it all (vicious circle).  </li>
            <li> the brush was very thin with a pointy piece sticking out the the end of the brush....</li>
            <li> I have very thin lashes and</li>
            <li> Very frustrating all day.  </li>
            <li> Fake lashes were always difficult to apply and eyelash extensions are very expensive.</li>
            <li> I like that I don&#x27;t have to use any glue as I&#x27;ve had a bad reaction the glue used to apply false eye</li>
            <li> I def didn&#x27;t end up with the crazy bent, weird looking spider legs</li>
            <li> They do make your lashes longer, but maybe not worth the outrageous price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how destructive extensions can be.</li>
            <li> I wanted desperately to like this product so that I did not have to wear falsies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used younique once (bought a tube and finished it) and when I was desperate and couldn&#x27;t get that, I tried this.</li>
            <li> It is summer and it is muggy out at times.</li>
            <li> It did not run in the muggy weather.</li>
            <li> This product makes me feel like I can ditch the fake lashes and glue forever!  </li>
            <li> If you are skeptical about this mascara, don&#x27;t be!</li>
            <li> Everyone think my eyelashes are fake!</li>
            <li> I have had a very difficult time finding something that would both keep my lashes out of my eyes, but also put them on display.</li>
            <li> and it declared that it can make the impossible happen, lengthen my lashes.  </li>
            <li> or I just got a bad batch, but</li>
            <li> Using the fibers gives me a bit of clumping, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> bad which is none&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed :(</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> This mascara lengthens the lashes like crazy!</li>
            <li> After all, they cannot reuse cosmetics anyways:(</li>
            <li> WRONG!!</li>
            <li> however I hate the falling pieces of microfibers.</li>
            <li> They adhere to the base layer and then are sealed in place with another base layer.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I hate tubes that leave residue on your hands after handling.</li>
            <li> When applying the fibers don&#x27;t go from base to tip of lashes</li>
            <li> and I hate clumps.  </li>
            <li> Had to return it, because it stung my eyes badly!</li>
            <li> I hated it when it would be all over my face.</li>
            <li> a try, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am unfortunately very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> however i was very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OBSESSED!!!</li>
            <li> Compared this 3D fiber lash Mascara $29 with L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic Shocking Extensions Waterproof Mascara</li>
            <li> but u couldn&#x27;t its terrible</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> It looked horrible!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i liked it A LOT when i first got it. since it&#x27;s started to run out (pretty fast) it gets in my eyes a lot. i think, to work correctly, you would definitely need to replace 1 a month. but it looks AMAZING when it&#x27;s new. great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product‚Ä¶I have very short wispy lashes and my bottom lashes are virtually non-existent.  One application of the magnifying gel and I could immediately tell the difference‚Ä¶more than doubled the length of my lashes.  If you want to give it an additional boost, you can use your favorite traditional mascara‚Ä¶&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks GREAT all day.  I was chopping onion for dinner and my eyes were watering immensely.  And to my surprise, the mascara didn‚Äôt run AT ALL!  I even went to sleep with it on and it still looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnifying gel is very gentle.  I was attempting to apply it to my bottom lashes and got some of it in my eye.  It didn‚Äôt even sting and nor did my eyes water.  At the end of which, it produced dramatic results even on my bottom lashes‚Ä¶&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Coolest thing EVER! I love the look of individially applied false eyelashes, but usually don&#x27;t have the time it takes to get them on properly. This 3D Fiber Lash Mascara gives you the same look of false eyelashes, literally in just seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very simple 3-step process. Apply mascara as usual. Apply the \\&quot;lashes\\&quot; while mascara is still wet. Apply mascara on top. Voila! Lashes are huge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, my first attempt was comically bad, but I got the hang of it really quickly. Lashes are oh-so-sexy! One of my favorite new beauty products in a long, long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if I could. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to put on false lashes in my whole life there always coming up at the ends or worse i cut them to short, but thankfully false is the thing of the past fiber lashes who knew? i was asked try these out and i cant believe it, i wish they were water proof since i live in a rainy area where in winter it always rains but wow the compliments i get are blowing my mind away! everyones asking me if there my own lashes! such a surprise i have never tried fiber lashes and went this cant be true! You know me if it looks to good to be true i am the person who wants to know the truth, with that said i found the truth a few things is  first the packaging is completely cute with the pink and white with black background, course the bottles were a bit hard to get out of the case the first time, when i did get them out i love the fact there marked 1,2,3, then the trial of the lashes i though yeah right regular mascara, the first looks that way sure the second had me stunned for a second it is a brush with fibers on it wrapped around it i guess and you brush that on then seal it again with the first one! my lashes were huge! i keep playing with it i started off with only 2 coats of the first now i am up to 3 and what a huge difference!! I am completely in love with these, no more false lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works good but when putting it on the fibers fall in ur eye and burn and then you end up messing up ur makeup half the time</li>
            <li> I ordered this from a promotional event and got it free to try. The tube of mascara and fibers came in a very cute packaging as shown. However, I&#x27;m giving this product 3/5 stars because of the fibers. The fibers do somewhat stick onto the mascara gel and lengthens the lashes, but once I curl my lashes, they stick to the curler. The fibers are also somewhat of a messy application, and for someone who wears contacts, this may be an issue. I do love the mascara though as it does somewhat lengthen the lashes on its own and curls my lashes just fine.</li>
            <li> This is such a cool product! I have never used 3d fiber lashes before so I did not really know what to expect. I am a huge makeup junkie so I just knew I had to try this. These made my lashes look much longer and thicker than regular mascara. I like using this product before I go out with my friends on weekends, but this mascara can also be used along with your normal makeup routine. I use this mascara before I go to work. I get so many compliments from customers and coworkers.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara very much. Makes my lashes look thicker and longer. I like the fact that the fibers are black and not white. Very easy to apply and take off.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, makes your eyes pop , but product was soso.I just didn&#x27;t care for product coming off under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is superior to the 3D lashes from Younique that I have ordered in the past.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would much rather take the time to put on false eyelashes. This product flaked during the day, and it was both in my eyes and on my face.</li>
            <li> It was wonderful. .I didn&#x27;t have any lashes until I got 3D lashes.... Oh my goodness it&#x27;s incredible..I love it......</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on here but I just love this product!! Unfortunately I have been cursed with short asian lashes and this mascara adds so much length and volume to your eyelashes they make your eyes pop :)</li>
            <li> I like this mascara a lot. I don&#x27;t have ANY eyelashes. Like at all. But this mascara gives me lashes that nearly hit my brow bone. I wouldn&#x27;t say that its like wearing false (and I love my falsies), but it gives me a lot of lash, enough to stop wearing falsies in the daytime and on dates. So I like it a lot.:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and these lashes last all day and don&#x27;t flake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty expensive though and thats the only thing that I&#x27;m not a fan of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still love the mascara!</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara and tried it today, wow this makes my very short lashes long, I love it!!</li>
            <li> This product did not work well at all. The natural fiber lashes (second applicator) sheds all over and gets in your eye and burns! So disappointed!</li>
            <li> So flaky .... Tried it three times and followed instructions I&#x27;m so disappointed :( my eye lashes are naturally pretty big as is and this did not help,  I would rather use normal mascara</li>
            <li> I got very ordinary results from this product.  I think I do better with reg mascara than with this product quite frankly.  It isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t as amazing as I&#x27;d expected considering the rating and other reviews.</li>
            <li> They do make your lashes longer, but maybe not worth the outrageous price. I&#x27;m still deciding if I&#x27;ll buy more. I wish there was a promo or discount code.</li>
            <li> Love the product will reorder.</li>
            <li> the only other mascara like this that i have tried is youngique. this one-3d fiber lash works very well and is much more comfortable that youngique (spelling?) but youngique did look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> This Mascara so wonderful. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!! I am buying another one soon!</li>
            <li> As of today, this is best 3d mascara I&#x27;ve personally used. It came with clear instructions, products were label,  and it was easy to apply!  This product gave me a natural look, but it enhanced my existing lashes.  This product makes me feel like I can ditch the fake lashes and glue forever!  What an awesome product to be given a chance to review,  test,  and share my honest opinion! Honestly,  I&#x27;m impressed with this item.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  See the difference for yourself!  Takes a cpl mins more than just regular mascara but so worth it! :  ) #BeautifulEyes</li>
            <li> It really amazed me to see my lashes curl up ... they never do but with this mascara it actually did what it said it would do.  And it stayed that way all day long.  It was easy to remove with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I love dramatic lashes but I&#x27;m not a big fan of using false lashes. I was very thrilled when I got the chance to try this 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora, as it&#x27;s as good as putting on false eyelashes, if not better. I love dramatic yet natural looking lashes - and I must say that it&#x27;s what I get by using this brand. There&#x27;s a two step process involved when using this product and it&#x27;s fool proof and very easy to follow - even makeup newbies can achieve a dramatic look with this brand. I have sensitive eyes and I am very picky with products and brands I use on and around my eye area. Mia Adora&#x27;s Fiber Lash Mascara, so far, has not caused any kind of irritation on my eyes and I could not be happier! Beautiful results, amazing mascara! I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.

            <li> I love this product!!! So much better then the competition. Easy and beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li> I really reall like it....thank u guy very much...</li>
            <li> did not  extend  current length of lashes. I chose waterproof, did not get it.</li>
            <li> Exelent .3d fiber lash works good  100% so happy my eye looks nice and long a day.thank u.from.samia v .</li>
            <li> I had never tried 3D fiber mascara before &amp; did not like it. Understand it quite the rage.  I read the reviews first before buying.  I should have know the comments about fiber fallout were true.  Too many of the little fibers end up on my cheekbones.  I really like short bristles on the mascara applicator wand for more control.  The wand bristles were too long.  The repeated process of application is too cumbersome.  I spend too much time applying make up as it is.  I have super long dark lashes as it is.  I will continue to use the product I have for many years.</li>
            <li> The mascara is pretty amazing but it does take some time to be put on with great result! Overall is a great price for this kind of mascara!</li>
            <li> Had to return it, because it stung my eyes badly!</li>
            <li> I was considering eyelash extensions when I happened upon this mascara. Not only does it make my eyelashes look amazing but saving $300 on eyelash extensions with the same result couldn&#x27;t make me happier. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love my long lashes!!!!</li>
            <li> Great, really boosts your lashes.</li>
            <li> At my age of 62, my eyelashes were close to nonexistant. Not sure why. Either they are gray and don&#x27;t show...or I&#x27;ve lost too many. But using this product has given me better eyelashes than ever, including when I was young. I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s very easy to use and I have had 0 problems with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great so far!</li>
            <li> Love how long it makes my lashes look! Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this mascara.  I did try another brand between my orders, and wasn&#x27;t happy with it.  This product lasts longer and is much better to apply.  Well worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> Works really well. Made my eyelashes look longer and thicker than mascara does without looking completely fake. It does take a minute to apply but it is worth it especially on a special night out.</li>
            <li> No problems at all!! At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t as thick as Younique and others I&#x27;ve tried, but i actually like it! It doesn&#x27;t clump my lashes, it actually straightened them out! I don&#x27;t use the curlers no more, noticed they were pulling my lashes out smh. I&#x27;ve tried all three brands Younique, Mia Adora, and Collection by Bunny. Here&#x27;s what I found to be different between three. Younique&#x27;s gel is thicker(makes for more clumps), also gives that spider legs appearance and the brush comes in a wavy pattern which is great, but softer bristles(so i use it with Collection by Bunny gel). Mia Adora&#x27;s gel is not as thick(makes for less clumps), the brush bristles are firmer causing to straighten out your lashes keeping them from clumpingm and head is more straight then wavy. Collection by Bunny, I simply only liked their fibers and gel better then Younique. Their brush head is straight, narrow, with less bristles, but somewhat firm. Either way, I have used all three interchangeably. If I had to put in order of use, it was Younique first, then I went looking for another brand which was CBB(used the most) and now starting to use Mia Adora more. All have great fibers. All sometimes irritates after long wear, but using 3D Fibers has been much better than individuals, a lot cheaper, and more natural attraction. I feel more natural with fibers then with individuals. My real lashes has grown out more, making the 3D fibers look great with each use.</li>
            <li> It did what it says it would do. I actually have long lashes already but with MiaAdora it made it extra long.  People often ask me at work if I have eyelash extensions.  And they wouldn&#x27;t believe me unless I closed my eyes and show them that it&#x27;s all natural.  I recommend this product if you want people to notice how beautiful and sexy lashes you have.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Took a few tries to get it how i liked it but it was worth the practice. Would not recommend falling asleep wearing it. Over all a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I apply a thin coat of mascara first!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s much better than those big brand name mascara. My eyelashes become thicker and longer. The best part is that they also curl up. I bought the product for my family and friends. They all love it.</li>
            <li> Great for thickening your lashes and does not smere or runoff on your face</li>
            <li> I seriously have very short and thin lashes. These 3D fiber lashes are fabulous! They look real. I have long and thick lashes now :) worth the $</li>
            <li> Great product. Only complaint is it says on packaging that it is waterproof, but it comes off in water.</li>
            <li> Not too fond of this. It does add to the length, but definitely makes your lashes look spidery.</li>
            <li> The Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lash Mascara comes in a sturdy case with a magnetic closure. I really like how the instructions on how to use the product are clearly printed on the inside of the case. This set comes with two tubes ‚Äì one is the Magnifying Gel and the other is the Natural Fiber Lashes. This product is designed to make your lashes instantly longer and thicker. In fact, the claim is that your lashes will be 300% magnified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is a good product to own if you have short eyelashes and you really want some added length. It does add some time to your makeup routine, and clean-up is very messy because the fibers go everywhere! Mia Adora does say that this can be worn over your normal mascara for an even more dramatic look, but I wanted to test it alone. I shouldn‚Äôt have to purchase an additional product to get my money‚Äôs worth! Thus, while I think the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara works, I do not see a 300% magnification in my lashes. I recommend it if you have the money and are looking to test out the product, but I don‚Äôt think this is a must have for your beauty routine. My drugstore mascaras get me results that I can enjoy just as much!</li>
            <li> After trying this mascara, I&#x27;ll say that I&#x27;m pretty well pleased, and very excited to use it again -- in the fall and winter. Where I live, spring and summer are both hot and very humid. This product does not do well in the humidity. The description says this mascara is &amp;#34;water resistant&amp;#34; but the sticker on the plastic wrap around the box that the tubes come in actually says &amp;#34;waterproof,&amp;#34; which it definitely isn&#x27;t. That said, during the cooler months when the humidity is lower, I&#x27;ll definitely be reaching for this mascara first. My lashes have never appeared so long and thick, not from any other mascara previously. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation at all and after applying very carefully, I haven&#x27;t had any shedding from the lash booster. I&#x27;ll definitely be recommending this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to get use to. But they work. I have thin blonde lashes. I could not use fake lash could never get them to look right. And  mascara help a little but not much. I can see a big different with this and I like it.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever use!! I used to have to glue ryes to male my eye lashes look long but with this product now I dont!! Its amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Received at discount for review, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried, makes my lashes beautiful and long. I dont have eyelashes just little ones, this product is incredibly worth it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the eyelash curler works great, looks great, &amp; is easy to use. I&#x27;m just a wee bit uneasy about taunt spring aimed straight at my eye. I can&#x27;t think of any good reason why the spring is there. It holds the curler open when you are not using it and is totally unnecessary. So, other than the fear of a spring flinging at my eye like a tiny cosmetic medieval battering ram , this is a really good product.</li>
            <li> I gave the product 4 stars because i do feel it does what it claims to do,  i just don&#x27;t think its as good as i had expected. My lashes are already very long do i was expecting them to be even longer. I feel the most this product did was add volume so i was really pleased with that. However,  i didnt see much of a difference in lenghth as when i use my regular mascara. Also, it did take some time to get the volume i wanted.  More so than with my go to mascara. It was a lot of switching tubes back and forth from my mascara, to the gel, to the fiberes back to the gel etc etc. And i wouldn&#x27;t really have minded that had i felt it made a drastic improvement. Im thinking maybe since my lashes are already extremely long that i didn&#x27;t see such a huge difference. I will still continue to use,  maybe when i go out to an event and im wanting some extra volume.  But i dont think i would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Compared this 3D fiber lash Mascara $29 with L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic Shocking Extensions Waterproof Mascara $7-13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finish Length: about the same&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volume: the ultra thin and short fibers of 3D fiber lash makes lots of bulky crumbs and creates messy look.  It adds more volume than L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic because of the crumbs.  L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic makes lashes look long and clean, yet it makes lashes look like thick threads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both mascaras won&#x27;t extend lashes forever long.  In other words, those mascaras won&#x27;t be long and clean like what lash extension does.  L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic is about $7-13, 1/3 to a half of 3D Fiber Lash.  What is drastically different is packaging. 3D fiber lash mascara is in a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I layer L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic and L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend Mascara.  Layering different mascara adds little more length and good volume.  L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend Mascara is about $8.  I like this mascara the best but wanted to find one that mimics real lash extension.  I applied 3D Fiber Lash on one eye and Telescopic and Double Extend on the other, both looked very similar. Both looks messy, but.. oh well.</li>
            <li> I love it, worked as described!  It&#x27;s easy to remove unlike other fiber lash mascara that required you to use a type of make up remover.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Works way better than Younique!!!, It doesn&#x27;t dry out at all. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I like Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lash Mascara. On the first attempt, I got a good result. Good, but not great. I get double again the length with one of my favorite mascaras. I&#x27;ll stick with my mascara and save all the steps.</li>
            <li> One gift that was on my wishlist this past Christmas was a fiber mascara.  I&#x27;ve fallen in love with using false eyelashes to amp up my eye makeup, but they are time consuming and just not always appropriate for all occasions for me.  That&#x27;s why - when Mia Adora approached me to try out their 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, there was absolutely no way that I&#x27;d turn down that opportunity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the little satin-lined box that mascara comes in from Mia Adora is absolutely ADORABLE.  It even has a magnetic closure, ensuring that it stays shut when you want it to.  When I first used the enclosed mascara, I noticed it was quite a bit drier than my holy grail mascara.  I could only do one set of lashes at a time, or it&#x27;d be completely dry before I even got the fibers up to it (Right eye, top lashes first, then left eye top lashes, followed by right eye bottom lashes, and finally left eye bottom lashes).  The fibers clung to the lashes quite easily, however there was a little bit of fall out - but that is to be expected!  If it bothers you too much, I recommend holding a tissue or oil sheet under your eye to catch any fibers that don&#x27;t stick.  After I was all finished I went back and coated the fibery lashes with one more coat of the mascara - and WOW!  They really did look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second time trying out the product, I decided to see how it&#x27;d work if I used my wetter mascara as the initial coat.  This time, it was even better.  The wet lashes grabbed every little fiber they could off of the wand, making my lashes look even more volumous (but honestly, a little too clumpy).  I went back through with a pin to separate any huge clumps of lashes that just looked awkward - and then finished up with Mia Adora&#x27;s mascara.  Ever since, this has been my go-to way of putting on mascara.  It leaves me with absolutely gorgeous lashes that still look natural and not too over-the-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough - even to people who normally don&#x27;t wear much makeup.  Mascara makes such a difference and brightens up your eyes so well - and this product is significantly less expensive than other similar options!  My photo attached is after strictly using only the Mia Adora fiber lash mascara - when I use my favorite way of combining the fiber lashes with my regular mascara, they are even more dramatic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I&#x27;ve since purchased the fiber lashes from a competitor brand - you know, the ones that people have home parties for?  I wanted to see how this mascara stood up against the expensive stuff - and it was fantastic!  I think I actually prefer the Mia Adora mascara more!t wear much makeup.

            <li> I love that this product is free of so many things I try to avoid.  It takes a few applications to get the hang of it.  It&#x27;s all about getting the right stroke.  I love the way it looks.  Make sure to seal the lashes well or they can flake off and irritate the eyes.  I only wish that they could be applied in one step!  Great mascara!</li>
            <li> I love it!... I followed directions as listed &amp; I already seen the difference.üòäüòÄ</li>
            <li> Lashes appear thicker and longer exactly as I wanted.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great to achieve a nice full eyelash to top of your look. There are instructions in the box and the product is easy to apply. While I did not receive as drastic results as the product picture shows, I was very happy with the volume enhancement that I was able to achieve. I had no problems with sensitivity and my only complaint would be that it dries out your eyelashes. Still, it is a great mascara to thicken those lashes for the night out!</li>
            <li> I bought this as advised from someone else.  It&#x27;s really easy to use and super cool.  I&#x27;m not adept at difficult things to apply but this is great.</li>
            <li> Sooo much easier than fake eyelashes and they look glam.</li>
            <li> It is an absolutely fine mascara. However, not as wonderfully awesome as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this Mascara at a very deep discount to give a review. I had high hopes that it would be AMAZING and make my lashes appear longer than they really are. I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY when I tried it!! It was easier to apply than I had anticipated. When I placed my order I have imagined the mess I would make all over my face and counter trying to apply the fibers, how I would have them drop on my eyeball, and cause discomfort.... WRONG!! It was easy as pie! the fibers didnt fall into my eye and there was ZERO mess! it stayed on all day and came right off with water!! I am in LOVE with this mascara and will be replacing my old product!! Thanks for making such an INCREDIBLE Mascara!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I was asked to try the new 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora since I have such fine, thin lashes I of course jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;Nestled in a black box are two silver tubes. One tube of Magnifying Gel and one tube of Natural Fiber Lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Starting with the box, it‚Äôs a great box with a magnet that keeps the box closed. The tubes are also inside a satin cut out. But the best part is the fact that the instructions are clearly printed on the inside lid. That was very helpful for me.&lt;br /&gt;Mia Adora recommends that you apply the product one eye at a time. The first step is to apply the Magnifying Gel from base of your lashes to top; 15-20 strokes. The Magnifying Gel looks like regular mascara except this gel separates your lashes and primes them for the Natural Fibers Lashes. The Natural Fiber Lashes looks like black lint stuck to a mascara wand. These are your fibers.&lt;br /&gt;While the Magnifying Gel is still wet, apply 10-15 strokes of the Natural Fiber Lashes from mid-lash to the top. Wait for 20 seconds for the fibers to dry. Then apply another 15-20 strokes of the Magnifying Gel. This step locks the fibers in place.&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with my finished look and with just one full coat (all three steps equals one coat) I am thrilled with how full my lashes look. My lashes are longer, fuller and full of volume. I‚Äôm quite pleased!&lt;br /&gt;You can add 2 or even 3 coats for more of a dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;I wear contact lenses and I had no problem using this 3D Fiber Lash Mascara. I experienced no flakes or smudges either!!&lt;br /&gt;More to love is the fact that you can start your base coat with your own mascara for an even more dramatic look. Made with 100% Green Tea, Paraben and SLS Free. 3D Fibers from Mia Adora is never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.

            <li> Hi, well my name is Brittni Espinosa and this is my fianc&amp;eacute;s Amazon account just FYI.. Anyways.. I absolutely LOVE my Mia Adore fiberglass mascara. It definitely gives my eyelashes volume!! &amp; for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.. I will post a before and after picture later on. Yayyy so excited to be using this mascara FINALLY!!</li>
            <li> This really works on my sparse, short lashes.  The gel alone makes the lashes look fuller and longer.  I only use one application of the gel and fibers as instructed, followed by my mascara -- amazing results.  I am not trying for a fake-lash-catwalk look, but those who want that will certainly get it with this product.  Just don&#x27;t use too much of the fiber, curl your lashes first and be ready to separate them with a lash brush or comb to avoid any clumps.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  The fibers end up irritating the eyes.</li>
            <li> Best ever!!! Throwing out the falsies!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara! I just wish the price wasn&#x27;t so steep. But you get what you pay for and what you get is a quality product all around. Even the box the mascara is in is this high quality cardboard with a soft silky lining. If you are skeptical about this mascara, don&#x27;t be! It works! My lashes are already pretty long naked so this makes me look like I have falsies on. I went out with my girlfriends and they all noticed my lashes without me saying anything. It gives you length, volume, and it thickens your lashes. The more you layer the product, the more of a dramatic look you will get. Now they say you have to practice with it, you do. There is a learning curve believe it or not. The first few times I kept getting fibers in my eyes and I wasn&#x27;t layering it enough so I wasn&#x27;t happy. But i started experimenting, and the ebook they send you really does help with giving you some tips and techniques to try. Now I don&#x27;t leave the house without applying this. I wear one layer for work for a more subtle look and 3 or 4 layers when I go out. This mascara does what it says, nothing more, nothing less. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well. I was hoping for length and definition and I got both! Lasts long, removes very easily, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes at all. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell, but that was only when the tube was open. There is no smell once it&#x27;s on your lashes. I give this two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, easy to remove, and I have fuller and longer lashes through out the day.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This mascara is wonderful! I have always had beautiful lashes, but the older one gets the less you have, well for all of you ladies who are experiencing what I have do not hesitate! You will love this product</li>
            <li> This mascara isn&#x27;t clumpy. It has fibers that go on your lashes, that appear like hair that you apply after first priming with the larger mascara then again after fiber mascara to lock in. You can apply as many coats as you want to achieve your desired length and fullness. I love this product.  I can&#x27;t go back to normal mascara again after using this fiber mascara. I highly recommend this product  to anyone who has trouble with false lashes and wishes to have the effects Falsies have. Its also very easy to take off as well. Simple eye remover or even baby oil to remove. Top 2 brands in my opinion of the fiber mascaras as I have tried all brands out there To compare.</li>
            <li> Tried Younique - loved it, so was not too excited to try another a different brand, but Younique isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;available&amp;#34; as I want it to be.  I absolutely love it, no fibers in my eyes, and they look fantastic - definately switching.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes so everything bothers me. The only irritation I get is if a piece of fiber gets in my eye. It is different and I had to get use to it after few application it became simple to apply.</li>
            <li> This leaves your lashes pretty and flair;not clumped together. I would assume my lashes will get longer and even more beautiful</li>
            <li> My mother loves the 3D lashes, she got it right on the first try. she will recommend to my sisters and her friends.</li>
            <li> Sold for life! Practice makes perfect but what I can tell you this is a great alternative to eye lash extensions, but the same fantastic result !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s and my lashes are becoming more and more sparse.  Wow, was I amazed at the difference this has made!  A few people have asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes.  ;-)  I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> You have to learn to use it, but once you get the hang out it, its awesome! Long and thick lashes!</li>
            <li> Love it! Definitely my favorite fiber lash, doesn&#x27;t run or leak and looks GREAT!</li>
            <li> Did not come out as dark as the picture.  Fibers only stayed on for a few minutes.  Had to reapply often and when I rubbed my eyes it all came off.</li>
            <li> I adore Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D lash mascara .I applied it once and didn&#x27;t have to reapply throughout the day. It gives me the look I want. I keep my makeup very simple and so I am very pleased. It opened up my eyes a little more. The application is smooth, I love the brush and packaging,fast shipping, and this mascara has not caused any eye irritation or sensitivity. I am happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had long lashes, but they weren&#x27;t necessarily thick so they never stood out unless I applied about 2 coats of mascara. I was really impressed with Mia Adora 3D fiber lashes and decided to buy this brand because it has natural and safe ingredients (compared to other brands). I also prefer animal cruelty-free products (not tested on animals) so, that was another reason behind me getting this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Magnifying gel and fiber lashes are NOT clumpy if you do a smooth application and lasts all day (12-16 hours at least).  I didn&#x27;t have to do a touch up at anytime during the day--that was a definite plus. Also, I was surprised at how easy the mascara washed off with my face wash and water. I prefer to remove my eye makeup with coconut oil since it soothes my skin/eye-lids and this mascara wiped off really well after I applied just a dab of coconut oil and warm water. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and my lashes look great! I get compliments on them now so, I guess my eyes really stand out once I apply things like eyeshadow and shape my eyebrows well.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to apply and made a big difference i will continue to purchase this product for sure! Thank you for making my eyes better</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, was a mix up with receiving the E-book but that was successfully resolved by the seller. Will order again and thank you seller for such good follow-up and resolution of the issue&lt;br /&gt;Maureen Stevens</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading the reviews and I thought I would give it a try; I also purchased their eyelash curler as well. I have very short straight lashes and have always used an eyelash curler along with waterproof mascara and my lashes always stayed curled. I was looking for a more of a dramatic look and thought I had found it. My lashes do not stay curled at all and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t a fan of this product at all...the step 2 piece of it didn&#x27;t work well at all....the brush was very thin with a pointy piece sticking out the the end of the brush....</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product &amp; the cost is more friendly compared to others products out there and it does the same thing!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Only have to apply one round for longer lashes, but will apply two if going out. Great customer service too. They called to see if I liked it and how it was working. The next week they sent me an entire tube for free. I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Found it to be easy to use and worked as advertised.  Would recommend this product.  Thanks Mia Adora</li>
            <li> I would never live without Mia Adore Fiber lash! No more false lashes for me!</li>
            <li> This mascara is great. I have lots of eye allergies and this mascara is gentle enough that it does not bother me. It give me the full look as if I was wear fake natural lashes. I love this product and will reorder again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Second order and I have tried other brands... nothing compares to this mascara</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara. It takes time to put on as it requires multiple layers, but definitely gives quite a dramatic effect if you want to spend the time putting many layers on. The little fibers do irritate my eyes a bit, so I don&#x27;t wear it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the first step of this product does not work as well as if I use my own mascara with it. When I use a mascara that has its own thickening and lengthening features to it, it seems to provide much better coverage than the mascara included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love it and get many, many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> I had to use the product a couple times to get the hang of it. It works better if you apply a regular mascara before the first coat of gel &amp; fibers. Not sure if its worth the money only because if you love long thick lashes you have to keep applying &amp; building up your lashes, which may lead to little fibers flaking &amp; ending up all over your face by the end of the day.. but for special occasions &amp; date nights, it&#x27;s a good product.. Just not for all day long. One thing that surprised me though, is that my eyes didnt feel irritable at all &amp; I didn&#x27;t find the fibers in my eye every five minutes like I expected to.</li>
            <li> Worked great. Was allergic to it though. Made my eyes red</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to darken and lengthen my lashes and found the perfect 3D mascara! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleases with this product. Unlike a similar product I have used, it stays on all day, but comes off much easier comparably speaking.</li>
            <li> I want to return but u couldn&#x27;t its terrible and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes longer and all stuck together.. I just want my money back... Very disappointing!!&lt;br /&gt;Ashley</li>
            <li> The Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lashes are a great investment! With two girls who wear fake eyelashes for dance performances - we were looking for a product that would replace the need for constantly buying the fake lashes and glue. Also, fake eyelashes have a tendency to not stay in place during the hours and hours of performances on stage. The Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lashes went on easily - just follow the simple steps in the product guide. The product gives the appearance of full thick lashes - the exact look we were going for. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this being that my eye lashes are blonde and some what short and thin.  The first time I used it I was amazed at how long and full it made them look. I&#x27;ve tried many high end mascaras that claim to do the same thing that cost a lot more money.  For the price this works just as well and stays on all day with out flaking or smudging. I am very pleased with this product the only draw back is to get the full effect it takes several applications so it takes 10 to 15 min to apply, other than that it I love everything about it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece and she normally buys a cheaper version for $8.00 and saw the difference with this one.  Goes on much better and smoother.  Great product.  Looks like false eyelashes, Just stunning.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s everything I was looking for, although now that I know what my lashes look like with the fibers, I don&#x27;t want to go back to regular mascara and this is a lot more expensive. Also, sunglasses are a little uncomfortable to wear while using this product because the added length pushes against the lense.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box and tried to use it for the first time it was dried up!!  They only give you one month to return and I didn&#x27;t need it right then.  After I used up the mascara I was using, I opened up this one (1 1/2 months after purchase) and got dried up flakes.  Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying fiber mascara, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I like it! As other reviewers have said, I&#x27;ve definitely gotten better with practice. The first time I tried it, I noticed a lot of the little fibers falling on my under eye/cheek area throughout the day. The next time I made sure to do more of the &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; coat after applying the fibers, and that helped a lot. I&#x27;ve also done one layer of my regular mascara underneath the first layer of Mia Adora, and that works very well. All in all it&#x27;s a nice product and I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product rocks. So easy to use and my lashes and my eyes look better than ever. I will never go back to traditional mascara. Thank you Mia Adora.</li>
            <li> Awesome Mascara will continue to buy this. Makes my lashed super long</li>
            <li> I will never go back to normal mascara after using this. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this at all. I have used fiber lash mascara before so I know how to apply it. This flaked off, left smudges, etc.</li>
            <li> The gel was very dry and the fibers barely came off the brush. Won&#x27;t repurchase. Will go for a different brand.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my new mascara!!! It&#x27;s PERFECT for my lashes. My lashes are light and scarce, but farely long and the first time I used it it looked like I was wearing falsie. Thank you soooo much!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> Ordering with Mia Adora was quick and easy. I have been wanting to try this product for so long. I love that it came with an eyelash curler. Something I will be working into my beauty routine. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product! Like it a lot! Dominique E.</li>
            <li> My wife had me order this on her behalf and cannot go a day without using this mascara. She loves this product very much.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other fiber mascaras, and found that the fibers ended up around the skin surrounding your eyes...not exactly your best look!!&lt;br /&gt;I find that Midora goes on smoother, right amount of fiber, and does not migrate to skin surrounding eyes!!!  I highly recommend this product for long, and natural looking eyelashes!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dell B</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. I would highly recommend it to anyone that wears mascara.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it did extend my lashes but I have regular mascara that works just the same.mi was hesitant using this product and didn&#x27;t load on the fibres as I was scared some would fall in my eyes and cause a issue. The photo is me with the product on.</li>
            <li> I just got that mascara literally this morning. It&#x27;s late afternoon and mascara still holds on the curl, volume and length. I have relatively long lashes already so was looking for something giving me more volume. My husband described my look as more Hollywoody as he put it. Maybe not for everyday but definitely to go out and celebrations. It&#x27;s a little clumpy but not more than most mascaras. I used little brush to separate lashes. So far I&#x27;m very pleased. You need to follow directions precisely.I would like a little less clumpy but that would be perfect mascara that I don&#x27;t think exists yet but this is pretty close. It gives me this glamorous look that you can&#x27;t achieve with regular mascara but only with falsies. I don&#x27;t know how easy is to remove it yet, so can&#x27;t judge on that part but so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with this purchase! I love how my eyelashes look both dramatic yet natural.This mascara is perfect for wearing from day to night and super easy to take off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I used it once and I can get the same results with Maybelline great las.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love! Mascara is not sticky. Lightweight, easy to put on and wash off. Pictures speak for themselves :o)</li>
            <li> Want ridiculously long, lush lashes? So did I... Then, I found this product. Heavenly!</li>
            <li> Great mascara - does what it says, but it takes many coats to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> This product works really well. I noticed a huge difference with how long and thick my eyelashes looked. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! It is a little hard to get the hang of with the fibers, but don&#x27;t give up!! So worth it! I was going to put on false lashes for my nephews wedding this weekend, now I don&#x27;t need to. Your lashes look awesome!! Thick and full like false ones, yet very natural looking. I will never use another mascara. I&#x27;m so excited I bought them!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have used products like this before and i must say this is one of my favorite! It made my lashes look full and long. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Men! Why is it that they always seem to have the long, beautiful, natural lashes? We ladies have to try and keep up with their girlish looks and wear mascara. How preposterous! Wait...what&#x27;s that in the distance? Is that a glorious angel descending from heaven with mascara in her hands. Look! Her lashes are simply angelic ;) She&#x27;s come to share her secrets with us mortals. What&#x27;s this? Two different layers of lashes? How do I...woah! Ok, ok...so one is sort of like mascara and then the other one adds these tiny little fibers onto your lashes. Seem like a bit of a process. I can keep adding fibers until my lashes are so long that I can&#x27;t open my eyes fully?? Perfect! Thank you, sweet, wonderful angel of beauty. Now I know that even angels have to use mascara to keep up with these men with beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> The Too Faced version of this was much better.  I can achieve better results with standard prestige mascara.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. I expected more for the price. Ive used cheaper ones that worked better. So sad really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my cousin. She had some trouble using it at first but after some time she was able to build the look she wanted.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this 3d mascara. It comes in such a cute little box. It&#x27;d easy to use and I love how the directions are right on box as soon as you open it. It makes my lashes full and long and doesn&#x27;t clump! Its a must have and I&#x27;ll be buying again</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Make my lashes fuller &amp; longer. Its a 3 step process easy to follow instructions printed on the case. If ur lashes are not to long this is a great product to lengthen ur lashes.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! I also own the competitor&#x27;s product that costs around 10x as much. Would definitely recommend to anyone considering a fiber mascara!! Thank you for the affordable alternative!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I could have only wished for lashes like this before.  No more glue or irritated eye with this product.  I recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  So easy!  Looks like I spent way more time than I actually have.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product!!!</li>
            <li> I tried the Younique brand for my first fiber lash product, in comparison to that, I feel this is just as good.  I do notice fall out during the day but that could be my fault for applying too much.  Makes my lashes look super thick and long.  I love fiber lashes vs fake for daily wear.  It washes off easy and does not cause irritation - I have very sensitive eyes and this product is great for me. I would tell any of my friends to buy it!</li>
            <li> Very nice product! Satisfied with the result...</li>
            <li> I got hooked on fiber mascara when my boss sold me younique mascara. And the younique mascara was great...for about two weeks. My Mia Adora mascara has been great for over a month! Seriously get this instead it&#x27;s just as good and lasts wayyyy longer. Also, the company is amazing and really makes an effort to make sure you are happy with your product. You can&#x27;t beat this stuff.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look much longer than usual mascaras.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. It&#x27;s my first time to use fiber lash mascara but do see a difference. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful.  I have sensitive eyes and this product works great for me. Looks very natural.  Its the best mascara I think I have ever owned. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It makes my lashes look so long and full i have been asked several times if i wear false eye lashes.  I have tried other fiber mascara but this is the best.</li>
            <li> I love fiber lashes and not too long ago discovered them!!!  I have blonde hair and that means I have fine light eyelashes.  I have been looking for something to make my eyes pop forevvvvvver!  I have tried another fiber lash mascara which constantly flaked off on my face.  This brand does not flake but it does not give me the volume the other does, so I wish I could combine the two.  To get the results I want I have to do the steps at least 2 times.  Overall I like this brand better, but I guess I&#x27;m looking for the perfect product.  Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it! I get lots of compliments how perfect my eyelashes look. Its simple quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I love this, it does work, doesn&#x27;t orritate. It looks oh so real on youth eyelashes.  Just use warm soap water to remove</li>
            <li> It is nice for a special occasion but not for every day.</li>
            <li> Promotional discount provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in 2 tubes.  It is not the easiest to put on, but it&#x27;s not really hard either.  It contains beeswax and green tea fibers.  One tube is the &#x27;gel&#x27; that you apply first and last.  It has the wax in it, and will color lashes fairly nice just by itself.  The second tube has green tea fibers, and comes with a extremely short bristled brush.  It has fibers that you apply, then you cover that with another coat of the first tube to &#x27;seal&#x27; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I usually have to clean my eye area up a bit after application - the fibers do get in places I don&#x27;t mean them to be, but a q-tip takes care of it pretty easily.  The mascara is NOT waterproof, and can&#x27;t really survive a nap or roll in the hay- my experience is that I end up, not with flaking, but fibers of black, like little hairs, on my face.  In normal wear though - like to go to town or out to eat, the mascara performs well as long as you don&#x27;t cry. IF you do cry, it doesn&#x27;t run, but the fibers start to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very gentle on my eyes- I have not experienced any burning or irritation.  It might not work well for contact lens wearers though - the fibers might be a real issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lengthens and thickens about as good as Covergirl Bombshell, but it is a lot easier to get off.  Forgive the pictures below, I was pretty tired when I took them.  As you can see, my lashes are normally very blonde.  They are, however, naturally fairly long, but because of their color, you can&#x27;t really see that.  The mascara colors them well, and thickens them a good bit.</li>
            <li> This 3D fiber lash mascara from Mia Adora is truly amazing and has gave me hope I could have beautiful lashes. I was cursed to be born with lashes that grow down and do not curl up. I have had a very difficult time finding something that would both keep my lashes out of my eyes, but also put them on display. This is the answer!!!! I am so excited that I was given the opportunity to review this item at no cost to me and it ended up  being better than I could have ever dreamed. My only concern is that it takes so many cost to finish the process but I am more than willing to do them because of the end result. I recommend this product for anyone that has issues with their lashes, not matter the issue. This is a must for all woman who wear makes and most of all mascara.</li>
            <li> Need some getting use to but once your technique is practiced, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to hassle with applying false lashes, this is the next best thing. My lashes looked longer and bolder compared to every mascara I used before. I had a friend who asked me if I was wearing false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go-to mascara. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but definitely worth the price if you want that striking false lash-look.</li>
            <li> Not like the photo...at all. It does extend the eyelashes however they clump and the wand for the mascara is a joke.</li>
            <li> i dnt have long thick lashes so this 3d fiber mascarra is so perfect for me. The price is not that expensive but the quality is so amazing. I gave 5 star because i love the product...as in literally im using it everyday...Before im using another brand famous brand but it doest have the result like this 3d fiber lash. Im like hello thick long lashes now :) Happy and satisfied costumer here :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is easy to apply. I did notice that the pieces flake off as the day goes on but that is as expected. I would highly recommend this item if you are looking for a more dramatic look. The sellers are also very pleasant to deal with.</li>
            <li> I usually use another brand, but tried this because it was a little less expensive. However, it does not come close to working as well as my previous brand. The &amp;#34;base and finishing mascara&amp;#34; part of this set is not thick, or nearly wet and sticky enough to hold and build the fibers correctly. So I usually use one of my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mascaras with it instead. That said, that may be a partial explanation for the cause of the eye irritation that occurs after a couple of hours of wearing (fibers start falling in your eyes). However, that also occurs when the mascara provided is used as well.</li>
            <li> In love with this product. It works fantastic and makes my eye lashes look gorgeous! This is a must have!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually very surprised at how well these mascaras work. I went out on a limb, &amp; purchased these mascaras. Upon first try, the mascara clumped up really easily, but after using the product 3-4 more times (&amp; got more practice!) my eyelashes couldn&#x27;t be anymore amazing. Their length is definitely a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> The product is good. I love how it makes your eyelashes longer however I hate the falling pieces of microfibers. I usually apply 3 coats of both and made sure it&#x27;s  sealed by the step 1 and 3 mascara but still the microfibers keeps falling. Lately I do not use the step 2 much.</li>
            <li> I love it !! :) it arrived before time and it works great! :)</li>
            <li> Love the way my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Younique and thought that I would give this a try based on the reviews. This product does a better job at keeping the eyelashes separated/looking full, however Younique does a MUCH better job at making the eyelashes look longer.  I ended up buying another Younique mascara and will stick to that...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and found this to be the best I have ever used. When used correctly - you look like you have on eyelash extensions. This product is very natural looking and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> this mascara works so well! I get asked if I am wearing fake lashes all the time. I absolutely adore my Mia Adora. I have recommended this product to anyone that has asked me about the makeup that I use. I will most definitely be a continued customer.</li>
            <li> I have thin and small eyelashes. I love doing applying my make up but it never looks complete since i don&#x27;t like wearing falsies. I am so happy I tried this mascara. It leaves my eyelashes thick and full! This is going to be my go to mascara. Thank you Adore!</li>
            <li> Received it fast and it works great.;</li>
            <li> Love this product! Really see the difference immediately</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product initially. I hate clumpy, spider looking lashes and my eyes are sensitive to everything! Reading the reviews I thought it&#x27;d be difficult to learn to apply.It wasn&#x27;t at all! I read the directions ONCE and viola, gorgeous lashes!! You can apply more or less for the look you&#x27;re trying to obtain. My lashes are thin and not very long. I curled them and applied the mascara as directed and they looked amazing. So much fuller and longer!!!! It stayed on nicely all day and didn&#x27;t smudge. My eyes are sensitive and itch with a lot of eye makeup. My eyes didn&#x27;t itch once with this on! It was easily removed with baby wash.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply and my lashes look amazing</li>
            <li> Horrible for short Asian eyelashes. Instead of producing long and luscious lashes, I got a thick and clumpy mess.  Definitely not worth $30!</li>
            <li> Its amazing!!! I used everyday and all my friends say that really natural and great. The ibook help me a lot too</li>
            <li> I really liked this product I can&#x27;t use it everyday because of the price. I would use it for special date night with husband. I also liked how long they were. It did take a few trys to get it the  way I wanted but will use it again. Plus my teenage grab it so am buying my own soon. I also received this product free or discounted from the company for a review.</li>
            <li> I have use a lot of mascaras, this one makes your eyelashes a lot longer and not fake</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara, it is very long lasting. The fibers did not come off in my eyes, even during intense gym workouts. It made my eyelashes pop without having to add false lases. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered these just to try a different brand. I am addicted to getting individual lashes and since I have been so busy a friend recommended these. I used my first brand up and wanted to try this brand to see the difference. These aren&#x27;t as good as my other brand. When I use the first stick the stick doesn&#x27;t have as much glue on it. I have to keep putting it in the container to get more. The fibers are plentiful, no problem there. So since I&#x27;m having problems with the glue the fibers get in my eyes more frequently. The stick seems almost dry except for the end of the stick.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve seen my lashes look so big and natural I&#x27;m in love with this product. .and it arrived on time,  package was in perfect conditions....im Definitely getting more after it&#x27;s done üòÜ...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!!! Great product</li>
            <li> I have tried several fiber lash mascaras and this is by far, not only the most natural looking but the one that is non irritating.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Niki C</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome, so much cheaper than other brands:-)</li>
            <li> Makes your eyelashes look fabulous !</li>
            <li> I really like this fiber lashes made my eye really stand out.&lt;br /&gt;Jamie D.</li>
            <li> U need to try it to believe it! I had many compliments of my lashes n the best part of this product is that it made my real lashes strong and fuller. I love it so much that i started recomending it to all my friends n coworkers!</li>
            <li> It REALLY works!  I was VERY skeptical about plopping down $30.00 for some MASCARA, but with the 60 day money back guarentee, I figured I had nothing to loose!  I am SURE glad I did!!!  On my FIRST try my lashes look a LOT fuller and longer than with ANY traditional mascara.  I HARDLY have ANY lashes, they are extremely short and very sparse, but this 3-D Mascara really did make my eyes pop out even without any eyeshadow at ALL!!!  If you actually already have decent lashes then this stuff is REALLY going to make them long and luscious !!! All in all, I am happy that I got this mascara!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were short and damaged. I had to write a review about how amazing this product is. I will never get eyelash extensions again. This mascara works miracles!</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but able to get the same results with my Better Than Sex mascara by Too Faced. Still did well for a night out, but not for everyday</li>
            <li> Really enjoying the product. Tricky at first but then I read the manual they send you via email and it helped in how successful I am in applying it. It works well. I&#x27;m giving my lashes a break from lash extensions so this is a good solution.</li>
            <li> I truly love this mascara. I don&#x27;t have long lashes and when i use this product it&#x27;s like magic. I instantly have full and long lashes. Another thing that i love is that it doesn&#x27;t clump or smuge. I will be a returning costumer.</li>
            <li> Super easy and great results, I&#x27;m not that skilled and have had no problems with it&lt;br /&gt;Gabriela G.</li>
            <li> They fall off to muchüòû</li>
            <li> I liked it and thought it was very good</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product overall.</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be somewhat of an expert in 3D fiber lash mascara. I have tried Younique and just about every other fiber lash mascara. I was on a mission to find a 3d fiber mascara that was the perfect consistency. I purchased Younique through one of their Younique representatives but found it to be heavy and while it added length I didn&#x27;t care for the spidery look it gave to my lashes. I am no stranger to fiber lash mascara. It took a little practice but I decided to try other 3d fiber lash products on Amazon. Well I found just the right one! Mia Adora! As with all fiber lash mascara it has a tube with the gel and the other tube contains all natural green tea fibers. But here&#x27;s the best news. The gel glides on your lashes and gives them great length. They do not look spidery nor does it clump. Then you apply the fibers. Let them set for 30 seconds and then seal with the gel. I only need to do one application to get long full natural looking lashes. The gel has no odor like other products I have tried and no flaking or smudging.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive eyes and Mia Adora did not irritate at all. Lasts all day until I&#x27;m ready to remove at night. Removal is super easy. Warm water on a round cotton pad and it swipes right off. No damage to your lashes! There may be less expensive fiber lash mascara but trust me they will damage your lashes. My lashes are on the thin sparse side so there is no way I am going to jeopardize damaging my lashes. Like I said I have tried them all and Mia Adora is the best!</li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars because I did not get the wow factor I was really truly expecting. I use L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous mascara and if I apply the same amount of layers I will get the same results. I bought this product wanting to see what the hype was all about. I YouTubed several videos of several different brands and felt Mia would be my best option. In the videos and on the photos this particular brand shows, the ladies who are trying the mascara on already have longer than normal eyelashes so it looks more appealing. I would say I have average eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did curl my eyelashes before hand. I tried both ways. Applying my mascara first and then following the steps and just applying the gel and the fibers without my mascara. I personally like not using my own mascara at the start and the third time I tried the mascara I actually used my personal mascara to help seal in the fibers which seemed to work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: my eyelashes in the corner of my eyes did appear a little longer. My eyelashes appeared fuller/thicker. Wasn&#x27;t too messy for me but I also used a foundation brush to brush away a couple fibers that fell off.  Comes off easily with an oil based cream eye make up remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: don&#x27;t put the fibers on your bottom eye lashes. Some fibers will get into your eyes. I would not suggest wearing this mascara if you are going to be in a vehicle that has air blowing in your face or be outside if it is windy. Fibers will flake off into your eyes if there is even a slight breeze blowing on your face. I would use only if you are going out to an event.This mascara didn&#x27;t bother my eyes until about 4 hours after wear. Then it did feel a bit flaky. It did not give my length that I was hoping for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly it only comes in black. HUGE BUMMER I almost didn&#x27;t even try it specifically for that reason alone. I&#x27;m a red head and wear dark brown mascara. Not pitch black. Picture below is me wearing two coats of Mia and the fibers in BLACK</li>
            <li> Goes on quickly and easily with great coverage! Not clumpy. Love it!</li>
            <li> The product is great, and I have not gone back to my old mascara and never plan to!!!!&lt;br /&gt;-Makela B</li>
            <li> This product was worth every penny. It does what it says it does. Odorless,  easy to use and will purchase again. Very happy with product and price.</li>
            <li> I really love this 3d fiber mascara...... each day I am getting better at appplying it!!! will purchase again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara. I don&#x27;t have to curl them and they don&#x27;t clump if you follow the directions and take your time. Yes... It&#x27;s somewhat time consuming, about 5 minutes for me, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like the 3D lash mascara...i will Re buy once mine is finished. .</li>
            <li> I like this mascara alot. It makes my lashes look thick &amp; very glamorous. It took me several trys to get my technique down but now I can apply it quickly &amp; efficiently. As the day goes on I get fibers on my upper lids &amp; just under my eyes. Perhaps I need another coat of gel as final step.</li>
            <li> Works great! I definitely notice a difference in my lash length. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and absolutely love it! I have been wanting to try a fiber mascara for a while and was going to try another brand but then I saw the reviews on the Mia Dora fiber mascara and ordered it.  I have stick straight Asian eyelashes and have tried a lot of mascaras but wanted the look of false lashes without the hassle.  The first time I tried this it was an OMG moment.  My lashes looked amazing and my eyes looked so big! It was easy to use, I had to clean up a few of the fibers in my waterline but nothing  too difficult. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the tube with the gel in it seemed a little dry.  I would think the gel would have more in it.  Other than that I would definitely order this again.&lt;br /&gt;Jeanne K.</li>
            <li> Overall good product it did what its meant to do ..I used to wear fake eyelashes everyday n with this product I have no need to any longer ... I recommend this product to anyone who like me has almost no eyelashes ... will be purchasing :-)</li>
            <li> I used to wear lash extensions which I loved but after a year started getting tired of the monthly upkeep, plus it wasn&#x27;t exactly cheap. After all my extensions fell out all were left were skimpy, short, broken lashes. I didn&#x27;t realize how destructive extensions can be. It&#x27;s been over a year now since I stopped and had been using various lash growing serums which worked wonderfully but didn&#x27;t give my lashes that nice, full look. Since then I&#x27;ve experimented with falsies but they never stayed on the entire night--plus it&#x27;s embarrassing to discover half of it hanging off one eye after a few hours. So---I thought I&#x27;d try fiber lash mascara. As a contact lens wearer I was a little hesitant but it quickly subsided after reading some reviews. I just got this today and quickly tried it, following the directions carefully. The results: I love the length, they don&#x27;t look like mangled spider legs and kinda give that false eyelash look. I don&#x27;t have the fullness, but I am completely satisfied with the final results. So far, no irritation to my eyes/contacts. This will be my holy grail of mascaras!</li>
            <li> It is really good. It does provide some length to your eyelashes and well as volume for sure but it is not &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34;. You have to expend some amount of time layer after layer to get the full benefits from it and after all, the benefits are not so far from the one you can get from regular and cheaper brand like covergirl, marbelline or so. I have to say  as big PRO that last for the all day, no messy and the best that made it superior to any other mascara use before, it is when you washed it do not left any print</li>
            <li> Tough to get right apparently. I&#x27;ve had better success with Younique.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a little unbelievable in its performance. I am impatient when I am applying it and don&#x27;t put on as many layers as one is advised and it is still the most amazing mascara ever. It comes in a pretty box and is two steps to apply. This is just slightly more work then normal mascara, and is worth it. I have not cried or sweated with the mascara on yet, neither have I swam in it. It comes off very easily with warm water, and there are no black smudges around my eyes the next morning. Oh and I must add, it does not go on clumpy.</li>
            <li> I love my Mia adora fiber lashes! It was my first time trying this kind of mascara, but I absolutely love them! Shipping was fast too! Even came a day early!</li>
            <li> The fiber lashes are very easy to apply.  Your lashes will look 3x longer and fuller just by using the fiber lashes.  I noticed that the effects are greater if you apply 2 coats of fiber lashes instead of just one coat.  Also, you should allow your fiber lashes to set/dry before blinking so the fibers don&#x27;t fall under your eyes.  The set/dry only takes about 30 seconds.  I did not have any irritation of my eyes from using this product.  I recommend using fiber lashes for all occasions.</li>
            <li> Love this!  So much better than regular mascara...and so glad I don&#x27;t have to pay for eyelash extensions!&lt;br /&gt;Super glad I made this purchase!!</li>
            <li> I love it it makes my lashes look amazing</li>
            <li> I received this mascara a few days ago and i am LOVING it. I have tried a few 3d mascaras, including Younique 3d fiber lash and none of them compare! This one is the best i have used. I will continue to purchase this one. Surprisingly, it is the cheapest out of all the ones i have tried, which makes it that much better!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this mascara. It makes my lashes look much fuller and thicker. I was afraid that it might be irritating but have found it just as comfortable as any other mascara. I&#x27;ve recommended it to a friend who finished chemo a while ago and is just getting her lashes back.</li>
            <li> I usually use yonuinque mascara and this is very close to it. I do feel that the yonuinque lasts longer as I am almost needing to order more already of Mia brand.</li>
            <li> It is an awesome products.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to use glue and fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, takes some practicing but makes my eyelashes look great. The most important step Is to curl your eyelashes before applying. This makes your eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff really lengthens and plumps lashes. It&#x27;s  easy to apply. Now if it stayed on my lashes, I&#x27;d  be thrilled. I turned into a raccoon within an hour and the fibers were gone within 4 hours. I&#x27;m  bummed because it&#x27;s  back to the falsies for me.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better ones.  Buyer beware with others. This really does work and enables my zero lashes to appear as if falsies.  Great product</li>
            <li> I love it . Made a big difference when I started using it . Would definitely recommend to friends</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and would order again.</li>
            <li> Loved this product!  I have tried other fiber mascaras and this one is just right!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I prefer Unique. It was not the easiest to remove</li>
            <li> Awful. After applying the black powder smudged bad even after following directions with gel.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I was a little iffy at first because i was worried that either it wouldnt work or it would make my lashes look spidery... not good. and although it did not give me super crazy long eyelashes it definitely did make a large improvement of the length. My lashes were not spidery at all!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i have to say is it is time consuming waiting for the fibers to dry when doing multiple coats. BUT beauty takes time right?&lt;br /&gt;Also make sure you wash it off at the end of the night because if you leave it on you might end up with fibers in your eyes the next morning and its not too comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;All in all i would buy this again.</li>
            <li> i liked because it work at the same they show on the picture&lt;br /&gt;my eye look  beutiful and big.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Love it from the first use!! Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I really expected these to be messy and complicated, but found them to be easy to use and look great!  I wear mascara daily, love love LOVE the look of this product.  Only complaint is that I do need to do some clean up after step two...the fibers usually flake a little bit onto my upper cheeks.  After step three, things are good and stay put until end of the day.  Will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> i received this prosuct at a promotional price to give my honest opinion..ive got to say this is probably the best mascara ive ever used..it didnt irritate my eyes which is good because my eyes are sensitive and it blends right in with my natural eyelashes..would def recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed for my first go-around with a Fiber Lash mascara.  The instructions were incredibly easy to follow and application was simple enough.  It did specifically say to not get the fibers close to the eye (stay above half way of lashes), but I still had a few fiber pieces fall into my eye which caused irritation.  It subsided after a while, when I was able to blink them out.  Overall - I like it! As you can see from the pictures, it does a great job of coating my lashes and makes them very full.  (one eye is before application, the other is after)  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that I had to check under my eyes several times a day because the small fibers kept falling off my lashes. The instructions say not to apply the fibers closer to your eye than half the distance of your lashes. To me, that makes my lashes look disproportionate with the ends being very full looking and the base looking like my normal lashes. I don&#x27;t use an expensive mascara, but I really prefer the look of my mascara over the look of this product. I wore this product a total of four times, but I never felt like the affects were dramatic enough for me to switch to this full-time.</li>
            <li> This is the best Mascara I ever had hands down! I was so blown away at how thick and long my lashes got. I am so happy I got it. Very easy to apply and I will definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Product works well, and does not cause irritation. But in order to achieve lashes as long as the picture, many applications fo the product are needed! Only 4 stars for us!</li>
            <li> This mascara is Amazing!!! I have very short lashes and this has made them Really stand out!! I was nervous it would be clumpy and messy but if you take your time and follow the directions it works great. I have never been so happy with a makeup product. This was by far the best deal i have gotten yet.</li>
            <li> I loved it. I have long lashes as normal, but I always wanted to see what I would look like with beautiful full eyelashes. I decided that this one was something that I would like to try, and it works great. I dont deal with irritation in the eyes, and it also gives a wonderful full look. Perfectly dark!</li>
            <li> I like using this product so much more than using fake eyelashes and having to glue them on. The 3D Fiber Lash is not as messy as I thought it might be and stays on pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t give that spider eye look either. I take this everywhere I go now.</li>
            <li> I was genuinely impressed by how long it made my lashes, but after using the product for about 2-3 weeks the natural fibers dried up. I&#x27;m not sure if there is a way to fix that problem without ruining the product or I just got a bad batch, but I was disappointed because I really enjoyed how long my lashes were. As much as I paid I was hoping for a product that lasted a little longer. I would still suggest it to others.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best mascara I have EVER used. I have gotten several compliments. It&#x27;s not waterproof, so I don&#x27;t wear it to surf, but  otherwise, it&#x27;s amazing! It looks very natural. My teenage daughter noticed how long and pretty my lashes looked and had to try it for herself! I also wear contacts, so I have sensitive eyes and this has not given me any problems. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully!  It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not smudge easily!  I love it!</li>
            <li> It really does extend the eyelashes! My eyelashes are average length and I was looking for an everyday mascara that would give me fab lashes! This gives me extra long, borderline extension status lashes! The downfall? It takes about 4-5 minutes to apply and reapply to Achieve the look below (see pic) that I simply don&#x27;t have. I budget 10 minutes in for my whole morning routing so I just don&#x27;t have the time. (Wake up at 430am and I&#x27;d rather sleep the xtra 5 min). I use this for date nights or special occasions.</li>
            <li> Cheaper alternative and no hassle unlike the constant barrage from distributors of Younique. Seems to achieve the exact same result for less money.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I don&#x27;t think there is as much actual product in these tubes as Younique.  I already feel like it almost empty after one month of daily, one layer use.  Younique lasts two months.  It may be cheaper but if it isn&#x27;t going to last, then its not a bargain.</li>
            <li> So disappointed. I was so excited to find this product and read about the all natural ingredients. Unfortunately, I could not stand this product. I know I&#x27;ve read so many others that really do like it very much and I&#x27;m sorry to say that I just do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with it was that it really doesn&#x27;t look natural. It&#x27;s too clumpy, and on top of that a small amount of the fibers consistently fall off while you&#x27;re applying it and got into my eyes and onto my face. I found it really annoying actually. Especially because you&#x27;re having to use these two separate products where you feel like you&#x27;re doing extra work and it&#x27;s really not working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that I really wanted to love, but unfortunately I returned it as I would consider it to be rather defective.</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara because it really gives your lashes instant length. I use about two coats or applications but you can keep building the product up to achieve an even fuller look.</li>
            <li> I saved this product until I went on my Babymoon with my husband.  The first night I used it, he was like, &amp;#34;WOW, what did you do differently?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever used the Younique Fiber Lashes, I would say this product is very compareable.  You apply a gel coat, fiber lash coat, and again &amp;#34;seal it up&amp;#34; with the gel coat.  I found it worked better for me when I first curled my eyelashes &amp; applied my black mascara (which is only optional).  When I sit in front of my mirror and take my time - it looks a lot better than when I am rushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use a coconut oil to remove my eye makeup, and the 3D Fiber Last Mascara by Mia Adora came off with ease.  I highly recommend this product for special occassions when you want a little extra BAM to your gorgeous eyes!</li>
            <li> It really works I love this product I would suggest it to anyone who wants longer beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> I love it. Makes my lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> As a natural Beauty Blogger Im impressed with this products wearability and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes either, just make sure you have a good makeup remover!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the other highly named brands of tea fiber mascara, like Younique.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughter,she loves this.</li>
            <li> Simple to use . Much more effective than regular mascara. I&#x27;d buy again</li>
            <li> Love it! Thank you for this great product.</li>
            <li> It worked Wonderfulllllll no clumping smooth transition</li>
            <li> I have short blonde lashes.  This product made my lashes look much longer and thicker.  It stayed on all day and came off easily with make up remover.  I have recommended this product to my friends.  It&#x27;s priced right also.</li>
            <li> It works really well. It&#x27;s easy to use and the results are pretty amazing. I&#x27;ve always had pretty long lashes so I was hesitant to try fiber lash mascara but I&#x27;m glad that I did. I was also emailed a tutorial which helped with initial application.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara-- great results. Have recommended this to family and friends</li>
            <li> I love this product. I no longer feel the need to wear falsies anymore due to this amazing mascara!</li>
            <li> I have had the pleasure of reviewing Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara and Eyelash Curler, and I have no longing for any other product! When I say this gives you the fullness and length you need, I&#x27;m not kidding. the application is easy, and there is no irritation whatsoever. This is definitely the best mascara I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li> I loved, loved, LOVED this product! I have small thin eyelashes that wouldnt get much volume with regular mascaras until I came across this one. This mascara made my lashes longer, fuller, and volumized, which I didn&#x27;t think I would see possible unless I had falsies on. Although the task of applying the product is quite a bit tedious its absolutely worth it since this mascara stays on all day long and doesnt smudge. I will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> love this, way better than younique!</li>
            <li> This is the first fiber lash mascara I&#x27;ve tried and I like the results. It&#x27;s pretty easy to apply, though I&#x27;m still working on perfecting my technique. Gives nice length and volume for a good price!</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara for my fiance and she loves it! Definitely a great product and the price is great too!</li>
            <li> This 3D fiber mascara is awesome!  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with flaking off or having lose fibers go astray.  The instructions are easy to follow.  Most important this WORKS!</li>
            <li> the fiber glass enhancers can get in your eye/contacts and stick around the lashes for over a day if you don&#x27;t take off well</li>
            <li> I have only used this 3D fiber lash mascara once so far and I am impressed. I applied it this morning and it looks beautiful, not clumpy at all just looks like I may have fake eyelashes on my but I don&#x27;t! It took me a few minutes to get used to the length becuase my lashes were touching my eyelids lol. I have tried younique 3D fiber lash mascara too, I wasn&#x27;t a big fan and my eyes got so red and itchy. With this Mia Adora Mascara I didn&#x27;t even do multiple coats I just folled the steps once andmy lashed look great, I&#x27;m sure If I sat there and played with it and applied more I would get some dramatic lashes. I&#x27;ll definetly have to try it out another day and come back to update my review. I would reccomend this product to anyone that wants longer lashes without the hassle of putting on fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  If you feel like my review was helpful to you at all will you please take a second and hit the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button. It would be greatly appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;* I recieved this product during a promotion and now I will be a return customer!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara and agree that it&#x27;s a better, cheaper, and faster alternative to applying falsies. The only minor problem I&#x27;ve had so far is that the little &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; you apply in &amp;#34;step 2&amp;#34; seem to end up above and below your eyelid throughout the day, but since I use a magnifying makeup mirror, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m the only one who notices. It could also be that I&#x27;m applying them too late and letting &amp;#34;step 1&amp;#34; dry too quickly so the fibers have nothing to stick to! I definitely need more practise with this, but even on my first try, my lashes still look AMAZING! I am so happy with this product and the price is so cheap for such fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this product again.  There are literally NO fibers in the smaller bottle.  complete rip off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time consuming and tedious to achieve ANY results, as well as remove. I get better results from regular mascara!</li>
            <li> Its ok not as Good as original one but not bad!</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well.  It extends the eyelashes, but takes a while to apply.  I usually only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Packaging is exceptional.</li>
            <li> This mascara works great making your lashes longer giving you that false lash impression it even comes with an extra spoolie, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s to use just in case you need to separate your lashes after application but over all good product</li>
            <li> First time I tried it I thought I was going to return it. I normally use false eye lashes that look very natural, each lash separated and all, as though I&#x27;m not wearing a mascara.  So I was kind of naively expecting to get close to that look.  This product does make you look like you&#x27;re wearing a mascara, but it looks beautiful. This will be my new every day look, but I&#x27;ll still wear falsies for the occasions when I want to look extra beautiful and natural :)</li>
            <li> This product works great! Followed the directions exactly and definitely have noticeably longer lashes. I was worried that the fibers would end up making my lashes clumpy, but that wasn&#x27;t an issue at all. And I&#x27;m a HUGE stickler for clumpy lashes! As in, I use a pin to separate my lashes from one another (dangerous, I know, but the struggle is real). But it was actually much easier than expected to place the fibers where I actually wanted them. My friend has been telling me about this product for a while now and I completely understand why. Totally worth the money and a LOT less hassle than applying fake lashes. I would highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and use it everyday. As a glasses wearer, I love that my lashed are very visible and the length does not make them hit my glasses since it adds volume. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I have never purchased a mascara before that came in such an elegant package. The 3 step process is super easy and not time consuming at all. The Gel slides right on with little to no clumping. The fibers go on with little to no mess and when you apply the last coat of gel the magic starts to come together and pow your eyelashes go from fair to fab! They even throw in a pretty pink and black lash brush to help with any clumps..Would definitely be buying another one.</li>
            <li> It does not make my flash longer then people said. But it does make it longer than my own lashes. it comes with the box which is very fancy and neat. Maybe I need to spend more time to practice it.</li>
            <li> First of a few new fiber lash products I&#x27;ve tried. The formula covers well and looks natural. For the price point a good choice if you&#x27;re not looking to spend a lot. The fiber addition is not as thick or as long as I&#x27;ve experienced but overall great improvements to my thin and light lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. by the end of the day, my eyes feel like they have sand in them.</li>
            <li> I wear mascara every day and found the first coat easy to apply. The second wand takes a little getting used to so you get the fibers on right. The third application really makes lashes stand out although I think it takes practice to get that dramatic look. I&#x27;m happy with the product and although I don&#x27;t planning on wearing it every day due to time, I will definitely wear it when I want to impress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, but I&#x27;m really not into make up. That being said the only make up I actually wear everyday is mascara so I am extremely picky!  I&#x27;ve probably tried almost every main brand of mascara and normally have a routine of having to use more then one mascara to get the look I want, but this mascara makes it so I don&#x27;t. I think the picture they show is a bit over dramatic of the results that you get unless you keep re applying, but you get a great full lengthy looking set of eyelashes that look beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara! I bought it because the 3D mascara is what everyone seems to be talking about. It really does give the full look shown. It takes practice, but I was very impressed. The book you get with it is extremely helpful on how to apply it. The only thing I don&#x27;t care much for is how hard it is to get off. It takes a lot of makeup remover cleanser and hot water. I only use it on special occasions due to how hard it is to remove. That can also be a good thing you don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off during the day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Mia Adora 3D Lash Mascara! I highly recommend this product! The results are amazing and application could not be easier! I look and feel so glamorous when I apply this finishing touch! I can&#x27;t imagine using another product that could offer such results!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loooooved this mascara... I used to buy only another expensive brand in order to get thicker blacker eyelashes, and then I&#x27;ve decided to spend less money into something new when I was searching on Amazon. Them I came across this one. It&#x27;s AWESOME!!! As good as the expensive one, if not better. I strongly recommend you buy this one if you want thicker and more beautiful eyelashes. And the best of all: after buying the first kit, they sent me another one as a way to thank me for buying it in the first place. I will never buy another brand of mascara again... will stick to this one forever. LOOOOOOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this mascara. I noticed her lashes are longer and look more natural with this mascara.</li>
            <li> It works well. I have tried other more expensive fiber lash massacras and this one works just as well for a little less of the price.</li>
            <li> Works well. Not quite what I expected as I have never used this type of mascara. All in all is was very easy to use and did make my eyelashes look very nice!&lt;br /&gt;Julie U</li>
            <li> When on smoothly,  didn&#x27;t clump, lasted. I really enjoyed this product, my eyelashes have never looked better. And the customer service was amazing as well. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara!  I wasn&#x27;t sure buying mascara online but I wanted to try a fiber mascara and this was well reviewed.  I have simply said, short stubbly eyelashes and have tried for years to find a mascara that I could use right out of the box without putting layer after layer, powder then mascara etc.  I was amazed that on the first application, following the directions, my eyelashes looked like they grew overnight!  I didn&#x27;t put an extra heavy application on and it really gave me a normal appearance.  I highly recommend this product, cannot beat the price you pay much more at the cosmetic counters and this is that quality!</li>
            <li> I really like it... easy to apply...</li>
            <li> Long beautiful lashes!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I&#x27;ve tried lots of mascara and even wear fake lashes for special occasions but this compares to fake lashes so I haven&#x27;t worn them in a while since using this!!</li>
            <li> Product is amazing! Makes lashes twice as long and volumious. Doesnt get clumpy and is super easy to apply!</li>
            <li> For a person born with tiny/thin eyelashes, this is just the answer to my endless search for the perfect mascara!  Will buy again. Also, the merchant is very good with follow up e-mails to see if I was happy along with a mini makeup help download which is very helpful!</li>
            <li> The mascara is very good. I already have long lashes but it extends them so much more and makes them look so much more full! I have no complaints about the product at all!</li>
            <li> Great product, a bit unusual to apply at first, but the results speak for themselves,  no flakes and big, long, full, thick lashes.</li>
            <li> This is a revolutionary product that solves many issues we all have; no need for eyelash dye, certainly no need for false lashes, and no smudge. My eyes water by nature so I can&#x27;t wear  regular mascara, and with this, nothing runs and it stays on.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara...works better than my MAC</li>
            <li> It came on time and is easy to use! The results are great</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  This is everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted in a mascara.  Easy to apply, easy to remove, no flaking, long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practice makes perfect.  Here is what I do:&lt;br /&gt;1. Large tube, put 15-20 strokes on one eye&lt;br /&gt;2.  Immediately, small tube (fibers) rub brush around tube to get fibers on, apply on 1/2 of the length of lashes&lt;br /&gt;3. repeat on other eye&lt;br /&gt;4. Go back to other eye and apply large tube then small tube&lt;br /&gt;5, repeat other eye&lt;br /&gt;6. Top with large tube&lt;br /&gt;7. for extra volume top with your favorite mascara (Mine is Cinique High Impact Extreme Volume)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find if I don&#x27;t apply the other brand of mascara, my lashes aren&#x27;t as thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this mascara is a KEEPER!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Easy to take off. Defines your lashes. Just be careful with the fiber and read directions so that they won&#x27;t get in your eye.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara because I had tried the Younique Brand and didn&#x27;t love it like everyone else did. It smeared so badly no matter what I did. It stained my shower, bathroom counter, eyelids etc. I thought the concept was great if it had held up throughout the day and in the humidity. I actually went to Amazon looking for a department store brand of mascara and came across this brand. I thought I would give it a shot. It definitely holds up far better than the Younique in my opinion. You still have to spend some time on it, which is why I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars. The process takes longer than I&#x27;d like, but you can end up with amazing lashes that last all day if you take the time to apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> Amanda P.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the mascara. I wear it everyday. I also love how I can easily wash it off and it&#x27;s easy on my lashes :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> Love my new mascara its exactly what i expected! My eyelashes look fuller and longer Lou V</li>
            <li> Product works well. Does make eyelashes look fuller and provide some length.</li>
            <li> I love this fiber lash mascara! I have tired several different brands and some of them flake throughout the day and leave behind stuff that smears when you go to wipe it off but not this one! Work great, leaves your eye lashes twice as long as before you put it on and stays pretty all day long. I would definitely recommend this product. No more fake eye lashes, you wont need them, all you need is this and you are good to go!</li>
            <li> Decent product. Comparable to orher name brand products in this particular category.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of fiber lashes and this is by far my favorite! It last all day without having to be reapplied! The difference in regular mascara and this fiber mascara is night and day this product is so amazing I love it!</li>
            <li> Item does not always stay on eyelash but when it does, it looks great.</li>
            <li> I feel like it didnt make a difference my friends told my unique is better</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome! It really looks like your wearing false lashes . it stays all day and washes off easy . I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> i think this product is absolutely amazing who needs falsies when you have these amazing fiber lashes Mia Adora rocks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this mascara. It makes a noticeable improvement in appearance in length over any over the counter mascara I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes even with my contact lenses in. I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis, but the only difference I see from standard mascara is the fibers sometimes flake off, so I just double check to make sure it doesn&#x27;t smudge in other areas on my face. I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara I dont need to wear falsies when Im using This product I love to see how thick and long I can get my lashes, Wipes off pretty easy with make-up wipes.</li>
            <li> Came super fast!! On top of that it is so amazing. I&#x27;ve used the really expensive ones. This one works just as good!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. I think it works better than the expensive ones. üíã</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and the fibers were all on my under eye area.  It looked horrible!  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Did not like. Tried a lot of times following instructions but never got great results. I did get a lot of mess and fibers in my eyes. Sent back.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. The fibers are thick and do not irritate your eye. The color is black and bold enough.</li>
            <li> Love it and it really works and its easy to use.  Lashes does look longer and it does&#x27;nt smear on eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara...it makes my real lashes look longer without the clumpiness&lt;br /&gt;Of having to put on multiple layers....I can&#x27;t leave home without it....</li>
            <li> Just a few little fibers fell off during the day, but other than that, it does make your eyelashes much prettier.  I have to order additional mascara for my friends after telling them out this!</li>
            <li> Sharona M :Best mascara ever!!! My lashes look amazing i love them</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this out, and did so almost as soon as it arrived in the mail and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The quality is outstanding, and it was so easy to apply. I&#x27;m going to be honest here and say I had no idea my lashes could look this good! There was little to no irritation to my eyes and it took me no time at all to complete from start to finish. If you are looking for a good alternative to false eye lashes this is the product for you. Not only was the product amazing but so is the customer service - I had trouble placing the order and the representative I spoke with didn&#x27;t stop until my issue was resolved. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am unfortunately very disappointed with this product. The fibers don&#x27;t apply to your lashes like the younique brand. I was thinking this would be a cheaper alternative, but it doesn&#x27;t work like I had hoped. Save your money and just pay the extra $10 and get the younique brand that actually works. -_-</li>
            <li> I just tried Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lashes and I have to tell the world all about them, (and not just because I said I would after I got a discounted price through Tomoson.com.)&lt;br /&gt; Firstly, the case itself is super fancy, a box with magnets to keep it closed and lined with silk.  The instructions are printed simply on the inside of the box so the outside of it looks simple and pretty.  When have you ever bought mascara that wasn‚Äôt just thrown in some plastic that was super difficult to remove?&lt;br /&gt; I tried on my left eyelash first and although the instructions clearly tell you not to get too close to your eye with the step 2 fibers, I did and got an eyeful of little fuzzy fibers.  On the second eye I new better and with practice from my first eye my lashes looked perfect.  I was assuming they would make my lashes look big and fake but they don‚Äôt!  They look like my own eyelashes only long, full and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt; I‚Äôve always had a hard time wearing fake eyelashes because they make my eyes feel tired and heavy.  With Mia Adora I feel like I am wearing normal mascara and can‚Äôt tell that there is a difference. (besides the face that they look beautiful)</li>
            <li> It works great just as expected! I always get compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> I wish I had knew about this product before I ever had lash extensions done. It looks just the same but without the cost and heavy feeling you get when you get extensions done.</li>
            <li> when used it feels like sand in the eye, the lashes are uncomfortable, nothing special about this. too much of stress for a mascara</li>
            <li> Iove this product because it makes my lashes look 3xs fuller! And it doesnt rip my real lashes out like false lashes</li>
            <li> Well this was definitely a new experience for me. It took some getting used to and I did apply the gel more than once to get the desired look, but when I was done my lashes were FABULOUS! The gel goes on easily but you have to work with the dark coating, just use clean strokes from the base of your lashes to the tips. If your lashes aren&#x27;t dark, full or long enough after the first application, I suggest putting more gel on and applying the dark coating again until your lashes are at their fullest. I will say it is time consuming but it is so worth it to keep from buying fake lashes, plus you&#x27;re not applying any glue to your eyelids. I will be using this 3D mascara for all of my girls nights out and for any romantic getaway celebrations!</li>
            <li> This is a great product . You can just use the gel mascara and it make lashes look longer . I put it on  and wait a few seconds and put more at the tips of my lashes and do it again . This will give the my lashes three time the length . This is a awesome product .I use only the gel mascara it is awesome .</li>
            <li> What a great product. I love fiber lashes. This one is not as clumpy and thick as most. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Great mascara!!!!  Look !!!!s like extensions</li>
            <li> The fiber lash mascara has done wonders in helping my lashes look fuller and longer , especially after they started falling out when I curled them incorrectly with an eyelash curler.  Thank you Mia Adora Fiber Lash Mascara!!!</li>
            <li> Great . Worth the money. Don&#x27;t waste money on regular mascara , this is way better.&lt;br /&gt;Must Buy</li>
            <li> I wanted desperately to like this product so that I did not have to wear falsies.  However, after trying it out for a month, I found that after I applied the extension portion of the mascara, it would get into my eye and irritate it.  I will go back to my false lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of mascara but this one I love my eyelashes look long I get compliments on them</li>
            <li> Not a big difference!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara on a discount for giving my honest opinion on the product. I would have to say I LOVE this mascara! I have never been more pleased with any other mascara. It doesn&#x27;t not clump on your lashes, it brings a fuller amazing look without a cheep look of clumps sticking to your eyelashes. I am putting this at the top of my makeup repeat list! Very happy &amp; would highly recommend to anyone looking fur quality mascara.</li>
            <li> You will need to make sure that there is no mascara in your eye at all when you apply it. Clean your make up of your eyes totally and don&#x27;t rush using the mascara. Take your time in applying the steps and the result worth it. It stays throughout the whole day and I have not experienced any irritations. Easy to remove. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly, perfectly packaged and sealed. I have ordered different mascara, from a different company. It arrived open, not sealed. Ewwwwww&lt;br /&gt;This mascara lengthened and made my lashes thicker. Thanks for making such a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Sandra K.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I have really short eye lashes and these works amazing for me! You can really tell a differents and it feels better than fake eye lashes. Thy look natural.</li>
            <li> The BOMB product!! Everyone think my eyelashes are fake! This product truly works and cost less than others!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used younique once (bought a tube and finished it) and when I was desperate and couldn&#x27;t get that, I tried this. The reviews were so convincing! Everyone said they liked it better. I like that its easy to put on, and the color looks very natural...but it didn&#x27;t give me that 3Dfake lash look I wanted. I have short lashes, and was looking for the drama that this type of mascara promotes but it looks very natural, almost as if I&#x27;m using my regular Maybelline. Overall, I&#x27;m not satisfied, and won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;(PS for the record, I don&#x27;t sell or endorse younique at all- younique was just better in my personal comparison).</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Glad to have bought it!</li>
            <li> Worked great and very easy to use! Lasted all day and looked amazing on my first try.</li>
            <li> These Fiber Lashes are totally worth your money! They arrived on time, and as soon as they arrived I just had to wear the product so  I wore them that same day, and my sister even asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes. They really do make your eyelashes longer and add a lot more volume to your eyelashes. I personally have very short eyelashes, and with one coat of my favorite mascara and these fiber lashes, I always get the results I want. I usually like a dramatic look, so I apply the fibers twice, and then with the eyelash brush I clean away any bumps. The first time, you may not get the results you want, but after by the second or third try you will start seeing the results you need.</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara this is the 2nd one I have bought and I will not use anything else.  The fuller longer looking lashes that this products does is amazing no irritation whatsoever.  The color is perfect black and my lashes look good all day long, this is a must have in your makeup bag.  It lasts a long time and easily comes off at the end of the day with eyemakeup remover.  I have used so many other mascaras and not had the same affect as this one does so easily to apply.  Love it will continue using it</li>
            <li> Okay for special occasions but not something I will keep up daily.</li>
            <li> Never used a 3D lash product before but love the way my lashes look. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Renee&#x27; R.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!..makes my eyelashes stand out. I&#x27;m addicted to it, wear it everyday.  I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this for a while. Now I got a chance to try it I must say I love it. The packaging is great and it tells you step by step directions on how to apply the fiber lash. It made my eyelashes look great! I won&#x27;t ever go back to fake eyelashes. Only thing that worried me was the strong odor. But I got over that. I was given a discount on this product to give my unbiased opinion on it. This is my experience and I had no other influences. I will buy this in the future when I run out. Great product. Only thing is getting over the strong smell</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE,LOVE this polish!! The colors are awesome and it stays on! Doesn&#x27;t chip! I have to wear gloves all day at work plus I clean houses after work five nights a week. Regular polish was a waste of $$; I tried them all!  This polish stays on and looks like I just put it on weeks later! AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely phenomenal!  Lasher are much longer and thicker!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Loving this product!  I do apply 2 coats of the gel before applying fibers for a more luxurious look.  So far this product is a great alternative to the damaging false lashes.</li>
            <li> Allergic to the adhesive that&#x27;s used to apply lashes decided to give it a try and now i Love the 3d mascara will not wear false eyelashes ever again .my friend thought i had lashes applied now she&#x27;s going to purchase thanks for this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Unique 3D fiber lash mascara for over a year. I decided to try this product since it&#x27;s not as pricy as the one I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. The concept is the same. There&#x27;s 2 mascara type products in the box. You use the longer tube first. It&#x27;s a clear coat gel. Then the second which contains the actual microfibers. My lashes are none existent without using these products. Let me just say I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and will be using it again.</li>
            <li> It was OK..I prefer the moonstruck 3D mascara.I was very sceptical about buying it but moonstruck is worth the price .  As a matter of fact I just placed an order for two! Lol don&#x27;t want to ever run out)!!! But your shipping was great! Thanks again, Tammy</li>
            <li> I love how long it makes my lashes! It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts all day, but washes off with ease too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was great at fist but its very repetitive and does do a good job. It just wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Works just as well, if not better than other brands! Great customer service! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Well, it delivers. You can make your eyelashes huge-very buildable. The first few times, they looked a little gunky, but then somehow you just get better at applying. The fibers do flake off if you mess with them too much, or if you don&#x27;t set them well with the gel, but I didn&#x27;t find them getting into my eyes much. They give a dramatic enough look that I actually felt like I didn&#x27;t need any other make up on. I&#x27;m not a fan of the way false lashes feel, so this will be my go to glam mascara if I have some time to spare to put it on (I&#x27;m just OCD about it looking right). Overall, a great few new concept  - definitely cheaper than some of the others out there, but this is my first fiber mascara so I can&#x27;t comment on the quality in comparison to the others.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is amazing. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use with adorable packaging. It arrived quickly and customer service was prompt in checking up to make sure I was satisfied with the product! Id definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the mascara!! I have tried a few of these fiber lashes and this one is the best one of all. The others are messy and the you end up with small fiber lashes everywhere. I hated it when it would be all over my face. This one I don&#x27;t have a problem with that all!! You have to try it!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Results are great and I find it easy to use with the directions given.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. I have never been a fan of fake eyelashes, they&#x27;re too hard to apply and it&#x27;s embarrassing if they come off in public. This product give you the option to choose how thick/long you want your eyelashes for the night. Sometimes you want a bit more for the club or less for some other event. Great product, it&#x27;s also a great gift. All of my friends love it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It really makes my lashes longer and everyone thinks i&#x27;m wearing false lashes, and it comes off pretty easy</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected. I didn&#x27;t realize that there were more than just your average mascara. The extra step made my lashes look and feel quite enhanced. I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Not completely terrible, but I still use it. It doesn&#x27;t stand a chance next to youniques 3D fiber lashes. I wouldn&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I&#x27;ve spent loads of money on other 3D Fiber Lash Mascaras, like Yonique, and other ones. Younique is highly overrated, and to me, does not compete with Mia Adora. I love this stuff so much. It doesn&#x27;t flake, and it&#x27;s so easy to do. I will definitely buy it again once I&#x27;m done with my first set c:</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! Omg! It is amazing! I like it better than any other brand I have used before. It doesn&#x27;t flake and once I curl my lashes after application .. The curl stays longer! Buying again!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in order to enhance my sparse lashes, and was delighted to find that it ENHANCED my lashes as well as lengthened them!  The best part is, they don&#x27;t look fake at all.  Plus, they are easy to wash off at the end of the day...just moisten them with warm water, and then they wash off just like regular mascara.  Happy I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> love the look it gives my lashes, easy to apply, makes lashes so much fuller</li>
            <li> I have used 3 different fiber lash mascaras. So far this one is my favorite. Absolutely no clumping at all! Will definitely buy this one again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara....I have placed my second order now and will be ordering this mascara as long as it is produced by the company.  A company representative actually called me personally to inquire about my experience and it is at her request that I am writing this review.  I was impressed that she would call me directly, and as a result, I chose to let everyone know that I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;ve always wanted long thick lashes, now I have them.  I even have to be careful because I wear glasses that I don&#x27;t get them too long.</li>
            <li> I have nearly non existent eyelashes, this product increased the length an volume of my lashes so much that my blonde short lashes stand out. Really liking it. update: sent me a free set just because!</li>
            <li> Overall an okay product. The brush shape is a little funky - the bristles on the gel wand don&#x27;t go all the way around, so I have to be careful of where on the brush is touching my eyelashes. The fibers are a bit messy, but nothing that doesn&#x27;t wipe right off. The first few times I used the set, my eyes got a little irritated by the end of the day from the fibers flaking off. But I started applying a little more gel in the second coat and that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a but pricey but has more gel and fiber consistently coming out than another brand I was using.  So far so good.  I&#x27;ve been applying 2 to 3 rounds of the gel and fiber and it extends my lashes pretty well.  I love how they make my lashes pop.  I&#x27;ve received compliments so the mascara does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleanor M.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. The end result was not any better than regular mascara. It also causes your lashes to clump together.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My eyelashes are getting thinner with age, and this product makes them look longer and fuller!  I will definitely continue to use this product.  - Kim R</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Fiber Lash Mascara I&#x27;ve tried; first was Younique. I get longer lashes w/ Younique, but I didn&#x27;t like the odor. Mia Adora doesn&#x27;t have an odor &amp; makes my lashes thicker. If I keep practicing, I should be able to get longer lashes. I would purchase this again &amp; recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I was truly impressed how easy it was to apply. Fake lashes were always difficult to apply and eyelash extensions are very expensive. I have asian eyes therefore lashes are minimal and goes straight down. These fiber lash mascara truly does make your lashes so much longer and fuller. Highly recommend for anyone who has been struggling with finding the right product for their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!! I have tried every mascara out there, from department store to drugstore and this is amazing. Buy it today, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I had tried eyelash extensions in the past and found the glue/ adhesive really irritated my eyes, they were also quite pricey to maintain every few weeks. I also could do without the hour or so it would take to apply the lashes individually.  This product allows for instant volume and most importantly awesome length!! I have tried a well known 3D mascara in the past and prefer this product. The magnifying gel applicator really allows for the separation of the lashes which subsequently causes less clumping. I enjoy the fact that you can create a dramatic look for nights out by just adding an additional coat or two; or keep it simple for the day with just one application. I definitely recommend this product as a person with short curly lashes I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Not at all like pictured. Performs like a mediocre mascara. Not sure if my fibers were dried out or what but they didn&#x27;t really exist. Very disappointed. Can&#x27;t help but wonder how this got such great reviews. I wanted to update my review after the company actually contacted me and provided a full refund very promptly. While the product wasn&#x27;t great their customer service was, so while I would say steer clear of this product I would say give other products from the company a chance.</li>
            <li> When I tried out the mascara it was very easy to apply it to my eyelashes. The steps to applying it are simple. You follow the instructions of putting the gel on to your eyelashes with about 15 strokes to make sure it&#x27;s on evenly. Then apply the fibers just as much as the gel, which is about 15 strokes. Lastly, you apply the gel again to seal it in. The mascara is wonderful and makes you feel like a model with the way your eyelashes will be looking. The mascara is definitely worth buying if you need to boost the look of false lashes or if you don&#x27;t have much long lashes of your own. You eyelashes will look flawless when your done if you applied it correctly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. I am getting so many compliments..... Cant believe there my lashes finally a real mascara. I will buy again. Fast service!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Hard to get off, but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> These are great and easy to use. I don&#x27;t do well with false lashes so these are a great alternative!</li>
            <li> Did not make my eyelashes longer. The model in the picture must have on atleast five coats-which would use it up quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery! I was a little skeptical because I had recently purchased another brand of 3D Fiber Lash Mascara that cost a lot less than this. I&#x27;m new to using 3D mascara so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money on it while perfecting the look of the lashes. Anyways the other brand I had initially purchased came with 2 sets for $14.99. not bad for the price, however my comments on using that brand was &amp;#34;wow long lashes&amp;#34; with the comment following &amp;#34;your lashes look dry and flaky&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s exactly the look I was going for....not. Before purchasing Mia Adora 3D fiber lash mascara I was considering purchasing the Younique Moodstruck but I couldn&#x27;t let myself spend that much on a 3D mascara as I&#x27;m novice to using it. I&#x27;ve seen many of my friends using the younique brand and their lashes look like how mine did when I used the cheaper brand. They weren&#x27;t so cute. Very clumpy uneven, just a mess. Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is awesome. Love this brand. I get so many compliments ever since I started using it. My lashes are long with volume and beautiful. Right now I would recommend this product and promote this brand. The instructions are on the tubes. So easy. No flaking or drying AND it&#x27;s water and smudge proof. I never thought I&#x27;d spend over 10 bucks on mascara but hey the price is fair as it lasts all day until you take it off. I&#x27;m very happy that I went with my gut and bought this.</li>
            <li> The mascara set comes in a beautiful box, satin lined, just stunning. Inside there are 2 tubes. One is the mascara, the other is the fibers. To use them, you simply use the mascara first, followed by the fiber wand, then finish again with the mascara. So simple, and it took no time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this mascara for a week to test it in all sorts of conditions. Sweat, working, rain... it got put through the test! The mascara does not flake off at all. I would apply this around 7 am and at 7 pm when I&#x27;d go to take my shower, I had to remove the mascara and fibers because they were still on my lashes, and still looked perfectly fine. I was shocked at how well the mascara held up, even during my long, sweaty work days, my lashes remained looking perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this a big 5 star rating because I have only positive, fantastic things to say about the Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lash Mascara Set! If you are looking for a gift for the makeup lover in your life, then this would be perfect! It&#x27;s sure to please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Received today and tried it right away.. My eye lashes looked amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with short limpy lashes and no mascara seems to work on them. Voluminous mascaras are too heavy and weigh my lashes down, lengthening mascaras aren&#x27;t noticeable. However this mascara is awesome at giving me what I don&#x27;t have. The fiber mascara is the best part! it really lengthens and thickens my lashes</li>
            <li> I have been SUPER skeptical about fiber lash mascara because of the negative experiences I&#x27;ve had with MLM reps contacting me about theirs. That, and i couldn&#x27;t stand the look of spider web legs on people&#x27;s eyes! I was contacted to review this product for free, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to apply, and easy to take off using my eye makeup remover. My eyelashes aren&#x27;t clumpy at all, and they are SO long! I have naturally dark blonde hair and light eyelashes, so these made them super dark which brought out my blue eyes! My mom tried it, too and this is the first mascara EVER that didn&#x27;t cause her issues. She has really sensitive eyes and can&#x27;t wear anything else! Love it!</li>
            <li> this stuff really does work...may make my eyes just a tid bit dry (contact wearer) but not enough to not use it.  i&#x27;m HOOKED!</li>
            <li> After ready some of the reviews, I half way expected that when I first applied this mascara system that I&#x27;d have a hard time perfecting it.  But I had great success with my very first use. I had no clumping or flaking problems.  Maybe because I&#x27;m a stickler for reading and following directions. I think the key is to let the fibers dry before applying the final coat of mascara. I have short, straight lashes and this product did build length better than any mascara product that I&#x27;ve ever used. At the end of the day, it removes easily, as they state that it would, with warm water. I&#x27;m impressed so far and the packaging is beautiful. Opening the case, you know that you are in for a state of the art product. I will now order their eyelash curler to compliment my new purchase. I&#x27;m guessing the quality of the eyelash curler will not disappoint either.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! Made my short lashes look long and voluminous. No flaking, no odor, no nothing. I absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking to spruce up their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Love my Mia Dora fiber lash kit very natural looking and brings out my beauty highly recommend it for all women.  No need for fake lashes. Mia Dora does the trick.</li>
            <li> So mascara has always been hard for me.  I have very thin and short eye lashes! I don&#x27;t do fake lashes or extensions.  So, I have this product a try!  It works amazing!! I just use one coat and I look like I have eye lashes.  Not complicated to apply and super quick! So happy to have found a great product!</li>
            <li> My lashes doubled in length, and with the directions I didn&#x27;t get any of the fibers in my eyes. Thank you Mia Adora for allowing me to sample your item! Your customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on special occasions and it works just as expected and makes my eyelashes fuller and more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Youngique Fiber Lash Mascara from a distributor last Fall.  I fell in love with the concept of fiber mascaras and really liked the green tea fibers as they are more natural.  After using up my mascara, I looked on Amazon to replace my mascara as I had moved to a different area of the country and needed a new supplier.  I decided to give this mascara a try.  The fiber part of this product is great, the gel is horrible.  The consistency of the gel is watery, not creamy and fails to adequately coat the lash in order to adhere the green tea fibers.  I ended up purchasing an additional natural creamy mascara just to have a good base for the fiber mascara.  I will not reorder this product and suggest the Younginque product to someone interested in trying out a Fiber Mascara.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  Makes my lashes no longer than if I use my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no eyelashes and was surprised by this product improved the appearance of my lashes.  It is easy to use and looks fabulous on.  I would recommend for anyone wanting to improve their lashes.</li>
            <li> It really thickens my lashes. Im very happy with the product. Gives my wimpy eyelashes a glamorous look.</li>
            <li> I love this fiber lash mascara!  I have used younique fiber lash as well and I can tell you I believe this product is better all around. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to enhance their lash look!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara at a lower price for the purpose of reviewing it, and at the cheaper price I love it!  However, at over $20 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it.  I already have lashes that are pretty full and a decent length, this did enhance them but not much more than my $7 drugstore brand.  It does do what it says, and it&#x27;s easy to use and apply so I do like it and I&#x27;ll finish it up but not sure if I&#x27;d purchase it again.  It was also very easy to remove with a make up cleansing cloth!</li>
            <li> I had the lovely opportunity to try out the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m a person who could not get into false lashes, the glue and putting them on and some looking wayyyy too much for my taste so when I saw this mascara type opportunity I was intrigue. I went for it. More so for curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day after I received it I read the instructions (YES PLEASE READ IT ALL BEFORE USING). I followed the steps and took my time. The results I loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: Easy to use, if you wear mascara then this is for you&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to remove&lt;br /&gt;  Looks very natural in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;  Does not leave your lashes dried out nor crunchie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: Since I wear contacts and have allergies, it can irritate if you get the particle in your eyes..so be very careful to NOT get it at the &#x27;root&#x27; of your lashes/near your eyeball&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I really like this mascara and the concept. I use it just about everyday. It is a 3 step and they also send a info booklet as well for tips etc. Can we say aweeessoommmeeee LOL</li>
            <li> *I received this at for free or at a reduced price in exchange a review; regardless all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually never wear mascara. Mascara usually irritates my eyes and makes my lashes fall out. Not only that but when they get wet the mascara bleeds. Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is the complete opposite experience for me. It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, my lashes don&#x27;t fall out and the mascara doesn&#x27;t bleed like regular mascara. I think my eyelashes still look natural when I use this mascara and it is easy to remove, unlike regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Definitely need practice applying it correctly but overall excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is really awesome. I just got this today and had to try it right away. I attached the picture with one eye done to compare. A lot of reviewers said it takes practice. I read the directions and didn&#x27;t have a problem but I guarantee it will get better with time. The fibers give you a full and long dramatic look, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara.  I recently vacationed in New Orleans where the heat index got up to 107 on some days.  As you might imagine, lots of sweating occurred, but the Mia Adora mascara held up without smudging.  When I first got the mascara, I put it on without reading the directions, and I must say, I was quite disappointed.  However I went back and read the directions.  When applied as instructed, the mascara did an amazing job of lengthening and thickening my lashes.  I was surprised by the volume and length this mascara added to my eyelashes.  I had previously considered getting eyelash extensions done at a salon, now that is no longer a consideration with Mia Adora.  I was a bit concerned about eye irritation, but did not experience any at all.  I will definitely make this a mainstay of my cosmetic regime.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  I had previously used a different brand of 3D Fiber lashes and loved them, so I was excited when I saw a decent price on this product.  The actual mascara is so thin it&#x27;s like it isn&#x27;t even applying, and then the fibers don&#x27;t seem to really come off of the wand.  A waste of money. Not impressed!</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as I thought</li>
            <li> I love these!  They came nicely packaged from the company and the results on my eyelashes is (as my co-workers say) luscious. They are fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> Does not last throughout the day, initially looks great but just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Addressing 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è reviews:&lt;br /&gt;* The fibers are supposed to be dry. They adhere to the base layer and then are sealed in place with another base layer.&lt;br /&gt;* As with the type of mascara that wraps your lashes in tubes (like blinc), there is confusion over how it can be both waterproof AND removed by water. It takes water+gentle rub to remove the mascara. No need for oily eye makeup remover. üòä&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my initial review:&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the curler and mascara. The items arrived quickly and were well packaged. I love the little case that contains the mascara set, but it&#x27;s kinda bulky if you plan to bring it along anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;BASE COAT - I love that the gel layer is black. Some of the other 3D lashes I was thinking of getting had a clear base coat and suggested that you use your &amp;#34;regular marcara&amp;#34; under everything. Well, I don&#x27;t have any regular stuff and didn&#x27;t want to have to purchase two things. ***The base coat can easily be worn alone!*** I like the brush it came with (I&#x27;m picky about mascara brushes) and it has a nice suction-type feel coming out of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;FIBERS - These are going to take some getting used to, but they were MUCH easier than I feared. I def didn&#x27;t end up with the crazy bent, weird looking spider legs I was worried about. Be patient and apply gradually. I have been getting quite a few in my eyes and under my bottom lid, but I think maybe I didn&#x27;t put a thick enough sealing coat after the fibers. I&#x27;ll experiment with this and then update.&lt;br /&gt;CURLER - This seems okay. What can you say? The springy mechanism feels quality but the handles aren&#x27;t super cushy like some other brands I looked at. Previously, I&#x27;ve used dollar brands, so this is a nice upgrade. It came with extra finger-hole pads.. (Why are they removable?) but mine was missing the extra pink curling pad. Happy to have the real deal.</li>
            <li> Love this product, went from shabby to chic</li>
            <li> Good product, does lengthen and thicken the lashes without using the fibers.  When I do apply the fibers, I work on one eye at a time because the mascara dries pretty fast and the fibers need to attach to the mascara to stay put before I apply another coat of the mascara to seal in the fibers.  Using the fibers gives me a bit of clumping, but not too bad.  This product makes a noticeable difference in my lashes.  You should definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> My lashes are fine and short. Mascara alone minimally has helped, but this product actually makes my eyelashes appear longer.  I will definitely continue to use Mia Adora.</li>
            <li> It does the job beautify and I use it all day I will give thumbs up they are thicker and longer 100%</li>
            <li> GREAT MASCARA!!! LOVE THAT IT MADE MY EYELASHES POP! I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> over all good product my lashes look awesome. i could do without the little flakes falling on my face</li>
            <li> Two things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I spent years looking for &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; lash lengthening mascara and tried everything known to man.&lt;br /&gt;2. I never wanted to spend much money on makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This mascara will turn any lashes into the longest lashes YOU EVER SAW.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t tell the makers, but I would pay 3x as much for this stuff. Seriously, it is THAT good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend it highly enough. It makes this penny pincher want to spend every penny on it for gorgeously gorgeous lashes that *everyone* compliments... because you&#x27;re worth it!!! :) :) :)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t quite do what I expected. As soon as you apply Step 1, you have to do Step 2. You can&#x27;t wait too long. I wish it works as well as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Though the product was packaged very nicely,  the product itself want very good. I applied to one eye so I could see the differenceand they&#x27;re want much of one.. the mascara from the dollar stores work betterfor me than this did.</li>
            <li> Seems like it may have worked well if the fiber lash tube would not have been dryed out. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best!  Love my lashes</li>
            <li> I was hopeful this product would eliminate my 25 coats of mascara and the time spent applying and reapplying eyeliner to look like I have full set of lashes.  This probably works for those that have nicer lashes but for fine and fair haired gals, I think building lashes with mascara is the only way to get the look you want.  Yes, they emailed me a 25 - 30 page booklet on how to make it work but really, I am BUSY and I need to get it done and move on.  Great marketing and packaging but I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was amazed at how long my lashes became with this.&lt;br /&gt;I used other mascaras and with my puny Asian lashes, I doubted that it would affect my lashes that much. But to my surprise, the fibers stuck to my lashes so long that it took time for me to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;The first step mascara goes on smooth and light, and the fiber mascara sticks really well. Then I coat it with the first step mascara again to keep the fibers in place. The last step makes the fibers appear like my own lashes and smooths the clumping if any.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for special events because it is too dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to have long lashes. Your 3D fiber lash mascara is great! My lashes look very long and beautiful. I will be buying more for my friends and family as gifts!</li>
            <li> I liked this product!  It made my lashes look lusciously long! I think the manufacturer&#x27;s description is accurate and, like other reviewers noted, you get the hang of the application procedure pretty quickly.  I gave this product 4 stars because of the price.  I have found a few drugstore brands of mascara that I like that I could get two of them for the price of one of these.  Still, if you&#x27;re thinking of giving this product a try...why not? --Noelle D.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for more dramatic change its ok, What i really like about the mascara is that can last all day.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best 3D fiber mascara out there, People ask me if I&#x27;m warring false lashes and I said no and recommended this product, Trust me you wont regret buying.</li>
            <li> Flakes off easy. Irritated my eyes and my eyes are far from sensitive.</li>
            <li> Does definitely enhance your lashes but not 300% like it claims. It&#x27;s not much better than some of the volumizing mascara from the drug store that I normally wear and it&#x27;s pretty pricey. I wouldn&#x27;t re-order again.</li>
            <li> I have thin eyelashes and wanted them too look longer. They do appear to make my lashes a lot longer..But def not as long as the picture!!! My biggest flaw on the mascara, is that I keep having a few fiber lashes fall on my face, no matter how much of the gel I use. I believe I will just stick with my old mascara.</li>
            <li> Like others have posted it does take a little practice to get the hang of application. Don&#x27;t give up! I first started with clumpy lashes I can now do many looks. Don&#x27;t try for the first time when you are heading to work and on a time crush. Take some time to play with application.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Makes a huge diference !!! Thank you !!!!</li>
            <li> Not as great as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great! Just takes practice and washes off great at the end of the day! Do one eye at a time so you can spend time perfecting application!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  Do not be hesitant to order this! It is easy to apply, and it stays put all day, yet it is easy to remove...no smudges and no flaking. I have very fine short lashes, and this makes my lashes look long and full! I am loving this, and I look forward to using it each morning. It truly opens up the eyes. For those with already full lashes, this product would send your eyes soaring!  The mascara is creamy and the fibers are feathery soft. Works like a charm! 5 ++ stars. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Makes my lashes look 3x longer and fuller! Practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara.  I give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> This product is great. It doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes sticky like some other fiber-mascaras do. Love it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay - I don&#x27;t seem to get the results they show.  I&#x27;ve tried to give it a chance but my lashes look no longer then when I use other mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday and I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve never tried using 3D mascara before but now I&#x27;m hooked. I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the length of my lashes. In the past I&#x27;ve spend so much money on special mascara promising volumized lashes but I&#x27;ve never gotten a result even close to this. Amazing product, fast shipping, defiantly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> was delivered quickly, have only tried it a couple of times since getting it, but it does seem good</li>
            <li> this was hard to rate, its not that its a horrible product, but for me not worth the money . takes a lot of time to get it on by the end of the day my eyes are irritated.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My eyelashes are so thin but by using this I actually look like I have lashes. It is very easy to put on. The price was great. I definitely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> We had been recommended a different brand, but decided to go with this one! Don&#x27;t regret t at all. It was a great choice! They are pretty simple to put on, the box does good at explains the instructions. Not to mention, they look incredible. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, the more practice you have, the better it looks. Item came quickly and in a nice carrying case.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using unique mascara.  I decided to take a chance &amp; try Mia Adora fiber lash mascara!  It has lasted much longer &amp; I will continue to order this it&#x27;s amazing! Shipping was extremely fast also! Very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Easy to use to create beautiful, long, full eyelashes.</li>
            <li> sent back, it really didn&#x27;t make my lashes look longer, and was very messy. plus they recommend on there packaging that you don&#x27;t wear with contacts due to the fibers getting under contact s and possibility damaging eye.</li>
            <li> Love it, very easy to use and gives you great lashes - Christina M</li>
            <li> Great product I will re-order this item over and over again</li>
            <li> I tried this with low expectations being a user of Cherry Blooms. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Received this and was excited to try. However, the step 1 applicator was dried up and barely coated my lashes no matter how many strokes I brush, resulting in the step 2 not being effective because they will not adhere. Very disappointed. Maybe I got a very old stock.</li>
            <li> Having breast cancer is hard but losing all your hair is even harder. Thankfully I went into remission an my hair returned, except my eyelashes were very sparse an almost impossible to see, even with over the counter mascara an fake eyelashes. Searching Amazon one day I came across this product an thought why not give it a try. It has transformed my life, I have eyelashes again! Amazing</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a product that would extend my eyelashes without clump and couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked for me. I have short eyelashes but it doesn&#x27;t look that way with 3D Fiber Lash Mascara I love this product!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  Great product and great service.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I suffer from short thin lashes and also different lash length. This product lengthened and thickened lashes without clumping. You could do one layer or several of coats to add more drama. Loved it. I was also say it does take a little practice at first so do not become discouraged</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good at making your eyelashes seem darker and does a sufficient job of making them longer. Actually, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;d look more voluminous than they do long. My eyes never looked like the pictures. It was a bit clumpy when you add the fibers. When adding the fibers, just make sure not to get them in your eye because they do fall sometimes and it really irritates. Don&#x27;t apply too close to the actual eye itself. I accidentally did and paid for it. The first tube that you use is also kind of messy so it&#x27;s very easy to accidentally get on your face, so you need to make sure you wipe the top of the brush off.  It&#x27;s better than your average mascara though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 3D fiber lash mascara by Mia Adora for my wife. She absolutely loves it. Plus it came it a classic container for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara. It does not make my eyelashes look bigger than my current mascara so I don&#x27;t think it works. At the end of the day I do feel some irritation on my eyes and also some of the little hairs of the fibers sometimes get inside my eye while applying it. Don&#x27;t buy it, try another brand!</li>
            <li> I had never tried fiber lashes before. They were amazing and a little different but so worth the extra length that they have me. Never turning back.</li>
            <li> Definitely see a difference! Great customer service. Just need more practice to be perfect.</li>
            <li> This mascara lengthens the lashes like crazy! I love how easy it is to remove any mistakes. Just dab some water on a cotton swab and clean the area. One coat is good for the simple days but I do 3 coats if I want my lashes to POP! No falsies necessary! I also tend to focus more on the outer corners for a flared look. It might take a little longer to apply than the normal mascara but it is worth it.  I want to personally thank the company for calling and thanking me for the purchase!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Great product. My husband accused me of getting fake lashes the first time I wore them. A little time consuming to apply but worth it!</li>
            <li> Awsome product!!! My lashes look amazing....no more falsies for me.</li>
            <li> I loved it. I really noticed a difference in the way that my eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a month so far. I really like it. It is summer and it is muggy out at times. Make up can easy run in this weather. What I found with this product is that it does not clump when applied as instructed. It did not run in the muggy weather. Also it lasted most of the day for me. I also liked that it is easily washed off when I was ready to remove it. I will continue to use it because it does make a difference between other mascara that I have used. It makes my eyelashes look bigger and fuller and it does not look fake. I am so happy I found this product!&lt;br /&gt;Irina B.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this and it&#x27;s ok but it&#x27;s not that dramatic as I&#x27;m expecting. I&#x27;ll give it a try again and update my review</li>
            <li> Love it. Works realy great and come off easy with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this but what a disappointment when the bottle of fibers is completely dry and would only leave clumps of fibers falling onto my lashes!  The hardest part was trying to keep the clumps out of my eyes!  I tried to contact the company directly via their website on the business card they included in my order (rather than post a negative review) but when I go to the website it&#x27;s all about nail polish!  Totally bummed.</li>
            <li> Nice fiber lash mascara - very similar to the ones being sold by independent distributors. The packaging though, was frayed and ripped and just not in the best condition, which clearly didn&#x27;t effect the product, but wanted to note it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good product, needs a bit of work to learn how to use it properly, but definitely gave me bigger and longer lashes. I don&#x27;t use it every day as it is time consuming to put on, but for special events, I love it.</li>
            <li> I am a professional 53 year that still enjoys trying to look her best for her age. Over the years my lashes have become much thinner. I didn&#x27;t want the exspence of lash extensions so I took a chance with your 3D mascara. I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you what a wonder product this is. A 5 star for sure !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy :) my husband and I are on a budget now, so $150 for lash extensions is out of the question. I tried these 3D fiber lashes and they extended and filled out my lashes like crazy!!! My husband was shocked when he saw how long they were! 3D fiber is good! I like! :)</li>
            <li> Great seller. My wife says there is a learning curve to this product but she is loving the result.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my practically non existent lashes.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I personally was unable to achieve the pictured results.  However, I am very pleased with my results.  I applied the product 3 times on each side to achieve my desired look and then applied mascara on top of that.  It really lengthened my lashes and gave them a slightly fuller appearance.  I would recommend this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Waw what a great product love it and will definitely order again. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this, have not had any problems like some of the users.  Just followed the simple directions.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of fiber mascara but discovered it existed when I did a general search for mascara in preparation for replacing my existing mascara that was about to run out.  I&#x27;d used the same brand of mascara for years and just for fun thought I&#x27;d see what else was out now.  Seriously glad I did.  This stuff is amazing.  So easy to use and so dramatically effective; I&#x27;ll never go back to regular mascara again.  In fact I just ordered a second set because I don&#x27;t want to be caught short when I start running out of my first set.</li>
            <li> I found this mascara to be the best!  I would much rather do this than get extensions put on , faster, less money and I personally think easier on your own lashes!!!  I would recommend this product and was so sad to see that after one week they were out of them..I want to keep them in my personal stock at all times..</li>
            <li> Younique 3 D fiber lashes are supposed to be the best. however i was very disappointed with this purchase. The mascara was clumped and even after trying to apply left little clumps which got into my eye. I am very disappointed I actually want a refund. I would not recommend this product after this experience</li>
            <li> This product was the first time I had tried fiber mascara - and I feel in LOVE!!! The packaging on Mia Adora&#x27;s is very elegant and would make a beautiful gift! Perfect for anyone wanting thicker and longer lashes. A little goes a long way. I would and do highly recommend this mascara! Stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t clump, and makes your lashes look beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> It really does add dimension to your eye lashes, It&#x27;s going to take some practice to get it just right, but I like how it looks so far</li>
            <li> Great purchase for the price! I would say that it takes some practice to perfect your lashes with this product. It also helps to curl your lashes and use mascara prior to using the product. Overall, I am happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love it! I just received the product and each day with practice thet are more and more beautiful! :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara. My eyelashes look amazing</li>
            <li> Made my eyes swollen and I didn&#x27;t think it worked that great!</li>
            <li> the mascara set glides smoothly onto my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t leave no clumps, gunk or stick my lashes together. It really works love how the mascara set gives me eyelashes that extra boost and volume!</li>
            <li> I have been seeing a lot of different ads for lengthening mascaras and I really wanted to try one. This one by Mia Adora is great. It has easy to follow directions, and comes in a lovely little box that is really handy to keep them together.&lt;br /&gt;You can also build up your length with more coats to get your desired length. Let me tell you I put on three coats and wow my eyelashes were long! I would only use three coats for a special occasion but, on a daily basis one or two coats works well too. I did have a little bit of flaking later in the day but I think that is to be expected with as many coats as I used. I haven&#x27;t had that when I used one or two coats.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the look that the mascara gives you and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia Adora has come up with another awesome product. They have this premium eyelash curler that does a great job curling your lashes. It has rubber rings in the finger holes that make it very comfortable to use. It also come with a refill. It is made very sturdy and will last a long time. If I had to make one change it would be to make it a little bit more of a curve to fit the eye better. Other than that I wouldn&#x27;t change anything. It makes a great companion to Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D fiber lash mascara that I reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;* I received these products at a reduced price to test and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I gave this one star simply because it burned my eyes when I removed it according to directions. It also burned my eyes when my eyes teareds slightly from weariness by end of day. It may be &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; but it is not &amp;#34;tear&amp;#34; proof. Also, it confuses me that if it is indeed &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;, why is water the only way to remove it? My mascara remover doesn&#x27;t work on it although it works with all my other mascaras. It&#x27;s so weird that you need &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; to remove &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; mascara. Buyer beware. Don&#x27;t count on all those five star stellar reviews. Be prepared to return this ridiculously expensive mascara. I am.</li>
            <li> I can get better results with my favorite mascara in less time, and less mess.</li>
            <li> Most amazing product I bought on Amazon. I&#x27;m no longer getting any other brand of mascara except for 3D fiber lash. üòçüòçüòçüòç</li>
            <li> I ordered these fiber lashes about a month ago, they are wonderful. I have had several compliments from co workers. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for the best mascara and length lengthing product and this was better than Younique. Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gina C.</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I was a little sketchy about this product, But of course when it arrived I immediately had to try it. Here is why I was sketchy, I tried the Younique 3D fiber lashes about a month ago &amp; personally I did not care for that product. It seemed to leave a lot of fall out the fibers fell everywhere &amp; it also came out super clumpy &amp;#62;_&amp;#60;  So when I seen this I was not to excited, But I did get a discount code &amp; I was able to purchase for $3.00, so I thought to myself &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;. At first I was little intimidated because of my personal experience with the Younique brand, But after applying it &amp; trying it out, I can absolutely say I LOVE this product! Honestly now that I know what this product is capable of I am more than happy with it, I will be purchasing this again &amp; paying full price is more than worth it. It does take a little while to apply, But lets be real if you want to look your best when it comes to makeup the last thing you want to do is rush! Another thing I could not stand was the Younique seemed to make my eyes itchy &amp; with this my eyes feel fine, just like if I was using a normal mascara. I love how much of a difference it made &amp; I only applied two coats. One of the things I really like about this is it is a buildable product, as in you can literally use as much as you want &amp; it still looks great!! I applied my two coats and my lashes looked great all day. I came home later that night and added a few more coats for my night on the town, I went from long natural looking lashes to full long dramatic lashes in about ten six minutes! Every time I have worn this on my eyes I am always given compliments which is always nice. This is definitely a product I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember this is my own personal opinion &amp; not all of you will agree.</li>
            <li> I love the product!!  My lashes look great, once you get used to the application process there is no clumping.  It&#x27;s long lasting and even looks great the next morning.  :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product for helping me go GLAM in 90 seconds! I&#x27;m a real girly girl and have makeup to last me for years. I purchase both inexpensive and high end makeup. Mascara has always been one of those items I can&#x27;t leave without. Over the years, I&#x27;ve progressed to using lashes (individuals and strips) and it became too time consuming. I&#x27;ve always love the natural look whenever I applied lashes, but still it took too long applying individuals. So, I searched for a solution to having beautiful lashes throughout the day during work and at the gym. Finally, I came across Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara and it was an instant hit with me. I read almost all the reviews and decided to buy it. I LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some of the reviewers, I applied it right from the beginning with no trouble. The instructions are easy to follow. I did three coats and I was HOOKED! I love the bold effect of my lashes and I appreciate the product being waterproof. However, it is easy to remove with my facial wash and it does not burn my eyes.  I have not had any smearing and I like the flexible feeling of my lashes instead of feeling hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, the packaging is very nice! The tubes are silver with black writing and so far they still look brand new with no fading in sight. I hate tubes that leave residue on your hands after handling. The small black and pink box the tubes are stored in is very pretty with a simple yet sleek logo design. Its lined with a black satin material that started fraying in a small area due to me opening the box daily. Yes, I kept the box because it&#x27;s so pretty and it looks nice sitting on my vanity area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love your lashes, like the natural look, don&#x27;t have time to apply lashes (individuals or strips) daily, love emphasizing your eyes, then this is the 3D lash mascara for you. Live a little and try it!!</li>
            <li> Tried this Brand of 3d Mascara,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good, Love the case is comes in, Very very easy to apply You follow the steps First you add step on and right after you add step 2 wait 20sec and reapply step one. It did great my lashes where much longer.. I loved the dark lash, I only had to put in on once in a 8 hour day and it lasted, heads up don&#x27;t rub your eyes lol it will come off alittle bit,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad which is none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just want to let anyone who never use 3d fiber there is one issue is with every 3d fiber the 2nd step is fiber so while applying it they do tend to drop on the check or bottom of the eye, My fix to this is use paper towel or apply the 3d fiber before you add base or any other makeup on face lol</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes longer and gave more volume but I had black fibers all over my face and decided to return it</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this fiber lash mascara!! Not tricky to use. Just follow the directions until you reach the results you desire. I did only one eye to see the difference and it was very noticeable. I love the dramatic look. I love that I can use out with my other mascara as well.</li>
            <li> No better than my drugstore mascara, but three times the price and requires three times the effort. Maybelline has better alternatives for under $10.</li>
            <li> These Fiber Lashes worked great. I have tried a few in the past and made a huge mess. This was simple and looked great after a couple practice rounds - didn&#x27;t flake off!</li>
            <li> I was immediately impressed with this product upon receiving it. It comes in a beautiful black silk-like material lined box with a magnetic closure that makes it immediately feel luxurious. After reading the directions, I thought it might be a bit difficult to use, but it really was just as easy as using any other mascara, but with a better end result. It&#x27;s a 3 step system. You start with the magnifying gel which brushes on just like regular mascara. The gel lengthens and moisturizes the lashes. Next while the gel is still wet, you brush on the fibers which add volume and length until you decide you&#x27;ve reached the look you want so you can make your eyes look really dramatic, or just stand out without over doing it for the office. Then after waiting 20 seconds for the fibers to dry you add more of the gel to seal them in place and voila! you&#x27;re done. The only drawback I found is that the lashes are not water proof. So don&#x27;t get caught crying with them - but the plus side is that means they clean up easily off your face at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some videos on this product and some people didn&#x27;t like it. I honestly think they applyed it wrong. When applying the fibers don&#x27;t go from base to tip of lashes go from mid lashe to tip. That way there is no irritation. Compared to other lash fiber systems this one doesn&#x27;t leave fallout fibers all over your face.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about this. It really does work!! The price is so much better than the name brand. I have super short lashes that are blonde and this mascara makes them almost look like falsies! It comes in a nice case and the tubes feel like metal. Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use love the way my lashes look it looks as if I&#x27;m wearing lash extensions. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I applied only one coat that it did such a good job of coating my lashes, I haven&#x27;t even tried doing all 3 steps. Maybe I&#x27;ll try that later this week for date night, but so far, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Switched from another brand, this was not as good. Went back to original.</li>
            <li> I love the way my eye lashes look fuller and longer.  This gives me amazing results.</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to try this because everyone was talking about the difficulty of application. I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.  My first experience was great.  I followed the instructions and had a perfect result. My lashes look awesome after 2 applications and no muss no fuss.  Definitely will order again when I need it.</li>
            <li> Love this! Exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the advertisement said.</li>
            <li> Received my set and tried it this morning. Wow - they are easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t really find them messy. What impressed me most was the e-book that is included that not only tells you how to use the product, but also how to structure your eyebrows for your face shape and a whole bunch more. Most things come with very little information and leave you hanging for even the most basic instructions let alone tips to make the product last and apply easier. Oh - and ladies over 50 - you CAN have beautiful lashes again with this product.</li>
            <li> I dont know... I wanted to like it but it does make clumps and I hate clumps.  I did try many  time and it does make my lash longer but to me its not so pretty looking.</li>
            <li> Mia Adora&#x27;s customer service is the phenomenal!! Very impressed. I have yet to try the lash mascara, but seems easy enough to use. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product to enhance my lashes because I didn&#x27;t want to get extensions or put irritating grow serums on my lashes.  I&#x27;ve done both but was looking for an easy to apply fiber based mascara.  It took me about three days to play with the wand and to remember to put the clear gel on to seal the fibers on (I would get side-tracked and would forget) that I really noticed that it would look amazingly thicker.  Just so you know, I did get a free fiber mascara to review this product.</li>
            <li> I intended to buy this to use only for special occassions to replace using and dealing with false lashes. Now, I use it every day! I can&#x27;t imagine myself using regular mascara anymore. This mascara makes a difference how much more it opens up your eyes without it looking clumpy or overdone. It&#x27;s also super easy to apply for a first timer and reasonably priced. Great customer service as well!</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical at first....I have very short lashes to begin with...but when I put on the Mia Adora...bammm I had the most amazing longest looking eye lashes....my husband was even amazed he couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my eyes...so yes I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Mia Adora is the best fiber lash mascara I have tried.  I&#x27;ve tried both a pricier one, and one less expensive and the Mia one takes the top post for sure.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Love this 3D mascara. It is my first experience with this type of product. It is definitely worth the extra minutes to apply. Makes my lashes look longer and thicker. Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!!  It stay on all day yet still washes off at night very easily!!!  üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time in excellent condition! The mascara makes my lashes gorgeous, especially since I have skimpy Asian lashes. Love this mascara! No more need for fake lashes that make me paranoid about the glue falling off :)</li>
            <li> Here is my HONEST review of the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara Set...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Kudos to the seller: fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;- Easy application&lt;br /&gt;- No mess when applying the fibers&lt;br /&gt;- I had the mascara on all day and it didn&#x27;t smudge or loose its volume&lt;br /&gt;- After breaking the habit of making small strokes right to left when applying regular mascara and just applying from the base to the tip of the lash in a straight, upward motion, I had minimal to no clumping.&lt;br /&gt;- I have sensitive eyes AND wear contacts. I was hesitant on the idea of applying loose fibers onto my lashes. Needless to say, no issues (although I&#x27;ve only really used this for a couple of days).&lt;br /&gt;- A great PLUS is that this product is available for a price lower than Younique. And quite frankly I think it looks a lot better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to what other reviewers have said, I do agree that the product MAGNIFIES your natural lashes by 300%. They didn&#x27;t say it LENGTHENS by that percentage. It definitely brings significant volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid using any type of eye lash curler after application. I found that using a hair dryer helps curl the lashes!</li>
            <li> It takes a couple times of using to get the right effect and results. The first couple times it didn&#x27;t come out as expected, but when you get the trick you can get as dramatic results as you want. I have a video review and demo on you tube (A1nettie2.0) if you would like to see the application process. Ultimately yes it works and the digital ebook included is very helpful to see tips. The diagrams and pictures are great as well. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
            <li> Very messy, flaky and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> If you have never used a 3D Fiber Lash Mascara reading the reviews and product information will probably leave you with more questions than answers. I hope my review will help you better understand if 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara comes with two tubes. The first is called Magnifying Gel. It looks like your traditional black mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd tube is called Natural Fiber Lashes. This tube is where I had a hard time wrapping my mind around what exactly it was. Prior to using Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara I&#x27;d never used a 3D mascara. This tube contains tiny micro fibers that adhere to the Magnifying Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand used in the Natural Fiber Lashes is different than the wand in the Magnifying Gel. The Natural Fiber Lashes wand doesn&#x27;t have bristles. What you see in my attached image that might appear to be bristles is actually the micro fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These micro fibers will adhere to the Magnifying Gel when applied quickly, before the Magnifying Gel dries. I&#x27;ve included a photo to give you a better idea of what the Natural Fiber look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application of Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is very easy. I like that I don&#x27;t have to use any glue as I&#x27;ve had a bad reaction the glue used to apply false eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara on myself and my daughter. I think it looks amazing on both of our eyes but I did such a better job on her&#x27;s that I&#x27;m going to use her before and after and after photo as my example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the left of my photo are my daughter&#x27;s natural lashes and on the right are her lashes with Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara applied. Mia Adora&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara added both length and volume. When you apply the Natural Fibers you may have excess fibers that give a clumped like look. If you use your mascara or a Q-Tip to remove the excess fibers you will not have a clumpy look to your eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora. These are definitely being added to my beauty regimen! 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora have better results than any mascara and easier to apply than fake lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratings (Out of five stars):&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Application: *5*&lt;br /&gt;Volume: *5*&lt;br /&gt;Length: *5*&lt;br /&gt;Sweat &amp; Tear Resistance: *5*&lt;br /&gt;Value: *5*&lt;br /&gt;Overall rating:  25 out of 25 stars / 5 Star Average&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoyed this review.

            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic customer service. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered these fiber lashes at the beginning of summer and I love them. They can look very natural with just one layer or you can go for more and glam it up. I use a layer of my own mascara underneath first. Tara F.</li>
            <li> The first one I received didn&#x27;t have much product in the gel portion or the fiber lashes. The company was able to send a replacement and the second was wayyyy better. I have used younique lash prior to this and this product is pretty similar. You will get length and some thickness if you use the product correctly. It&#x27;s fairly easy to apply and stays on well thoughout the day. If you want to save on 3D mascara, I highly recommend Mia adora!</li>
            <li> Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is my new go to mascara.  I have ordered it twice now and absolutely love it.  It gives me long full lashes without the fake gawdy look.  It is easy to apply and does not flake throuout the day.  I finish it with a light coat of waterproof mascara.  Although it is a little spendy, it lasts a long time and is well worth the price.  Shipping was prompt.  A satisfied purchaser, Annette M</li>
            <li> This 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is Awesome!!!!!! loving the outcome overall.</li>
            <li> Doesnt feel like its working at first but a huge differencw!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Adds great length,  like this product way better than Younique .</li>
            <li> Love the mascara; it is easy to apply, great results, and well worth the price. I wear contacts and there is no irritation.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described. It does seem to work better if you apply one coat of your regular mascara first then first coat of gel. I also think it works best doing one eye at a time. Washes off easily. It does take some practice.</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy to apply and looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I really liked this eyelash curler! It did it&#x27;s job and didn&#x27;t pull!</li>
            <li> Be sure to curl lashes first.  Apply a coat of good lengthening mascara (I use Guerlain) and allow to dry.  Then use the 3 d fiber lash according to directions.  Concentrate on lashes about half way up straight to the tips.&lt;br /&gt;You will really see a difference.  I use Latisse and Guerlain, and that is typically enough, but with the addition of this, they get mega long :)</li>
            <li> This product is as described.  It goes on smoothly and extends lashes nicely.  I have tried another similar product and this one performs better.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to. I followed the instructions explicitly but i don&#x27;t see a difference. I usually use the Younique brand and it really and truly works. I get amazing results with that one. Not this though. Disappointing. :o(</li>
            <li> I really love this 3D fiber lashes.. It&#x27;s really make  my lashes so long and it&#x27;s looks naturals and easily applied. I&#x27;m very happy that I found this kind of brand. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Magnifying Gel looks just like a mascara wand. It‚Äôs quite large and it‚Äôs easy to accidentally hit your eyelid while applying this. The Natural Fibers looks like a small mascara wand that‚Äôs covered in small fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say that it practice does make perfect.. There is a slight learning curve to putting these on. I will admit that I jumped the gun and skimmed the instructions the first time I put the 3D Fiber Lashes by Mia Adora on. I did exactly what it said not to do, which was to put the fibers too close to your eye ball. Because of that, I got fibers all in my eyes and they were dry all day. So, on first attempt I hated these! I decided to actually read the instructions and applied the fibers for the second time to the top half of my lashes and it was glorious. Lesson of the day? Read the instructions! I did test the waterproof claim of the mascara. It didn‚Äôt run nor did it mess up the lashes. They looked just as good before and after. It was a nice surprise as I don‚Äôt generally wear waterproof mascara because it‚Äôs so difficult to get off, but these came off with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never tried fiber lashes before these. I had been wanting too but I have so many other mascaras that I didn‚Äôt want to spend another $30 buying some. I‚Äôm so happy I did because I‚Äôm not a fake lashes girl. I never have been and I don‚Äôt think I ever will be. This mascara makes it look like I have falsies on. It‚Äôs amazing. I get so much volume and a decent amount of length. I‚Äôm so impressed with this mascara. My lashes look fabulous. I‚Äôve gotten so many complements, it‚Äôs such a confidence booster!</li>
            <li> Wow!  I have very thin lashes and this fiber lash mascara made my lashes look think and full.  The process is easy if you follow the directions.  And, you basically can choose how much thickness you want to add to your lashes by repeating steps.  So, if you&#x27;re going for a day look you can do a step once and for a night look you can do additional steps until you get the look you want.  I am not a big makeup wearer, but I do like to at least do my eyes in some way.  I usually just apply some liner.  But, I tried just applying this mascara and it actually looked even more natural than with just the liner.  I prefer a natural look and applying only this mascara made my eyes look dramatic, but naturally dramatic.  I always thought the liner was an unnatural look, but like I said, my lashes are thin and traditional mascaras just never looked right.  They almost always seemed to clump up.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mascara. It gives length &amp; volume and lasts all day without giving raccoon eyes. It is great if applied right! Practice is definitely the key to get the right technique down. The first time  I used it I got a little carried away when applying it and put everything on way too thick. Since then I learned what works for my lashes and thin is the way to go! The fibers do sometimes get somewhat clumped up but running a lash comb through them really helps. I also the love the fact that this mascara is made with natural ingredients,paraben free,and is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for test and review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the easier it is.  First application was a little hard.  Every day a bit easier.  I have re-ordered already.  My lashes have thinned out and now they look the best they have in a long time</li>
            <li> I love this my lashes are huge! Exactly what I was expecting, love it!</li>
            <li> beautiful product, i love it, very stunning and more than just i thought it is beautiful when i applied it, affordable and excellent 3d fiber lash.</li>
            <li> Love,Love this product. I love this eyelash curler. The 3 Dmascara is awesome. I am going to buy more soon,because I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product- it takes a few practice runs to get the hang of it, but totally worth it. My eyes pop with this mascara combo. I was also happily surprised that it does not clump, even with multiple coats. It comes off easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> love love love it! i have short sparse lashes, since using i have been asked if i got extensions! very easy to apply</li>
            <li> I LOVE Mia Adora&#x27;s fiber lash product! I tried a similar product by recommendation of a friend, and although I loved how much better my lashes looked, the fibers kept getting into my eyes. Very frustrating all day.  I have also spent a lot of money on high end mascara&#x27;s and have yet to find one that does what it says. I took the time to read the instructions online, and I have NOT had any problems.  I am 60 with  thin eyelashes so this is not a review by a young girl who still has lots of lashes left.  This product has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. My lashes used to be thick but as I got older (I&#x27;m 54), my lashes seemed thinner and less lush. I&#x27;ve tried false lash sets and just could not get the hang of putting them on. This is very easy -- just follow the instructions to the letter. Curl your lashes first, follow the instructions, then let the product dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is any different from any other fiber lash mascara, including the much cheaper version by maybelline. It adds some volume and some length, but creates spider eyes easily. And it is not smudge proof. I ended up returning mine. However the company was great. Took and processed my return, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> Ok‚Ä¶.but doesn‚Äôt work that great.</li>
            <li> im so impressed with this stuff..i did one eye first and the difference was crazy-I love this!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, I have a lot of mascara and this is now my new fav. I personally found this super easy to apply, Lasts all day. Looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a little bit more complicated than regular mascara because you need to coat lashes, apply fibers, then seal with another coat of mascara.  I use regular mascara for &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; and use the 3D mascara for that extra &amp;#34;turned out&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> This mascara works very well.I am so happy to have this.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mascara I have ever used!  And I have tried them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mascara was the one thing in my beauty bag that I could never hit a happy medium with (much less love).  There was always at least one thing that would disappoint me about all of them.  They would clump, smudge, flake, or just not be black enough.  I&#x27;ve not experienced any of those drawbacks with this product!  It&#x27;s even somewhat tear proof!  The price is nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip:  Through my own personal experience with applying this mascara, I&#x27;ve discovered that long, slow strokes work best for me :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and you&#x27;ll never use a different brand again!</li>
            <li> I had to wait to write a review because i wanna see just how effective this is based on a daily wear. I would say im really impressed. My lash is really short &amp; when i started using this, i get a lot of comments from my friends about how great my eyelash looked. Its thicker &amp; fuller. I love it!  When you get use to it, its like a flash, &amp; youre all set.</li>
            <li> I am still learning to use this mascara but so far I love the way it makes my lashes look! It&#x27;s easy to use, you just have to learn how it works best for you. I have just used the base before and it worked great! Thanks for the discount!</li>
            <li> My lashes look great and it lasts most of the day</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPd23f51eecbf8fef5835e303afc015a5f&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&amp;lt;/a&gt; I have feel in love. I never tried fiber lashes before, but I always wondered how it works. So its a two part step that has to be done. The first step is just like mascara and its applied the same, the second step is to add the fibers. If its not thick or long enough repeat. Ive always loved the look of lashes because they are full and long but is scared to wear them because i dont want to look fake.The fiber lashes are natural but are thick and full. I love them. Great shipping and Great product. &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMd23f51eecbf8fef5835e303afc015a5f&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&amp;lt;/a&gt;</li>
            <li> Of all the different 3D fiber lash mascaras I have tried in the past, the Mia Adora brand is vastly superior than all of them.  Easy application produces thick and long eyelashes without any  eye irritation.  With all that,  it&#x27;s also cheaper than other brands that I have used.  I am now a committed and faithful user and will highly recommend this product to other women who desire beautiful eye lashes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The brush that came with my mascara was falling apart and basically unusable.  This mascara is very expensive and is basically useless because it cannot be applied correctly without a decent brush.</li>
            <li> Loved itt and my daughter loved it. Speedy shopping and good quality. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It takes some&lt;br /&gt;practice but it gives you full and long lashes and so easy to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michelle G</li>
            <li> Hi, my name is Leighann and I have hypotrichosis, at least that‚Äôs what Brooke Shields told me in her Lattise commercial.  I suffer from abnormally short sparse lashes that are weak as heck but for some reason strong enough to fight any curling mechanism known to man.  Okay that‚Äôs a lie, I have permed it and used the blow drier to heat up my eyelash curler and that seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I love trying new products but I also have such low hopes in them working.  When I heard of fiber lashes I was intrigued by the science.  I decided to try out Mia Adora because the price was pretty amazing and it declared that it can make the impossible happen, lengthen my lashes.  And what a miracle it was.  What?!?!?! I have lashes?  What?!?!? They‚Äôre luscious and not at all fake?  What?!?!?!  It‚Äôs so easy to apply and to REMOVE?  I love this Mascara!  Takes a while to put on but I like primping in front of the mirror so no loss there.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received my order yesterday and was so upset when I tried to use it and one of the tubes were completely dried out.</li>
            <li> the 3D fiber lash mascara made my lashes  look longer I don&#x27;t  need to wear  fake lashes  any more :)</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara! No more false lashes for me! Definitely worth the money! I&#x27;ve received so many compliments!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I would definitely recommend this product. Amazing result and amazing company! Such nice people!!!! I posted a video of me using the product and after one layer of coating you can really see the difference! I was truly surprised but absolutely amazed! Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Is not waterproof as ad states. The false fiber irritated my eyes since it did not stay on. Very disappointed. Would like a no hassel refund as ad states. Too much trouble to send back if not. After all, they cannot reuse cosmetics anyways:(</li>
            <li> Very nice worked good.</li>
            <li> Simply said... I&#x27;m OBSESSED!!! Great product</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 kinds if fibers before Mia Adora and got o.k.results but they were either very messy or didn&#x27;t give me length just thickness. Mia Adora 3D fibers gave my lashes all day length and thickness WITHOUT looking like spider legs and clumpy. This was a big deal for me because I had been using lash extensions for 4 ¬Ω years and have lost a ton of my real lashes,but you can&#x27;t tell any breakage of my real lashes thanks to my 3D lashes, I highly recommend Mia Adora 3D Fiber Lashes (btw I was super nervous about it being waterproof, it was actually so easy to remove even while swimming I didn&#x27;t look like a raccoon LOL) I will definitely be getting these fibers again!!!</li>
            <li> I have long lashes and when I use the mascara I loved it my eyes look sexy it&#x27;s the best I ever useüëç</li>
            <li> good product.  Did as advertised.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MASCARA!  I will say I don&#x27;t wear make-up everyday and was skeptical of everyone promoting this lashes but I tried them and as a stay at home mom and women who has been thru chemo THESE WORK WONDERS!!!!!  Jeans and tee-shirt or dressing up you can rock it with these.  It is amazing how this Mascara makes such a difference on ones face and can bring out your eyes so much and make you feel so pretty.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!!!!  People will look at you because they will see a difference also.  Don&#x27;t wait like I did!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a process, but they look nice on!</li>
            <li> It is exactly how it is advertised!  The best mascara ever!!!  I will never buy anything else again:)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, maybe not worth the money. I didn&#x27;t see that drastic of results.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the product.  I don&#x27;t use it daily because it does take a little extra time (though, not too much more than normal daily mascara application) but for an alternative to false lashes it&#x27;s great for extra volume.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I will definitely purchase again once I run out of my initial tube.</li>
            <li> Great product I see a major difference!  I love it I use it all the time! I definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;-Karen M.</li>
            <li> A lot easier to work with than expected, and I&#x27;ve learned to make it look natural, yet it gives me the long, dark lashes I want. Shipping came in quick, too!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look about 30% fuller.</li>
            <li> I definitely love this product, cute packaging and good instruction booklet. Didn&#x27;t clump on me and it never flaked. My eyelashes are small and I don&#x27;t like false lashes so this product is my absolute favorite&lt;br /&gt;You can do 3 different coats of this with the transplanting gel and fibers and it won&#x27;t clump it will just make them more voluminous and long.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used any of my other mascaras since I purchased this product, I recommend everyong to buy this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product , it upset my eyes, made them itch and it kept flaking off even tho I put a lot of gel. I&#x27;m not satisfied and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this out! My eyelashes are very little so I definitely love mascara. I was hoping this would be a great alternative to false lashes as they normally irritate my eyes. The packaging was nice in a little box. I first tried this product first on clean lashes and it looked like regular mascara. The fibers did irritate my eyes as I was putting it on. The second time I used it, same thing. I think I may need to keep trying as other reviews say practice makes perfect. I will post updates and pictures later.</li>
            <li> Too flakey it gets in your eyes üëÄ. Too many steps in the process.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised. I will be buying more. I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brandi M</li>
            <li> This has become a daily makeup routine for me.  These fibers do a beautiful job at enhancing my lashes.  They definitely look longer and more &amp;#34;luscious&amp;#34;.  I use it quite often and it has not irritated my eyes(keep in mind each individual will react differently to the product) it looks very pretty and natural.  I hate using fake lashes so this is a great alternative.  I recommended to my mother and she bought one for herself.  I will continue to use this product - A L</li>
            <li> That mascara is awesome. I have very blond eye lashes and using the 3D fiber lash mascara makes my eyes look like stars.</li>
            <li> I love my 3D fiber lash mascara! This is the first time that I had tried any of the fiber lash mascaras and I was not disappointed. The product actually came earlier than the predicted arrival date. It comes in a nice box that holds the lengthening gel and fibers. The lengthening brush separates lashes instead of clumping together, even with numerous coats. It also volumizes your lashes, giving them that long full look. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product really does extend the lashes!! Very easy to apply. Lasts all day. Washes off easily with make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing extensions on my top lashes for years now, finding a mascara that matches the volume and length for my lower lashes is a challenge. It definitely requires time to &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; the technique with lower lashes, it&#x27;s worth it at the end!&lt;br /&gt;As for the top lashes, I practiced on my 7 years old daughter, her 9 years old brother and the &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; (sorry bae!). It&#x27;s a piece of cake, love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  When I really want to look good I use Mia Adorable mascara. I like the natural look. I take pride in my natural hair, it&#x27;s very long and all mine. I love my real nails.  Mia Adora helps me have the length and look of false eyelashes,  but they&#x27;re my own natural lashes!  I love it!</li>
            <li> It works great! Makes my lashes look like falsies when there actually my own lashes loved it!!! (:  -Berenice A</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I get a lot of compliments. People ask if I have false eyelashes all the time.  I have recommended it a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Fiber Lash Mascara!! I read some reviews that said it was difficult to apply....I SOOOO did not find that the case! It was just as easy as the instructions explain. My eyelashes have become very fine &amp; sparse, but with the Mia Adora Fiber Lash Mascara my eyelashes are just as long as if I had used fake eyelashes. I am VERY pleased &amp; would recommend Mia Adora to anyone who needs the extra length &amp; thickness as I do. They have an amazing customer service who contact you the entire way of your process. Thank you, Crystal &amp; team, for your appreciation of your customers!! It has truly been a pleasure &amp; I WILL be back when my product is gone!&lt;br /&gt;I will attach photos at a later date when I have a chance, it is evening now &amp; I am not wearing makeup! Stay tuned!</li>
            <li> This product deserves a great review. Love this 3D fiber lash mascara and wish I discovered it earlier. I can really see the huge difference between a regular mascara and a 3D mascara. I have fine, short, asian eyelashes, so I envy anyone with long, thick, dark eyelashes. With this product, it makes me feel beautiful every time I use it without applying fake eyelashes. Fast delivery and good customer service. Would definitely purchase again. You would not regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> I just really like this product. I was so excited about it that I gave my daughter in law some for her Birthday. She also gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  Im new to using fiber lashes but I caught on right away and these really do make your eyelashes look 100x more longer, thicker, and fuller!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have another brand which is pretty good but I read the reviews on this and took a chance that it was better.  It&#x27;s not.  The gel tube is practically dry and the fibers go on very sparsely, which means I have to  go through the process atleast 3 times to get the effect I get with one application of my other brand.  Sorry, won&#x27;t be getting this one again.  If it was just the dried up gel that was causing the problem, then I might try it, but the whole application process is too time consuming compared to the other brand.</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome. It does not leave clumbs like Younique does and the fiber is not as loose that gets into your eyes. Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> The fillers in this mascara would flake off and get into my eyes!</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome!  I use the Mia Adora eyelash curler as well and so far that&#x27;s also worked great.  What a difference this fiber lash mascara makes...my lashes are pretty short and straight (Asian eyelashes)...and afterwards they look fantastic.  I get compliments all the time when I wear it.  I tried the other brand (Younique) and was not impressed at all...the fibers kept falling in my eyes and when I&#x27;d try to correct any mistakes above my eyes with a Q-Tip, it would clump them together, then I would have to separate them, which would cause them to fall off, so I&#x27;d have to reapply it all (vicious circle).  I don&#x27;t have that problem with the Mia Adora brand, after I Q-tip, my lashes are still separated...best part is I don&#x27;t end up with fibers in my eyes during application or throughout the day.  I haven&#x27;t been using my fiber lashes as much recently because I haven&#x27;t had as much time lately and it does take a bit longer to apply than regular mascara, but really does make a huge difference when I do.</li>
            <li> loved this product and will continued ordering from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than other fiber lashes I have used because lash fibers don&#x27;t get in my eyes while applying and during the day. I use this along with a coat of my fave mascara.</li>
            <li> This was actually a bit more complicated than I expected.  Took my a couple of tries to get the hang of proper application. The fibers are a bit darker than expected but I have very dark lashes anyway.  Some of the fibers will fall out, so keep a small tissue under the eye when applying.&lt;br /&gt;I applied once in the morning and by mid-evening, I needed to make another application.  If the fibers fall into the eye, it will become quite irritated.  That only happened once but I think a slower and lighter application eliminated that issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes do look longer and much fuller after use.  Although the fibers will washout when you wash your face, I found no issues when I was perspiring or even crying. Don&#x27;t wear into the pool!  :)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  Just a couple of minor things are an issue -- nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Mia Adora 3D Lash Mascara in order to facilitate a review.  All opinions are my own and based on my own use of the item.</li>
            <li> The Fiber Lash Mascara is very easy to use.  You get the look of long, glamorous lashes without having to deal with false eyelashes.  It also makes your lashes appear naturally long vs falsely long.  Very easy to take off without any irritation which is a plus b/c my eyes are sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Younique</li>
            <li> Great product! Quick and Easy to use!</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara, looking, beautiful if you take time to put it the right way.i  very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Amazing! Will repurchase(:</li>
            <li> This is average. Have gotten much better fiber mascara at sephora at a better price.  Should have stuck with what I knew.</li>
            <li> IT looks great when applied properly my lashes look super think and long. you have to be careful with the fiber part though cause it will spill easily. I have super sensitive eyes so it can make them pretty itchy and red and painful if im not extra careful but otherwise this is awesome.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  I suffer from short thin lashes and also different lash length.  This product lengthened and thickened lashes without clumping. You could do one layer or several of coats to add more drama. Loved it. I was also say it does take a little practice at first so do not become discouraged</li>
            <li> Younique product is much better</li>
            <li> I found that you need to be really careful or else the fibers get in your eyes and cause discomfort.  I put in on the second time and loved it. I will always use this product. It is fabulous</li>
            <li> Not spectacular,  but ok.</li>
            <li> absoulty love this mascara!!! Recommend it to every woman out there</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup too often and I just can&#x27;t get the hang of false lashes so i tried this item.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I have to say my paltry old lashes really looked thicker and longer.  Wasn&#x27;t too hard to wash off either.  For me, a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> It really worked I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Easy to use! Washes off easily. Yet, doesn&#x27;t smear throughout the day! Doesn&#x27;t harm my lashes! Like I said, It&#x27;s Great! :) ...BUT, I never received my eyelash curler as promised.</li>
            <li> It does what it says, overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> WOW! This is the BEST mascara/fiber product I&#x27;ve ever tried!! No clumping, no fibers dropping off the brush onto my skin...and lasts....LOVE this stuff! Worked like a charm for me the first time I tried it. A breeze to apply.</li>
            <li> Amazing results, easy to use.  I highly recommend this product.  It arrived quickly and well packaged. I was very impressed with the results  I will be reordering.</li>
