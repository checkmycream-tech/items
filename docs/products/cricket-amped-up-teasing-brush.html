            <li>Best yet, perfect for my volume!!</li>
            <li>We all have days where we have great hair and not so great hair.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect teasing comb for that kind of thing.</li>
            <li>Great for teasing and vampy styling.</li>
            <li>Great for teasing hair and adding volume to any part of your hair.</li>
            <li>Good price too</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I get great volume without creating knots and the teased sections of my hair are easy to brush out.  </li>
            <li>This comb has amazing staying power when it does tease</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Okay so I just received this brush and have plans to use it as a back-comb device for putting my extensions in.</li>
            <li>Works great and not too big.</li>
            <li>Simply great brush for my daughter&#x27;s hair especially when I make a pony</li>
            <li>is fabulous.....</li>
            <li>And when I pulled at them, like a gentle tug, more came out.</li>
            <li>, the specially-designed tip allows me to easily section my hair, &amp; create a zigzag or other kind of part.</li>
            <li>this teasing brush is amazing and gives you fantastic volume within half the time it would normally take with just a teasing comb!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>My regular comb does a much better job.</li>
            <li>I have found that this comb is nice when it comes to combing down the top of what I teased as it doesn&#x27;t comb out the tease underneath like a regular plastic teasing comb does.</li>
            <li>this teasing brush help you to easily create various styles &amp; volume, while minimizing all kinds of damage (yes!)&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>I have always had difficulty teasing my hair and for me this product is so much easier to use than a rat-tail comb.  </li>
            <li>It is a great quality product and looks more expensive than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>my wife loves this and wants another</li>
            <li>And, the ergonomic handle is comfortable, especially if you have Carpal-Tunnel in your dominant hand&#x27;s wrist like I</li>
            <li>I really wanted a teasing comb</li>
            <li>but this just doesn&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy but in a good way, like solid plastic that my puppy could chew on</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s inexpensive, but is SO much better than any of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>small, easy to handle, and does just what it is intended to do!  </li>
            <li>Love it, I use it everyday!</li>
            <li>have long&#x27;ish, very baby fine wavy hair cut in long layers, but the top/crown just lies flat.  </li>
            <li>day old hair or a dry shampoo is applied first and then sprayed after teasing is complete</li>
            <li>So obviously the first thing I did was run it through my hair and sort of practice back combing and when I pulled it back, some of the bristles were falling out.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Maybe I just got a bad one or maybe its just like initial fall out....</li>
            <li> If using on baby hairs, very hard brush.</li>

            <li> Works great and not too big.</li>
            <li> Love this! Bought it after a friend of mine recommended it! Good price too</li>
            <li> Okay so I just received this brush and have plans to use it as a back-comb device for putting my extensions in. Anyhoo, I just opened the package so here are my initial thoughts. It&#x27;s heavy but in a good way, like solid plastic that my puppy could chew on but it would survive with only minor damage. So obviously the first thing I did was run it through my hair and sort of practice back combing and when I pulled it back, some of the bristles were falling out. And when I pulled at them, like a gentle tug, more came out. Additionally, the bristles are all different jagged lengths which I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s proper because it&#x27;s so inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a bad one or maybe its just like initial fall out....I don&#x27;t know. But kind of disappointed :/</li>
            <li> I do like this comb...some days. We all have days where we have great hair and not so great hair. I have found that this comb is nice when it comes to combing down the top of what I teased as it doesn&#x27;t comb out the tease underneath like a regular plastic teasing comb does. This comb has amazing staying power when it does tease but I feel like it is best for day old hair or a dry shampoo is applied first and then sprayed after teasing is complete</li>
            <li> this teasing brush is amazing and gives you fantastic volume within half the time it would normally take with just a teasing comb! i would buy this again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> I think the bristles should be a little tougher but it works! I I like it and the color blue is one of my favorites</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cheerleader so we have to tease our hair a LOT. This is a perfect teasing comb for that kind of thing.</li>
            <li> Simply great brush for my daughter&#x27;s hair especially when I make a pony</li>
            <li> Love it, I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I always had a hard time teasing my hair, but this brush really helps. I am not able to tease my hair and it look natural and not like a knot on my head.</li>
            <li> I have always had difficulty teasing my hair and for me this product is so much easier to use than a rat-tail comb.  I looked in several drugstores and a few other places that carry beauty products to purchase a teasing brush and could never find something like this.  I get great volume without creating knots and the teased sections of my hair are easy to brush out.  It is a great quality product and looks more expensive than it actually is.  I like that it also doubles as a regular brush too, to brush my hair out, which I could never do with a rat-tail comb.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Best yet, perfect for my volume!!</li>
            <li> Great for teasing and vampy styling. This is second one I purchased as I throw one in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Great for teasing hair and adding volume to any part of your hair.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this and wants another</li>
            <li> If using on baby hairs, very hard brush. Not sure about the teasing part by bristles are quite firm and hard.</li>
            <li> I was given one of these in a styling class, it was a REVELATION. AMAZING. I lost it in the midst of a move, and I went to my local ulta to find a replacement, I bought a few different ones but nothing comes close to this one! it&#x27;s inexpensive, but is SO much better than any of the more expensive ones. buy this!</li>
            <li> The multi-level bristles&#x27; pattern &amp; texture (mixed boar &amp; nylon)on this teasing brush help you to easily create various styles &amp; volume, while minimizing all kinds of damage (yes!)&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the specially-designed tip allows me to easily section my hair, &amp; create a zigzag or other kind of part. And, the ergonomic handle is comfortable, especially if you have Carpal-Tunnel in your dominant hand&#x27;s wrist like I do.&lt;br /&gt;I have long&#x27;ish, very baby fine wavy hair cut in long layers, but the top/crown just lies flat.  This totally-awesome tool give me enough oomph at the roots, thereby balancing my &#x27;hairstyle&#x27; - a really big thing for me. ;-)</li>
            <li> I really wanted a teasing comb but this just doesn&#x27;t really do anything.  My regular comb does a much better job.</li>
            <li> Cricket  Amped Up Teasing  Brush is fabulous.....small, easy to handle, and does just what it is intended to do!  I love it!</li>
