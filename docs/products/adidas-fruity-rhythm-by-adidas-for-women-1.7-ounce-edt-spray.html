            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend because it was cheap</li>

            <li>I got this for a gift for my lady and enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>I smells kinda cheap.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, Fruity Rhythm lasts fairly well, and is an addition to the fragrance collection of natural scent lovers.</li>
            <li>A little pick-me-up scent to spritz on in the morning and enjoy through the day, very nice!</li>
            <li>i highly recomend to bye this :) !...</li>
            <li>I have always loved adidas perfumes and this scent is sweet and soft but it lasts!</li>
            <li>This smells ok when you first put it on .  </li>
            <li>We are not disappointed for the purchase</li>
            <li>Better to buy a fragrance you can try first.</li>
            <li>the parfum are very nice, there are very seewt and that ist erfect to use in the morning because that parfum are so softly to the ocasion</li>
            <li>was purchased as last minute gift.&lt;br /&gt;The person gifted to liked the mild fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything about thisperfume, it&#x27;s pink bottle to it&#x27;s scent, makes me happy to be a woman.</li>
            <li>Good for a teen or to wear to work.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a light, fun scent</li>
            <li>Not only does this fragrance smell good, but to my wife and I...</li>
            <li>She loves it, thinks it&#x27;s a good smell and at the same time not overbearing.</li>
            <li>But really, smells lovely.</li>
            <li>it smells good last all day on you price</li>
            <li>I Love its smell and it very cheep</li>
            <li>I figured it would be a sweet fruity smell</li>
            <li>It smells really good and last</li>
            <li>it really last a good long time which is surprising.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice perfume for the price, but I&#x27;ve found the other Adidas perfumes to be much more satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet, but just right.  </li>
            <li>Nice cologne, smell wonderful, but in me does not last to long, but enough for a while.</li>
            <li>but I thought it was worth the risk because of the price.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the $8.</li>
            <li>This perfume has just the right blend of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I use to think that I had to pay lots of money for the right perfumes because the saying: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.</li>
            <li>the power of it&#x27;s scent is just right.</li>
            <li>I would very highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It is hard to find perfumes that suit me if I don&#x27;t smell them first, lol.</li>
            <li>The scent is light but strong enough to still be noticed, if you are like me and willing to try new things give this one a try!  </li>
            <li>Very femine, fresh outta the shower smell.</li>
            <li>And it does exactly that.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First time i bought something online</li>
            <li>A good deal for something that lasts this long and smells this good at such a small price.</li>
            <li>I love this light, long lasting, fruity scent from Adidas.  </li>
            <li>The problem is I need to put so much on just to be able to smell even a hint of it for very long.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good as a cheap every day fragrance to spray on at random occasions.</li>
            <li>The tricky thing is that she doesn&#x27;t really like perfume</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok not real fruity</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This perfume makes me feel young and fresh.</li>
            <li>For the price, I guess I can&#x27;t really complain about this perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fruity and very feminine and lasted about 2 months.</li>
            <li>I really like how this smells.</li>
            <li>it is not a long laster scent, but you can spray every now and then as in now and later, 1 or 2 short sprays lightly will give that great passionate tropical scenty effect.</li>
            <li>I never smelled this before, so I usually would not buy something that I might not like, but I love it!</li>
            <li>Other reviews were right about sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>I mean I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this perfume!</li>
            <li>I am just really getting into wearing perfumes at 27yrs old.  </li>
            <li>and I didnt think I would like it because I normally don&#x27;t buy perfume online unless I know the fragrance.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend bought me this for Christmas last year and I have used it so much!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell strong at all - a little fruity, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too light and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t feel old when I wear it</li>
            <li>but NOW I&#x27;ve been completely swayed.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it was not as fruity as I would have liked but then and again that is not the product&#x27;s fault</li>
            <li>If you in the market for something light (not overpowering) and a whimsical fruit flavor scent then Fruity Rhythm could be just right for you!</li>
            <li>And free shipping is like a little Christmas present for me!</li>

            <li> The scent is light but strong enough to still be noticed, if you are like me and willing to try new things give this one a try!  </li>
            <li> Very femine, fresh outta the shower smell.</li>
            <li> And it does exactly that.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First time i bought something online</li>
            <li> A good deal for something that lasts this long and smells this good at such a small price.</li>
            <li> I love this light, long lasting, fruity scent from Adidas.  </li>
            <li> The problem is I need to put so much on just to be able to smell even a hint of it for very long.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good as a cheap every day fragrance to spray on at random occasions.</li>
            <li> The tricky thing is that she doesn&#x27;t really like perfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not real fruity</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This perfume makes me feel young and fresh.</li>
            <li> For the price, I guess I can&#x27;t really complain about this perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fruity and very feminine and lasted about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I really like how this smells.</li>
            <li> it is not a long laster scent, but you can spray every now and then as in now and later, 1 or 2 short sprays lightly will give that great passionate tropical scenty effect.</li>
            <li> I never smelled this before, so I usually would not buy something that I might not like, but I love it!</li>
            <li> Other reviews were right about sweet smell.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I mean I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this perfume!</li>
            <li> I am just really getting into wearing perfumes at 27yrs old.  </li>
            <li> and I didnt think I would like it because I normally don&#x27;t buy perfume online unless I know the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought me this for Christmas last year and I have used it so much!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell strong at all - a little fruity, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too light and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t feel old when I wear it</li>
            <li> but NOW I&#x27;ve been completely swayed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it was not as fruity as I would have liked but then and again that is not the product&#x27;s fault</li>
            <li> If you in the market for something light (not overpowering) and a whimsical fruit flavor scent then Fruity Rhythm could be just right for you!</li>
            <li> And free shipping is like a little Christmas present for me!</li>
            <li> I really like the scent on her, and this is the perfume that I usually purchase for</li>
            <li> sent doesn&#x27;t last to long.</li>
            <li> The scent last so long!</li>
            <li> it does smell fruity just like it says, lasts a long time as well, when i run out</li>
            <li> and its smell lasts so long..</li>
            <li> I got the product today, as a little Christmas present to myself, and it smells TERRIFIC!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t find that it lasts very long</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe the smell, but it is soft and def not overwhelming like some perfumes can be.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few months back</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> i got this perfume 5 days before the due date.  </li>
            <li> but I was pretty upset when I walked into work after ordering this for $8 +s.h. and seen we had the same sized bottle in a pack with 2 other Adidas fragrances of the same size for $8 :(</li>
            <li> This products came quickly and it looks like a very expensive perfume</li>
            <li> I am a scent-a-holic and I usually wear Victoria&#x27;s Secret or Bath &amp; Body Works, but I have to say that this is my new addiction.</li>
            <li> In this case it&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s casual, daytime, or nightime, cologne, and it&#x27;s very mature.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL COULD OF BEEN A LITTLE STRONGER</li>
            <li> not worth buying on here!</li>
            <li> Will be buying the other scents from Addidas as well!!</li>
            <li> I actually prefer a subtle scent but this one is so subtle</li>
            <li> The only reaosn it isn&#x27;t 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last :(    </li>
            <li> Not a LOVE scent that I thought I might like.</li>
            <li> I usually spray this on myself before going to bed.</li>
            <li> its very hard to find it in stores, and when i do its half gone.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t checked lately to see if they are still selling it.  </li>
            <li> I hate flowery scents and too much citrus</li>
            <li> I should never buy a perfume on line, i was not happy with the smell, what a waist of money.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose and the wrong perfume will cause my nostrils to flare which could be very painful.</li>
            <li> But it has become increasingly difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> This never happened with the expensive perfumes that I wear.</li>
            <li> it can be worn casually.</li>
            <li> con un aroma muy juvenil y casual la usa</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing Adidas perfume because I always thought that it would have an unpleasant scent</li>
            <li> IT WAS VERY FAINT</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found an Adidas perfume that smells bad, so I would say go for it.</li>
            <li> This one has that sporty fruity smell that I never get sick of.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Now I just wear it around the house because I hate reapply as often as every 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought it for my mother. She said it was okay.&lt;br /&gt;The sent doesn&#x27;t last to long. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Having tried out the mens Adidas and liking the sporty smell for myself I decided to order this for my wife. The tricky thing is that she doesn&#x27;t really like perfume but I thought it was worth the risk because of the price. She loves it and I also enjoy the smell on her! This one has that sporty fruity smell that I never get sick of. She puts it on once a day in the morning and it almost lasts the entire day. A good deal for something that lasts this long and smells this good at such a small price.</li>
            <li> This fragance don´t have a good fixation, but it´s sweet for use every day. Good product and price.</li>
            <li> light and fruity, smells great, not overpowering</li>
            <li> it has a pleasant aroma</li>
            <li> This is a fab fragrance.  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere but here.  Haven&#x27;t checked lately to see if they are still selling it.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this light, long lasting, fruity scent from Adidas.  I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> A GIFT TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER 11 SHE LOVED IT</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months back and I didnt think I would like it because I normally don&#x27;t buy perfume online unless I know the fragrance. But this was awesome! Even when I cant smell it others seem to smell it and get ALOT of compliments! Very femine, fresh outta the shower smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not real fruity</li>
            <li> Never get problems with the direction</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this fragrance.  I buy her a couple of bottles every year at Christmas.  But it has become increasingly difficult to find in stores.  I&#x27;m so grateful that Amazon has Adidas Fruity Rhythm again this year. And free shipping is like a little Christmas present for me!</li>
            <li> I got the product today, as a little Christmas present to myself, and it smells TERRIFIC! Even my husband thought it smells good.. which is ALWAYS a plus!</li>
            <li> This smells ok when you first put it on .  As  another reviewer said it leaves a funky smell on you as it wears on  after awhile .  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  UPDATE;  That funky smell I told you guys about has totally disappeared!! This stuff really smells good!  I&#x27;ve had it on for several hours it really last a good long time which is surprising.  I didn&#x27;t think it would because of the cheap price.  The scent is light but strong enough to still be noticed, if you are like me and willing to try new things give this one a try!  Will try others by  this maker  and this one again .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she seemed to like it. I haven&#x27;t found an Adidas perfume that smells bad, so I would say go for it. I however like the Adidas Moves for her, and would suggest that over this perfume.</li>
            <li> ADIDAS FRUITY ES MUY RICA, AQUI EN VENEZUELA LA BUSCAN MUCHO POR LO FRESCO DE EL AROMA, GUSTO PARA USAR DIARIAMENTE. MU GUSTA EL PRECIO Y EL PERFUME. LO RECOMIENDO</li>
            <li> Nice cologne, smell wonderful, but in me does not last to long, but enough for a while. You feel fresh and beautiful</li>
            <li> Some things should not be bought online. I never smelled this before, so I usually would not buy something that I might not like, but I love it! I can&#x27;t describe the smell, but it is soft and def not overwhelming like some perfumes can be.  When I run out, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Light, Bright Sparkly Fruity Fragrance! If you in the market for something light (not overpowering) and a whimsical fruit flavor scent then Fruity Rhythm could be just right for you! It&#x27;s a very inexpensive scent too which is nice.. A little pick-me-up scent to spritz on in the morning and enjoy through the day, very nice!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let the name fool you. it has a nice light scent. it can be worn casually. really nice light weight scent that last for a nice while</li>
            <li> eu comprei esse produto e amei, é uma fragrância vem suave  pode comprar sem medo.</li>
            <li> This smells fine. Don&#x27;t find that it lasts very long but it&#x27;s good as a cheap every day fragrance to spray on at random occasions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Good scent and doable for the cheap price.  It&#x27;s not too light and not too heavy.  Good for a teen or to wear to work.</li>
            <li> very good. excellent.</li>
            <li> I love Adidas Fruity Rhythm!!  I have been looking for a light, fun scent and I have found it!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nice scent but don&#x27;t expect this for all day wear..lasts about no longer than three hours..smells very nice though..and great price..cant beat it</li>
            <li> its very hard to find it in stores, and when i do its half gone. i am glad they had it online because i ALWAYS get compliments on how good it smells!</li>
            <li> my gf love the smell of this parfume. its light fruity and for this price is great gift :)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought me this for Christmas last year and I have used it so much! It smells very good and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it :) I will buy again!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000VOP79O Adidas Fruity Rhythm By Adidas For Women, Eau De Toilette Spray, 1.7-Ounce Bottle]]  This perfume has just the right blend of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am just really getting into wearing perfumes at 27yrs old.  I have a very sensitive nose and the wrong perfume will cause my nostrils to flare which could be very painful. I use to think that I had to pay lots of money for the right perfumes because the saying: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. In this case it&#x27;s not true. This perfume is very lightly scented. Everywhere I go I am sure to get compliments. People want to know what perfume I am wearing. This never happened with the expensive perfumes that I wear. I wash my clothes and the smell is still lightly scented in them. Everything about thisperfume, it&#x27;s pink bottle to it&#x27;s scent, makes me happy to be a woman. And I don&#x27;t feel old when I wear it (Some perfumes have ancient looking bottles with pearls, and flower tops). This perfume makes me feel young and fresh.</li>
            <li> fragancia refrescante</li>
            <li> Not only does this fragrance smell good, but to my wife and I... the power of it&#x27;s scent is just right. The smell isn&#x27;t over powering, and is quite light. I really like the scent on her, and this is the perfume that I usually purchase for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like strong fragrances, you won&#x27;t care for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like my review, buy here:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000VOP79O B000VOP79O]]</li>
            <li> There was a family member who had purchased this, used it all up and wanted more, so this purchase was a gift.  It was loved!</li>
            <li> i got this perfume 5 days before the due date.  i love the smell.  i going to send to  HUNGARY,  to the friend, but: i going to have one for me,  ...&lt;br /&gt;the seller is perfect.  super nice packing.  thank you:  IRENE</li>
            <li> was purchased as last minute gift.&lt;br /&gt;The person gifted to liked the mild fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely a good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because it was cheap and I thought I would give it a shot. She uses it to smell good. And it does exactly that. She loves it, thinks it&#x27;s a good smell and at the same time not overbearing. It was definitely worth the $8. She is not a perfume connoisseur, so there&#x27;s that. But she definitely likes it for its intended purposes.</li>
            <li> it does smell fruity just like it says, lasts a long time as well, when i run out i will definitely come buy it again.</li>
            <li> When I say that I LOVE I mean I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this perfume! I was skeptical about purchasing Adidas perfume because I always thought that it would have an unpleasant scent but NOW I&#x27;ve been completely swayed. I am a scent-a-holic and I usually wear Victoria&#x27;s Secret or Bath &amp; Body Works, but I have to say that this is my new addiction. I have Floral Dreams and Fruity Rhythm. The scent last so long! I swear that I did not have to reapply for five hours and I receive so many compliments. I only wish that the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Great seller, great product as new. 10000% recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and feminine without being too sickingly sweet. The only reaosn it isn&#x27;t 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last :(    Now I just wear it around the house because I hate reapply as often as every 2 hours. But really, smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for me because I wanted something that was not too strong, and while it is okay, it leaves a funky after scent that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This is an OKAY item. I continue to use it just not often. Not a LOVE scent that I thought I might like. I think after this purchase, I will go back to buying my perfume at the store. It was a good price though. Im sure others would like this. Im just picky I guess.</li>
            <li> I should never buy a perfume on line, i was not happy with the smell, what a waist of money.</li>
            <li> For the price, I guess I can&#x27;t really complain about this perfume. It doesn&#x27;t smell strong at all - a little fruity, but that&#x27;s it. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger for more than 5 minutes. It smells nice, but nothing extraordinary, just a clean, fruity smell. I usually spray this on myself before going to bed. This is a nice perfume for the price, but I&#x27;ve found the other Adidas perfumes to be much more satisfactory.</li>
            <li> En realidad el producto no llegado a mis manos, no me percate que los perfumes son un problemas para despacharlos a otros paises. Necesito una soluci&amp;oacute;n pronto</li>
            <li> This is a bit too strong for me.  I got it because I thought it would have a light scent but this is not the case.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, in great packaging. My only complaint is that it was not as fruity as I would have liked but then and again that is not the product&#x27;s fault so I am giving it 5 stars. I love the shape of the bottle too; it&#x27;s quite elegant but not overly so.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION, YOU RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Oh, I absolutely love this scent and recommend it, no it is not a long laster scent, but you can spray every now and then as in now and later, 1 or 2 short sprays lightly will give that great passionate tropical scenty effect. Buy today.</li>
            <li> un arome frutal y fresco para hacer ejercicio y andar de diario.&lt;br /&gt;la presentacion es linda, ya la habia usado me gusta mucho.&lt;br /&gt;gente seria y respnsables muy puntuales los recomiendo al 100%</li>
            <li> The spray is very nice both my wife and myself liked the spray very much. We are not disappointed for the purchase</li>
            <li> the parfum are very nice, there are very seewt and that ist erfect to use in the morning because that parfum are so softly to the ocasion</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s fruity and very feminine and lasted about 2 months. Everyone commented on how nice I smelled. Thanks! One of my favorites and definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> everything as advertised and on time</li>
            <li> I would very highly recommend this! It smells amazing sweet and fruity but not over powering and it wears for along time  i am in love with it give it a try!!!!!! Im deffinatly buying this again! :)</li>
            <li> I really like how this smells.I hate flowery scents and too much citrus but this is fruity but not sickeningly so. The problem is I need to put so much on just to be able to smell even a hint of it for very long. And no I&#x27;m not just a smelly person who needs to drown herself in perfume. I actually prefer a subtle scent but this one is so subtle you don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in fragrance.  Not what I expected.  Would not recommend.  But that&#x27;s my personal opinion.  Better to buy a fragrance you can try first.</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift for my lady and enjoy the smell. I am sure she will enjoy too.</li>
            <li> Esta colonia juvenil se la compre a mi hija y le encanto, con un aroma muy juvenil y casual la usa a diario</li>
            <li> it smells good last all day on you price was good no complaints on my end i would buy moreof there products</li>
            <li> Excelente, responsable entrega la mercancía a tiempo y bien protegida lo recomiendo al cien por ciento. gracias. . . .</li>
            <li> THE SMELL COULD OF BEEN A LITTLE STRONGER IT WAS VERY FAINT YOU COULD HARLDY SMELL IT YOU HAD TO SPRAY ALOT OF IT.</li>
            <li> excelente todo me llego en tiempo y condiciones esperadas extraordinario servicio sigan asi honestidad, responsabilidad y buen servicio lo mejor de lo mejor</li>
            <li> This does not smell like fruit!!!  I smells kinda cheap. What the hell, u get what u pay 4 ! Lol</li>
            <li> I Love its smell and it very cheep and its smell lasts so long..i highly recomend to bye this :) !...</li>
            <li> Other reviews were right about sweet smell.  Not too sweet, but just right.  If you spray enough, it will last all day, especially if you spray on your clothes.  Size is perfect.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The perfume was ok. Not what I thought it would be. I figured it would be a sweet fruity smell but it wasn&#x27;t. But that was my fault. It is hard to find perfumes that suit me if I don&#x27;t smell them first, lol.</li>
            <li> Open and not well wrapped</li>
            <li> First time i bought something online &amp; I like all the products.</li>
            <li> Buena fragancia economica</li>
            <li> This is a great choice if you love scents with fruity notes. Not overpowering, Fruity Rhythm lasts fairly well, and is an addition to the fragrance collection of natural scent lovers.</li>
            <li> perfumes muy sabrosos y a buen precio, muy buen vendedor,.&lt;br /&gt;todo bien llego a venezuela en perfecto estado eso sip si osn de vzla no utilicen liberty express jaja</li>
            <li> I have always loved adidas perfumes and this scent is sweet and soft but it lasts! I am glad i chose it.</li>
            <li> This item was for my daughter and she loves it!!! Will be buying the other scents from Addidas as well!!</li>
            <li> This products came quickly and it looks like a very expensive perfume but it was a great price!  I can&#x27;t wait to give it to my sister!</li>
            <li> me gusta, es una fragancia suave y delicada para la mujer joven y despierta de nuestros tiempos, la recomiendo es fresca.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with the product, excellent quality, just what I was looking for a totally original fragrance, very good seller, timely delivery, good packaging, recommended for future purchases, worthy of five stars</li>
            <li> Great fruity smell...!!! I love this product! I bought it for my Girlfriend and we both like it!</li>
            <li> product arrived on time and are very good, a responsible person is recommended.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, fruity, smell. It&#x27;s casual, daytime, or nightime, cologne, and it&#x27;s very mature. I would recommend it and buy it again.</li>
            <li> Adidas&#x27;s perfume smell wonderful. And the price here is cheaper.  I like it. I will tell my friends to buy it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to smell too sweet, but it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s actually a perfect perfume to wear for any occasion. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and last but I was pretty upset when I walked into work after ordering this for $8 +s.h. and seen we had the same sized bottle in a pack with 2 other Adidas fragrances of the same size for $8 :( not worth buying on here!</li>
