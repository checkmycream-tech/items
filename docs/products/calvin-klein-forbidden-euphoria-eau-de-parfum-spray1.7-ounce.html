            <li>My boyfriend loves it as well. :)</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to a friend, and I think it smells better on her than it did on me.</li>
            <li>but when my boyfriend gave me a sample of this one to try I fell in love with it.  </li>

            <li>i would recommend it to others :)</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled better in the store.  </li>
            <li>The scent just does not linger at all - feels more.</li>
            <li>It stays with you most of the day or night and will have people asking you what you are wearing.</li>
            <li>I sprayed both scents and immediately feel love with Forbidden.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t  know if it was going to be as good as the reviiews said, turns out they were right.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant and refreshing, much better that the regular euphoria.  </li>
            <li>I like the perfume, but it&#x27;s not as nice as the original Euphoria.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those perfumes that smells good for the first hour</li>
            <li>wow ,very nice for wife</li>
            <li>When I was done shopping, it smelled as strong on my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet, vanilla, florals, but not overpowering or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This scent is seductive but light.</li>
            <li>I own CK Euphoria which I really like for the office.</li>
            <li>Yet it is Fun!</li>
            <li>I love this scent; was my first time purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering the original Calvin Klein Euphoria, and accidentally bought the Forbidden one instead.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the original Euphoria over this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter than the original and has a fruitier scent.</li>
            <li>A light floral and sweet scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance did not seem authentic - didn&#x27;t last for more than an hour which is unlike genuine CK products.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the real thing and not a knock-off.</li>
            <li>The original Euphoria has a stronger brasher smell and the scent is more masculine.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it a great price much less than it&#x27;s being sold at department stores.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft, vanilla type smell that isn&#x27;t super flowery or alcoholly like most womens perfumes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents so far.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it smelled nice enough to keep it instead of exchanging it for the one I intended on purchasing, so I kept it.</li>
            <li>you have it on, and then changes to a less pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite different than Euphoria, and is a bit more floral than I prefer.</li>
            <li>It fades very quickly and while similar to what&#x27;s sold in department stores</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I just really don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>Forbidden is in my opinion sexier than the regular euphoria and the silage and long lasting effect is great for its very inexpensive price point.</li>
            <li>I initially went to Ulta Beauty to purchase CK Euphoria (the original sent)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The replacement no where near Forbiden !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more girly/playful than Euphoria.</li>
            <li>I normally wear Calvin Klein Euphoria</li>
            <li>I may buy a few more now</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really test to see if the smell will last throughout the day since I&#x27;m using another perfume for now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product is old.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the original, Forbidden Euphoria is lighter and subtly inviting (once you catch a whiff you want to come closer and \\&quot;investigate\\&quot; ;-).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful in its own little way and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It is hard to describe the scent, but it is nice without being too strong or weak.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great product and excellent transaction</li>
            <li> Some of the perfumes have been watered down, the smell was lasting for few minutes only.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Sucks that they don&#x27;t have it in stores anymore. Haven&#x27;t really test to see if the smell will last throughout the day since I&#x27;m using another perfume for now. It smells really good just out of the box. I&#x27;ll update when I use later. The size is great for travel as well.</li>
            <li> This scent smells like sexy sophisticated class in a bottle. Yet it is Fun! It&#x27;s the perfect balance. To me it is a all seasons scent. Which is slowly starting to become my signature scent.  It truly is enchanting. It&#x27;s powerful in its own little way and a little goes a long way. I am glad I bought this fragrance it&#x27;s sweet, vanilla, florals, but not overpowering or overwhelming. Forbidden is in my opinion sexier than the regular euphoria and the silage and long lasting effect is great for its very inexpensive price point. I give this fragrance 5 stars and would also say that this is my pick for top 10 fragrances I have ever smelled in my life.</li>
            <li> I love this scent; was my first time purchasing it.  I know the Euphoria smelled great, now this one is one of favorite perfumes! My boyfriend loves it as well. :)</li>
            <li> Great gift for my girl friend... She loves it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. She loves it and I think it smells great too. It has a soft, vanilla type smell that isn&#x27;t super flowery or alcoholly like most womens perfumes.</li>
            <li> The scent is long lasting, and smells less sharp after few hours (which I like more). Similar scent to Calvin Klein Euphoria, but this one smells sharper, and if you are comparing these two, I&#x27;d recommend this one for younger people.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the original Calvin Klein Euphoria, and accidentally bought the Forbidden one instead. At first, I thought it smelled nice enough to keep it instead of exchanging it for the one I intended on purchasing, so I kept it. The smell is quite different than Euphoria, and is a bit more floral than I prefer. I ended up giving it to a friend, and I think it smells better on her than it did on me. It&#x27;s one of those perfumes that smells good for the first hour you have it on, and then changes to a less pleasant scent. I would recommend the original Euphoria over this one.</li>
            <li> The reason why I chose this particular fragrance was because when I tried it on in the department store, the smell was wonderful. But what really got me was that the fragrance lasted well over a few hours.  When I was done shopping, it smelled as strong on my skin. I have a hard time with perfumes lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume&#x27;s smell DOES not last at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very dissatisfied. N:(</li>
            <li> I normally wear Calvin Klein Euphoria but when my boyfriend gave me a sample of this one to try I fell in love with it.  Not to mention he loves the scent on me. That&#x27;s always a bonus!  It&#x27;s lighter than the original and has a fruitier scent.</li>
            <li> I have no opinion.  The product arrived as advertised and she seems to be happy with it.  Sorry not much help.</li>
            <li> wow ,very nice for wife</li>
            <li> I love this version of Forbidden.</li>
            <li> I like the perfume, but it&#x27;s not as nice as the original Euphoria.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  The smell is very pleasant and refreshing, much better that the regular euphoria.  Every time I wear this scent, I receive compliments from both men and women.  I purchased it a great price much less than it&#x27;s being sold at department stores.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my wife for Christmas.  It showed up just in time(thank God) and I was &#x27;tha Man&#x27;.  Believe me, it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife for Christmas. She really liked it.</li>
            <li> i think it is perfecto! smells great and really lasts a while too. i would recommend it to others :)</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled better in the store.  I don&#x27;t know if this product is old.  I just really don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> This was a present for a friend of mine and she is still talking about it. I think that this will be her product of choice for at least next few years. Also hard to beat the look of this product.</li>
            <li> The scent just does not linger at all - feels more. like spraying scented water. I would return it if I could.</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume ! Men love it! When I found out Calvin Klein replaced it I was devasted !! The replacement no where near Forbiden !!</li>
            <li> The fragrance did not seem authentic - didn&#x27;t last for more than an hour which is unlike genuine CK products.</li>
            <li> This scent is seductive but light. It stays with you most of the day or night and will have people asking you what you are wearing.</li>
            <li> I own CK Euphoria which I really like for the office. So, I decided to try this one. I am very glad I did. This is a really nice perfume. Somewhat similar to Euphoria. It is hard to describe the scent, but it is nice without being too strong or weak. It&#x27;s a little more girly/playful than Euphoria. I wear this one to the office, or out with my husband. I recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li> I initially went to Ulta Beauty to purchase CK Euphoria (the original sent) however the tester for Forbidden was there as well. I sprayed both scents and immediately feel love with Forbidden. Unlike the original, Forbidden Euphoria is lighter and subtly inviting (once you catch a whiff you want to come closer and \\&quot;investigate\\&quot; ;-). The original Euphoria has a stronger brasher smell and the scent is more masculine.  I was devastated when the salesperson informed me they no longer carried it. I search 8 different store, including their websites and the answer I got was, \\&quot;Out of Stock\\&quot;. On a whim I check Amazon and it was here (for half the price!). I bought two just in case. I may buy a few more now that I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the real thing and not a knock-off.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Sadly the one I got must have been exposed to heat or something as it&#x27;s a very weak scent. It fades very quickly and while similar to what&#x27;s sold in department stores it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents so far. Love it!</li>
            <li> Excelent perfume. I didn&#x27;t  know if it was going to be as good as the reviiews said, turns out they were right. A light floral and sweet scent. I bought it for me mom and she was very happy with the smell and with the bottle as well.</li>
