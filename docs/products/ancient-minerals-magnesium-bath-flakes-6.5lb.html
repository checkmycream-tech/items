            <li>The soaks are very effective.  </li>
            <li>This is the most perfect product and what a great relaxing way to get your magnesium needs met.  </li>
            <li>great product for a good soak</li>
            <li>This has been the most wonderful product for my fibromyalgia pain.</li>
            <li>distilled water is used in the marketed spray, which is a good idea because in some areas tap water contains chemicals which can work against Mg absorption, Fluoride being one of these).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to experiment with the flakes for a variety of uses, including cleaning and laundry, since they appear to be good at dissolving</li>
            <li>It dissolves well and feels good on the aches and pains.</li>
            <li>This spray can be used on aching joints or for spraying the bottom of your feet before bed with socks covering the spray... a good way to absorb magnesium trans-dermally every night.</li>
            <li>I have successfully created my own magnesium oil and will be saving tons of money.</li>
            <li>I had heard many good things about purified magnesium chloride (the best magnesium salt to use on skin because it&#x27;s more bio-available than epsom salts).  </li>
            <li>Best price and the right product to increase magnesuim by bathing or sprayng on..</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing relief.</li>
            <li>so I have been taking \\&quot;Calm\\&quot; magnesium powder in warm water at night to relax me for years.  </li>
            <li>so I could bath in it to increase my magnesium intake and also mix up my own magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li>So buy this and make your own.</li>
            <li>I buy these flakes to make my own magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li>Like having my own spa.  </li>
            <li>I either soak in a bath, or I make my own magnesium oil with it.</li>
            <li>Now I can make my own Manesim Oil.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, now that I own them, I have no idea what that person is referring to.  </li>
            <li>This is the absolute best way to get more magnesium into your body.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>ITS A MUST ITS AWESOME THE BEST SERIOUS</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING BATH EVER...</li>
            <li>It was easy and he did a nice soak without irritation or itching.  </li>
            <li>the package is HUGE!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get the top off of this product.</li>
            <li>how much better I feel when I come out of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MOSTLY</li>
            <li>This 8 lb bottle of magnesium chloride flakes is a welcome find on Amazon, offered at a reasonable price from the company which also provides mg sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, another reputable site described the mining and manufacturing processes of both the flakes and \\&quot;oils\\</li>
            <li>B001AD0HL8 Ancient Minerals]] web site [the hyperlink here goes to the Amazon page for this company&#x27;s mg oil spray] has interesting information on the mining, production, and suggested uses of these magnesium products.  </li>
            <li>I wrote more about this in my review of The Magnesium Miracle.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is reportedly not as perfect as magnesium chloride, but you just simply have to use more.</li>
            <li>I boiled them on top of the stove with no luck.</li>
            <li>, I feel more relaxed.</li>
            <li>I love the bath with it - felt better immediately.  </li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing in a weekly bath and a great way to absorb magnesium.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My husband got to use most of it, but still what I used was lovely.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The warmer the water, the better the absorption according to scientific book I read on magnesium trans-dermal therapy.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I didnt notice a difference from this and using salts, but I&#x27;ve read that this is better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>nice warm bath right before bed</li>
            <li>and I definitely had a very good sleep after.</li>
            <li>Very nice in my bath, dissolves really quick, much easier then store bought Epsom salt.</li>
            <li>Your experience may vary, but it&#x27;s certainly an easy thing to try.</li>
            <li>From quick research it appears that magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) is a pretty good source of Magnesium too.</li>
            <li>I actually like my own brew better than the magnesium oil I purchased, and I&#x27;ll save a lot of money making my own.</li>
            <li>If you want to make your own Mg chloride spray by adding water to these flakes, I would recommend first reading the Zechstein web site regarding this.  </li>
            <li>directions recommend using water that is not too hot as water that is overly warm will interfere with the absorption to the body.</li>
            <li>I feel blessed to find a product without unwanted ingredients which are often toxic and operating in opposition to the purpose of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In efforts to reverse numerous health issues currently speculated to be caused by magnesium deficiencies, many people have been reporting excellent results from transdermal applications of magnesium chloride sprays and bath flakes, much better results than from oral supplements (which can provide laxative effects unneeded by some, though I still use mg products both orally, for healthy regularity cleansing, and transdermally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As exemplified from a science class experiment noted in Dr. Carolyn Dean&#x27;s book, [[ASIN:034549458X The Magnesium Miracle]] (also on Kindle), magnesium in adequate quantities [the percentage of Mg has to be greater than the amount of</li>

            <li>The bottle is huge but you get a lot for the money.</li>
            <li>but some of them are rather hair-brained and most I&#x27;ve already tried without success.  </li>
            <li>i am free</li>
            <li>Ordered the 8# size and received it with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>no deoderant is needed this works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using them in warm foot baths for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>I use these flakes to make magnesium &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; (a misnomer, there is no oil in it) using DISTILLED water (important) heated on the stove and then cooled and placed in a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>take one hot-tube bath a week, use the equivalent of two cups in the warm (not hot) bath tube for best effect, soak myself for near an hour</li>
            <li>I have kidney stones and hope the magnesium helps, but was unexpected for how great it feels just to relaz in a hot tub with these bath crystals.  </li>
            <li>Ancient Minerals was also really great  to deal with and answered several question quickly via email</li>
            <li>When cool, I poured the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; into several spray bottles and it applies very nicely to the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to share a true story which confirmed for me magnesium&#x27;s ability to remove calcium deposits.  </li>
            <li>sure not too hot.  </li>
            <li>The pain and muscle stiffness started to lessen within hours of the first application, and I&#x27;m feeling much better.</li>
            <li>I continued studying related web sites, I was encouraged that one reputable site said these flakes can be used to make your own Mag chloride brine water.  </li>
            <li>, these flakes are dissolved in water in a full bath or foot bath.  </li>
            <li>Magnesium flakes, when used with my Pearl Foot Detox Massage Spa Bucket, warms me up in the cool evenings and helps my sleep.</li>
            <li>I love the magnesium bath flakes they really help relax my muscles when I soak in the bath.  </li>
            <li>No longer is there a pile of dropped hairs on the floor when I brush nor a is my hairbrush full of hair that  has come out.</li>
            <li>I wanted to experiment with percentages of water to salt, and I am pleased with how easily and clearly the flakes dissolved.  </li>
            <li>I have an injured ankle (long duration) and soaking my ankle provides pleasant temporary relief for the pain and swelling.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Among other uses, it makes great magneium oil.</li>
            <li>The detox baths make me feel great (aches and pains), leave me to sleep hard as a rock, and are replenishing depleted magnesium (not to mention helping get the digestive system moving healthily).  </li>
            <li>I carry a baggie of flakes in my purse for making a quick batch of \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in an emergency.  </li>
            <li>It is a super way to build up your magnesium reserves in your body without the side effects of taking magnesium orally.</li>
            <li>This is a super product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>am also using a squirt of the MO and rubbing a quick swish across my underarm</li>
            <li>Love the product but price to high.  </li>
            <li>I heated 1 cup of water in a saucepan until very hot.</li>
            <li>filled the tub with about 4&amp;#34; of hot water and added 1 cup of the magnesium flakes.</li>
            <li>The magnesium flakes seem clean, and the plastic box is very large.</li>
            <li>but i want to know more and be sure this stuff is legit and not harmful in the long run</li>
            <li>amazing stuff, worth it only if you get the 5 pound can.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the success with the oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;The price is a bit steep, but, for the results, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I feel it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It came in a big plastic bottle which is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Other good sites to check are Swanson and Ancient Minerals.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was very easy only took about 10 minutes from start to finish.</li>
            <li>Quality wise, the product is made of pure magnesium flakes (no additives) and it looks simply like it should: large crystals layered in sheets, very pure as advertised (devolving will not show any</li>
            <li>They work really well, disolve easily and really help.  </li>
            <li>The larger bag is cheaper per pound, but the s/h is high and makes it more economical to buy the 8# more frequently..</li>
            <li>So far I am thrilled to be turning things around clearly this Magnesium Oil applied directly to my thinning hair is giving me fantastic results.</li>

            <li>&quot; (brine water) and explained, if I understand this correctly, that the magnesium chloride brine water is the first extraction from the seabed, and the flakes are made by evaporation of that brine water, in a process using heat which produces minuscule quantities of byproducts from the magnesium chloride solution.  </li>
            <li>However, Magnesium Chloride flakes might produce similar results in a more efficient way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>According to most current speculation, Magnesium releases or relaxes muscles, while Calcium tenses them.  </li>

            <li>After using it as a soak, I typically do not rinse it off although it is perfectly fine to do so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If using it in chlorinated city water, recommend using ascorbic acid (Vit. C) dissolved  in the tub first to neutralize the chlorine, before soaking..</li>
            <li>Who could ask for better results than turning around a case of alopecia in as short as 2 months?</li>
            <li>Who could ask for better results than turning around a case of alopecia in as short as 2 months?</li>
            <li>Most likely would not purchase again</li>
            <li>I have read that homemade magnesium oil does not contain the concentrated amounts of magnesium that the manufactured magnesium oil does, but even at lower, inferior topical dosing it has alleviated leg cramping - for which I am VERY thankful!</li>
            <li>I have given samples to several friends and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>this really relaxes the muscles right before bed.  </li>
            <li>I use it regularly as a part of my overall approach to optimum health and wellness.</li>
            <li>The solution feels the same as the 8 oz spray linked above, though the spray is a super saturated solution made directly from the mg chloride deposits in the Zechstein sea, so that quality of solution might be superior to my makeshift dissolving of the flakes into tap water.  </li>
            <li>They are high quality and very pure (as illustrated on the label).  </li>
            <li>I bathed our 3 year-old grandson in a warm bath with half a cup of these flakes in the water.  </li>
            <li>My forehead hairline had begun to recede and it is now coming back in strong.</li>
            <li>Pure flakes.</li>
            <li>Though the flush would fully remove contents, I had always wondered why we rarely heard the \\&quot;gluck, gluck, gluck\\&quot; sound which normal toilets seem to produce, following completion of the water&#x27;s downward swirl.  </li>
            <li>After using Ancient Minerals Magnesium daily for one to two weeks, the aching improved greatly and has completely gone away after using it long term.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what this oil will do on a tight muscle ... relaxes it almost immediately.</li>
            <li>[I had originally purchased the Swanson 2 lb flakes, to try the smaller quantity first], I checked the ingredients and was relieved to see that not a single item has been added to this pure magnesium chloride salt in the form of gorgeous, smooth, marble white flakes from the ancient Zechstein Seabed (currently located far underground).  </li>
            <li>It is very cheap by natural food standards, but next time I will be buying the 50 lbs.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing bath</li>
            <li>I use it to pedicure, also I made magnesium oil to apply it straight on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the stuff you buy doesn&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li>it really helps balance moods</li>
            <li>It has no smell, dissolves easily and offers positive benefits to bodily aches and pains.</li>
            <li>Because of the lack of minerals our ground, most minerals that we do get from foood are not there today, thus we need to find other ways to get them.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to use instead of Epsom Salt for bath salts due to a recommendation on Camp Wanderer indicating that the benefit  of the magnesium flakes was better than the salts.</li>
            <li>Just got back from 3 days camping in the rain in the smokies and getting ready to soak right now!  </li>
            <li>However, I recently read an article about the general need for more magnesium than the digestive system can tolerate so absorption through the skin was recommended.  </li>
            <li>But as bath flakes, as this product is sold and intended, this is a great product I would not only recommend to anyone but would have a hard time to depart from.</li>
            <li>Extremely hard to open container, but the product is great.</li>
            <li>I dissolved a bit of it in a small amount hot water until the water wouldn&#x27;t hold any more, turning it into what is called \\&quot;magnesium oil\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>High magnesium levels help put you to sleep and prevent all sorts of diseases.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, this product is good when feeling stressed or tired and</li>
            <li>I have seen some minor changes since starting three weeks ago(one being no more restless legs at night), but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need to continue for a longer period for more noticeable results.</li>
            <li>It seems like someone always has an new recommendation or idea for me to try</li>
            <li>Due to my experiences with Mg deficiency noted in my review of Mg oil, I wasn&#x27;t surprised at how many ills are said to be caused by this deficiency, and how many people are oblivious to the deficiency and its connections to a number of serious health issues.  </li>
            <li>The magnesium oil you buy is exactly the same thing - magnesium flakes dissolved in water.</li>
            <li>First, I have read others have used to make a magnesium oil for external application</li>
            <li>about the same time as I started using my MO two months ago) I have started taking  Jarrow Adrenal Optimizer tablets and have increased my energy by leaps and bounds from the first capsule.</li>

            <li>Leaves your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>It is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>[I&#x27;m currently using a pure powder of mg ox instead of a tablet].  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that the magnesium oil applied directly to</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>This product is part of a weekly routine for me and I will continue to use it as far as I can.</li>
            <li>Every cell in the body needs magnesium in some way, and it is vital for bone, tooth, muscle and joint health as well as for optimal sleep and stress reduction.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but since I have been rubbing the Magnesium oil and Iodine into it it has shrunk nearly to 1/4 of its size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far it seems like</li>
            <li>Then one day added to a few subsequent days during which we removed large flakes of dense mineral deposits which had remained in the (clean) bowl after flushing.  </li>
            <li>The daughter, according to the report from her physician, had been given (by a different physician) a new medication which surprised everyone by suddenly depleting the magnesium in her system.  </li>
            <li>The daughter, according to the report from her physician, had been given (by a different physician) a new medication which surprised everyone by suddenly depleting the magnesium in her system.  </li>
            <li>Since removing those released deposits, the toilet has flushed with never before seen vigor accompanied by a loud series of \\&quot;glucks.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I wrote more about this in my review of The Magnesium Miracle.le of a toilet being expunged of calcium solidifications reinforced the truth in magnesium&#x27;s reversals of serious health issues related to calcium deposits.  </li>
            <li>am also adding a small amount of Calm Magnesium to every glass of water.</li>
            <li>(I dip the tip of the spoon into the calm and stir that small amount into my glass of water)</li>
            <li>My general energy level dropped dropped dropped, exercise did not net me muscle improvement.</li>
            <li>i hope i suffer no long term effects from this stuff, as the laboratory results seem a bit bogus that describes what is in them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started massaging the Magnesium Oil (MO) into my feet calves and into my scalp and hairline and my hair that had been falling out-- has stopped falling out and is coming back in quickly and thickly over the temples.</li>

            <li> These are great for making magnesium oil and also for soaking in.  </li>
            <li> It was great.</li>
            <li> Works for aches and pains, great for de-stressing, helps with sleep, has helped my eczema.</li>
            <li> The soaks are very effective.  </li>
            <li> This is the most perfect product and what a great relaxing way to get your magnesium needs met.  </li>
            <li> great product for a good soak</li>
            <li> This has been the most wonderful product for my fibromyalgia pain.</li>
            <li> distilled water is used in the marketed spray, which is a good idea because in some areas tap water contains chemicals which can work against Mg absorption, Fluoride being one of these).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to experiment with the flakes for a variety of uses, including cleaning and laundry, since they appear to be good at dissolving</li>
            <li> It dissolves well and feels good on the aches and pains.</li>
            <li> This spray can be used on aching joints or for spraying the bottom of your feet before bed with socks covering the spray... a good way to absorb magnesium trans-dermally every night.</li>
            <li> I have successfully created my own magnesium oil and will be saving tons of money.</li>
            <li> I had heard many good things about purified magnesium chloride (the best magnesium salt to use on skin because it&#x27;s more bio-available than epsom salts).  </li>
            <li> Best price and the right product to increase magnesuim by bathing or sprayng on..</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing relief.</li>
            <li> so I have been taking \\&quot;Calm\\&quot; magnesium powder in warm water at night to relax me for years.  </li>
            <li> so I could bath in it to increase my magnesium intake and also mix up my own magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li> So buy this and make your own.</li>
            <li> I buy these flakes to make my own magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li> Like having my own spa.  </li>
            <li> I either soak in a bath, or I make my own magnesium oil with it.</li>
            <li> Now I can make my own Manesim Oil.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, now that I own them, I have no idea what that person is referring to.  </li>
            <li> This is the absolute best way to get more magnesium into your body.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> ITS A MUST ITS AWESOME THE BEST SERIOUS</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING BATH EVER...</li>
            <li> It was easy and he did a nice soak without irritation or itching.  </li>
            <li> the package is HUGE!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the top off of this product.</li>
            <li> how much better I feel when I come out of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MOSTLY</li>
            <li> This 8 lb bottle of magnesium chloride flakes is a welcome find on Amazon, offered at a reasonable price from the company which also provides mg sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, another reputable site described the mining and manufacturing processes of both the flakes and \\&quot;oils\\</li>
            <li> B001AD0HL8 Ancient Minerals]] web site [the hyperlink here goes to the Amazon page for this company&#x27;s mg oil spray] has interesting information on the mining, production, and suggested uses of these magnesium products.  </li>
            <li> I wrote more about this in my review of The Magnesium Miracle.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is reportedly not as perfect as magnesium chloride, but you just simply have to use more.</li>
            <li> I boiled them on top of the stove with no luck.</li>
            <li> , I feel more relaxed.</li>
            <li> I love the bath with it - felt better immediately.  </li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing in a weekly bath and a great way to absorb magnesium.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My husband got to use most of it, but still what I used was lovely.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> The warmer the water, the better the absorption according to scientific book I read on magnesium trans-dermal therapy.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I didnt notice a difference from this and using salts, but I&#x27;ve read that this is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> nice warm bath right before bed</li>
            <li> and I definitely had a very good sleep after.</li>
            <li> Very nice in my bath, dissolves really quick, much easier then store bought Epsom salt.</li>
            <li> Your experience may vary, but it&#x27;s certainly an easy thing to try.</li>
            <li> From quick research it appears that magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) is a pretty good source of Magnesium too.</li>
            <li> I actually like my own brew better than the magnesium oil I purchased, and I&#x27;ll save a lot of money making my own.</li>
            <li> If you want to make your own Mg chloride spray by adding water to these flakes, I would recommend first reading the Zechstein web site regarding this.  </li>
            <li> directions recommend using water that is not too hot as water that is overly warm will interfere with the absorption to the body.</li>
            <li> I feel blessed to find a product without unwanted ingredients which are often toxic and operating in opposition to the purpose of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In efforts to reverse numerous health issues currently speculated to be caused by magnesium deficiencies, many people have been reporting excellent results from transdermal applications of magnesium chloride sprays and bath flakes, much better results than from oral supplements (which can provide laxative effects unneeded by some, though I still use mg products both orally, for healthy regularity cleansing, and transdermally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As exemplified from a science class experiment noted in Dr. Carolyn Dean&#x27;s book, [[ASIN:034549458X The Magnesium Miracle]] (also on Kindle), magnesium in adequate quantities [the percentage of Mg has to be greater than the amount of</li>

            <li> The bottle is huge but you get a lot for the money.</li>
            <li> but some of them are rather hair-brained and most I&#x27;ve already tried without success.  </li>
            <li> i am free</li>
            <li> Ordered the 8# size and received it with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> no deoderant is needed this works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them in warm foot baths for the whole family.  </li>
            <li> I use these flakes to make magnesium &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; (a misnomer, there is no oil in it) using DISTILLED water (important) heated on the stove and then cooled and placed in a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> take one hot-tube bath a week, use the equivalent of two cups in the warm (not hot) bath tube for best effect, soak myself for near an hour</li>
            <li> I have kidney stones and hope the magnesium helps, but was unexpected for how great it feels just to relaz in a hot tub with these bath crystals.  </li>
            <li> Ancient Minerals was also really great  to deal with and answered several question quickly via email</li>
            <li> When cool, I poured the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; into several spray bottles and it applies very nicely to the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d like to share a true story which confirmed for me magnesium&#x27;s ability to remove calcium deposits.  </li>
            <li> sure not too hot.  </li>
            <li> The pain and muscle stiffness started to lessen within hours of the first application, and I&#x27;m feeling much better.</li>
            <li> I continued studying related web sites, I was encouraged that one reputable site said these flakes can be used to make your own Mag chloride brine water.  </li>
            <li> , these flakes are dissolved in water in a full bath or foot bath.  </li>
            <li> Magnesium flakes, when used with my Pearl Foot Detox Massage Spa Bucket, warms me up in the cool evenings and helps my sleep.</li>
            <li> I love the magnesium bath flakes they really help relax my muscles when I soak in the bath.  </li>
            <li> No longer is there a pile of dropped hairs on the floor when I brush nor a is my hairbrush full of hair that  has come out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to experiment with percentages of water to salt, and I am pleased with how easily and clearly the flakes dissolved.  </li>
            <li> I have an injured ankle (long duration) and soaking my ankle provides pleasant temporary relief for the pain and swelling.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Among other uses, it makes great magneium oil.</li>
            <li> The detox baths make me feel great (aches and pains), leave me to sleep hard as a rock, and are replenishing depleted magnesium (not to mention helping get the digestive system moving healthily).  </li>
            <li> I carry a baggie of flakes in my purse for making a quick batch of \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in an emergency.  </li>
            <li> It is a super way to build up your magnesium reserves in your body without the side effects of taking magnesium orally.</li>
            <li> This is a super product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am also using a squirt of the MO and rubbing a quick swish across my underarm</li>
            <li> Love the product but price to high.  </li>
            <li> I heated 1 cup of water in a saucepan until very hot.</li>
            <li> filled the tub with about 4&amp;#34; of hot water and added 1 cup of the magnesium flakes.</li>
            <li> The magnesium flakes seem clean, and the plastic box is very large.</li>
            <li> but i want to know more and be sure this stuff is legit and not harmful in the long run</li>
            <li> amazing stuff, worth it only if you get the 5 pound can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the success with the oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;The price is a bit steep, but, for the results, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I feel it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It came in a big plastic bottle which is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Other good sites to check are Swanson and Ancient Minerals.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was very easy only took about 10 minutes from start to finish.</li>
            <li> Quality wise, the product is made of pure magnesium flakes (no additives) and it looks simply like it should: large crystals layered in sheets, very pure as advertised (devolving will not show any</li>
            <li> They work really well, disolve easily and really help.  </li>
            <li> The larger bag is cheaper per pound, but the s/h is high and makes it more economical to buy the 8# more frequently..</li>
            <li> So far I am thrilled to be turning things around clearly this Magnesium Oil applied directly to my thinning hair is giving me fantastic results.</li>

            <li> &quot; (brine water) and explained, if I understand this correctly, that the magnesium chloride brine water is the first extraction from the seabed, and the flakes are made by evaporation of that brine water, in a process using heat which produces minuscule quantities of byproducts from the magnesium chloride solution.  </li>
            <li> However, Magnesium Chloride flakes might produce similar results in a more efficient way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> According to most current speculation, Magnesium releases or relaxes muscles, while Calcium tenses them.  </li>
            <li> According to most current speculation, Magnesium releases or relaxes muscles, while Calcium tenses them.  </li>
            <li> After using it as a soak, I typically do not rinse it off although it is perfectly fine to do so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If using it in chlorinated city water, recommend using ascorbic acid (Vit. C) dissolved  in the tub first to neutralize the chlorine, before soaking..</li>
            <li> Who could ask for better results than turning around a case of alopecia in as short as 2 months?</li>
            <li> Who could ask for better results than turning around a case of alopecia in as short as 2 months?</li>
            <li> Most likely would not purchase again</li>
            <li> I have read that homemade magnesium oil does not contain the concentrated amounts of magnesium that the manufactured magnesium oil does, but even at lower, inferior topical dosing it has alleviated leg cramping - for which I am VERY thankful!</li>
            <li> I have given samples to several friends and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> this really relaxes the muscles right before bed.  </li>
            <li> I use it regularly as a part of my overall approach to optimum health and wellness.</li>
            <li> The solution feels the same as the 8 oz spray linked above, though the spray is a super saturated solution made directly from the mg chloride deposits in the Zechstein sea, so that quality of solution might be superior to my makeshift dissolving of the flakes into tap water.  </li>
            <li> They are high quality and very pure (as illustrated on the label).  </li>
            <li> I bathed our 3 year-old grandson in a warm bath with half a cup of these flakes in the water.  </li>
            <li> My forehead hairline had begun to recede and it is now coming back in strong.</li>
            <li> Pure flakes.</li>
            <li> Though the flush would fully remove contents, I had always wondered why we rarely heard the \\&quot;gluck, gluck, gluck\\&quot; sound which normal toilets seem to produce, following completion of the water&#x27;s downward swirl.  </li>
            <li> After using Ancient Minerals Magnesium daily for one to two weeks, the aching improved greatly and has completely gone away after using it long term.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what this oil will do on a tight muscle ... relaxes it almost immediately.</li>
            <li> [I had originally purchased the Swanson 2 lb flakes, to try the smaller quantity first], I checked the ingredients and was relieved to see that not a single item has been added to this pure magnesium chloride salt in the form of gorgeous, smooth, marble white flakes from the ancient Zechstein Seabed (currently located far underground).  </li>
            <li> It is very cheap by natural food standards, but next time I will be buying the 50 lbs.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing bath</li>
            <li> I use it to pedicure, also I made magnesium oil to apply it straight on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the stuff you buy doesn&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li> it really helps balance moods</li>
            <li> It has no smell, dissolves easily and offers positive benefits to bodily aches and pains.</li>
            <li> Because of the lack of minerals our ground, most minerals that we do get from foood are not there today, thus we need to find other ways to get them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use instead of Epsom Salt for bath salts due to a recommendation on Camp Wanderer indicating that the benefit  of the magnesium flakes was better than the salts.</li>
            <li> Just got back from 3 days camping in the rain in the smokies and getting ready to soak right now!  </li>
            <li> However, I recently read an article about the general need for more magnesium than the digestive system can tolerate so absorption through the skin was recommended.  </li>
            <li> But as bath flakes, as this product is sold and intended, this is a great product I would not only recommend to anyone but would have a hard time to depart from.</li>
            <li> Extremely hard to open container, but the product is great.</li>
            <li> I dissolved a bit of it in a small amount hot water until the water wouldn&#x27;t hold any more, turning it into what is called \\&quot;magnesium oil\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> High magnesium levels help put you to sleep and prevent all sorts of diseases.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> , this product is good when feeling stressed or tired and</li>
            <li> I have seen some minor changes since starting three weeks ago(one being no more restless legs at night), but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need to continue for a longer period for more noticeable results.</li>
            <li> It seems like someone always has an new recommendation or idea for me to try</li>
            <li> Due to my experiences with Mg deficiency noted in my review of Mg oil, I wasn&#x27;t surprised at how many ills are said to be caused by this deficiency, and how many people are oblivious to the deficiency and its connections to a number of serious health issues.  </li>
            <li> The magnesium oil you buy is exactly the same thing - magnesium flakes dissolved in water.</li>
            <li> First, I have read others have used to make a magnesium oil for external application</li>
            <li> about the same time as I started using my MO two months ago) I have started taking  Jarrow Adrenal Optimizer tablets and have increased my energy by leaps and bounds from the first capsule.</li>

            <li> It is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> [I&#x27;m currently using a pure powder of mg ox instead of a tablet].  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that the magnesium oil applied directly to</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> This product is part of a weekly routine for me and I will continue to use it as far as I can.</li>
            <li> Every cell in the body needs magnesium in some way, and it is vital for bone, tooth, muscle and joint health as well as for optimal sleep and stress reduction.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but since I have been rubbing the Magnesium oil and Iodine into it it has shrunk nearly to 1/4 of its size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far it seems like</li>
            <li> Then one day added to a few subsequent days during which we removed large flakes of dense mineral deposits which had remained in the (clean) bowl after flushing.  </li>
            <li> The daughter, according to the report from her physician, had been given (by a different physician) a new medication which surprised everyone by suddenly depleting the magnesium in her system.  </li>

            <li> Since removing those released deposits, the toilet has flushed with never before seen vigor accompanied by a loud series of \\&quot;glucks.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I wrote more about this in my review of The Magnesium Miracle.le of a toilet being expunged of calcium solidifications reinforced the truth in magnesium&#x27;s reversals of serious health issues related to calcium deposits.  </li>
            <li> am also adding a small amount of Calm Magnesium to every glass of water.</li>
            <li> (I dip the tip of the spoon into the calm and stir that small amount into my glass of water)</li>
            <li> My general energy level dropped dropped dropped, exercise did not net me muscle improvement.</li>
            <li> i hope i suffer no long term effects from this stuff, as the laboratory results seem a bit bogus that describes what is in them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started massaging the Magnesium Oil (MO) into my feet calves and into my scalp and hairline and my hair that had been falling out-- has stopped falling out and is coming back in quickly and thickly over the temples.</li>
            <li> From my personal opinion perspective, I believe that it is not only essential but vital that magnesium retain the highest percentage over other minerals, especially calcium, phosphorus, and potassium, which tend to overtake magnesium and defeat the synergistic purposes of all minerals and vitamins, indeed all nutrients.  </li>

            <li> Magnesium soaks have given me the most immediate restorative results for sore muscles after tough workouts and long bike rides (typically 25-40 miles) as well as relief from menstrual cramps and occasional insomnia.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this product as long as I can afford it.</li>
            <li> Just was not enough for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> At first I just began washing it less and less until I didn&#x27;t need to wash it</li>
            <li> In the past several years calcium has been promoted as being the priority mineral (recall the high level of hype placed on coral calcium being a cure all).  </li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to a friend who suffers from Lupus and to my dad who is 61 years old and still runs 4+ miles a day and both have had similar success.</li>
            <li> I noticed a strange side effect.  </li>
            <li> Sat in it for quite a long time trying to absorb the liquid.</li>
            <li> I use it for detox baths or soothing baths after I&#x27;ve had a long day.  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t get the top off of this product.</li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping and frequently experience leg cramps so I have been taking \\&quot;Calm\\&quot; magnesium powder in warm water at night to relax me for years.  However, I recently read an article about the general need for more magnesium than the digestive system can tolerate so absorption through the skin was recommended.  I ordered these bath flakes and began evening bathtub soaks.  The soaks are very effective.  They have not only helped relax me for sleep, they are also relieving persistent shoulder and neck muscle aches (probably from being at the computer a lot)... plus, these soaks helped quickly sooth and heal a badly bruised toe. Since these flakes are expensive, I have recently been reducing the volume of flakes and adding some Epsom Salt to the bath too in order to stretch the supply of this product.  I will definitely continue to use this product as long as I can afford it.</li>
            <li> They were just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> tested the product to see how it would work for me and I am very impressed.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe muscular issues in my neck and shoulders which cause terrible headaches.  It seems like someone always has an new recommendation or idea for me to try but some of them are rather hair-brained and most I&#x27;ve already tried without success.  A friend recommended trying magnesium oil, which is one thing I&#x27;d never heard of, and I figured I had nothing to lose.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that the magnesium oil applied directly to my problem areas actually reduced my tension and pain, but it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the success with the oil, I thought I&#x27;d buy some flakes so I could bath in it to increase my magnesium intake and also mix up my own magnesium oil.  This is the best price I&#x27;ve found for this quantity of flakes.  They are high quality and very pure (as illustrated on the label).  I try to soak for at least half an hour and it&#x27;s amazing how much better I feel when I come out of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to a friend who suffers from Lupus and to my dad who is 61 years old and still runs 4+ miles a day and both have had similar success.</li>
            <li> WOW&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS GIVE ME A REASON TO TAKE A BATH AND JUST SOAK IN THE TUBE AND THINK ABOUT WOW...THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING BATH EVER...AND I AM A DUDE I ONLY SHOWER MOSTLY BUT THIS I HAVE NOW AND I TAKE A BATH ITS A MUST ITS AWESOME THE BEST SERIOUS</li>
            <li> This 8 lb bottle of magnesium chloride flakes is a welcome find on Amazon, offered at a reasonable price from the company which also provides mg sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[My review of [[ASIN:B0026RCMAG Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz (237 ml) Spray]] gives details on causes and cures of magnesium deficiency.  I&#x27;ve also posted a video review on the Ancient Mineral mag oil spray, linked below.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receipt of these flakes [I had originally purchased the Swanson 2 lb flakes, to try the smaller quantity first], I checked the ingredients and was relieved to see that not a single item has been added to this pure magnesium chloride salt in the form of gorgeous, smooth, marble white flakes from the ancient Zechstein Seabed (currently located far underground).  I feel blessed to find a product without unwanted ingredients which are often toxic and operating in opposition to the purpose of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In efforts to reverse numerous health issues currently speculated to be caused by magnesium deficiencies, many people have been reporting excellent results from transdermal applications of magnesium chloride sprays and bath flakes, much better results than from oral supplements (which can provide laxative effects unneeded by some, though I still use mg products both orally, for healthy regularity cleansing, and transdermally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Epsom salts, these flakes are dissolved in water in a full bath or foot bath.  In addition to that use, I purchased the flakes to refill my spray bottle of Mg oil.  I used tap water instead of distilled water (note: distilled water is used in the marketed spray, which is a good idea because in some areas tap water contains chemicals which can work against Mg absorption, Fluoride being one of these).  I wanted to experiment with percentages of water to salt, and I am pleased with how easily and clearly the flakes dissolved.  I used the proportions noted on the label (1 cup flakes to 4 qt&#x27;s water, which I reduced to ¼ cup in 1 qt).  The solution feels the same as the 8 oz spray linked above, though the spray is a super saturated solution made directly from the mg chloride deposits in the Zechstein sea, so that quality of solution might be superior to my makeshift dissolving of the flakes into tap water.  I&#x27;m planning to experiment with the flakes for a variety of uses, including cleaning and laundry, since they appear to be good at dissolving deposits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I continued studying related web sites, I was encouraged that one reputable site said these flakes can be used to make your own Mag chloride brine water.  However, another reputable site described the mining and manufacturing processes of both the flakes and \\&quot;oils\\&quot; (brine water) and explained, if I understand this correctly, that the magnesium chloride brine water is the first extraction from the seabed, and the flakes are made by evaporation of that brine water, in a process using heat which produces minuscule quantities of byproducts from the magnesium chloride solution.  They said these byproducts are not toxic, but they can&#x27;t recommend using the flakes to make homemade sprays.  If you want to make your own Mg chloride spray by adding water to these flakes, I would recommend first reading the Zechstein web site regarding this.  Other good sites to check are Swanson and Ancient Minerals.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Ancient Minerals and Swanson offer a larger quantity, for refills, of the same solution which is sold in the 8 oz spray bottles.  I keep a supply of refil on hand, in addition to the flakes, and also buy additional spray bottles of solution.  I carry a baggie of flakes in my purse for making a quick batch of \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in an emergency.  In a larger purse I also carry the spray bottle of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B001AD0HL8 Ancient Minerals]] web site [the hyperlink here goes to the Amazon page for this company&#x27;s mg oil spray] has interesting information on the mining, production, and suggested uses of these magnesium products.  Swanson carries similar products and also has an informative web site.  I recommend reading other reviews on magnesium products and books, as well as Googling Magnesium every which way.  I actually Googled Mg ions contained in the outer ring in quasars!  Due to my experiences with Mg deficiency noted in my review of Mg oil, I wasn&#x27;t surprised at how many ills are said to be caused by this deficiency, and how many people are oblivious to the deficiency and its connections to a number of serious health issues.  I&#x27;ve almost fallen over the edge of believing this mineral is the Life Force incarnate, the link to the Godhead!  Yes, I write sci-fi, LOL!!  (Even so, I&#x27;m so thankful for the healing, strengthening, clarifying potency of magnesium that I could believe some pretty weird stuff.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to share a true story which confirmed for me magnesium&#x27;s ability to remove calcium deposits.  In this case the product was oral Magnesium Oxide tablets [I&#x27;m currently using a pure powder of mg ox instead of a tablet].  However, Magnesium Chloride flakes might produce similar results in a more efficient way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ingesting daily 1500 mg of Magnesium Oxide tablets for a few months (releasing remainders of the mineral daily) I noticed a strange side effect.  For decades our toilet had flushed sluggishly, in spite of using every treatment made on Earth.  Though the flush would fully remove contents, I had always wondered why we rarely heard the \\&quot;gluck, gluck, gluck\\&quot; sound which normal toilets seem to produce, following completion of the water&#x27;s downward swirl.  Then one day added to a few subsequent days during which we removed large flakes of dense mineral deposits which had remained in the (clean) bowl after flushing.  The heavy flakes had been loosened from somewhere inside beyond the bowl.  Since removing those released deposits, the toilet has flushed with never before seen vigor accompanied by a loud series of \\&quot;glucks.\\&quot;  We had no idea that calcium deposits in the plumbing were restricting the flow of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this example of a toilet being expunged of calcium solidifications reinforced the truth in magnesium&#x27;s reversals of serious health issues related to calcium deposits.  As exemplified from a science class experiment noted in Dr. Carolyn Dean&#x27;s book, [[ASIN:034549458X The Magnesium Miracle]] (also on Kindle), magnesium in adequate quantities [the percentage of Mg has to be greater than the amount of Ca*] will dissolve calcium deposits in the body, often resulting in relief of kidney and bladder stones, gout, hardening of the arteries, and calcium build up in various vessels, tissues, bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will conclude by sharing a heartbreaking fact here which I had also included in my review of Mg oil:  A friend of mine recently suffered the death of a daughter in her 30&#x27;s.  The daughter, according to the report from her physician, had been given (by a different physician) a new medication which surprised everyone by suddenly depleting the magnesium in her system.  Upon retiring for the night, the woman died, from one heartbeat to the next.  According to most current speculation, Magnesium releases or relaxes muscles, while Calcium tenses them.  According to the reports, the woman&#x27;s heart contracted, but wouldn&#x27;t release, due to the sudden depletion of magnesium.  She died in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is dedicated to Melissa, who would appreciate both the humor and the seriousness of magnesium&#x27;s connection to the life force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda G. Shelnutt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Recent studies seem to be leaning toward seeing the necessity of the ratio of magnesium to calcium favoring Mg.  In the past several years calcium has been promoted as being the priority mineral (recall the high level of hype placed on coral calcium being a cure all).  Very recently the preferred ratio was moved again toward the favor of Mg, as noted in Dr. Dean&#x27;s book linked above, with the preferred ratio being 1:1 (her web site has recently been leaning toward a 2:1 ratio). From my personal opinion perspective, I believe that it is not only essential but vital that magnesium retain the highest percentage over other minerals, especially calcium, phosphorus, and potassium, which tend to overtake magnesium and defeat the synergistic purposes of all minerals and vitamins, indeed all nutrients.

            <li> From quick research it appears that magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) is a pretty good source of Magnesium too. Yes, it is reportedly not as perfect as magnesium chloride, but you just simply have to use more. Epsom salts cost $1 for a ~5lb bag in Dollar Tree, which is 45 times cheaper than this product.</li>
            <li> My homeopathic doctor prescribed this for me. I had aching arms and legs for several years. After using Ancient Minerals Magnesium daily for one to two weeks, the aching improved greatly and has completely gone away after using it long term. I like this the flakes for soaking.  Magnesium flakes, when used with my Pearl Foot Detox Massage Spa Bucket, warms me up in the cool evenings and helps my sleep.</li>
            <li> This is the most perfect product and what a great relaxing way to get your magnesium needs met.  High magnesium levels help put you to sleep and prevent all sorts of diseases.  Buy it and use it.  I only wish it could be ordered in a larger size.</li>
            <li> My Accupuncturist recommended this for muscle spasms....it works wonders!~ I love it! I use it in the morning and eveing to soothe my legs and reduce spasms associated with multiple sclerosis.</li>
            <li> Ancient Minerals Magnesium Bath Flakes is an excellent product for me. I have an injured ankle (long duration) and soaking my ankle provides pleasant temporary relief for the pain and swelling.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is good when feeling stressed or tired and achy.&lt;br /&gt;The directions recommend using water that is not too hot as water that is overly warm will interfere with the absorption to the body. After using it as a soak, I typically do not rinse it off although it is perfectly fine to do so.&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit steep, but, for the results, it is worth it. It has no smell, dissolves easily and offers positive benefits to bodily aches and pains. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I tried everything to get these Magnesium Flakes to break down. I boiled them on top of the stove with no luck. Then, I place 1 cup of flakes and 4 cups of water in the Blender to break them down. They destroyed my blender. It was like putting rocks in my blender. Afterwards, I put them in my pressure cooker for 1 hour. I could not believe the flakes were still in the pot. I wanted them to dissolve of melt so I could make Magnesium oil or cream. I have Fybromyalga and Arthritis and I thought these flakes would help. I even put the flakes under my sauna belt and after staying in 140 degree sauna for 2 hours. The flakes did not dissolve under my sauna belt. I am telling the truth about these so called Magnesium Flakes. They stole my money.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing bath and I definitely had a very good sleep after. Not sure how often one can use it-  expensive product though.</li>
            <li> I use these flakes almost every night.  It is a super way to build up your magnesium reserves in your body without the side effects of taking magnesium orally.</li>
            <li> Dissolves faster than any other epsom salt I have tried.</li>
            <li> I use it to pedicure, also I made magnesium oil to apply it straight on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It helps me to fight night muscle cramps.</li>
            <li> soaked feet every night for 20 min  used the lotion when finished  one blessed night  i just went to sleep  with out  a sleep pill had tried every thing to get off sleep medication due to taking medicine bless  pat i am free</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. The magnesium flakes seem clean, and the plastic box is very large. I have successfully created my own magnesium oil and will be saving tons of money. I heated 1 cup of water in a saucepan until very hot. Then I poured in 1/2 cup of magnesium flakes and let them melt - stirring every so often while the mixture cooled. When cool, I poured the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; into several spray bottles and it applies very nicely to the skin. I actually like my own brew better than the magnesium oil I purchased, and I&#x27;ll save a lot of money making my own. I also did a bath soak one day when my back muscles were quite spasmy ... filled the tub with about 4&amp;#34; of hot water and added 1 cup of the magnesium flakes. Sat in it for quite a long time trying to absorb the liquid. It helped, but no more so in my opinion than a liberal application of the oil. So, because of the cost of these flakes, I probably won&#x27;t do the bath thing again unless I&#x27;m desperate. It&#x27;s amazing what this oil will do on a tight muscle ... relaxes it almost immediately. PS: The magnesium oil you buy is exactly the same thing - magnesium flakes dissolved in water. So buy this and make your own. And, I know the strength of mine, 2:1, and the stuff you buy doesn&#x27;t really say. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the magnesium bath flakes they really help relax my muscles when I soak in the bath.  They are great as part of a detox bath</li>
            <li> I searched all over the web for the best price on this product. This is a super product.&lt;br /&gt;I would order it from this distributor again.</li>
            <li> First, I have read others have used to make a magnesium oil for external application but I did not try doing that yet. But as bath flakes, as this product is sold and intended, this is a great product I would not only recommend to anyone but would have a hard time to depart from. Quality wise, the product is made of pure magnesium flakes (no additives) and it looks simply like it should: large crystals layered in sheets, very pure as advertised (devolving will not show any impurity).&lt;br /&gt;I take one hot-tube bath a week, use the equivalent of two cups in the warm (not hot) bath tube for best effect, soak myself for near an hour (yes, I read a novel or the news along) for an immediate relaxing experience. The effects are multiple: my hair feel stronger, muscles are relaxed, I have some joint pains and it seems to help and overall, I feel more relaxed. This product is part of a weekly routine for me and I will continue to use it as far as I can.</li>
            <li> I love the bath with it - felt better immediately.  Also made magnesium oil which both my clients and I rave about.</li>
            <li> Been using these as a part of my detox bath regimen.  I love them.  The detox baths make me feel great (aches and pains), leave me to sleep hard as a rock, and are replenishing depleted magnesium (not to mention helping get the digestive system moving healthily).  I use the spray after showers as well and that&#x27;s also great.</li>
            <li> The jar was busted, but great product.</li>
            <li> Best price and the right product to increase magnesuim by bathing or sprayng on.. Every cell in the body needs magnesium in some way, and it is vital for bone, tooth, muscle and joint health as well as for optimal sleep and stress reduction.&lt;br /&gt;I now use to improve calcium absorption....</li>
            <li> Ordered the 8# size and received it with free shipping.  This also comes from the company in 32# size.  The larger bag is cheaper per pound, but the s/h is high and makes it more economical to buy the 8# more frequently.. Very relaxing in a weekly bath and a great way to absorb magnesium.  If using it in chlorinated city water, recommend using ascorbic acid (Vit. C) dissolved  in the tub first to neutralize the chlorine, before soaking..</li>
            <li> (Maybe two months ago) I made Magnesium oil from the flakes. It was very easy only took about 10 minutes from start to finish. These flakes saved me a lot of money making my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started massaging the Magnesium Oil (MO) into my feet calves and into my scalp and hairline and my hair that had been falling out-- has stopped falling out and is coming back in quickly and thickly over the temples. No longer is there a pile of dropped hairs on the floor when I brush nor a is my hairbrush full of hair that  has come out. My forehead hairline had begun to recede and it is now coming back in strong. (I am very happy) Also now when I wash my hair it is silky and shiny again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a red ugly bump on my shin for the past 4 years. It would get a crusty covering which I could clip off but the base of the bump was always there. I don&#x27;t know what it is-- but since I have been rubbing the Magnesium oil and Iodine into it it has shrunk nearly to 1/4 of its size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using a squirt of the MO and rubbing a quick swish across my underarm no deoderant is needed this works fantastic. MY fingernails are less bendy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also adding a small amount of Calm Magnesium to every glass of water. (I dip the tip of the spoon into the calm and stir that small amount into my glass of water) I make it no stronger than enough to add a touch of tang, no stronger than squeezing a lemon wedge into the glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 years ago, my hair began to fall out in clumps in the shower and in the hairbrush. My silky shiny hair turned dry and lifeless. At first I just began washing it less and less until I didn&#x27;t need to wash it but once a week (down from every day). My general energy level dropped dropped dropped, exercise did not net me muscle improvement. And I was gaining weight. My hairline was receding which I didn&#x27;t notice until it began to get very thin over my temples in a v shape that was noticeable when I wore my hair pulled back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Just about the same time as I started using my MO two months ago) I have started taking  Jarrow Adrenal Optimizer tablets and have increased my energy by leaps and bounds from the first capsule. (I soon upped the dose to double twice a day. Now I am cutting back to one twice a day, I feel I don&#x27;t need so much now.) I am also massaging iodine mixed with coconut oil into my skin and over my thyroid several times a week. I am hitting my symptoms with a shotgun blast. So far I am thrilled to be turning things around clearly this Magnesium Oil applied directly to my thinning hair is giving me fantastic results. Who could ask for better results than turning around a case of alopecia in as short as 2 months? Google it... This is a known benefit of Magnesium oil.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Just about the same time as I started using my MO two months ago) I have started taking  Jarrow Adrenal Optimizer tablets and have increased my energy by leaps and bounds from the first capsule.

            <li> I buy these flakes to make my own magnesium oil.  I use it to spray on my skin because it cures body odor and I use it in place of deodorant.  These flakes work great!  Sometimes I put a couple of handfuls in my kids&#x27; baths and they sleep especially well on those nights.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it for detox baths or soothing baths after I&#x27;ve had a long day.  They work really well, disolve easily and really help.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> so i called the owner to make some inquiries and she yelled at me and hung up in my face! after searching online it seems the company that mines in this Zechstein seabed does not produce flakes for ancient minerals...so how does ancient minerals get them? that&#x27;s what i wanted to know and she couldn&#x27;t give me a physical address of an office in europe..so how does ancient minerals get it&#x27;s magnesium flakes? i guess that will be an ancient mystery. i hope i suffer no long term effects from this stuff, as the laboratory results seem a bit bogus that describes what is in them. people be careful about stuff not regulated...sometimes big brother can be a good thing :(  so far it seems like is has relieved some issues...but i want to know more and be sure this stuff is legit and not harmful in the long run</li>
            <li> So I am back to epsom salts for my bath.  But it&#x27;s a great way to relax and to get some magnesium in your system.  My husband got to use most of it, but still what I used was lovely.</li>
            <li> It is very cheap by natural food standards, but next time I will be buying the 50 lbs. bag for roughly the same price that is in the category of de-icing salts.</li>
            <li> After a hard day of teaching, my feet and legs are tired..this really relaxes the muscles right before bed.  Wish they had put a scoop in the jar and that the container had a handle...but the product does what it is supposed to, so I will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> I have used about half the container so far and I like it. It dissolves well and feels good on the aches and pains.</li>
            <li> amazing stuff, worth it only if you get the 5 pound can.&lt;br /&gt;if you are in a bad mood, or just off, and if your muscles are tight.&lt;br /&gt;make sure not too hot.  i put essential oils in also. sometimes bath together with husband if we are both grumpy after traveling.  it really helps balance moods</li>
            <li> Magnesium soaks have given me the most immediate restorative results for sore muscles after tough workouts and long bike rides (typically 25-40 miles) as well as relief from menstrual cramps and occasional insomnia. I use it regularly as a part of my overall approach to optimum health and wellness.</li>
            <li> great product for a good soak</li>
            <li> Love the product but price to high.  Most likely would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have kidney stones and hope the magnesium helps, but was unexpected for how great it feels just to relaz in a hot tub with these bath crystals.  Like having my own spa.  Just got back from 3 days camping in the rain in the smokies and getting ready to soak right now!  Leaves your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Hard to justify the price</li>
            <li> Very nice in my bath, dissolves really quick, much easier then store bought Epsom salt. Also very good for preparing my homemade magnesium body cream.&lt;br /&gt;And... the package is HUGE!</li>
            <li> I have seen some minor changes since starting three weeks ago(one being no more restless legs at night), but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need to continue for a longer period for more noticeable results. I make magnesium oil with the flakes and use it every night on legs, abdomen, arms. It does feel a little itchy, but it is tolerable for me so I just leave it on all night and shower in morning.</li>
            <li> I use this to help control &amp;#34;charlie horse&amp;#34; cramps that I get during pregnancy. I either soak in a bath, or I make my own magnesium oil with it. I have read that homemade magnesium oil does not contain the concentrated amounts of magnesium that the manufactured magnesium oil does, but even at lower, inferior topical dosing it has alleviated leg cramping - for which I am VERY thankful!</li>
            <li> I could not wait until my mineral flakes arrived.  I had purchased the Manesium gel .5 oz for 3 times the price.  Now I can make my own Manesim Oil.  I am in the process of going Holistic &amp; organic in what I use on my body or digest.  After speaking with my doctor &amp; given the go &amp; this brand name, I use it every day after a shower or bath followed by Coconut oil.  Because of the lack of minerals our ground, most minerals that we do get from foood are not there today, thus we need to find other ways to get them.  I feel it is worth the price.  It came on time.  I use it with distilled water (preserve it for 6 months) &amp; spray 10-25 sprits daily.  I would caution anyone to speak to their Physician prior to using this or any other products for your health!!</li>
            <li> This has been the most wonderful product for my fibromyalgia pain. Amazing relief. I dissolved a bit of it in a small amount hot water until the water wouldn&#x27;t hold any more, turning it into what is called \\&quot;magnesium oil\\&quot;. Then I applied just a little each day. The pain and muscle stiffness started to lessen within hours of the first application, and I&#x27;m feeling much better. Your experience may vary, but it&#x27;s certainly an easy thing to try. For me, it&#x27;s been so beneficial - for a condition that&#x27;s hard to treat.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use instead of Epsom Salt for bath salts due to a recommendation on Camp Wanderer indicating that the benefit  of the magnesium flakes was better than the salts. The bottle is huge but you get a lot for the money. I still added some essential oils for  fragrance and a tiny bit of Bath &amp; Body Works product for some bubbles. I would buy this again. Ancient Minerals was also really great  to deal with and answered several question quickly via email</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best way to get more magnesium into your body.&lt;br /&gt;A nice warm bath right before bed and you&#x27;ll sleep like a baby!</li>
            <li> These are great for making magnesium oil and also for soaking in.  It came in a big plastic bottle which is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I had heard many good things about purified magnesium chloride (the best magnesium salt to use on skin because it&#x27;s more bio-available than epsom salts).  I read the few negative reviews here and was almost swayed by one that asserted strongly that these flakes were hard to dissolve.  I didn&#x27;t want to deal with all the things that reviewer tried to get these to dissolve.  I have to say, now that I own them, I have no idea what that person is referring to.  They have been dissolving immediately for me and I didn&#x27;t have to do any of the things that reviewer did.  I bathed our 3 year-old grandson in a warm bath with half a cup of these flakes in the water.  It was easy and he did a nice soak without irritation or itching.  Children are just as magnesium-deficient as adults are.  Almost all Americans are magnesium deficient, so I take ionic magnesium chloride (a different liquid brand) internally and use these flakes for trans-dermal therapy. I&#x27;m using them in warm foot baths for the whole family.  The warmer the water, the better the absorption according to scientific book I read on magnesium trans-dermal therapy. I use these flakes to make magnesium &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; (a misnomer, there is no oil in it) using DISTILLED water (important) heated on the stove and then cooled and placed in a spray bottle.  This spray can be used on aching joints or for spraying the bottom of your feet before bed with socks covering the spray... a good way to absorb magnesium trans-dermally every night.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I didnt notice a difference from this and using salts, but I&#x27;ve read that this is better.</li>
            <li> It was great. Just was not enough for a long period of time. The 8 lbs. works for us.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my homeopathic doctor. It is wonderful stuff. Works for aches and pains, great for de-stressing, helps with sleep, has helped my eczema. I have given samples to several friends and they love it as well. I have tried several less expensive brands, and they don&#x27;t come CLOSE to this. It is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> Extremely hard to open container, but the product is great.</li>
            <li> I use magnesium bath flakes for foot soaks. Excellent drawing of soreness in legs and feet. I highly recommend this product. Pure flakes. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> After tons of research into the purest magnesium I could find I finally settled on this one. I&#x27;m glad I did. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Among other uses, it makes great magneium oil.</li>
