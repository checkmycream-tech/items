            <li>Love all the colors, nice and pigmented.</li>
            <li>For the price it is amzingly pigmented and easy to blend eye shadows!</li>
            <li>Judy is loyal and a good role model for kids.</li>
            <li>I received this fairly quick and once I had a chance to really try it out, I was impressed!</li>
            <li>i am so happy that i found it for 15$, im super excited to use it :)</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this palette.  </li>
            <li>I love judy</li>
            <li>I got it thinking it was going to just be okay.</li>
            <li>But I LOVE wearing these eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>so make sure to use one if you know your eyelids.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the colors</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this palette.  </li>
            <li>Love the variety of colors in this palette.  </li>
            <li>I love the pigmentation and consistency.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Some colors in the palette are better than others.</li>
            <li>I love this pallet I do however own all available palettes by bHcosmetics and love them all.</li>
            <li>I watch itsjudytime and was able to recreate her tutorials with this palette effortlessly.</li>
            <li>So after watching Judy herself on youtube display the palette, do tutorials on how to use it and seeing her swatch these eye shadow,  that appeared to have great payoff, are very pigmented</li>
            <li>Kind of looks like cheap eyeshadow you would buy at a dollar store.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>she is one of my favorite youtubers.</li>
            <li>in my mind, no youtuber is better than her.</li>
            <li>She had to make sure to edit it , while taking care of 3 girls.</li>
            <li>I had always love her since the day I found out about her channel.</li>
            <li>I lov how the vlogs are more than 20 min.</li>
            <li>There are more fans than haters .</li>
            <li>I am NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li>As far as pigmentation, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>The packaging feels sleek on top but the cardboard material under the mirror make it feel cheap.</li>
            <li>I definitely suggest this palette, it&#x27;s gorgeous!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite palettes better than some of my higher end palettes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for someone who is just starting out using eyeshadow and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, or if you&#x27;re a Judy fan of course.</li>
            <li>With a mix of matte and metallic tones available, why would you?</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>if not even better then higher end products.</li>
            <li>and it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Was excited for this palette until I opened and saw this..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was super excited to get this.</li>
            <li>Really love this colors they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>My love for this palette is so intense.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, very well pigmented</li>
            <li>Overall good buy, good price, much more less that</li>
            <li>Seriously this eyeshadow palette is awesome!</li>
            <li>Nothing extraordinary about it.</li>
            <li>No lie, I love this more than all my Naked palettes, mac eyeshadows,</li>
            <li>pretty excited when i got it .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not expensive and its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>packaged nicely, nothing was broken, I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this pallet!</li>
            <li>The colors are so beautiful and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>I want to make sure I have a back up!</li>
            <li>I totally recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>Perfect for making a quick 5 min look for busy morning with just one/two shades and then making a dramatic evening look.</li>
            <li>Really wishing I bought 2 of these!</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented and great for everyday use!</li>
            <li>Very nice palette, it was much smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li>I think if I only owned this palette I would be fine.</li>
            <li>I love the range of colors, from basic neutrals, to a little something more sultry.</li>
            <li>Amazing this is my everyday palette</li>
            <li>It is so much better than I expected</li>
            <li>Colors don&#x27;t fade by the end of the day too much either.</li>
            <li>Very compact for on the go or travel as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not quite ready to be spending $50 on eye shadow palettes</li>
            <li>/&gt;My palette did not arrive broken or anything which is great</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really a surprise though because this is my Amazon account</li>
            <li>they would sell triple the amount they already sold, there is so many loyal viewers of Judy Travis that were not able to buy palette.</li>
            <li>There are mostly shimmer colors and a few flat colors on the top row.</li>
            <li>Love how the colours of this palette all marry with each other.</li>
            <li>I must say I really enjoy using this palette for simple everyday looks :)</li>
            <li>I hope Judy comes out with more palettes in the future, because this one is definitely a hit! 5 Stars!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been debating on whether to dish out the cash to buy these high quality eye shadows from Mac, Ulta, Sephora, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Use it everyday :)</li>
            <li>At this point  I pretty much just use it for a highlight or for a tiny bit of color under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love her youtube channel but not a huge fan of this palette.</li>
            <li>Why spent $54 or more on Urban Decay,</li>
            <li>My first eyeshadow palette and I am so happy , to bad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just starting to get really into makeup, watching beauty bloggers on youtube, etc</li>
            <li>So far I like the colors</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t that pigmented, but it performs better with the use of an eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li>I hope one day in the near future, they will bring this pallet back</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into neutral brown eyeshadow colours and like sometimes a pop of blue or purple on your lids, then you need no other palette.</li>
            <li>If you have higher quality palettes like urban decay or lorac pro don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>

            <li> My first eyeshadow palette and I am so happy , to bad</li>

            <li> I bought it in the website and loved it im thinking to buy it again if someone is selling it because at the website it is gone no more in stock ever that is so sad</li>
            <li> I finally purchased this palette once I realized its limited edition.</li>
            <li> after holding off for so long.</li>
            <li> it was limited edition on bhcosmetics</li>
            <li> The size was a bit smaller than I expected, but I do think these will last along time since a little does go along way.</li>
            <li> Even though the actual shadows are small they seem to last a long time.</li>

            <li> I love the colors in this palette.  Judy did an amazing job on it and I&#x27;m sad to hear it&#x27;s been discontinued. The pigmentation is awesome and I love that I can get any kind of look from the colors. Even though the actual shadows are small they seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought it in the website and loved it im thinking to buy it again if someone is selling it because at the website it is gone no more in stock ever that is so sad</li>
            <li> Really love this colors they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s my daily wear!!! This is my second palette. I want to make sure I have a back up! I totally recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> My love for this palette is so intense. SO happy that I did end up buying it (and at a reduced price too!) after holding off for so long.</li>
            <li> Great! It is so much better than I expected</li>
            <li> I love judy so i had to get this palette and its perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this palette!  Colors are pigmented well!</li>
            <li> Omg! For the price it is amzingly pigmented and easy to blend eye shadows! Looks great on me.</li>
            <li> great palette, but the mirror was cracked.</li>
            <li> Seriously this eyeshadow palette is awesome! I got it thinking it was going to just be okay. But I LOVE wearing these eyeshadows. I know I&#x27;ll hit pan on these. As far as pigmentation, they&#x27;re great. There are mostly shimmer colors and a few flat colors on the top row. The nice purple and blues add a nice hint of color to your eyes. I&#x27;ve seriously been wearing these since I got it. There are transitioning shadow colors, a base color, and the dark colors can even be an eye liner. I personally always use a primer so make sure to use one if you know your eyelids. Colors don&#x27;t fade by the end of the day too much either. Beautiful palette.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting this forever, ever since hearing about it through Judy. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the colors but I decided to give it a try. I am so very glad I did!! This is now one of my favorites. I used it almost all the time!!</li>
            <li> Was so excited when i got this but got a little disappointed cause the mirror was broken into pieces. ..thank god it has a plastic strip of some sort so the mirror pcs didnt get to the actual palette or so i hope it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this palette.  There are some beautiful copper and violet tones!  My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t that pigmented, but it performs better with the use of an eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li> My first eyeshadow palette and I am so happy , to bad it was limited edition on bhcosmetics they would sell triple the amount they already sold, there is so many loyal viewers of Judy Travis that were not able to buy palette. I would recommend this to everyone who asks which eyeshadow palette to buy.Why spent $54 or more on Urban Decay, Too Faced when you can buy this one for $15 and is equal if not even better then higher end products.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of colors in this palette.  Colors stay on nicely!  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Great Color selection! but very small pots. you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Great colors and pigment! Very compact for on the go or travel as well. I think if I only owned this palette I would be fine. Perfect for making a quick 5 min look for busy morning with just one/two shades and then making a dramatic evening look. Really good for a beginner in makeup as well.</li>
            <li> I love the pigmentation and consistency. The colors are so beautiful and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Nothing extraordinary about it. Some colors in the palette are better than others. It&#x27;s great for someone who is just starting out using eyeshadow and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, or if you&#x27;re a Judy fan of course. I love her youtube channel but not a huge fan of this palette. If you have higher quality palettes like urban decay or lorac pro don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Love how the colours of this palette all marry with each other. If you&#x27;re into neutral brown eyeshadow colours and like sometimes a pop of blue or purple on your lids, then you need no other palette. You won&#x27;t regret getting this one. With a mix of matte and metallic tones available, why would you?</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing. my favorite is the rose gold and the bronze... they&#x27;re so creamy and they last all day with ANY eye shadow primer.. from elf to Urban Decay&#x27;s primer. i recommend it. it&#x27;s not expensive and its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> I love this pallet I do however own all available palettes by bHcosmetics and love them all. Great prices great products! Excellent pigmentation!</li>
            <li> I love it!! I use it for everyday as well as evening looks!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as pigmented as everyone says it is, but it is buildable. I watch itsjudytime and was able to recreate her tutorials with this palette effortlessly. I must say I really enjoy using this palette for simple everyday looks :)</li>
            <li> Amazing this is my everyday palette</li>
            <li> Really wishing I bought 2 of these! The pigmentation is amazing! I use the matte brown for my crease, it&#x27;s so beautiful. I hope one day in the near future, they will bring this pallet back</li>
            <li> Very nice palette, it was much smaller than what I expected. Love all the colors, nice and pigmented. Great range, I do miss highlighter... Overall good buy, good price, much more less that on BH and eBay, thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> LOOOOVE This pallette as well as most BH Cosmetics products!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite palettes better than some of my higher end palettes</li>
            <li> I just rec&#x27;d this palette and I LOVE it! I&#x27;m just starting to get really into makeup, watching beauty bloggers on youtube, etc and I&#x27;ve been debating on whether to dish out the cash to buy these high quality eye shadows from Mac, Ulta, Sephora, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite ready to be spending $50 on eye shadow palettes but I don&#x27;t want crappy drug store ones either. So after watching Judy herself on youtube display the palette, do tutorials on how to use it and seeing her swatch these eye shadow,  that appeared to have great payoff, are very pigmented and I wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am NOT disappointed! The colors are AMAZING, they&#x27;re pigmented and there are matte and shimmery shades in there too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My palette did not arrive broken or anything which is great and it is definitely worth the money! I definitely suggest this palette, it&#x27;s gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I just received this and I&#x27;m not very impressed with how the colors look.  Kind of looks like cheap eyeshadow you would buy at a dollar store.  There&#x27;s also a small amount of eyeshadow makeup for each color.</li>
            <li> packaged nicely, nothing was broken, I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this pallet!</li>
            <li> I would say this palette is average. I like that it has a variety of colors and finishes. There are mattes, shimmers and also pops of color. The packaging feels sleek on top but the cardboard material under the mirror make it feel cheap. So far I like the colors but you do need a good amount of product for it to show.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this palate ever since Judy announced it! LOVE IT ❤️ Highly pigmented and great for everyday use!</li>
            <li> In love with this pallette! I Use it everyday :)</li>
            <li> I finally purchased this palette once I realized its limited edition. I usually stick with higher end eyeshadows, I have a specific brand I regularly use. I received this fairly quick and once I had a chance to really try it out, I was impressed! The colors are amazing and highly pigmented. I love the range of colors, from basic neutrals, to a little something more sultry. The size was a bit smaller than I expected, but I do think these will last along time since a little does go along way. I hope Judy comes out with more palettes in the future, because this one is definitely a hit! 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallette! Really nice quality and great pigmentation!</li>
            <li> Yesssssss, thanks boyfriend for surprising me with this!! It wasn&#x27;t really a surprise though because this is my Amazon account and I receive the email confirmations lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great pigmentation and ugh... blends so perfectly!! No lie, I love this more than all my Naked palettes, mac eyeshadows, just you know all that stuff. Wished I got this while it was on sale with a deal for 2 palettes on the BH site.. If I knew how great it was, I would have bought 5 more lol!</li>
            <li> Truly happy with seller and my purchase.</li>
            <li> Received it in perfect condition! plus, the colours are truly gorgeous. Too bad they discontinued this product:(</li>
            <li> she is one of my favorite youtubers. in my mind, no youtuber is better than her. I support her no matter what. Judy does daily vlogs which is hard in my opinion.  She had to make sure to edit it , while taking care of 3 girls. Judy is loyal and a good role model for kids. I had always love her since the day I found out about her channel. I lov how the vlogs are more than 20 min. She takes the time to vlog and edit. Other youtubers are way to lazy to that. Some youtubers have a 8 min video.I admire judy for her hard Work. Haters gonna hate. But who cares. There are more fans than haters .</li>
            <li> Was excited for this palette until I opened and saw this..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that my review is the opposite of what I was looking forward to. I&#x27;m pale skinned. I do use a primer. The powders are not the smoothest on the eye. I have to use ALOT of the product to get the colors to show (this is impressive as I am fairly light complexted) and after a few uses, I have def made a dent in the amount of product as such. Some of the colors are not the same color once applied, so you don&#x27;t get the look you&#x27;re going for. The powders are not the smoothest feeling against the skin. Not the best to blend. At this point  I pretty much just use it for a highlight or for a tiny bit of color under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited to get this. I so wish it was what I expected. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Love it! I bought 5 more!</li>
            <li> pretty excited when i got it . i am so happy that i found it for 15$, im super excited to use it :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, very well pigmented</li>
