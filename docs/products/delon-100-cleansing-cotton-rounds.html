    <ol>
            <li>These are perfect...</li>
            <li>what a great deal!</li>
            <li>Best cotton pad ever.  </li>
            <li>For the price, these are great and get the job done.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase, and I will buy again, when I need more, that is :)</li>
            <li>I do it nightly before going to bed and my skin feels great and healthy in the morning.</li>
            <li>Love the quality!  </li>
            <li>These are so much better than cotton balls because they do not shred or leave pieces on her</li>
            <li>Usable, but will look for another brand that will hopefully stay together at the edges better as I use them to remove eye make up and don&#x27;t want fibers to get into my eyes.</li>
            <li>These are so much better than the swabs you get at dollar stores.  </li>
            <li>These are OK, but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to recommend them to my customers.</li>
            <li>Overall, happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li>I noticed that the textured side rolls off the pad somewhat easily if you&#x27;re using them to vigorously apply something but for general usage, they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li>OK, but the layers come apart easily, and one side tends to fuzz off.  </li>
            <li>They come apart easily also.  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t suuuper soft, but I use them when I want to do a good job of making sure I get a lot of dirt off my face.</li>
            <li>There is a smooth side and a lightly textured side.</li>
            <li>They hold together great as I cut them in half to use with my Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover.</li>
            <li>Love that I can buy several years worth of makeup removers all at one time.</li>
            <li>They are soft and strong, I havent had one that felt itchy or that fell apart on me yet.</li>
            <li>One side has a kind of cotton mesh that is somewhat rough.  </li>
            <li>Love that each side has a different texture, but don&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;d hold up for something like nail polish removal.</li>
            <li>Cotton Rounds are 100% pure cotton, soft and lint free.</li>
            <li>The cleaning cotton rounds work really well</li>
            <li>They work really well and are very affordable.</li>
            <li>They are good for cleaning one&#x27;s face because of it, but if you need something delicate you have to be sure and use the other side.  </li>
            <li>Thick, don&#x27;t fall apart when removing nail polish, great for applying astringent, one side of pad is a little gritty, for mild exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Kind of rough and of lower quality than other brands.</li>
            <li>We wet the smooth side with Doggie Bliss Spa Natural Tear Stain Remover (also available on Amazon) and hold it under our dog’s eye for a few minutes to soften the “gunk” that builds up there; then use the textured side to wipe off the debris and tear stains.</li>
            <li>And they aren&#x27;t the same quality as the ones I normally get.</li>
            <li>Little bit pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and my face is so much softer and I have had far few blemishes on my face since using these cleaning clothes.</li>
            <li>Because these are 2¼” in diameter, we cut these in half and use a clean half on each eye.</li>

            <li> This is enough to last a long time. The cleaning cotton rounds work really well, it cleans my face and you can see the dirt that is coming off after using it. I do it nightly before going to bed and my skin feels great and healthy in the morning. I think that the 300 pieces should last me a about a year and my face is so much softer and I have had far few blemishes on my face since using these cleaning clothes. They work really well and are very affordable.</li>
            <li> Love that I can buy several years worth of makeup removers all at one time. I use these at least once a day every day, so I really needed a bulk box like this! They are soft and strong, I havent had one that felt itchy or that fell apart on me yet. Very happy with this purchase, and I will buy again, when I need more, that is :)</li>
            <li> ...a miniature poodle, who needs to have the area under her eyes cleaned regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Cotton Rounds are 100% pure cotton, soft and lint free. There is a smooth side and a lightly textured side. We wet the smooth side with Doggie Bliss Spa Natural Tear Stain Remover (also available on Amazon) and hold it under our dog’s eye for a few minutes to soften the “gunk” that builds up there; then use the textured side to wipe off the debris and tear stains. Because these are 2¼” in diameter, we cut these in half and use a clean half on each eye. These are so much better than cotton balls because they do not shred or leave pieces on her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Cotton Rounds are Dematologist Tested and made in Canada.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t suuuper soft, but I use them when I want to do a good job of making sure I get a lot of dirt off my face.</li>
            <li> These fall apart when you use them! Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Should have listened to other reviews.  The product is not what is pictured. The box looks like the one I get from Costco but actually there is only three tubes. And they aren&#x27;t the same quality as the ones I normally get.</li>
            <li> OK, but the layers come apart easily, and one side tends to fuzz off.  Usable, but will look for another brand that will hopefully stay together at the edges better as I use them to remove eye make up and don&#x27;t want fibers to get into my eyes.</li>
            <li> These are perfect...what a great deal!</li>
            <li> Best cotton pad ever.  Little bit pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are great and get the job done. I noticed that the textured side rolls off the pad somewhat easily if you&#x27;re using them to vigorously apply something but for general usage, they&#x27;re perfect. I use them on my face and nails.</li>

            <li> Love the quality!  They hold together great as I cut them in half to use with my Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover. I&#x27;ll be sure to recommend them to my customers.</li>
            <li> These work well. They are not flimsy, do not leave lint only face, but the exfoliating netting on one side does tend to come off. Overall, happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> A little on the rough side.</li>
