            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a better brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft, it doesn&#x27;t shed like most mineral makeup brushes and I like the idea that it&#x27;s always there when I need it - lol.  </li>
            <li>and I hope that more will be available.</li>
            <li>I love how smoothly it applies to my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, this mineral powder foundation leaves my face with a beautiful finish.</li>
            <li>I wish L&#x27;Oreal True Match Mineral Foundation came in more ethnic shades.  </li>
            <li>It provides a flawless coverage, glides smoothly onto my face, and conceals my dark spots.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>This product does both along with being light weight and providing coverage.</li>
            <li>but it was a bit to light for my complexion.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to know that I was able to purchase that shade here on Amazon for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>Was a good price but seems very cheap, it gave my skin a dry ashy look to it.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I saw this product online as they stopped selling it in certain stores where I live.</li>
            <li>I wear this when I am home or for a quick trip out.</li>
            <li>This mineral powder foundation is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Other than that it had good coverage.</li>
            <li>Maybe this just was not my right color</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Really gives me the full coverage I need.</li>
            <li>I just put my Concealer on first then apply</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>That is the only thing that would make the product better.</li>
            <li>I tried Covergirl Loose Powder in Tawny which seemed to max my skin town the best, and gave my skin the clearest look, but it has too much glitter in it, and I&#x27;m already a man wearing makeup, boldly, so I don&#x27;t exactly want to look like a black Edward Culen stalking around in the sun.</li>
            <li>Ok let&#x27;s just state the only reason this got a two star is because it came extremely fast</li>
            <li>I put it on and at first I didn&#x27;t notice how much it transformed my face</li>
            <li>I blend it on my face (which is EXTREMELY EASY)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, just get it, doesn&#x27;t cost much and it makes you look amazing.</li>
            <li>well, I chose a shade that is too dark for my skin tone, although I don&#x27;t think any of them were suitable for my particular lighter brown skinned face.</li>
            <li>So I wanted this loose powder foundation to cover up the blemishes that it has become so apparent I will never be able to get rid of.</li>
            <li>OMG as an African American dark skinned woman of 19 years old (just telling you my age and race group, lol)</li>
            <li>My new favorite everyday product.</li>
            <li>then ordered this L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Loose Powder and it&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>This gives you a very natural and matte look.</li>
            <li>The included brush built into the container is really meant for just overall coverage.</li>
            <li>My pores seem to diminish, my skin feels soft to touch and it looks as if I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup at all.  </li>
            <li>it looks soooooo natural and</li>
            <li>I honesty think the people who bashed this were people from a rival makeup group, I even think this will look good if I used the WRONG shade.</li>
            <li>I had tried the Men Pen Concealer, which is waxy but fine for cover some small acne pop ups.</li>
            <li>can still spot-hide blemishes by using a smaller brush and dabbing directly on the spot.</li>
            <li>My new favorite foundation.not too heavy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not heavy but was a little pasty make sure you use the least amount for coverage</li>
            <li>then I turn the whole thing upside down so some can get on the brush&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was no one exact match for my skin, so one (the Cocoa) is slightly too dark, and the other is slightly too light.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The powder foundation I&#x27;ve tried in the past didn&#x27;t really work well as foundation.</li>
            <li> It definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other than that, in my opinion, no - it doesn&#x27;t compare to Bare Minerals, but for an on the shelf store talc/mineral foundation</li>
            <li> so that was amazing now a far as the product itself it was horrible first or all it is not true to color</li>
            <li> After a long winter out of the sun, the lighter shade works.</li>
            <li> and you get long-lasting coverage all day long.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for this cocoa foundation for a long time.</li>
            <li> I only spent two bucks on it.</li>
            <li> This made my skin dry so remember to moisturize your face before applying this mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> so dry def will not being buying this again</li>
            <li> I will, however be trying the Soft Sable shade because Cocoa is a little dark for me.</li>
            <li> Darker than expected...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I can layer it in, or just soften any imperfections.</li>
            <li> I even tried a men&#x27;s line of pressed powder under the brand name &amp;#34;Menaji&amp;#34; and let me tell ya, it expressly says anti-shine on the packaging, but that stuff makes my skin shinier than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> At least not without expensive treatments I can&#x27;t possibly afford right now.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was going to be to dark</li>
            <li> it looks dark</li>
            <li> I turn my brush upside down into the part where the makeup is</li>
            <li> second of all it gets everywhere there are little booklets in the actual makeup which is weird  because you have to dig them out in order to use the makeup</li>
            <li> It has SPF19 and does cause my T-zone area to shine a little, but it&#x27;s nothing that I can&#x27;t touch up with a translucent powder</li>
            <li> but it made me look dead.</li>
            <li> it is usually difficult to find a shade that looks natural and non cakey.</li>
            <li> The make up seems a little thick when applied</li>
            <li> The brush makes it hard to apply and get across your face and blemishes.</li>
            <li> (duh)</li>
            <li> I honestly never write reviews</li>
            <li> But at least it doesn&#x27;t glitter.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> I hate when there is a lot of foundation piled on a face and when the face is very shiny and somewhat gleaming with makeup.</li>
            <li> Just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The minerals seemed to thin be a foundation,</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s suffocating, and I can wear it all day without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It looks exaggerated, unrealistic.</li>
            <li> but let me tell you how wrong I was.</li>
            <li> it made my face look dirty  </li>
            <li> wouldnt recommend this product for my WORST enemy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this powder is super great it makes your skin look golden and glowy, its a must have especaially if your using over liquid foundation, its a great finish for your face.</li>
            <li> wouldnt recommend this product for my WORST enemy. Just ridiculous. Cheaply made. No!</li>
            <li> I have used foundation off and on over the years and found that no matter what I do, the liquid and cream powders all make me feel like my pores are crying out for help - kinda like being in a very humid environment. My skin can&#x27;t stand them, and will break out. The powder foundation I&#x27;ve tried in the past didn&#x27;t really work well as foundation. I tried samples of the big name mineral foundation and found that I didn&#x27;t like it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across these and bought two. There was no one exact match for my skin, so one (the Cocoa) is slightly too dark, and the other is slightly too light. If I&#x27;ve been spending lots of time in the sun, the Cocoa works on it&#x27;s own. After a long winter out of the sun, the lighter shade works. Mixing the two is no problem - I tap a bit of both into one of the covers and use one of the brushes. A little goes a long way, and I can layer it in, or just soften any imperfections. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s suffocating, and I can wear it all day without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can still spot-hide blemishes by using a smaller brush and dabbing directly on the spot. The included brush built into the container is really meant for just overall coverage.</li>
            <li> This mineral powder foundation is by far my favorite. It provides a flawless coverage, glides smoothly onto my face, and conceals my dark spots. It has SPF19 and does cause my T-zone area to shine a little, but it&#x27;s nothing that I can&#x27;t touch up with a translucent powder every couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product in Cocoa which has been discontinued by the manufacturer so I was glad to know that I was able to purchase that shade here on Amazon for a very affordable price. I will, however be trying the Soft Sable shade because Cocoa is a little dark for me. Overall, this mineral powder foundation leaves my face with a beautiful finish.</li>
            <li> I wear this when I am home or for a quick trip out. If I&#x27;m longer, I use it after another &#x27;matte&#x27; foundation.</li>
            <li> It definitely beats paying the triple price in Walmart or CVS.  Great for Arizona hot weather too!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was going to be to dark cause it looks dark but it s really a light/medium brown its great I approve</li>
            <li> this is a nice amount of powder for a great price. It arrived on time and everything was in tact. I use this powder on top of my liquid foundation, and I just love the finish it gives. I hate when there is a lot of foundation piled on a face and when the face is very shiny and somewhat gleaming with makeup. It looks exaggerated, unrealistic. I believe makeup should just enhance the beauty not change it all together. This gives you a very natural and matte look. I absolutely love it, and will be purchasing again without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Maybe this just was not my right color but it made me look dead. The minerals seemed to thin be a foundation,</li>
            <li> Just ok... Dries my skin out some</li>
            <li> I like the foundation it&#x27;s not heavy but was a little pasty make sure you use the least amount for coverage and you defintely need a moist skin or else it will look pasty I only use it in the summer months because it doesn&#x27;t sweat off and it matches great!</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I saw this product online as they stopped selling it in certain stores where I live. This powder gives you the ideal &#x27;dollyface&#x27; look and you get long-lasting coverage all day long. Once again I am so glad that I can now purchase this product on amazon.com and I received it in perfect condition. I will recommend it to anyone, excellent product at a cheap rate!</li>
            <li> Had been looking for this cocoa foundation for a long time. Have had difficulty finding it. Thankful for it and I hope that more will be available.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be good to carry in my purse; it is kinda bulky and messier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> its different from liquid foundation if you like powder foundation then get it .</li>
            <li> My new favorite foundation.not too heavy and a little goes a long way. The price is unbeatable!!! I liked it so much I ordered a backup just in case they stop selling it.</li>
            <li> Really gives me the full coverage I need. I just put my Concealer on first then apply and I&#x27;m good to go!  I like it. And I do recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this foundation. It is nice and light on the face. I am glad I can purchae this on Amazon it use to be at the Loreal Outlet Store, But they discountinued it. I am a returning customer.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used mineral foundation. I love it. It arrived about two days after I ordered it. The brush is very soft and easy to use. Being a woman of color it is usually difficult to find a shade that looks natural and non cakey. This product does both along with being light weight and providing coverage. It does last the entire day. My new favorite everyday product.</li>
            <li> Was a good price but seems very cheap, it gave my skin a dry ashy look to it. I&#x27;ll stick to the Avon brand makeup.</li>
            <li> The make up seems a little thick when applied but I think its because I should of ordered a better brush but I love it.</li>
            <li> Darker than expected...</li>
            <li> This made my skin dry so remember to moisturize your face before applying this mineral foundation. Other than that it had good coverage.</li>
            <li> This color Cocoa #472 matches my skin tone perfectly.  The brush is so soft, it doesn&#x27;t shed like most mineral makeup brushes and I like the idea that it&#x27;s always there when I need it - lol.  After applying it twice (yes I have to apply it twice to get the coverage I want), my face looks flawless.  My pores seem to diminish, my skin feels soft to touch and it looks as if I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup at all.  This foundation doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens which is great.  There are two downfalls though - 1. It contains Talc so it isn&#x27;t 100% mineral powder and 2. I wish L&#x27;Oreal True Match Mineral Foundation came in more ethnic shades.  Other than that, in my opinion, no - it doesn&#x27;t compare to Bare Minerals, but for an on the shelf store talc/mineral foundation and it&#x27;s price - I say it does the job.</li>
            <li> This foundation is great once you apply you really can&#x27;t tell its on which is a plus for me I love it know complaints I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> OMG as an African American dark skinned woman of 19 years old (just telling you my age and race group, lol) I&#x27;ve always been like aw naw I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll wear any make up like this because 1) it seems too powdery and 2) it seems like it&#x27;ll make you look ashy.. but let me tell you how wrong I was. I put it on and at first I didn&#x27;t notice how much it transformed my face but then I looked at my face and I almost cried.. it looks soooooo natural and omg there&#x27;s no words to describe it... I put it on like this&lt;br /&gt;1) I open it (duh) lol&lt;br /&gt;2) I turn my brush upside down into the part where the makeup is&lt;br /&gt;3) then I turn the whole thing upside down so some can get on the brush&lt;br /&gt;4) I blend it on my face (which is EXTREMELY EASY)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, just get it, doesn&#x27;t cost much and it makes you look amazing. doesn&#x27;t even look like you have on any makeup... I honesty think the people who bashed this were people from a rival makeup group, I even think this will look good if I used the WRONG shade. lol its honestly that amazing... I honestly never write reviews but I had to let you know that this is a staple for me..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot. It definitely goes a long way. I wish there was a better brush. That is the only thing that would make the product better.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price.</li>
            <li> Ok let&#x27;s just state the only reason this got a two star is because it came extremely fast I ordered on January 24th 2014 and it came on the 25th so that was amazing now a far as the product itself it was horrible first or all it is not true to color I got the cocoa one and it is like a greenish brown color when I put it on my skin I looked like I never wash my face it made my face look dirty  second of all it gets everywhere there are little booklets in the actual makeup which is weird  because you have to dig them out in order to use the makeup looks chalky and when I took it off it left my face feeling so dry def will not being buying this again</li>
            <li> this color is perfect for my skin tone. I love how smoothly it applies to my skin. No lines and caked up foundation. its a great but</li>
            <li> its a good product but it was a bit to light for my complexion. it was trial and error since i had no way of actually veryfying the color blend. i gave it to a friend who was lighter than i was.</li>
            <li> So I wanted this loose powder foundation to cover up the blemishes that it has become so apparent I will never be able to get rid of. At least not without expensive treatments I can&#x27;t possibly afford right now. I had tried the Men Pen Concealer, which is waxy but fine for cover some small acne pop ups. I tried Covergirl Loose Powder in Tawny which seemed to max my skin town the best, and gave my skin the clearest look, but it has too much glitter in it, and I&#x27;m already a man wearing makeup, boldly, so I don&#x27;t exactly want to look like a black Edward Culen stalking around in the sun. I even tried a men&#x27;s line of pressed powder under the brand name &amp;#34;Menaji&amp;#34; and let me tell ya, it expressly says anti-shine on the packaging, but that stuff makes my skin shinier than any other product I&#x27;ve used. Supposedly it was designed specifically for men who have 20% oilier skin than women. They missed the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then ordered this L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Loose Powder and it&#x27;s...well, I chose a shade that is too dark for my skin tone, although I don&#x27;t think any of them were suitable for my particular lighter brown skinned face. It doesn&#x27;t offer very good coverage, and makes my pores look huge. Thank goodness I only spent two bucks on it. The brush makes it hard to apply and get across your face and blemishes. But at least it doesn&#x27;t glitter.&lt;br /&gt;Next stop? Covergirl pressed powder in Tawny. Hopefully glitter-less.</li>
            <li> very cheap was not the color I order and the bursh color comes out on your skin NEVER USED IT washed off as soon as iput on I ONLY USED THIS ONCE I DID NOT WALK OUT MY HOUSE WITH IT ON</li>
