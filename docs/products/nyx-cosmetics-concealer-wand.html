            <li>This concealer is amazing.</li>
            <li>And the price is amazing too.</li>
            <li>but sometimes I just wear the NYX one on its own too).</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Had nice coverage.</li>
            <li>KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE&lt;</li>
            <li>This is great for covering blemishes and it blends easily into the skin and on top of foundation.</li>
            <li>Love this NYX concealer.</li>
            <li>I go through too many in a three month period.  </li>
            <li>Wasnt as satisfying as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>Whatever the case, not my favorite</li>
            <li>depends how many layers of this you apply.</li>
            <li>Much better than a competing brand that was twice the price.</li>
            <li>Will repurchase! :)</li>
            <li>An inexpensive concealer that works so well better than designer make up</li>
            <li>Love this concealer.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now literally my FAVORITE concealer.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better concealer.</li>
            <li>Love this concealer.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I THEN PURCHASED THE SOHO BEAUTY SPONGE (WALMART $5) AND LOVE APPYING</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that NYX has some pretty good and affordable products.</li>
            <li>Super smooth and creamy and has great full coverage for blemishes and under eyes.</li>
            <li>Really works I loved it</li>
            <li>Easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The color match was easy despite my guessing online.</li>
            <li>I love it, i wasnt sure about the color but thank God i chose the right one</li>
            <li>The concealer perfectly to lay down on skin, the first-class thing for correction of a nose fold and wrinkles mixes up with skin shades,</li>
            <li>It creases very quickly and does not apply on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s easy to apply, inexpensive, and cruelty-free, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is my new favorite concealer and its cheap too</li>
            <li>It arrived super quick.</li>
            <li>It also works fine for undereye area as long as you use a concealer brush to blend away any excess product and top with a powder since it could crease into fine lines.</li>
            <li>, it is so smooth and blends in so good, the dark spots</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit drying of a formula, but it covers pretty well!</li>
            <li>It does seem to settle in fine lines, so I don&#x27;t much like it under my eyes.</li>
            <li>provides amazing coverage especially for any acne or scars.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve bought so many that I could fill a small drawer full).  </li>
            <li>Some other brands have so many options that it&#x27;s overwhelming, but I found the beige shade to be exactly what I needed (my skin is light/neutral with beigeish undertones?).</li>
            <li>So I would say it&#x27;s worth a try, and I enjoy that Nyx products are reasonably-priced so that you can try a new thing before shelling out a lot of money.</li>
            <li>NC25 here, yellow undertones, using &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34;, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Its my first time using this concealer</li>
            <li>First time trying it.</li>
            <li>This is my first concealer ever</li>
            <li>WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED THIS</li>
            <li>TYPE:  COMBINATION, BUT MORE DRY THAN OILY,</li>
            <li>The color &amp;#34;Beige&amp;#34; is much darker / yellowy than I anticipated, but that tone works well for blemishes anyway.</li>
            <li>Very oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so creamy and blends really well.</li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li>MUCH.</li>
            <li>The beige color worked great with my pale asian NC20 skin tone.</li>
            <li>The biggest plus is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin - the ingredients are perfect for me and my skin is like CRAZY sensitive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it seemed to be medium to maybe high coverage.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, no acne, just freckles and pores</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it runs out too fast.  </li>
            <li>Caused major dryness and cracking on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have really dark eye circles, this concealer really covers them up.</li>

            <li> The concealer perfectly to lay down on skin, the first-class thing for correction of a nose fold and wrinkles mixes up with skin shades,</li>
            <li> Beige looks good on everyone! Stays put, non-cakey, great price! Love this NYX concealer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit drying of a formula, but it covers pretty well! The color &amp;#34;Beige&amp;#34; is much darker / yellowy than I anticipated, but that tone works well for blemishes anyway. It does seem to settle in fine lines, so I don&#x27;t much like it under my eyes. The biggest plus is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin - the ingredients are perfect for me and my skin is like CRAZY sensitive.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve bought so many that I could fill a small drawer full).  I have one in my make up bag and one in my purse. The color Beige is perfect for my skin. It delivers maximum coverage for a great price.  Even the expensive concealers like Jane Iredale and Dermablend have true competition with Nyx.  I wish i would have known sooner about this product-would have saved me tons of $.  The only downfall is that it runs out too fast.  I go through too many in a three month period.  Needs to have more concealer in the base.</li>
            <li> Wasnt as satisfying as I would have hoped. It creases very quickly and does not apply on smoothly.</li>
            <li> love it! Very nice look.</li>
            <li> I have really dark eye circles, this concealer really covers them up. It is truly amazing. I sometimes use a yellow based concealer base from NYX, but this can be worn on its own (but sometimes I just wear the NYX one on its own too). This is a great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use this always for little blemishes.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that NYX has some pretty good and affordable products. I am pretty disappointed in this concealer. It cakes and creases and it has very low coverage. The applicator brush is very hard and I scraped my under eye region because the spongy part either disintegrated or half of it fell off. Whatever the case, not my favorite</li>
            <li> works great - nice tone</li>
            <li> I hate this product! It&#x27;s clogs your pores. Very oily. Not very much in the tube. It&#x27;s not worth buying.</li>
            <li> It arrived super quick. Its my first time using this concealer and I really liked it. Had nice coverage. I&#x27;d say it seemed to be medium to maybe high coverage. depends how many layers of this you apply. I only apply it once and it covers up everything. I&#x27;m definitely happy with my purchase. I&#x27;d say this is my new favorite concealer and its cheap too so thats also a plus.</li>
            <li> NC25 here, yellow undertones, using &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34;, and so far so good. Thick consistency and high coverage for dry spots. Easy to blend. Good color selection! Much better than a competing brand that was twice the price. Will repurchase! :)</li>
            <li> Really works I loved it</li>
            <li> I will ever use another concealer. This is THE BEST.</li>
            <li> An inexpensive concealer that works so well better than designer make up</li>
            <li> Love this concealer. It&#x27;s so creamy and blends really well. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love it, i wasnt sure about the color but thank God i chose the right one, it is so smooth and blends in so good, the dark spots undeath my eyes were magicky gone, and i am ordering one soon too. Totally recommend it, you wont regret!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not all it is cracked up to be.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this. I have never bought a makeup product twice, but I&#x27;ve purchased this again and will continue to. I use it as an all over face foundation not just a concealer. I have normal skin, no acne, just freckles and pores I do not like. I apply it with a spounge and use Rimmel primer.</li>
            <li> My Fiance loved it, said it has a good texture and it does its job. Plus they dont animal test.</li>
            <li> Great seller and product!</li>
            <li> Just got my NYX HD Concealer in Beige. First time trying it. It&#x27;s now literally my FAVORITE concealer. Super smooth and creamy and has great full coverage for blemishes and under eyes. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better concealer. I&#x27;m stocking up and reordering now! So excited I tried this product!!!</li>
            <li> Love this concealer.  Easy to apply.  Good price for a nice product.</li>
            <li> provides amazing coverage especially for any acne or scars. if only it wasnt darker than i interpreted... XD</li>
            <li> Maybe I got the wrong color...but boy was it terrible! Never again.</li>
            <li> The best concealer out there</li>
            <li> This is great for covering blemishes and it blends easily into the skin and on top of foundation. The beige color worked great with my pale asian NC20 skin tone. It also works fine for undereye area as long as you use a concealer brush to blend away any excess product and top with a powder since it could crease into fine lines.</li>
            <li> This is my first concealer ever and I love it! The color match was easy despite my guessing online.

Anyway, it&#x27;s easy to apply, inexpensive, and cruelty-free, which is important to me. So I would say it&#x27;s worth a try, and I enjoy that Nyx products are reasonably-priced so that you can try a new thing before shelling out a lot of money. I&#x27;ll probably just buy this again when I run out! I think it&#x27;s made a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> Really helps correct my dark circles I use this every day!! Plz keep selling this. I have a hard time time finding at stores.</li>
            <li> Caused major dryness and cracking on my skin. Also burns on application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about 3 tubes of this and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This concealer is amazing. I love it. And the price is amazing too.</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED THIS I DIDNT REALLY LIKE IT BECAUSE IT WAS A LITTLE THIN AND WHEN APPIED WITH THE FINGERS, DIDNT COVER UP MY DARK UNDER EYE CIRCLES MUCH. I THEN PURCHASED THE SOHO BEAUTY SPONGE (WALMART $5) AND LOVE APPYING THE CONCEALER WITH THIS SPONGE! IDK WHY IT WORKS BUT IT PROVIDES GREAT COVERAGE AND AN EVEN FLAWLESS APPLICATION !! REALLY GREAT INEXPENSIVE CONCEALER !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTE:  I APPLY BEN NYE BANANA POWDER OVERTOP THE CONCEALER TO SET IT BECAUSE IT DOES CREASE A LITTLE LIKE ANY OTHER CONCEALER !! THE COMBO IS AMAZINGLY FLAWLESS !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN TYPE:  COMBINATION, BUT MORE DRY THAN OILY, KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN TONE:  MAC NW30</li>
