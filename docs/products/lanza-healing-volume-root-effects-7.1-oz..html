            <li>I have thick but fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair super fluffy, workable and doesn&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for  years and with fine, thin hair it gives me body and keeps it the way I brush it after washing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered the Lanza product pictured (note the red can).  I received an orange-colored Lanza product, also called \\&quot;root effects.\\&quot;  However, it tends to add softening that the red product does not.  No explanation in the packaging.  Caution!</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair body and shape with a very natural look. You only need to use a little bit for good results!</li>
            <li> Works well and gives my fine hair some body!</li>
            <li> This product is magic, The volume it provides is awesome and it will hold even in High Humidity. Love it will  purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great product. Good price. Arrived when promised.</li>
            <li> It seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s authentic bc the smell is a little funky and not in a good way at all. It works well but the smell is quite awful and I won&#x27;t buy on Amazon next time, I&#x27;ll buy at a proper salon.</li>
            <li> Have been using Lanza for a couple years and love it.  My hair is very fine and thin.  Lanza gives more body and fullnes without the stiffness or stickiness.</li>
            <li> Makes hair super fluffy, workable and doesn&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product. The first time, my hair was shorter and I was delighted with the results. Now that my hair is longer, I find that it is weighing my hair down a bit. I use a very small amount of the product so that cannot be the problem. I think it works best with shorter styles.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and the only place I can find it is for sale at Amazon. The container and name have changed a little over the years, but it still works great for me.</li>
            <li> Great root lifter for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick but fine hair.  This product adds just the volume I need</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really puts bounce it your hair. It doesn&#x27;t weight it down. I can have full body with my hair straight or curly</li>
            <li> Great product for fine limp hair!! I love this stuff.  When applied as directed my hair looks as if I had a lot of it as well as a lot of body and bounce.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Lanza</li>
            <li> cheaper than the salon</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have fine hair and this gives me lift</li>
            <li> Product works great. It definitely gives me the lift I&#x27;m looking for. If you need extra lift or volume you should give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It gives REAL root boosting volume, with great added bouncy body, shine and fullness to fine hair. Conditions hair without weighing it down AND your hair looks great for 2-3 days without shampooing, saving time and money. It also has the correct hold factor, so no hairspray is required! The absolute BEST product on the market for fine hair!  I am looking to find a travel size (3oz) for flight approval.</li>
            <li> No noticeable change in volume.  A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for years.  It is the only Volume spray that works well for me.  I would recommend it to everyone.  My hair is wavy and short.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for  years and with fine, thin hair it gives me body and keeps it the way I brush it after washing.</li>
            <li> The best volumizing thickener I have used. Be sure to shake well before using. A little goes a long way. Spray at roots before drying hair</li>
            <li> Identical to salon product but at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product for several years and am always pleased with the results. I was first introduced to it at a beauty salon where I was shown how to use it. It provides good but modest volume for my short, lightened hair. If you require more lift, you may have to use another product along with this one, as I have done on some occasions. One caution: make sure that you shake the container very well before the first use. The root volume solution is a white foam but if the container is not shaken well enough all you will get is the propellant.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
            <li> I was expecting more volume than I am getting.  Perhaps it&#x27;s the stylist.  I was introduced to it while vacationing in Florida and my hair looked amazing but since I am home, I don&#x27;t have the same results.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and flat.  This product does very well in adding lift at the roots.  It lasts all day, I never have to touch up throughout the day to get more volume.  I have tried several other non-salon brands and this seems to perform better than any other brand that I have tried.  I use this product every day and have found one bottle to last for 6 months.</li>
            <li> The product came when it was supposed to and is excellent.  I really like this product and would purchase it again.  The price was cheaper than in any store.</li>
