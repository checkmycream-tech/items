            <li>She loves anything hippy-ish and she loved these.</li>
            <li>the patchouli is good.</li>
            <li>The scents are true to scent and they smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>They have my two very favorite scents...patchouli and nag champa.</li>
            <li>The Nag Champa oil is a wonderful blend of floral and classic Nag scents!</li>
            <li>Both of these body fragrances are really nice.</li>
            <li>Patchouli is an all-time favorite of mine, but I bought this set because I was looking for a good Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best Patchouli oil I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>/back of your neck, inside of elbows) and give the scent time to warm and rise on your body.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this fragrance!!  </li>
            <li>Of all the oils I have used, this one has been the best, most pleasant by far!</li>
            <li>The concentration is very strong</li>
            <li>Items were shipped very quickly!  </li>
            <li>My new go to place for this kind of stuff!!</li>
            <li>Smells great and exactly as you expect it.</li>
            <li>Their products are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I really love the Hippie Peace.  </li>
            <li>When I got it, it was leaking in the box, but that is ok.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume of all time is from Jovan patchouli.</li>
            <li>but it is better than others I have tried, which often do not at all resemble Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a birthday gift for a fellow hippie :)</li>
            <li>But I absolutely love the way these perfumes smell</li>
            <li>Love the roll on dispenser.</li>
            <li>Me and my gf love the scents, actually they&#x27;re quite perfect.</li>
            <li>My gf took the &amp;#34;Hippie Peace&amp;#34; with her to work today. :)</li>
            <li>I thought maybe the Nag Champa would smell better</li>
            <li>You can always add more if you think you need it</li>
            <li>Well...the men love it.  </li>
            <li>Ok patchouli.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>The Aging Hippie smells more like aging burnt toast.  </li>
            <li>I liked the scents, were true to that type.</li>
            <li>I am so excited that I found Mountain Country!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with everything, thanks!</li>
            <li>Clean fragrance, doesn&#x27;t have funky undertone that so many of the patchouli and nag champa scents often do</li>
            <li>not as strong as i like it...</li>
            <li>lotsa folks dont like it too strong...</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong, but it stays with you all day.</li>
            <li>Also ordered as a Christmas present for someone who also is very pleased!</li>
            <li>I can comfortably wear.  </li>
            <li>And, enjoy the Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li>Light and sensual.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good buy and I would purchase more of this brand.</li>
            <li>Too sweet smelling for me.</li>
            <li>And the Aging Hippie is such a good patchouli mix....</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a true Patchouli scent, this is not it...</li>
            <li>I find the Nag Champa to be true to others I&#x27;ve smelled over the years.</li>
            <li>Not the sweet patchouli scent I remember from the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The hippie peace goes A LONG WAY, like one lil dab on the wrist and you are good for the day.</li>
            <li>It makes me smile when I smell the Hippie peace.</li>
            <li>I was so excited because I wanted the lovely smell of Patchouli from the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, but this is definitely not it.  </li>
            <li>The patchouli however, is far too strong.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality oil!</li>
            <li>however, the labels on the perfumes are a lot more generic looking and are not as seen in the picture...</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing any of these products.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer commented I&#x27;d love it if the company replaced the word &amp;#34;Aging&amp;#34; with a different word like, &amp;#34;Joyful&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Amazing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Awesome&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;Skippy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Use very sparingly!.  </li>
            <li>The smell is exactly what you want in a patchouli or Nag Champa-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am old hippie and these are by far my two favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>Lots of positive comments when I wear these.  </li>
            <li>Both are good quality and long lasting</li>
            <li>Strong enough to fill the whole room with scent.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Not too much leaked out.  </li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>too much can be overwhelming/nauseating.  </li>
            <li>I really like these products.</li>
            <li>Arrived early!!!</li>
            <li>Plus the little roller container lets out the right amount (some have a crappy fit ball making</li>
            <li>The are not over bearing, just enough for you to enjoy the scent which is good because either you love the smell of patchouli and nag champa or hate it.</li>
            <li>This smells just like the aroma you get when walking into a hippie dippy shop... and takes you right back in time to 1968...</li>
            <li>It has a very earthy sharp fragrance at first which becomes more subtle and sweet as it warms on your skin.</li>
            <li>very soft scented and</li>
            <li>This Nag Champa is still not exactly what I want-- not like the original Satya Sai Baba</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way so these will last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>The patchouli is great but the nag shampa smells too artificial (chemicals may be?)</li>
            <li>although that is the only fragrance that has ever stayed on me I will never pay that much.</li>
            <li>smells like days of old.  </li>
            <li>So, this order was a complete surprise.  </li>
            <li>but my husband thought I was wearing old lady Jean Nate.  </li>
            <li>I think these will be fun to mix with each other as well other similar oil based perfumes I&#x27;ve found and enjoy.</li>
            <li>.. start with a very tiny dab on the pulse points first then distribute by rubbing your wrists elsewhere on your body (back of the knees, front</li>
            <li>The scent does not linger and I can barely smell it.</li>
            <li>Not only do I always keep one of these roll on perfume oils in my purse, but my six year old daughter does too.</li>
            <li>The company ships quickly and includes a little surprise sample of another of their products ( I&#x27;ve ordered one of the soaps I tried!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely long lasting because I ran straight in the bathroom and scrubbed it off my wrist several times</li>
            <li>too much or too little come out).</li>

            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> I am not actually an old hippy and am unfamiliar with this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as they are made out of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Truly, a little goes a long long way</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> The Aging Hippie Patchouli wasn&#x27;t as I expected and the Hippie Peace just isn&#x27;t my thing-</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> so I only need to use a very small amount of these oils -- the fragrance lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Has an odd scent almost bitter.</li>
            <li> the Nag Champa is less stout in the lotion....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> But was a little overpowering even in just a small amount.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t...not sure which one is worse...they are both awful.  </li>
            <li> Sadly a disappointment for an old hippie.</li>
            <li> Again , the oil is very thin, does not last all day as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> but once it is on it&#x27;s near impossible to reduce it without bathing and</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have minded as much if at least it was a wearable smell, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> A very thin oil compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Sadly they stopped making it, and on here it sales at $150,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> but the other one smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t stick with me :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Smells soapy and awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Very pleased with everything, thanks!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this fragrance!!  I get compliments on the Aging Hippie all the time!</li>
            <li> These were part of my mom&#x27;s gift for Mother&#x27;s Day. She loves anything hippy-ish and she loved these. The scents are true to scent and they smell wonderful. Long lasting and it doesn&#x27;t take much. A little goes a long way so these will last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> not as strong as i like it...lotsa folks dont like it too strong...</li>
            <li> Would I buy this again? Absolutely not. The scent does not linger and I can barely smell it. Their patchouli lotion is awesome but the oil doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I found Mountain Country! They have my two very favorite scents...patchouli and nag champa. Their products are fabulous!</li>
            <li> Items were shipped very quickly!  The concentration is very strong so I only need to use a very small amount of these oils -- the fragrance lasts a long time.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> The Aging Hippie Patchouli wasn&#x27;t as I expected and the Hippie Peace just isn&#x27;t my thing- Too sweet smelling for me.</li>
            <li> Both are good quality and long lasting</li>
            <li> I really love the Hippie Peace.  When I got it, it was leaking in the box, but that is ok.  Not too much leaked out.  The patchouli however, is far too strong.  It makes me smile when I smell the Hippie peace. Cant wait to wear it during yoga.</li>
            <li> The hippie peace goes A LONG WAY, like one lil dab on the wrist and you are good for the day. the Nag Champa is less stout in the lotion....And the Aging Hippie is such a good patchouli mix....its earthy and mellow and I cant get enough of it on my husband</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume of all time is from Jovan patchouli. Sadly they stopped making it, and on here it sales at $150, although that is the only fragrance that has ever stayed on me I will never pay that much. I like the roll on feature of these and they smell as they should. Just don&#x27;t stick with me :(</li>
            <li> Both of these body fragrances are really nice. Patchouli is an all-time favorite of mine, but I bought this set because I was looking for a good Nag Champa. This Nag Champa is still not exactly what I want-- not like the original Satya Sai Baba version-- but it is better than others I have tried, which often do not at all resemble Nag Champa.  Overall, a good buy and I would purchase more of this brand.</li>
            <li> great stuff.  smells like days of old.  very soft scented and I would consider buying it again.  I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a birthday gift for a fellow hippie :) The oils themselves smell great. however, the labels on the perfumes are a lot more generic looking and are not as seen in the picture... so it didn&#x27;t make a great gift. But I absolutely love the way these perfumes smell and I would buy this product for myself to use!</li>
            <li> Not only do I always keep one of these roll on perfume oils in my purse, but my six year old daughter does too. The smell is not too strong, but it stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> I liked the scents, were true to that type. But was a little overpowering even in just a small amount. Strong enough to fill the whole room with scent.</li>
            <li> Very high quality oil! Love the roll on dispenser.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing any of these products. Me and my gf love the scents, actually they&#x27;re quite perfect. My gf took the &amp;#34;Hippie Peace&amp;#34; with her to work today. :)</li>
            <li> omg!!! love the nag champ, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best Patchouli oil I have ever used!  This is the second time I have purchase this oil and will continue to order  it!!!</li>
            <li> Did not smell like Patchouli at all!  Smells soapy and awful.  I thought maybe the Nag Champa would smell better but it doesn&#x27;t...not sure which one is worse...they are both awful.  I was so excited because I wanted the lovely smell of Patchouli from the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, but this is definitely not it.  I wouldn&#x27;t have minded as much if at least it was a wearable smell, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s definitely long lasting because I ran straight in the bathroom and scrubbed it off my wrist several times and I can still smell them.  If you are looking for a true Patchouli scent, this is not it...I promise.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Try another brand; I&#x27;m going to.</li>
            <li> Love them!! Truly, a little goes a long long way .. start with a very tiny dab on the pulse points first then distribute by rubbing your wrists elsewhere on your body (back of the knees, front/back of your neck, inside of elbows) and give the scent time to warm and rise on your body. You can always add more if you think you need it but once it is on it&#x27;s near impossible to reduce it without bathing and too much can be overwhelming/nauseating.  I think these will be fun to mix with each other as well other similar oil based perfumes I&#x27;ve found and enjoy. I find the Nag Champa to be true to others I&#x27;ve smelled over the years. As another reviewer commented I&#x27;d love it if the company replaced the word &amp;#34;Aging&amp;#34; with a different word like, &amp;#34;Joyful&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Amazing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Awesome&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;Skippy&amp;#34;. LOL</li>
            <li> Lots of positive comments when I wear these.  &amp;#34;Aging Hippie&amp;#34; may suggest caught in the 60s. I prefer &amp;#34;Updated, Unapologetic Hippie&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This smells just like the aroma you get when walking into a hippie dippy shop... and takes you right back in time to 1968... wow!</li>
            <li> the patchouli is good. but the other one smells terrible. I threw away the hippie peace and my husband felt like having a headache with that hippie peace.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness!  this oill is awesome!  I always wore  them in the 70&#x27;s  and did you know that patchouli is considered an aphrodisiac? LOL!  Well...the men love it.  3 times now, I was out with my hubby, and men asked, &amp;#34;who&#x27;s wearing the patchouli?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;One guy was a cop..and said his wife used to wear it...he&#x27;s gonna get some for her again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and exactly as you expect it. A little goes a long way as they are made out of essential oils.  I received a ton of compliments on the scent but every afternoon my boss would get a headache.  This didn&#x27;t happen when I did not wear it, and while he never said a word I stopped wearing it to work since we work in a shared office suite.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set not knowing what to expect of the Nag Champa.  I am not actually an old hippy and am unfamiliar with this fragrance.  Well, this version is yummy.  I HAVE smelled Patchouli before.  That&#x27;s why I ordered this.  This was nothing like what I&#x27;ve smelled before.  I would describe this as stinky.  So, this order was a complete surprise.  I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a Patchouli I can comfortably wear.  And, enjoy the Nag Champa.  I&#x27;m getting rid of the Patchouli.  It&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Ok patchouli. Just ok.</li>
            <li> The Aging Hippie smells more like aging burnt toast.  Not the sweet patchouli scent I remember from the 70&#x27;s.  It smells like charred wood.  I would return it, but I already used it as I thought it would change and soften on my skin. NOT.  Disappointed.  I recommend medicinal grade patchouli oil from your local pharmacy,  The Hippie Peace is a bit nicer but my husband thought I was wearing old lady Jean Nate.  I tried them together as well and it didnt&#x27; make a difference.  This is going in the can</li>
            <li> I really like these products.</li>
            <li> great combination of scents for children of the 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Mountain Country Soap is a wonderful store.  Everything I have ordered there has been great.  The Nag Champa is a heady fragrance, but they have balanced it well.  Use very sparingly!.  Mountain Country&#x27;s patchouli is the best out there.  It has a very earthy sharp fragrance at first which becomes more subtle and sweet as it warms on your skin.</li>
            <li> Great scents. Clean fragrance, doesn&#x27;t have funky undertone that so many of the patchouli and nag champa scents often do</li>
            <li> The patchouli is great but the nag shampa smells too artificial (chemicals may be?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am old hippie and these are by far my two favorite scents.  The are not over bearing, just enough for you to enjoy the scent which is good because either you love the smell of patchouli and nag champa or hate it.</li>
            <li> Did not like the patchouli scent at all.</li>
            <li> Sadly a disappointment for an old hippie. The Patchouli is way off. Has an odd scent almost bitter. A very thin oil compared to other brands. The scent did not last as it should. The Nag champa has a wonderful scent . Light and sensual. Again , the oil is very thin, does not last all day as others have mentioned. The scent faded to almost nothing within 2-3 hrs.</li>
            <li> Tried SO MANY and these oils are the best! The smell is exactly what you want in a patchouli or Nag Champa- and it lasts! Plus the little roller container lets out the right amount (some have a crappy fit ball making too much or too little come out). The company ships quickly and includes a little surprise sample of another of their products ( I&#x27;ve ordered one of the soaps I tried!). Also ordered as a Christmas present for someone who also is very pleased! My new go to place for this kind of stuff!!</li>
            <li> The Nag Champa oil is a wonderful blend of floral and classic Nag scents! Of all the oils I have used, this one has been the best, most pleasant by far! A must have, to apply before leaving the house!</li>
            <li> Arrived early!!! So happy with the set! Brings back memories!✌️</li>
