    <ol>
            <li>Works great !</li>
            <li>This is the best that I have used for treating sleep apnea.  </li>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>I guess i havent found the perfect one for me...</li>
            <li>But it has the T-frame on the forehead and causes a great deal of headaches.</li>
            <li>and I was totally happy with that.</li>
            <li>all there works and fits great.</li>
            <li>While that mask works great, it leaves a mark on my forehead even though I fitted it with padding (covered it with headband</li>
            <li>By using one, it creates a GREAT seal that without it you just cannot achieve.  </li>
            <li>Good product and no problems.</li>
            <li>and I was even able to wear this mask when I broke my nose!  </li>
            <li>Just a suggestion for everyone who has someone that is handy with a sewing machine:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this Quattro FX full face mask works great for me</li>
            <li>The mask became for me soft, hygienic, of hermetic closure; I am sleeping and feeling very comfortable!!!</li>
            <li>My backup mask - VERY comfortable (if you move around)</li>
            <li>This mask is well constructed, washable and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The headgear couldn&#x27;t even fit my head!</li>
            <li>You better make sure</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>I love It</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only used it a week now, I would have to say that I&#x27;m VERY happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>This was a much better value than ordering any two of the four components separately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because I have used it and love it</li>
            <li>also when you follow all the instrucctions, reviews and youtube videos on how to wear it, it fits perfectly, but 2 hours later is pulling up on your face and then comes the air leak..  </li>
            <li>, it was more like wearing a helmet...</li>
            <li>It defeats the purpose of having a c-pap machine in the first place by no allowing a good nights&#x27; sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works great, better than old headgear style mask.</li>
            <li>The ResMed Quattro really provided a great fit.  </li>
            <li>I like that this mask doesn&#x27;t have the piece on the forehead, its a more comfortable mask</li>
            <li>thought I would try the Quattro FX to see if it would fit my needs better.  </li>
            <li>I extremely happy with this mask/design so far.  </li>
            <li>Love the CPap, but the face mask fit is a pain.</li>
            <li>This mask fit better than the one for women.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the most comfortable mask I have used.</li>
            <li>I can now enjoy sleeping much better than before.</li>
            <li>He says it is a much more comfortable fit and the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; headgear that came with it</li>
            <li>, It is much more quieter then the full face mask with the forehead piece.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the headgear from my full face mask.</li>
            <li>This thing fits so well and is so comfortable (on my face, anyway)</li>
            <li>This is, in my humble opinion, the best mask on the market.</li>
            <li>My fit is somewhere between the Quattro FX (S) and the Quattro FX (S) for Her.</li>
            <li>When I rigged it with tissue and medical tape (while waiting for an appointment to get a refit), it worked great.</li>
            <li>When I switched to the For Her, the nose bridge fit well</li>
            <li>I bought the cpap and then looked for a mask that would fit and allow me to rest comfortably.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprise about how well it fit to my face.</li>
            <li>and they agreed to take it back , and was very nice about it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that the key to a good fit and a NON-LEAKING full face mask is to use some type of cotton mask liner.  </li>
            <li>Tell your doctor to write you an RX for the newer Quattro Air if he is prescribing a full face</li>
            <li>Stick to the full face version with the forehead brace.</li>
            <li>the comfort full 2</li>
            <li>This mask is pretty good, however, requires some more care than others, the sillicon cushion is comfortable the first two hours, then you need to clean it or tight more the mask, cause it will leak...</li>
            <li>The plastic part that holds the headgear \\&quot;peg\\&quot;, as I call it, also broke and I had to super glue the heck out it.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, my wife knows how to use a sewing machine.  </li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described !</li>
            <li>it is nor comfortable but the mask stays the whole night...</li>
            <li>The mask has leaks and doesn&#x27;t  fit very well, so I spoke to the company that it came from</li>
            <li>I like the mask, its easy to wear and for the two or 3 first hours its magic, comfortable and reliable, when I used to have other mask from respironics</li>
            <li>It is extremely comfortable and vents to allow you to exhale normally, which was not the case with the nasal pillows that i tried first.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>and I could clearly tell that it didn&#x27;t fit once I took it out of the plastic packaging.</li>
            <li>overpriced , a first for me from Amazon,this a case where eve one one has the same Phillips product , shop some more.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li>Surprising how much better the new one works, old one looks fine but loses functionality so replace it when needed!</li>
            <li>I have replaced the unit with a different unit I hope t0 be able to return the unit to you thanks</li>
            <li>The face piece is much thicker and seats much better and is a major improvement over the older Quattros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have bought all the right accessories and it makes this whizzing sound out the sides, I adjusted the straps every way possible and it still gives me problems.</li>
            <li>It did take a bit to get used to how it moves but overall so much better than my last mask which fit all of the way up to your forehead.</li>
            <li>I ordered medium in the mask and headgear, thinking it should fit because of the size I currently use.</li>
            <li>When I got the numerous amounts of flip-flopping e-mails from this company, they couldn&#x27;t even exchange it because they don&#x27;t have the size available that I need.</li>
            <li>It still leaked too much for me to use.</li>
            <li>I know no mask works for everyone, but this has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Finally I&#x27;m not tired anymore.  </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Easy to wear, comfortable, very little to break.  </li>
            <li>and I have found most uncomfortable, easy to break and full of leaks.  </li>
            <li>And if you buy the headgear to go with it (which you should) you will find it does not stretch out of shape like most other head gear does.</li>
            <li>being said, be sure to tighten the lower straps sufficiently so that the cotton liner doesn&#x27;t slip down your face during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>is so much easier to adjust than the old one.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy online at one of the online equipment vendors, I pay for my equipment out of pocket so finding the exact same item on amazon at a very competitive price saves me a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is made better for fuller, round shape face.  </li>
            <li>I was not getting a full nights sleep because the forehead piece would snap loose and air would leak, I would wake to fix and adjust.  </li>
            <li>So I thought maybe its just time for a new mask.</li>
            <li>I had to check to make sure I didn&#x27;t get a small.</li>
            <li>so if yours is 13 or higher you are not going to like this masks, especially if you move around or sleep on your side.</li>
            <li>It had not left any marks on my face (a first).  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband to replace his old mask that was about 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re not sure you better not take it out of packaging because you will never get your money back if you have to return it.</li>
            <li>I adjusted the straps tight and loose, one side at a time, then both sides then top and bottom, all to no avail.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s enough to shift my love-hate relationship with BiPAP a little further toward love.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and smaller than previous one I used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Resmed has a new masks with a different face membrane called the Quattro Air.</li>
            <li>It barely covered my face!</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as the sleep center</li>
            <li>It does not break easily (I am thinking of all the masks I&#x27;ve broken with the forehead pieces)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much quieter than the old one as it disperses the outgoing air from breathing through several small holes rather than a single one like the old mask.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;d have her sell them, but they last so long there probably wouldn&#x27;t be a profit.  </li>
            <li> My first review was not a good one,  because I had not received by the date promised.</li>
            <li> I know CPAP masks vary by the user, but for me this mask puts a lot less pressure on the nose bridge and the inner eyes than my last mask</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong size and the staff were nothing shy of amazing, not tow toon accommodating!</li>
            <li> Additionally, the upper straps rest on my bottom eyelids and make for a very uncomfortable fit.  </li>
            <li> If you are just starting to use a machine, try putting just the mask on for a few minutes at a time while watching tv or reading to get used to wearing it.  </li>
            <li> I need the length of the FX, but the bridge of the nose is too wide and blows air into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not only was the headgear really small, no matter how I adjusted the strap</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why other people said this Item doesn&#x27;t come with head gear clip and cushion</li>
            <li> sometimes they stretch so far that the seal is broken during the night.  </li>
            <li> This masks uses a minimum amount of parts so there is less to break.  </li>
            <li> Before I had to cinch up the mask so tight that in the morning the grooves on my face made me look like I had just finished a 12 hour B-17 mission over Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how tightly I adjust the headgear, I always wake up with air squealing around the cushion.  </li>
            <li> when it is that tight, it hurts.  </li>

            <li> Exactly the same as the sleep center</li>
            <li> The mask I currently use is medium, so is the headgear. But it has the T-frame on the forehead and causes a great deal of headaches. The plastic part that holds the headgear \\&quot;peg\\&quot;, as I call it, also broke and I had to super glue the heck out it. So I thought maybe its just time for a new mask. I went looking for masks, low and behold I found this one and no T-frame! I ordered medium in the mask and headgear, thinking it should fit because of the size I currently use. Nope! Not only was the headgear really small, no matter how I adjusted the strap but so was the mask. It barely covered my face! I didn&#x27;t even put it on my face and I could clearly tell that it didn&#x27;t fit once I took it out of the plastic packaging. I tried the headgear to see if I could work around it, nope! The headgear couldn&#x27;t even fit my head! I had to check to make sure I didn&#x27;t get a small. Oh no, then I requested to return. Should&#x27;ve read their ridiculous return policy before ordering. If you even take it out of the packaging, you cannot return. When I got the numerous amounts of flip-flopping e-mails from this company, they couldn&#x27;t even exchange it because they don&#x27;t have the size available that I need. Now, I&#x27;m unemployed with no income anymore having to pay out of pocket medical expenses. I am now out over $100 of a small CPAP mask and headgear that I can&#x27;t return or even exchange. You better make sure you know the size you&#x27;re getting and if you&#x27;re not sure you better not take it out of packaging because you will never get your money back if you have to return it. No Insurance Medical Supplies, should be No Medical Solution cause I&#x27;m up you-know-what creek without a paddle now.</li>
            <li> I tried both versions of this mask with and without the forehead brace. They both suck or perhaps I should say blowby. These mask were impossible to adjust to a point where they did not leak and my pressure was 13 so if yours is 13 or higher you are not going to like this masks, especially if you move around or sleep on your side. The thin membrane of the masks seal against your face consistantly roll out and then leaks. When it does you cannot just push it back. You need to turn off the machine or disconnect the air hose and then remove the lower masks straps and try to pivot the mask away from your face and then set it back in the correct position. You cannot move it around once it is on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resmed has a new masks with a different face membrane called the Quattro Air. The face piece is much thicker and seats much better and is a major improvement over the older Quattros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real secret to the mask leak problem is a lower pressure. By testing you and your doctor need to find the lowest pressure that will still produce acceptable AHI numbers. I just got  my pressure lowered to 10 and everything especially mask leak was reduced a bunch. Before I had to cinch up the mask so tight that in the morning the grooves on my face made me look like I had just finished a 12 hour B-17 mission over Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most stores associated with the doctors that perscribe these masks seem to have a lot of the regular Quattros that they are trying to get rid of. Tell your doctor to write you an RX for the newer Quattro Air if he is prescribing a full face mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;noelvm</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described ! Works great !</li>
            <li> Good product and no problems.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. No returns.</li>
            <li> The mask worked well for 3-4 days then began leaking excessively. I adjusted the straps tight and loose, one side at a time, then both sides then top and bottom, all to no avail. It still leaked too much for me to use.</li>
            <li> This thing fits so well and is so comfortable (on my face, anyway), it&#x27;s enough to shift my love-hate relationship with BiPAP a little further toward love.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I have tried literally every mask on the market and I have found most uncomfortable, easy to break and full of leaks.  With this mask, I can wear my glasses and watch TV.  It does not break easily (I am thinking of all the masks I&#x27;ve broken with the forehead pieces) and I was even able to wear this mask when I broke my nose!  This masks uses a minimum amount of parts so there is less to break.  If you follow the directions for putting this mask on - it will hardly ever leak. It had not left any marks on my face (a first).  Easy to wear, comfortable, very little to break.  And if you buy the headgear to go with it (which you should) you will find it does not stretch out of shape like most other head gear does. This is, in my humble opinion, the best mask on the market.</li>
            <li> Surprising how much better the new one works, old one looks fine but loses functionality so replace it when needed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why other people said this Item doesn&#x27;t come with head gear clip and cushion but it did and I was totally happy with that. However I did buy the head gear for this because you have to.</li>
            <li> all there works and fits great. No air leaking and dont even no it on my face. I love It</li>
            <li> I like that this mask doesn&#x27;t have the piece on the forehead, its a more comfortable mask once you get it adjusted correctly. I used to buy online at one of the online equipment vendors, I pay for my equipment out of pocket so finding the exact same item on amazon at a very competitive price saves me a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was packaged differently than the same mask from the online companies but its Resmed packaging and its the same mask which was what I was worried about. My purchase was from Amazon Vendor No insurance Medical Supplies and they performed well</li>
            <li> Is too big I have replaced the unit with a different unit I hope t0 be able to return the unit to you thanks</li>
            <li> The mask became for me soft, hygienic, of hermetic closure; I am sleeping and feeling very comfortable!!! Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I have bought all the right accessories and it makes this whizzing sound out the sides, I adjusted the straps every way possible and it still gives me problems. Stick to the full face version with the forehead brace.</li>
            <li> I know CPAP masks vary by the user, but for me this mask puts a lot less pressure on the nose bridge and the inner eyes than my last mask (and I was starting to have problems because of it). Leaks are few and without a forehead piece it&#x27;s easier to sleep on my side. I know no mask works for everyone, but this has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> My backup mask - VERY comfortable (if you move around)</li>
            <li> This mask is a nightmare to use. It defeats the purpose of having a c-pap machine in the first place by no allowing a good nights&#x27; sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it brief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask design is flawed. The design causes the mask to slide up the bridge of your nose during the night waking you up numerous times with leaks and air blowing out into the eye area and out the sides. It just gets to the point after about five hours were you can&#x27;t fall into a deep enough sleep to stay asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is not to buy it.</li>
            <li> My therapist told me I wouldn&#x27;t like this mask, even though I was having seepage issues with the very similar Quattro model.  I should have listened to her.  I cannot get this mask to stop leaking!  No matter how tightly I adjust the headgear, I always wake up with air squealing around the cushion.  Additionally, the upper straps rest on my bottom eyelids and make for a very uncomfortable fit.  After three nights, I&#x27;ve scrapped this mask and gone back to my Quattro.</li>
            <li> I used the Mirage Quattro (with the forehead brace) mask for 4 years.  While that mask works great, it leaves a mark on my forehead even though I fitted it with padding (covered it with headband material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would try the Quattro FX to see if it would fit my needs better.  Although I&#x27;ve only used it a week now, I would have to say that I&#x27;m VERY happy with the product.  An added benefit to this mask is that my wife says that she doesn&#x27;t even hear this mask at all (the Quattro is very quiet, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that the key to a good fit and a NON-LEAKING full face mask is to use some type of cotton mask liner.  By using one, it creates a GREAT seal that without it you just cannot achieve.  I started out using the RemZzz product.  They work well, but they stretch a lot so sometimes they stretch so far that the seal is broken during the night.  They are made of VERY thin cotton, so I had to replace the product each night.  Lucky for me, my wife knows how to use a sewing machine.  She has created cotton liners that are about 3-4 times as thick as the RemZzzs and she stitches around the edge and the nose hole so that it doesn&#x27;t stretch out.  I can hand wash it once a week and each one lasts me about 3 months!  I&#x27;d have her sell them, but they last so long there probably wouldn&#x27;t be a profit.  Just a suggestion for everyone who has someone that is handy with a sewing machine:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, be sure to tighten the lower straps sufficiently so that the cotton liner doesn&#x27;t slip down your face during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line....I extremely happy with this mask/design so far.  If my opinion changes after a longer test-ride, I&#x27;ll update my findings.</li>
            <li> This is the best that I have used for treating sleep apnea.  Finally I&#x27;m not tired anymore.  If you are a back sleeper I would recommend you try this.  If you are just starting to use a machine, try putting just the mask on for a few minutes at a time while watching tv or reading to get used to wearing it.  Don&#x27;t give up!!!</li>
            <li> worst mask ever.  very uncomfortable.  poor seal.  in order to use it you must pull it very tight or it hisses.  when it is that tight, it hurts.  worst mask ever.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Description says &amp;#34;no headgear&amp;#34;, but I received frame, cushion, headgear, and clips! The headgear that I ordered separately didn&#x27;t even come with clips. This was a much better value than ordering any two of the four components separately. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My first review was not a good one,  because I had not received by the date promised. I blamed the company instead of the postal service.  I was asked to write a review for something I did not have. I received this the next day. I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because I have used it and love it, It is much more quieter then the full face mask with the forehead piece. I was not getting a full nights sleep because the forehead piece would snap loose and air would leak, I would wake to fix and adjust.  I&#x27;m a stomach or side sleeper and this Quattro FX full face mask works great for me it doesn&#x27;t leak air like the others I have tried. I read the reviews from others and I did not buy the headgear even though it says no headgear  some said they received theirs with a headgear. I was able to use the headgear from my full face mask. I was using..</li>
            <li> My fit is somewhere between the Quattro FX (S) and the Quattro FX (S) for Her. Unfortunately, there is no in-between size. I need the length of the FX, but the bridge of the nose is too wide and blows air into my eyes. There is no adjustment for this. When I rigged it with tissue and medical tape (while waiting for an appointment to get a refit), it worked great. I slept like a baby. When I switched to the For Her, the nose bridge fit well but the frame was too short. When I moved my jaw in the night, the seal popped and woke me up. I also didn&#x27;t seem to get the airflow that I had with the larger model. Unfortunately, I had to exchange my rigged model for the smaller version, and they threw it away! Gah! If they were going to do that, I could have kept it for a back-up. Love the CPap, but the face mask fit is a pain. Nasal pillows didn&#x27;t work for me, because I open my mouth occasionally, which breaks the airflow and wakes me up.</li>
            <li> This mask is pretty good, however, requires some more care than others, the sillicon cushion is comfortable the first two hours, then you need to clean it or tight more the mask, cause it will leak... also when you follow all the instrucctions, reviews and youtube videos on how to wear it, it fits perfectly, but 2 hours later is pulling up on your face and then comes the air leak..  I like the mask, its easy to wear and for the two or 3 first hours its magic, comfortable and reliable, when I used to have other mask from respironics the comfort full 2, it was more like wearing a helmet... it is nor comfortable but the mask stays the whole night... I guess i havent found the perfect one for me... Ill keep searching.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my buddy told me that a cpap machine would make all the difference in my energy level.  I bought the cpap and then looked for a mask that would fit and allow me to rest comfortably.  The ResMed Quattro really provided a great fit.  It is extremely comfortable and vents to allow you to exhale normally, which was not the case with the nasal pillows that i tried first.  This mask is well constructed, washable and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It did take a bit to get used to how it moves but overall so much better than my last mask which fit all of the way up to your forehead. I like that it is smaller, lighter weight and i have fewer iindentations on my face in the morning!</li>
            <li> This mask fit better than the one for women.  It is made better for fuller, round shape face.  Really like it.</li>
            <li> overpriced , a first for me from Amazon,this a case where eve one one has the same Phillips product , shop some more.</li>
            <li> I ordered a medium and got a small. It works horribly and ended up being a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> It is one of the most comfortable mask I have used. For some reason, still have not gotten 100% used to it, but plan to keep trying as there is no forehead pressure.</li>
            <li> works great, better than old headgear style mask.</li>
            <li> The mask has leaks and doesn&#x27;t  fit very well, so I spoke to the company that it came from and they agreed to take it back , and was very nice about it.  It is the bone structure of my face that is off, and difficult to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;San Jose Nova65</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost an year and it totally changed my life. I can now enjoy sleeping much better than before.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his old mask that was about 15 years old.  He says it is a much more comfortable fit and the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; headgear that came with it is so much easier to adjust than the old one.  It&#x27;s also much quieter than the old one as it disperses the outgoing air from breathing through several small holes rather than a single one like the old mask.  Wish we&#x27;d bought it sooner!</li>
            <li> Comfortable and smaller than previous one I used. I really like it and I was surprise about how well it fit to my face.</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong size and the staff were nothing shy of amazing, not tow toon accommodating! HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
