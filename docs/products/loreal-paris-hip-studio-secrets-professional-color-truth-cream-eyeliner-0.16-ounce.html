            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li>If Stila Smudge Pots are not on for a good price at the time you&#x27;re shopping, you&#x27;re not losing out by picking this liner up instead.</li>
            <li>Loreal is a good makeup.</li>
            <li>Design and quality are great, so far very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>All was OK, good seller</li>
            <li>I really liked the color, but like others have said, the brush isnt great for detailed lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this shade, but it took a couple of application to get true color.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with nice brush.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>i was able to line my eyes with that sexy cat look with no problem and it stayed put all day.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love the way it applies and looks.</li>
            <li>The gel like texture is really nice and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I do love the color and it wears well once applied.</li>
            <li>When I went to take it off that night, most of it had smeared away.</li>
            <li>If I had to do over, Id save my money and get something better.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Love the texture and easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and I love the texture.</li>
            <li>easy to apply</li>
            <li>Makes very bold lines.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick, no complaints there.</li>
            <li>But the eyeliner and its pot were in fine shape.</li>
            <li>For the price is extraordinary!</li>
            <li>I notice a huge finger print on the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the shadow crumbles when I try to apply it instead of a smooth application.</li>
            <li>All in all much better than other eye liners and a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s intense color that lasts all day, what more could a girl want in an eyeliner?</li>
            <li>good product, last forever.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure there are better cream eyeliners out there, however, I probably got all 4 L&#x27;Oreal cream eyeliners I have for the same price as one of the nicer ones.</li>
            <li>Yes, arrive quickly.  </li>
            <li>very pretty color though.  </li>
            <li>this was gentle, easy to use,</li>
            <li>the little slanted brush is great.  </li>
            <li>I already own several Stila Smudge Pots, including one in Cobalt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still worth the price, though.</li>
            <li>Definitely use your own.  </li>
            <li>just right consistency, no smudging.  </li>
            <li>Good colors but largely dark.</li>
            <li>Good idea -- the thick paste and fairly precise applicator.</li>
            <li>The brush is kinda rough on my eyelids, so I bough a new one, but the gel is very nice and stays the whole day.</li>
            <li>definitely buying this one in brown too! :)</li>
            <li>I honestly love navy blue eyeliner on my brown eyes it stands them out</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It also required a bit more product to get the same results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really cant disinfect it since this is a cream product!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have to keep applying more and more layers to try and get a rich dark blue, and even then I end up going over it with another eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Im pretty good at them usually.</li>
            <li>was easy to remove with my regular creamy face wash.  </li>
            <li>The eyeliner is great, the colour is dark blue , yet not too drak ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the waterline and stays on all day, but also very hard to take off of the waterline</li>
            <li>The blue itself is beautiful, just the right amount of lightness/darkness to be seen and noticed, but not overly flashy or cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>It glides on really well.</li>
            <li>THE COLOR IS SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE PICTURES.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented, creamy as a dream and apply spectaculary.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box I noticed the packaging of the product - the jar and lid - are absolutely identical to Stila Smudge Pots.</li>
            <li>dries up to fast and have to toss out before its all used up...</li>
            <li>it goes on really close&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it dried up after sometime but a nice product afterall</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll save you some money and you&#x27;ll wind up with pretty much exactly the same product.</li>
            <li>I like this because while its still wet , you can clean up (if you apply too much ) or make adjustments ..</li>
            <li>I think it is a little dry, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing for gel eye liner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also exactly the same shade on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s too scratchy to use anywhere around my eye.</li>
            <li>i have extremely sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>wow wasnt expecting the color to make my eyes pop</li>
            <li>When I opened the lid, much to my amazement, even the *product* looked the same!</li>
            <li>your eyelashes and looks so natural.. not</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this liner because it gets dry very fast and comes out in patches and you can not use this liner on water line......waste of money.</li>
            <li>it is so harsh and it hurts to actually use it to apply on your lid , other than that it is quite good ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy other colors after my positive experience with this one.</li>
            <li>but I use my own brush as I found this brush to be somewhat difficult.</li>
            <li>I have brown eyes and thought the dark blue would really pop.</li>

            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> creamy, pretty color pigment, but it flakes on me, even though i only had on a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products , and either had itchy eyelids ( using the maybeline especially ) or by lunch no sign of the liner I put on .&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> The brush is a little wide to obtain a smooth, thin line.</li>
            <li> I bought the dark blue eyeliner because it was on sale</li>
            <li> Does just as well as more very expensive products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only difference I can notice are almost indistinguishable little flecks of silver in it.</li>
            <li> All over my face were little blue flakes.</li>
            <li> so just be careful with that.</li>
            <li> Luckily this wasnt expensive otherwise it would be totally not worth it.</li>
            <li> This cream eyeliner is pretty mediocre compared to the e.l.f.</li>
            <li> The little brush it comes with sux its all rough like wire and</li>
            <li> so used this eyeliner on my eyes instead of brown black.</li>
            <li> This is much less pigmented, and has an almost too thin/creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li> One small thing in an otherwise good order - the box that holds the product (meaning L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s box) was in terrible shape.  </li>
            <li> , my only complaint and the reason I took one star out is the applicator which is really not appropriate ,  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Yet the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is a little thick.</li>
            <li> Hard to get off immediately -- dries hard and won&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> Use cooking oil to get it off &amp; rub hard.</li>
            <li> Am I just using this wrong or what?</li>
            <li> The brush is terrible, a total throwaway.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Right away the color was flaking off into my eyes and got under my contacts which was quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but sadly is quite disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Like the dog got a hold of it bad.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars for these bad boys, all the way!</li>

            <li> I just used this eyeliner again last night. I like it. I was wearing navy blue so used this eyeliner on my eyes instead of brown black. It glides on really well. I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars for the price and how it works but I am sure there are better cream eyeliners out there, however, I probably got all 4 L&#x27;Oreal cream eyeliners I have for the same price as one of the nicer ones. I also have this in brown, teal, and eggplant.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT AND IT CAME SOONER THAN I THOUGHT. THE COLOR IS SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE PICTURES. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> its a nice eyeliner but it dried up after sometime but a nice product afterall</li>
            <li> I bought the Midnight blue to help off set the redness of my eyes from allergies. The plan was to use it for my waterline. I&#x27;m going to try to soften the bristles on the angle brush but so far it&#x27;s too scratchy to use anywhere around my eye. Also, the shadow crumbles when I try to apply it instead of a smooth application. Am I just using this wrong or what? Hopefully I can figure out a way to make it work for me</li>
            <li> this eyeliner works great.  i have extremely sensitive eyes.  this was gentle, easy to use, just right consistency, no smudging.  i was able to line my eyes with that sexy cat look with no problem and it stayed put all day.  was easy to remove with my regular creamy face wash.  the little slanted brush is great.  i purchased the deep blue, and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. It goes on smooth and I love the texture. Fast shipment. I would recommend this. Thank you.</li>
            <li> wow wasnt expecting the color to make my eyes pop but it did. was very easy to use! definitely buying this one in brown too! :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this liner because it gets dry very fast and comes out in patches and you can not use this liner on water line......waste of money.</li>
            <li> I honestly love navy blue eyeliner on my brown eyes it stands them out this is beautiful beautiful! For the price is extraordinary! Fast shipment and it&#x27;s bigger then I accept it and yes I def recommend it! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous. The brush is kinda rough on my eyelids, so I bough a new one, but the gel is very nice and stays the whole day. I think it is a little dry, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing for gel eye liner. Very big container. It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great color. Easy to apply with nice brush. I love the way it applies and looks. Lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> One small thing in an otherwise good order - the box that holds the product (meaning L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s box) was in terrible shape.  Like the dog got a hold of it bad.  But the eyeliner and its pot were in fine shape.</li>
            <li> Love the color, application is a bit difficult but that may just be me. The gel like texture is really nice and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> easy to apply but I use my own brush as I found this brush to be somewhat difficult. would buy this again in a different color.</li>
            <li> I found that this was to gloopy for me.  I am used to a powder liner.  I may just not of applied correctly.  I do love the color and it wears well once applied.</li>
            <li> Yes, arrive quickly.  The price is great.  Excellent product.  Don&#x27;t smuge, beautiful colour.  Recommend to anyone to purchase this.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The little brush it comes with sux its all rough like wire and the eyeline its self clumps up when ur trying to put it on</li>
            <li> creamy, pretty color pigment, but it flakes on me, even though i only had on a thin layer.  very pretty color though.  i am bummed, so hoping to find the one eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I already own several Stila Smudge Pots, including one in Cobalt. They are very pigmented, creamy as a dream and apply spectaculary. I was looking for another blue gel liner that was a bit of a different blue shade from Stila&#x27;s Cobalt so decided to try this Loreal Hip liner in Midnight Blue, along with another in Eggplant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the item very quickly, great stuff. When I opened the box I noticed the packaging of the product - the jar and lid - are absolutely identical to Stila Smudge Pots. When I opened the lid, much to my amazement, even the *product* looked the same! Same shade, same texture, even the same level of product in the container. WTH? So I dipped my angled liner brush in and applied. This Loreal HIP liner is just as creamy and pigmented as my Stila Smudge Pot in Cobalt! It&#x27;s also exactly the same shade on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference I can notice are almost indistinguishable little flecks of silver in it. It&#x27;s not noticeable in the jar or when applied, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is worth every penny. If Stila Smudge Pots are not on for a good price at the time you&#x27;re shopping, you&#x27;re not losing out by picking this liner up instead. It&#x27;ll save you some money and you&#x27;ll wind up with pretty much exactly the same product. Keep in mind, however, that all shades of these HIP liners may not be the same in terms of pigmentation and texture. I found the Eggplant shade not quite as pigmented as this one. It also required a bit more product to get the same results. It&#x27;s still worth the price, though. Especially with the massive amount you get in the jar. I would sooner buy these HIP liners than any MAC cream liner any day of the week. 5 stars for these bad boys, all the way!</li>
            <li> Good idea -- the thick paste and fairly precise applicator. Good colors but largely dark. Makes very bold lines. Hard to get off immediately -- dries hard and won&#x27;t run. Use cooking oil to get it off &amp; rub hard. All in all much better than other eye liners and a good price.</li>
            <li> dries up to fast and have to toss out before its all used up...</li>
            <li> All was OK, good seller</li>
            <li> It stays all day and doesn&#x27;t come out, even when you&#x27;re exercising! It&#x27;s esay to use with the brush, though you have to get used to it. The color is awesome. But it&#x27;s great! I would definetaly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have tried other products , and either had itchy eyelids ( using the maybeline especially ) or by lunch no sign of the liner I put on .&lt;br /&gt;Once it dries it&#x27;s on. I like this because while its still wet , you can clean up (if you apply too much ) or make adjustments ..</li>
            <li> This cream eyeliner is pretty mediocre compared to the e.l.f. I purchased on the same day.  This is much less pigmented, and has an almost too thin/creamy consistency.  I have to keep applying more and more layers to try and get a rich dark blue, and even then I end up going over it with another eyeliner.  The brush is terrible, a total throwaway.  Definitely use your own.  The blue itself is beautiful, just the right amount of lightness/darkness to be seen and noticed, but not overly flashy or cheap looking.  My husband loves the shade.  Even though I have lots left, I&#x27;m giving up on this and going to purchase e.l.f. instead.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick, no complaints there. There was a sticker on the package that said 50% off, kinda makes me wonder where the seller got the product from??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product looks like it will be great...but sadly is quite disappointing.  I have brown eyes and thought the dark blue would really pop. I really liked the color, but like others have said, the brush isnt great for detailed lines. I tried doing a cat eye with the brush and they were not even. Im pretty good at them usually. Def not something I&#x27;d use for a work day when I dont have time to stand there and make it look right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away the color was flaking off into my eyes and got under my contacts which was quite uncomfortable. I left it on for maybe 5 hours just out shopping. No sweating or humidity. When I went to take it off that night, most of it had smeared away. All over my face were little blue flakes. I have found using baby wipes takes most makeup off wonderfully but this required some scrubbing and even some makeup remover. Luckily this wasnt expensive otherwise it would be totally not worth it. If I had to do over, Id save my money and get something better.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and once I opened the eyeliner I notice a huge finger print on the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really cant disinfect it since this is a cream product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of eyeliner and I&#x27;m a clutz at applying it..&lt;br /&gt;this has an applicator brush that is awesome.. it goes on really close&lt;br /&gt;to your eyelashes and looks so natural.. not a big obvious line!&lt;br /&gt;It does not bleed or rub off.. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the dark blue eyeliner because it was on sale and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;m going to buy other colors after my positive experience with this one. It&#x27;s great for the waterline and stays on all day, but also very hard to take off of the waterline so just be careful with that. It also stays on all day for the lid. It&#x27;s intense color that lasts all day, what more could a girl want in an eyeliner?</li>
            <li> The brush is a little wide to obtain a smooth, thin line. The color is fantastic! Yet the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is a little thick. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this it is awesome.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is great, the colour is dark blue , yet not too drak .. I am NC 30 and this colour is perfect on me .. staying power is very good too , my only complaint and the reason I took one star out is the applicator which is really not appropriate ,  it is so harsh and it hurts to actually use it to apply on your lid , other than that it is quite good .. I think I have to get another eyeliner brush..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this shade, but it took a couple of application to get true color.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and easy to put on.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> good product, last forever.  Loreal is a good makeup. Does just as well as more very expensive products. It stays on all day.</li>
            <li> very good benefit/price ratio excellent deal good product. Design and quality are great, so far very happy with my purchase.</li>
