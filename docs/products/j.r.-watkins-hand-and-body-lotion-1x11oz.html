            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The bottle I received did not have the pump top (which isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but I was kind of excited about having the pump top!).</li>
            <li>Love this smell -</li>
            <li>Finished one bottle and just purchased 4 bottles to make sure i don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and after 3 days it&#x27;s mostly gone.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Thicker than most hand/body lotions.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the watery consistency most of them do.  </li>
            <li>Next best thing I&#x27;ve found to an Rx.</li>
            <li>This lotion works perfect for my needs, dry hands in the winter.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>Love the fresh fragrance too and the fact that there are no chemicals / mineral oils etc.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good natural moisturizer for my face and found this one.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this (bought a trial pack at Target before buying the full size here)</li>
            <li>It has a very creamy feeling that I love.</li>
            <li>Just knowing its all natural and chemical.free:)</li>
            <li>I purchased the lavender thinking it would be the most natural scent (I don&#x27;t care to smell like a lemon cupcake).  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, exactly as described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>And it goes on easily leaving your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>all slickery &amp; the smell of the aloe &amp; green tea is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It was a little bottle and the price was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I love their products, and especially their hand creams.  </li>
            <li>I first found one in a store on the mainland, then moved to Hawaii</li>
            <li>It definitely was not the light sweet smelling scent I am used to purchasing.</li>
            <li>For a natural lotion, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>While it isn&#x27;t as cheap as say, Aveeno, it&#x27;s still pretty cheap compared to the other &#x27;natural&#x27; and &#x27;fancy&#x27; brands, and you get a large amount of the product.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle, pleasing fragrance that is a delight to the senses.  </li>
            <li>Even Burts Bees didn&#x27;t work or just felt very greasy.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy and moisturizes my face without making it feel oily.</li>
            <li>They mostly use natural ingredients  that actually work.  </li>
            <li>I usually like scent free creams but this scent is light and pleasing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as my favorite high dollar brand which I only found out about when a had a temporary serious skin rash, but at about 94 cents an ounce compared to $85.00 dollars an ounce, Watkins is the only way to go for me!</li>
            <li>I would recommend Goe oil instead, much pricier, but long lasting and a better scent that wears off.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>The lavender smell is very musky and masculine.</li>
            <li>Lotion smelled old and very nutty.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, a little goes a long way and it makes my skin feel so soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Not for people averse to heavy or strong perfumes (this is not 100% natural, by the way).</li>
            <li>I keep it by my kitchen sink and it keeps my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>I use it for shaving sensitive areas and I get no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>96% natural ingredients or close to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also natural and has no harmful ingredients, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not suggested for use on sensitive skin, it burned on contact and my skin became red where I&#x27;d used it.</li>
            <li>Actually, it&#x27;s quite thick and doesn&#x27;t rub into the skin easily.  </li>
            <li>I pay a little bit extra now to have them shipped but find it worth the money.</li>

            <li> The smell of the body creams are awesome and they make your body soft.Just knowing its all natural and chemical.free:)</li>
            <li> I like the lemon lotion Watkins makes, but I prefer this one.  It has a gentle, pleasing fragrance that is a delight to the senses.  And it goes on easily leaving your skin feeling soft.  I&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion! I&#x27;m thinking about buying the lemon and mango. Its natural ingredients and smell is perfect. And its amount is more than generous.</li>
            <li> I love their products, and especially their hand creams.  They mostly use natural ingredients  that actually work.  The fragrance is light and fresh.  I keep it by my kitchen sink and it keeps my hands soft.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it for shaving sensitive areas and I get no irritation at all.  Also works wonderfully as a moisturizer, nice and smooth and rich.  Love the fresh fragrance too and the fact that there are no chemicals / mineral oils etc.  Wouldnt be without it.</li>
            <li> Great product and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t always find this at Target, so it&#x27;s great to be able to snag it on Amazon. The bottle I received did not have the pump top (which isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but I was kind of excited about having the pump top!). Otherwise, exactly as described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this smell - we use it in our guest bathroom paired with the hand soap.  I have a feeling it&#x27;s going to last forever - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Effective product for itching.  Instant relief.  With continued application the skin problem ends.  Finished one bottle and just purchased 4 bottles to make sure i don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion at the airport when I realized I had not taken any.  It was a little bottle and the price was pretty good.  On using it I loved the scent right away and the cream was perfect.  It leaves a little sticky surface but after rubbing it in and letting it set it made my hands soft and not dry.  I&#x27;ll buy this one again!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite lotion! I&#x27;ve sent it to family and friends and they love it too!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and leaves skin soft. Great product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use regular store bought lotion. They always make me break out or don&#x27;t work. Even Burts Bees didn&#x27;t work or just felt very greasy. The stuff that DID work for me was far too expensive and you didn&#x27;t get much of the product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this (bought a trial pack at Target before buying the full size here) and I love it! I have eczema and after 3 days it&#x27;s mostly gone. It smells nice, a little goes a long way and it makes my skin feel so soft without being greasy. While it isn&#x27;t as cheap as say, Aveeno, it&#x27;s still pretty cheap compared to the other &#x27;natural&#x27; and &#x27;fancy&#x27; brands, and you get a large amount of the product. It&#x27;s also natural and has no harmful ingredients, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great and I&#x27;m already placing another order.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy. It has a very creamy feeling that I love. My skin always feels moist and plump  after I use it.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  Thicker than most hand/body lotions.  Does a great job of moisturizing.  Have stocked up for the coming winter!</li>
            <li> I purchased the lavender thinking it would be the most natural scent (I don&#x27;t care to smell like a lemon cupcake).  For a natural lotion, it&#x27;s not bad. It doesn&#x27;t have the watery consistency most of them do.  Actually, it&#x27;s quite thick and doesn&#x27;t rub into the skin easily.  I have dry skin and it moisturizes for a few hours, not the whole day.  The lavender smell is very musky and masculine. It unfortunately lasts the entire day.  I would recommend Goe oil instead, much pricier, but long lasting and a better scent that wears off.</li>
            <li> This has been the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever come across. I first found one in a store on the mainland, then moved to Hawaii and I can&#x27;t find a store that sells it. I pay a little bit extra now to have them shipped but find it worth the money. The cream is thick, not watery. 96% natural ingredients or close to it. I use it as a total body moisturizer, aftershave cream, and after burn cream from sunburn.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin all slickery &amp; the smell of the aloe &amp; green tea is pleasant. Could be considered unisexual. I didn&#x27;t get a pump, so I&#x27;ve got to store the bottle upside down, then tap it on the counter a couple of times to get it out, yet it doesn&#x27;t feel thick either. Keeps my psoriasis from itching &amp; drying out. Next best thing I&#x27;ve found to an Rx.</li>
            <li> Lotion smelled old and very nutty. It definitely was not the light sweet smelling scent I am used to purchasing. I want a refund.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good natural moisturizer for my face and found this one. It is very creamy and moisturizes my face without making it feel oily. I usually like scent free creams but this scent is light and pleasing. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion works perfect for my needs, dry hands in the winter. It takes a little rubbing to work it in&lt;br /&gt;to my hands but that doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit. It&#x27;s not as good as my favorite high dollar brand which I only found out about when a had a temporary serious skin rash, but at about 94 cents an ounce compared to $85.00 dollars an ounce, Watkins is the only way to go for me!</li>
            <li> SMELLS very strong -- an acrid, chemical, and flowery scent. Not for people averse to heavy or strong perfumes (this is not 100% natural, by the way). Not suggested for use on sensitive skin, it burned on contact and my skin became red where I&#x27;d used it.</li>
