            <li>This is a good nighttime cream.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for good night cream and stumbled upon this in the store a couple of years ago</li>
            <li>the price is good.  </li>

            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>After a month I can see an amazing complexion.</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t break me out, and my skin is looking AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, creamy, non-greasy night cream.  </li>
            <li>it is just nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>Aside from that it&#x27;s a nice night cream for the price.</li>
            <li>it absorbs nicely</li>
            <li>I have always liked the Palmers products.</li>
            <li>Nice vitamin e smell.</li>
            <li>Would liked to have smelled the cocao butter</li>
            <li>Nice cream, haven&#x27;t seen any &amp;#34;renewal&amp;#34; properties.</li>
            <li>but goes on nice and light, makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li>I found this cream to be somewhat chalky and it seemed to tighten skin but not in a good way; more like a drying sensation.</li>
            <li>It acts as a moisturizer and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it!!</li>
            <li>It is rich and makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced, has a pleasant smell, and is not greasy!  </li>
            <li>Especially effective on the sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The weight and feel of it is incredible, but the smell can be really overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightweight--feels silky smooth--really pleasant smell, not at all medicinal--plus a SUPER AFFORDABLE price point.  </li>
            <li>A very pleasant non-greasy night cream that leaves skin as soft and lustrous as Clinique and Olay products that cost much more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I think I need a cream that&#x27;s more moisturizering.</li>
            <li>:),</li>
            <li>You may have better results</li>
            <li>I really love this product also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>This is my fourth jar and I am so impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>I apply it mostly on my neck because I have a separate retinol product on my face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>As with Palmer&#x27;s day time moisturizer, this one is my favorite of all I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love this night creme.</li>
            <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s products and have never had a problem with any, until now.</li>
            <li>Ok product like oil of olay better.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Within a week I noticed a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I like this product better than Revlon products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The best thing was that the next day there was no need to apply additional lotion/moisturizer as it penetrated my skin that well.</li>
            <li>This night cream is my favorite for 3 reasons: performance, price, and Peta-approval.</li>
            <li>I have used many, many, many products over the years; this performs as well as any and better than most.</li>
            <li>My favorite night cream.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of the night cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this Night renewal cream.</li>
            <li>I love their products so</li>
            <li>- I am subscribed to auto-ship to stay stocked at all times :)</li>
            <li>I Love it...</li>
            <li>I love.  </li>
            <li>I love it and reccomend this brand.</li>
            <li>and I love how my skin feels after use.  </li>
            <li>the scrub is to die for! :)</li>
            <li>I just love this moisturiser.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent night cream and does actually work.</li>
            <li>This feels like candle wax on your skin, so I dont get the indication that it is sinking in, just laying on top.</li>
            <li>so it does not bother me any more :)</li>
            <li>I know that I will be ordering more of Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>and I am totally satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this night cream  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face moisturized at night and gives me a healthy glow in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is an ok night cream.</li>
            <li>not as spectacular as the reviews...but not bad either.</li>
            <li>When applied per the directions, I noticed a significant change in the way my skin looked almost immediately!  </li>
            <li>In dry weather, this cream is awesome.</li>
            <li>Wonderful light scent, creamy enough to know it&#x27;s moisturizing, but not overly greasy.</li>
            <li>This stuff immediately gives me&lt;br /&gt;much needed moisture, smooth, lovely feeling.  </li>
            <li>Its great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it really does a good job on my face.  </li>
            <li>The price is right &amp; it is a nice cream.</li>
            <li>The product was wonderfully moisturizing though, so for a person with dry and less acne-prone skin it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use these on other parts of the body, but perhaps &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; is not the best solution for my face.</li>
            <li>But it does feel lovely and rich bit not greasy.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is super luxurious!</li>
            <li>I noticed that my neck becomes firmer and smooth</li>
            <li>It lets the smooth face.</li>
            <li>but if you light you might not.  </li>
            <li>A smooth feeling after one use.</li>
            <li>It truly makes your skin feel smooth and eliminates any dryness.</li>
            <li>product is very creamy and absorbs nicely in my skin also</li>
            <li>the cream has a light scent.</li>
            <li>but I thought it would be good to use it early as a prevarication method.</li>
            <li>but then my skin was becoming more soft and healthy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never tried Palmer&#x27;s night cream, and was looking for something that was budget friendly.  </li>
            <li>I am past 40 and always looking out for some excellent night cremes for my face.</li>
            <li>I like the rich cream, but it&#x27;s not too oily.  </li>
            <li>I like it because I can still feel my pores breathing after applying it as it is super light.</li>
            <li>My skin just isn&#x27;t a good fit for their facial products.</li>
            <li>This cream is thick and rich and wonderful!!!  </li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles I can certainly see a change in the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell too and I am very sensitive to most perfumes.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and nice.</li>
            <li>The best and least exspensive night cream.  </li>
            <li>I love the body lotion so much and needed something to moisturize my face.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, has a light, pleasant scent that fades quickly, and does not affect my sensitive skin or cause break outs (so far).</li>
            <li>, it is offers good hydration for dry skin during the night, smell&#x27;s nice and since it is very good for acne prone skin, you would think it is heavy and might clog pores</li>
            <li>But once you put on your skin it quickly settle into your skin.</li>
            <li>I got my purchase quick.</li>
            <li>I will say that the product has a great smell to it and is very relaxing and definitely softened my face to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Not too greasy and absorbes quickly.</li>
            <li>This dries quickly, and&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It is really moisturizing, the smell is meh (not my favorite, but not unusable) but the price is right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product for people with dry skin like me or just becuase your worried about wrinkles, I give this product two thumbs up!!!!</li>
            <li>VERY INEXPENSIVE TOO!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not mad about it.</li>
            <li>(lucky right?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it is helping reduce fine lines and/or wrinkles so</li>
            <li>I wish this had worked for me, as I love the soft scent and absorbent quality.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin lovely and soft, if you can put up with the rotten smell.</li>
            <li>But not 2 hours later my face and neck started to feel warm.</li>
            <li>This night cream is by far my favorite when it comes to moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to get this at our local drugstore and was excited to find it on Amazon when they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>Had to rehome it pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice heavy cream night renewal or use anytime.  </li>
            <li>Not unpleasant, but not my first preference either.  </li>
            <li>Just right for my skin.  </li>
            <li>The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li>It is silky, cool, and very luxurious.  </li>
            <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s skincare line and face line in general.</li>
            <li>and I live in a dry climate I always look for a better moisturizer but for my face this just created many problems that took about 2 months to overcome.  </li>
            <li>and like it very much.</li>
            <li>I had my first baby and did not get stretch marks (used the Palmers creme in a jar) on my stomach every day.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a fluke, and stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>When looking for a face cream, the first question to answer is, &amp;#34;Does</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh and ready for bed in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is light and soaks into my skin and leaves me feeling really soft and supple.</li>
            <li>and I find I wake up with smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this and it leaves my skin feeling soft at night and smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li>Makes my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s,Oil of Olay,and french creams are a must for healthy exterior maintenance.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work out!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This cream moisturize my dry skin very well overnight that it just feels amazing every morning.</li>
            <li>Not quite moisturizing enough for my very dry skin, but will work great in the summer months.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I see a real reduction in lines and wrinkles, but I think overall my skin is in much better condition since I have started using the Palmer&#x27;s skin products.</li>
            <li>Forget the choco sweet smell of Palmers, this stuff smells like old lady&#x27;s cupboards, makes me gag.</li>
            <li>I used this as a daily moisturizer during our very dry winter months and it works wonderfully to keep dry skin in check.  </li>
            <li>use it AM and PM for extra fine skin</li>
            <li>Probably fine for someone younger, I am 59 , with combo skin.</li>
            <li>Smells a little bit like an old lady perfume, but it does a good job moisturizing</li>
            <li>Really did not like it at all.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream</li>
            <li>My face seem much clearer and smoother...</li>
            <li>It is really making my face and neck look smoother.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizers the face and neck.</li>
            <li>one thing i really don&#x27;t like: the smell.</li>
            <li>It is a product that really helps my skin...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>&amp; I did not care for the product as much.  </li>
            <li>Wish it wasn&#x27;t available as an add on item only.</li>
            <li>and if you do not care much about how a product smells.</li>
            <li>This is also real value for money.</li>
            <li>For me, it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>heavy creme, nice smell</li>
            <li>At first I thought I had an allergic reaction to something I ate, But nothing I ate that day was new to my system.</li>
            <li>Love some of their other stuff though - just not this one.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product he has found that leaves his face feeling clean and moisturized without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I really like the Palmer&#x27;s Skin Therapy Oil for Face, and Palmer&#x27;s body lotion, so I had high hopes for this cream.</li>
            <li>It definitely matches the description of being &#x27;quick absorbing&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I purchased the full compliment of Palmer&#x27;s facial and body lotions and started using them.  </li>
            <li>Rich but clean and moisturizes very well; very little needed.  </li>
            <li>It look, feel and smell better than the previous cream I was using.</li>
            <li>The cream gets absorbed almost instantly and the skin feels very taut immediately.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all types of skin.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I will highly  recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend exfoliating with a scrub or brush so the natural vitamins in this product can really sink into the skin and leave you looking radiant in the morning.</li>
            <li>Not thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li>My normal routine is Obagi</li>
            <li>I washed my face immediately and applied my normal moisturizer, bringing some relief from the burning and itching</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this cream for normal or normal/oily skin types.</li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s nice and thick</li>
            <li>Love the body lotion skin therapy for dry skin but will never use the facial products.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive with both dry and oily patches and I wake up with an all-over smooth face.  </li>
            <li>My face does have a pleasant little glow the next morning, but I&#x27;d like to try the regular lotion instead.</li>
            <li>Been using this for about two months now, and my skin is feeling vibrant and soft.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface, it penetrates the skin leaving it very soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My usual brand was Olay Night Cream, Palmers is better.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for hydrating night cream that will make your skin feel ridiculously soft, this is it!</li>
            <li>ive got other stuff that i like a lot better in or near the same price range.</li>
            <li>It leave my face very soft and clear in the morning without botch look.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t relieve that slightly dry feeling my skin has right after washing.</li>
            <li>So far I am content.</li>
            <li>I decided to use the product because I seem to always have bags under my eyes and redness around my nose from extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>After overnight usage I didn&#x27;t wake to any break outs on my sensitive skin and the cocoa and shea butter fragrance was an added bonus.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li>Of course I use it at night, and have noticed how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Nearly forgot I ordered this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am prone to break outs.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or overly greasy.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>When I awake in the mornings and wash my face, it is so soft.</li>
            <li>It has faded old scars on my face, evened my skin tone and the crow&#x27;s feet that extended outward from my eyes have disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I will say it doesn&#x27;t do much for under the eye, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week</li>
            <li>And I live in Texas, where women really know about dry skin!</li>
            <li>However, as someone with dry skin, I expected the product to be much more thicker and longer lasting on the skin as it is supposed to be a &#x27;night&#x27; cream.</li>
            <li>I purchased another similar product used for the same purpose and the cost was higher</li>
            <li>My normal procedure is to apply the cream over my entire face, then I add some spot treatment under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>but it is harsh and full of chemicals</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable compared with other high priced products that serve the same purpose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m familiar with Palmer&#x27;s products usually having that cocoa smell.</li>
            <li>USED TO USE OIL OF OLAY AND NO OTHER PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to know if it really helps with wrinkles and scars.</li>
            <li>However  I only use at night because  it&#x27;s &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; kinda smells like old lady..  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, my face is always red and not matter which face cream I apply, I always get stung.</li>
            <li>This night cream is OK, but not great.</li>
            <li>This cream is thick and rich.</li>
            <li>At first the cream felt heavy</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s thick, it absorbs relatively quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize.</li>
            <li>Many other products also do this job, though, so there are a few other factors that set this cream apart:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wanted to venture out and try something less expensive but have never had good results.</li>

            <li> I loved the texture, the smell, the way it made my face and neck feel.</li>
            <li> This is a good nighttime cream.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for good night cream and stumbled upon this in the store a couple of years ago</li>
            <li> the price is good.  </li>
            <li> and it feels good on the face, but I still have not seen a difference after 4 weeks of using</li>

            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> After a month I can see an amazing complexion.</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t break me out, and my skin is looking AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, creamy, non-greasy night cream.  </li>
            <li> it is just nice and creamy.</li>
            <li> Aside from that it&#x27;s a nice night cream for the price.</li>
            <li> it absorbs nicely</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Palmers products.</li>
            <li> Nice vitamin e smell.</li>
            <li> Would liked to have smelled the cocao butter</li>
            <li> Nice cream, haven&#x27;t seen any &amp;#34;renewal&amp;#34; properties.</li>
            <li> but goes on nice and light, makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li> I found this cream to be somewhat chalky and it seemed to tighten skin but not in a good way; more like a drying sensation.</li>
            <li> It acts as a moisturizer and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it!!</li>
            <li> It is rich and makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced, has a pleasant smell, and is not greasy!  </li>
            <li> Especially effective on the sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The weight and feel of it is incredible, but the smell can be really overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightweight--feels silky smooth--really pleasant smell, not at all medicinal--plus a SUPER AFFORDABLE price point.  </li>
            <li> A very pleasant non-greasy night cream that leaves skin as soft and lustrous as Clinique and Olay products that cost much more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I think I need a cream that&#x27;s more moisturizering.</li>
            <li> :),</li>
            <li> You may have better results</li>
            <li> I really love this product also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth jar and I am so impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I apply it mostly on my neck because I have a separate retinol product on my face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> As with Palmer&#x27;s day time moisturizer, this one is my favorite of all I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love this night creme.</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s products and have never had a problem with any, until now.</li>
            <li> Ok product like oil of olay better.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than Revlon products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The best thing was that the next day there was no need to apply additional lotion/moisturizer as it penetrated my skin that well.</li>
            <li> This night cream is my favorite for 3 reasons: performance, price, and Peta-approval.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many, many products over the years; this performs as well as any and better than most.</li>
            <li> My favorite night cream.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of the night cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this Night renewal cream.</li>
            <li> I love their products so</li>
            <li> - I am subscribed to auto-ship to stay stocked at all times :)</li>
            <li> I Love it...</li>
            <li> I love.  </li>
            <li> I love it and reccomend this brand.</li>
            <li> and I love how my skin feels after use.  </li>
            <li> the scrub is to die for! :)</li>
            <li> I just love this moisturiser.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent night cream and does actually work.</li>
            <li> This feels like candle wax on your skin, so I dont get the indication that it is sinking in, just laying on top.</li>
            <li> so it does not bother me any more :)</li>
            <li> I know that I will be ordering more of Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> and I am totally satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream  </li>
            <li> Keeps my face moisturized at night and gives me a healthy glow in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is an ok night cream.</li>
            <li> not as spectacular as the reviews...but not bad either.</li>
            <li> When applied per the directions, I noticed a significant change in the way my skin looked almost immediately!  </li>
            <li> In dry weather, this cream is awesome.</li>
            <li> Wonderful light scent, creamy enough to know it&#x27;s moisturizing, but not overly greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff immediately gives me&lt;br /&gt;much needed moisture, smooth, lovely feeling.  </li>
            <li> Its great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it really does a good job on my face.  </li>
            <li> The price is right &amp; it is a nice cream.</li>
            <li> The product was wonderfully moisturizing though, so for a person with dry and less acne-prone skin it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use these on other parts of the body, but perhaps &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; is not the best solution for my face.</li>
            <li> But it does feel lovely and rich bit not greasy.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is super luxurious!</li>
            <li> I noticed that my neck becomes firmer and smooth</li>
            <li> It lets the smooth face.</li>
            <li> but if you light you might not.  </li>
            <li> A smooth feeling after one use.</li>
            <li> It truly makes your skin feel smooth and eliminates any dryness.</li>
            <li> product is very creamy and absorbs nicely in my skin also</li>
            <li> the cream has a light scent.</li>
            <li> but I thought it would be good to use it early as a prevarication method.</li>
            <li> but then my skin was becoming more soft and healthy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried Palmer&#x27;s night cream, and was looking for something that was budget friendly.  </li>
            <li> I am past 40 and always looking out for some excellent night cremes for my face.</li>
            <li> I like the rich cream, but it&#x27;s not too oily.  </li>
            <li> I like it because I can still feel my pores breathing after applying it as it is super light.</li>
            <li> My skin just isn&#x27;t a good fit for their facial products.</li>
            <li> This cream is thick and rich and wonderful!!!  </li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles I can certainly see a change in the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell too and I am very sensitive to most perfumes.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and nice.</li>
            <li> The best and least exspensive night cream.  </li>
            <li> I love the body lotion so much and needed something to moisturize my face.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, has a light, pleasant scent that fades quickly, and does not affect my sensitive skin or cause break outs (so far).</li>
            <li> , it is offers good hydration for dry skin during the night, smell&#x27;s nice and since it is very good for acne prone skin, you would think it is heavy and might clog pores</li>
            <li> But once you put on your skin it quickly settle into your skin.</li>
            <li> I got my purchase quick.</li>
            <li> I will say that the product has a great smell to it and is very relaxing and definitely softened my face to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Not too greasy and absorbes quickly.</li>
            <li> This dries quickly, and&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It is really moisturizing, the smell is meh (not my favorite, but not unusable) but the price is right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product for people with dry skin like me or just becuase your worried about wrinkles, I give this product two thumbs up!!!!</li>
            <li> VERY INEXPENSIVE TOO!!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not mad about it.</li>
            <li> (lucky right?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if it is helping reduce fine lines and/or wrinkles so</li>
            <li> I wish this had worked for me, as I love the soft scent and absorbent quality.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin lovely and soft, if you can put up with the rotten smell.</li>
            <li> But not 2 hours later my face and neck started to feel warm.</li>
            <li> This night cream is by far my favorite when it comes to moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get this at our local drugstore and was excited to find it on Amazon when they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> Had to rehome it pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice heavy cream night renewal or use anytime.  </li>
            <li> Not unpleasant, but not my first preference either.  </li>
            <li> Just right for my skin.  </li>
            <li> The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li> It is silky, cool, and very luxurious.  </li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s skincare line and face line in general.</li>
            <li> and I live in a dry climate I always look for a better moisturizer but for my face this just created many problems that took about 2 months to overcome.  </li>
            <li> and like it very much.</li>
            <li> I had my first baby and did not get stretch marks (used the Palmers creme in a jar) on my stomach every day.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a fluke, and stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> When looking for a face cream, the first question to answer is, &amp;#34;Does</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh and ready for bed in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is light and soaks into my skin and leaves me feeling really soft and supple.</li>
            <li> and I find I wake up with smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this and it leaves my skin feeling soft at night and smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li> Makes my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s,Oil of Olay,and french creams are a must for healthy exterior maintenance.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work out!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This cream moisturize my dry skin very well overnight that it just feels amazing every morning.</li>
            <li> Not quite moisturizing enough for my very dry skin, but will work great in the summer months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I see a real reduction in lines and wrinkles, but I think overall my skin is in much better condition since I have started using the Palmer&#x27;s skin products.</li>
            <li> Forget the choco sweet smell of Palmers, this stuff smells like old lady&#x27;s cupboards, makes me gag.</li>
            <li> I used this as a daily moisturizer during our very dry winter months and it works wonderfully to keep dry skin in check.  </li>
            <li> use it AM and PM for extra fine skin</li>
            <li> Probably fine for someone younger, I am 59 , with combo skin.</li>
            <li> Smells a little bit like an old lady perfume, but it does a good job moisturizing</li>
            <li> Really did not like it at all.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cream</li>
            <li> My face seem much clearer and smoother...</li>
            <li> It is really making my face and neck look smoother.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizers the face and neck.</li>
            <li> one thing i really don&#x27;t like: the smell.</li>
            <li> It is a product that really helps my skin...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> &amp; I did not care for the product as much.  </li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t available as an add on item only.</li>
            <li> and if you do not care much about how a product smells.</li>
            <li> This is also real value for money.</li>
            <li> For me, it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> heavy creme, nice smell</li>
            <li> At first I thought I had an allergic reaction to something I ate, But nothing I ate that day was new to my system.</li>
            <li> Love some of their other stuff though - just not this one.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product he has found that leaves his face feeling clean and moisturized without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I really like the Palmer&#x27;s Skin Therapy Oil for Face, and Palmer&#x27;s body lotion, so I had high hopes for this cream.</li>
            <li> It definitely matches the description of being &#x27;quick absorbing&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I purchased the full compliment of Palmer&#x27;s facial and body lotions and started using them.  </li>
            <li> Rich but clean and moisturizes very well; very little needed.  </li>
            <li> It look, feel and smell better than the previous cream I was using.</li>
            <li> The cream gets absorbed almost instantly and the skin feels very taut immediately.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for all types of skin.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I will highly  recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend exfoliating with a scrub or brush so the natural vitamins in this product can really sink into the skin and leave you looking radiant in the morning.</li>
            <li> Not thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> My normal routine is Obagi</li>
            <li> I washed my face immediately and applied my normal moisturizer, bringing some relief from the burning and itching</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this cream for normal or normal/oily skin types.</li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s nice and thick</li>
            <li> Love the body lotion skin therapy for dry skin but will never use the facial products.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive with both dry and oily patches and I wake up with an all-over smooth face.  </li>
            <li> My face does have a pleasant little glow the next morning, but I&#x27;d like to try the regular lotion instead.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about two months now, and my skin is feeling vibrant and soft.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface, it penetrates the skin leaving it very soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My usual brand was Olay Night Cream, Palmers is better.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for hydrating night cream that will make your skin feel ridiculously soft, this is it!</li>
            <li> ive got other stuff that i like a lot better in or near the same price range.</li>
            <li> It leave my face very soft and clear in the morning without botch look.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t relieve that slightly dry feeling my skin has right after washing.</li>
            <li> So far I am content.</li>
            <li> I decided to use the product because I seem to always have bags under my eyes and redness around my nose from extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After overnight usage I didn&#x27;t wake to any break outs on my sensitive skin and the cocoa and shea butter fragrance was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li> Of course I use it at night, and have noticed how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Nearly forgot I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am prone to break outs.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or overly greasy.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> When I awake in the mornings and wash my face, it is so soft.</li>
            <li> It has faded old scars on my face, evened my skin tone and the crow&#x27;s feet that extended outward from my eyes have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I will say it doesn&#x27;t do much for under the eye, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week</li>
            <li> And I live in Texas, where women really know about dry skin!</li>
            <li> However, as someone with dry skin, I expected the product to be much more thicker and longer lasting on the skin as it is supposed to be a &#x27;night&#x27; cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased another similar product used for the same purpose and the cost was higher</li>
            <li> My normal procedure is to apply the cream over my entire face, then I add some spot treatment under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but it is harsh and full of chemicals</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable compared with other high priced products that serve the same purpose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m familiar with Palmer&#x27;s products usually having that cocoa smell.</li>
            <li> USED TO USE OIL OF OLAY AND NO OTHER PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to know if it really helps with wrinkles and scars.</li>
            <li> However  I only use at night because  it&#x27;s &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; kinda smells like old lady..  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, my face is always red and not matter which face cream I apply, I always get stung.</li>
            <li> This night cream is OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> This cream is thick and rich.</li>
            <li> At first the cream felt heavy</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s thick, it absorbs relatively quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Many other products also do this job, though, so there are a few other factors that set this cream apart:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wanted to venture out and try something less expensive but have never had good results.</li>
            <li> also have sensitive skin, and have not had any breakouts or other blemishes</li>
            <li> I live in high desert, cold temps &amp; hot temps.  </li>
            <li> I was previously using the 3 step Clinique products, well this is my new 3 steps.</li>
            <li> Keeping age away as long as possible, it&#x27;s helping</li>
            <li> I dont think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see improvment on wrinkles, but i dont plan on stopping it anytime soon!</li>
            <li> I gave this a full week every night and my skin looked worse than it had in years.</li>
            <li> It has a soft fragrance and after a few weeks of using it, I actually feel my skin tightening after it&#x27;s been on for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> and they say retinol takes a long time to see results.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who need a break from other facial product.</li>
            <li> I use this during the day and it works well doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like the oil did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but they all seem to leave my face feeling like sand paper, dry and cracking.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been four days and the blotches and bumps are gone, but I still have an extremely dry forehead.</li>
            <li> and it works alright by keeping my dry skin mosturized.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help my dry skin</li>
            <li> I wake up with dry skin on my forehead and cheeks</li>
            <li> (i do drink water before bed but still have dry skin)</li>
            <li> I tried several weeks later, and again broke into a rash after just  a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a new person, but my skin is noticeably brighter, smoother, and firmer.</li>
            <li> My skin usually isn&#x27;t that sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Other products that work can cost at least twice as much as this.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the Facial Cream and went ahead and purchased the Night Renewal Cream.</li>
            <li> so moisturized and since my skin is very dry</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> and she tried it a few nights and handed it back to me.</li>
            <li> I imagine this review will be cancelled so not much point.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduce in wrinkkes yet but its only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I definitely want to reorder and will recommended to all my friends that have an issue with uneven skin tone due to birth controll, sunlight, etc.</li>
            <li> As I had mentioned on the other palmer brand comments.</li>
            <li> This product caused extreme breakouts.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers when they say they can go without make-up after using this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Night Renewal Cream for about two weeks (every other night on average).  </li>
            <li> Simple cream, not too heavy and not a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> It does not have that typical chocolate-cocoa butter signature smell of other Palmers products.</li>
            <li> it is not too greasy and not too watered down.</li>
            <li> i replace my ovally with this after less then a month</li>
            <li> The wrinkles seem to be disappearing a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I find the natural cocoa butter very relaxing, and I have absolutely hated the smell of some face</li>
            <li> It was heavy and made me break out</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using the cream my skin seemingly feels softer.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this type of cream for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> My skin is quite dry from the cold, dry, winter weather, and this seems to be helping quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> so I think it made her face an oil slick.</li>
            <li> This is second one I&#x27;ve unfortunately found that does NOT smell like cocoa.</li>
            <li> It has an almost pasty texture that has a hard time sinking into my skin, like its a little too thick for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I am apply lotion at least 10 times a day to my forehead to fix what this product did to me.</li>
            <li> Mine was not creamy, but thick and paste like.</li>
            <li> Thick</li>
            <li> This however is not necessarily a good thing for me as my skins starts stretching and does not feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> When I buy this product I didnt know it has ingredients that are not good for you, so I stop using it .</li>
            <li> Dermatologist said these items are not good to use for acne, or to improve skin, I purchased a bunch of items that I threw out.</li>
            <li> I think it is extremely moisturizing and keeps my skin extremely hydrated!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick.</li>
            <li> Its very thick when you put it on</li>
            <li> &gt;  leaves no greasy film behind.</li>
            <li> so i purchased this item because I was told dry skin can cause wrinkles :(</li>
            <li> hardly any wrinkles!!)</li>
            <li> Sorry Palmers.</li>
            <li> It is truly a sad thing for me because their body lotion leaves my skin</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my face broke out in a rash after I used it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it also clogged my pores and after I used it just one night, I woke up with a breakout.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> but i think it smells bad :(  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the fragrance, I was expecting it to smell like cocoa butter</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed, I use Palmer&#x27;s products faithfully.</li>
            <li> As I put this on at night, I hate feeling product on my face that rubs off onto my pillow.</li>
            <li> I absolutley hate feeling smothered with lotions, so I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awful to use under foundation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> A very pleasant non-greasy night cream that leaves skin as soft and lustrous as Clinique and Olay products that cost much more.  Especially effective on the sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell. It&#x27;s creamy. But once you put on your skin it quickly settle into your skin. I feel my skin firming ( no kidding folks). This is good for me in the spring and summer. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. However, in the fall in winter months. I think I need a cream that&#x27;s more moisturizering. I got my purchase quick. So far I am content.</li>
            <li> This cream is actually used by my husband. This is the only product he has found that leaves his face feeling clean and moisturized without a greasy feeling. He uses all of the Palmer&#x27;s products (facial washing gel and the body lotion).</li>
            <li> I use this during the day and it works well doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like the oil did.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a moisture gel over it. I do see an improvement.</li>
            <li> I definitely want to reorder and will recommended to all my friends that have an issue with uneven skin tone due to birth controll, sunlight, etc. Love it, Love it, Love it!!</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel yucky - caused milia around my eyes.  Really did not like it at all.  Had to rehome it pretty quick.  Love some of their other stuff though - just not this one.  Sorry Palmers.</li>
            <li> Great night cream.  The best thing is it is NOT tested on animals.  I have used this cream for a while now and like it very much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this night cream!  It is rich and makes my skin feel great.  I can put this on liberally and never have to worry about breakouts or skin reactions, which as a person with Lupus can be a big problem. I don&#x27;t know if I see a real reduction in lines and wrinkles, but I think overall my skin is in much better condition since I have started using the Palmer&#x27;s skin products.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, creamy, non-greasy night cream.  I wish it had fewer ingredients, but I&#x27;m going to stick it out and use this for a while to see how it goes.  My skin is quite dry from the cold, dry, winter weather, and this seems to be helping quite a bit.  It goes on smoothly, has a light, pleasant scent that fades quickly, and does not affect my sensitive skin or cause break outs (so far).</li>
            <li> I really like this cream, it is offers good hydration for dry skin during the night, smell&#x27;s nice and since it is very good for acne prone skin, you would think it is heavy and might clog pores but no it is perfect. As for anti aging, I am only 29 so no wrinkles yet :), but I thought it would be good to use it early as a prevarication method.</li>
            <li> Again, I must give this product one star.  I had purchased all three products at the same time and used them but they all seem to leave my face feeling like sand paper, dry and cracking.  Love the body lotion skin therapy for dry skin but will never use the facial products.  It is truly a sad thing for me because their body lotion leaves my skin so moisturized and since my skin is very dry and I live in a dry climate I always look for a better moisturizer but for my face this just created many problems that took about 2 months to overcome.  You may have better results but I will never use the facial products again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Palmers to begin with when at 42 I had my first baby and did not get stretch marks (used the Palmers creme in a jar) on my stomach every day. I really love this product also. Wonderful light scent, creamy enough to know it&#x27;s moisturizing, but not overly greasy. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great product. However  I only use at night because  it&#x27;s &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; kinda smells like old lady..  works well though</li>
            <li> The wrinkles seem to be disappearing a little bit.  My face seem much clearer and smoother...It is really making my face and neck look smoother.</li>
            <li> I gave this a full week every night and my skin looked worse than it had in years. My grandmother was here visiting and let her use it before I threw it out and she tried it a few nights and handed it back to me. It was heavy and made me break out - gram didn&#x27;t say what it was she didn&#x27;t like about it. She has oily skin (lucky right? hardly any wrinkles!!) so I think it made her face an oil slick. It has a strong smell too and I am very sensitive to most perfumes. My normal routine is Obagi but it is harsh and full of chemicals so I switch to Image Skincare to give my skin and body a break every 3-4 months. Wanted to venture out and try something less expensive but have never had good results. Bummer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It has an almost pasty texture that has a hard time sinking into my skin, like its a little too thick for my combination skin. My face does have a pleasant little glow the next morning, but I&#x27;d like to try the regular lotion instead.</li>
            <li> I love this cream as it has quality ingredients and is a great moisturizer. I use it at night and morning to my neck and face and have had a lot of compliments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth jar and I am so impressed with this product. I apply it mostly on my neck because I have a separate retinol product on my face. I noticed that my neck becomes firmer and smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Night Renewal Cream for about two weeks (every other night on average).  I decided to use the product because I seem to always have bags under my eyes and redness around my nose from extremely sensitive skin.  My normal procedure is to apply the cream over my entire face, then I add some spot treatment under my eyes.  I will say that the product has a great smell to it and is very relaxing and definitely softened my face to the touch.  I noticed an improvement in the brightness of my face but the bags seemed to still persist.  It may take time to reduce those but I&#x27;m going to continue to use it to see how it performs.</li>
            <li> This night cream is OK, but not great. Mine was not creamy, but thick and paste like. I didn&#x27;t care for that at all.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. It lets the smooth face.</li>
            <li> Just right for my skin.  Simple cream, not too heavy and not a strong smell.  I use it with the rejuvenating serum and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I suffer from dry skin. This cream is thick and rich. Makes my skin feel soft and nice. Not too greasy and absorbes quickly. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice heavy cream night renewal or use anytime.  I like it but if you light you might not.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you grease it is just nice and creamy.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizers the face and neck. The best lotion I have ever tried. Highly recommend for all types of skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok. not as spectacular as the reviews...but not bad either. ive got other stuff that i like a lot better in or near the same price range. one thing i really don&#x27;t like: the smell. prob just my opinion but i think it smells bad :(  the service/delivery etc was excellent from amazon.com</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the fragrance, I was expecting it to smell like cocoa butter, that&#x27;s why I bought it, but it doesn&#x27;t. The fragrance is not offensive but not what I had wanted. Aside from that it&#x27;s a nice night cream for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried Palmer&#x27;s night cream, and was looking for something that was budget friendly.  I wish this had worked for me, as I love the soft scent and absorbent quality.  Unfortunately, my face broke out in a rash after I used it.  At first I thought it was a fluke, and stopped using it.  I tried several weeks later, and again broke into a rash after just  a few uses.  My skin usually isn&#x27;t that sensitive.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> The best and least exspensive night cream.  Can&#x27;t find in stores.  My usual brand was Olay Night Cream, Palmers is better. Saw improvement in 2 weeks, even skin tone.</li>
            <li> I purchased the full compliment of Palmer&#x27;s facial and body lotions and started using them.  They are all a bit greasy, and make me smell like a gigantic chocolate bar.  Not unpleasant, but not my first preference either.  After about three days my face started breaking out so I&#x27;ve discontinued use of the Daily Facial and Night Renewal Creams.  Too bad.  I had high hopes for this lotion.  I&#x27;ll continue to use these on other parts of the body, but perhaps &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; is not the best solution for my face.</li>
            <li> i like the way this cream feels and smells. it is not too greasy and not too watered down. i have combination skin and this works great.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s and Palmer&#x27;s products have had a place in my home for over 20 years. I LOVE the way they smell like cocoa and chocolate! I&#x27;m familiar with Palmer&#x27;s products usually having that cocoa smell. This is second one I&#x27;ve unfortunately found that does NOT smell like cocoa. Instead Palmer&#x27;s has chosen to use a flowery white lily scent. It&#x27;s a bit overpowering to have slathered all over your face and neck. The cream itself is super luxurious! The weight and feel of it is incredible, but the smell can be really overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking for another night cream.&lt;br /&gt;Please Palmer&#x27;s make this unscented or cocoa scented.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick. &amp;#34;Spackle&amp;#34; in my dad&#x27;s voice goes through my head every time I put it on my face. Although it&#x27;s thick, it absorbs relatively quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize. It doesn&#x27;t relieve that slightly dry feeling my skin has right after washing.</li>
            <li> Forget the choco sweet smell of Palmers, this stuff smells like old lady&#x27;s cupboards, makes me gag. But it does feel lovely and rich bit not greasy. Makes skin lovely and soft, if you can put up with the rotten smell.</li>
            <li> When looking for a face cream, the first question to answer is, &amp;#34;Does it work?&amp;#34; This Palmer&#x27;s cream gets a resounding yes to that question; it does what it is supposed to do. I&#x27;m not a new person, but my skin is noticeably brighter, smoother, and firmer. Many other products also do this job, though, so there are a few other factors that set this cream apart:&lt;br /&gt;  •  Cost. Other products that work can cost at least twice as much as this.&lt;br /&gt;  •  Smell. I find the natural cocoa butter very relaxing, and I have absolutely hated the smell of some face creams!&lt;br /&gt;  •  Application. As I put this on at night, I hate feeling product on my face that rubs off onto my pillow. This dries quickly, and&lt;br /&gt;  leaves no greasy film behind. My face feels fresh and ready for bed in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and have not had any breakouts or other blemishes appear when using this product. I recommend exfoliating with a scrub or brush so the natural vitamins in this product can really sink into the skin and leave you looking radiant in the morning. If you are looking for a face cream, get this, you won&#x27;t find anything better out there!</li>
            <li> As with Palmer&#x27;s day time moisturizer, this one is my favorite of all I&#x27;ve used. It has a soft fragrance and after a few weeks of using it, I actually feel my skin tightening after it&#x27;s been on for about 30 minutes. It is a product that really helps my skin...it doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface, it penetrates the skin leaving it very soft and moist. And I live in Texas, where women really know about dry skin! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It works, My skin is truly looking great i replace my ovally with this after less then a month people were saying I looked younger..lol Must have and I will keep using it</li>
            <li> Been using this for about two months now, and my skin is feeling vibrant and soft.  It seems like the bags under my eyes are smaller, too, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> This cream works as advertised!  When applied per the directions, I noticed a significant change in the way my skin looked almost immediately!  It is silky, cool, and very luxurious.  It feels great when applied on my face. It doesn&#x27;t interfere with sleeping at all, and the results are, frankly, amazing!  I looked noticeably younger from having used Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Night Renewal - my skin looked and felt smoother and firmer.After some use over a short time, my skin felt softer, looked smoother.  I felt like I was glowing the next morning.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this night creme.</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s products and have never had a problem with any, until now. I loved the texture, the smell, the way it made my face and neck feel. But not 2 hours later my face and neck started to feel warm. I touched my face and could feel bumps. On closer inspection in the bathroom mirror I was horrified at what I saw. Red blotches and bumps on my cheeks, forehead, jaw line and my neck. At first I thought I had an allergic reaction to something I ate, But nothing I ate that day was new to my system. I washed my face immediately and applied my normal moisturizer, bringing some relief from the burning and itching I had before I did. I called the doctor the next day and was told I might be allergic to the retinol in this product. It&#x27;s now been four days and the blotches and bumps are gone, but I still have an extremely dry forehead. I am apply lotion at least 10 times a day to my forehead to fix what this product did to me. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS STUFF DOES WONDERS! I HAVE USED IT FOR FOUR YEARS NOW. EVEN BEATS OUT SOME ESTEE LAUDER NIGHT CREAMS. NO KIDDING...VERY INEXPENSIVE TOO!!</li>
            <li> Ok product like oil of olay better.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. it is light and soaks into my skin and leaves me feeling really soft and supple. I wish I could stock pile this cream because I will miss it if this company ever leaves. best face moisture on the market!</li>
            <li> A smooth feeling after one use. Within a week I noticed a healthy glow. After a month I can see an amazing complexion. I can go without makeup.</li>
            <li> I love how great this product feels on my skin-- it absorbs nicely and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looking healthier and lifted.  I like this product better than Revlon products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my skin almost immediately. Not too heavy or greasy. Couldn&#x27;t find it in the store. I knew I could count on amazon to have it and will probably be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, my face is always red and not matter which face cream I apply, I always get stung. This one doesnt and it works alright by keeping my dry skin mosturized.</li>
            <li> Got a refund. The end.</li>
            <li> I love this inexpensive night cream! Absorbs well and I find I wake up with smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect cream... I live in high desert, cold temps &amp; hot temps.  The skin takes a beating.  This stuff immediately gives me&lt;br /&gt;much needed moisture, smooth, lovely feeling.  I put this on auto ship..  I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is a good nighttime cream.  I have found it healing and soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> This night cream is by far my favorite when it comes to moisturizers. After applying it at night, it did not leave a greasy film on my face. I like it because I can still feel my pores breathing after applying it as it is super light. The best thing was that the next day there was no need to apply additional lotion/moisturizer as it penetrated my skin that well. After overnight usage I didn&#x27;t wake to any break outs on my sensitive skin and the cocoa and shea butter fragrance was an added bonus. Though I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles I can certainly see a change in the bags under my eyes. This will continue to be apart of my night time routine.</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it on my face.  Softens yet not greasy.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to know if it really helps with wrinkles and scars.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Palmers products. This one is no different. The price is right &amp; it is a nice cream. Not thick or greasy.  I purchased another similar product used for the same purpose and the cost was higher &amp; I did not care for the product as much.  Palmers is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Got me through the Boston winter. A+++</li>
            <li> This night cream is my favorite for 3 reasons: performance, price, and Peta-approval. I have used many, many, many products over the years; this performs as well as any and better than most. Palmer&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin either. If you&#x27;re considering trying this, you have my encouragement :-}</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> NOT GREASY OR OILY.  USED TO USE OIL OF OLAY AND NO OTHER PRODUCT COMPARES TO PALMER&#x27;S NIGHT CREAM.  WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Lightweight--feels silky smooth--really pleasant smell, not at all medicinal--plus a SUPER AFFORDABLE price point.  Def recommend.</li>
            <li> Not quite moisturizing enough for my very dry skin, but will work great in the summer months. Nice vitamin e smell.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this and it leaves my skin feeling soft at night and smooth in the morning. My favorite night cream.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of the night cream.  Would liked to have smelled the cocao butter but that&#x27;s just me. After a few weeks of using the cream my skin seemingly feels softer. Not oily and I would recommend this cream for normal or normal/oily skin types.</li>
            <li> Nice cream, haven&#x27;t seen any &amp;#34;renewal&amp;#34; properties.</li>
            <li> In dry weather, this cream is awesome. My skin gulps it up. I use it morning and night. Wish it wasn&#x27;t available as an add on item only.</li>
            <li> I love this Night renewal cream. It leave my face very soft and clear in the morning without botch look. It look, feel and smell better than the previous cream I was using. It work faster than the rest of the Palmer facial cream.  I would recommend this product to anyone who need a break from other facial product.</li>
            <li> I am past 40 and always looking out for some excellent night cremes for my face. This cream is excellent. Makes my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for good night cream and stumbled upon this in the store a couple of years ago but now the only place I can find it is on amazon.  My skin is sensitive with both dry and oily patches and I wake up with an all-over smooth face.  If you are looking for hydrating night cream that will make your skin feel ridiculously soft, this is it!</li>
            <li> The product did not perform as I had hoped.  My skin did not feel softer or renewed.  I like Palmer products, but this one did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I&#x27;ve always sworn by the Oil of Olay products which I think are great.  One day my store was out of my Oil of Olay night cream so I decided to try this and it&#x27;s VERY nice and the price is good.  I like the rich cream, but it&#x27;s not too oily.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Have no clue as the order was cancelled. I imagine this review will be cancelled so not much point. However I am a big fan of palmers products and use the day cream on a regular basis.  I love their products so will be looking to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Rich but clean and moisturizes very well; very little needed.  Keeping age away as long as possible, it&#x27;s helping - I am subscribed to auto-ship to stay stocked at all times :)</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the Facial Cream and went ahead and purchased the Night Renewal Cream. All I can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;. Of course I use it at night, and have noticed how soft my skin feels. I have a daily routine of the night cream, then use the facial cream in the morning with the eye cream. I was previously using the 3 step Clinique products, well this is my new 3 steps. I Love it...</li>
            <li> The cream is not greasy at all and it feels good on the face, but I still have not seen a difference after 4 weeks of using</li>
            <li> Nearly forgot I ordered this product. My reason for buying the night renewal cream is for my hands &amp; feet at bed time. I use assorted products for different body parts. Palmer&#x27;s,Oil of Olay,and french creams are a must for healthy exterior maintenance.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work out!  I love the body lotion so much and needed something to moisturize my face.  I have sensitive skin and am prone to break outs.  This cream is thick and rich and wonderful!!!  Unfortunately, it also clogged my pores and after I used it just one night, I woke up with a breakout.  I kept using it over the next couple of days in the hopes that the one breakout was a fluke....but no, I broke out again.  :(  Wish it could have worked!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the palmers Toner and it&#x27;s a great product &amp; combo in my opinion! Its very thick when you put it on but it just seems so lightweight and not greasy at all! I have sensitive and acne prone skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t give me break outs or make me red, my skin feels softer and healthier. I dont think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see improvment on wrinkles, but i dont plan on stopping it anytime soon! I would recommend this product to any skin type.</li>
            <li> Loving this night renewal cream! I can feel the difference after I have applied. It is not heavy or overly greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My skin is very dry. I put this on everynight and my skin has improved 100%!</li>
            <li> I like the texture -it&#x27;s nice and thick and it really does a good job on my face.  It&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> It definitely matches the description of being &#x27;quick absorbing&#x27;. However, as someone with dry skin, I expected the product to be much more thicker and longer lasting on the skin as it is supposed to be a &#x27;night&#x27; cream. The cream gets absorbed almost instantly and the skin feels very taut immediately. This however is not necessarily a good thing for me as my skins starts stretching and does not feel moisturized. I feel the need to reapply the cream almost immediately. The smell is not that great either. It does not have that typical chocolate-cocoa butter signature smell of other Palmers products. I would recommend this product only if you already have oily skin and if you do not care much about how a product smells.</li>
            <li> When I buy this product I didnt know it has ingredients that are not good for you, so I stop using it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a day and night cream and I have combination skin, it didn&#x27;t break me out, and my skin is looking AMAZING. I stopped using my eye cream because it looks like I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> Great face cream.  Thick but goes on nice and light, makes my skin feel great.  DOES NOT irritate my sensitive skin.  Has that cocoa butter smell I love.  Have used during the day as well as overnight and happy with both!</li>
            <li> As I had mentioned on the other palmer brand comments. I love it and reccomend this brand. Ive been using this type of cream for a few weeks now. I never knew they made a face cream till I found on amazon. I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduce in wrinkkes yet but its only been a few weeks so I may be over time I will a diffrence. It does make my skin silky smoothe. Its great on sensitive skin. I had a sinus infection and a runny nose for weeks. My nose was on fire. I used this cream and it helpped relieve the pain. It didn&#x27;t burn on irritated skin either. I use it day and night and its great to wear under make up.</li>
            <li> I will defiantly keep buying this product.  GREAT Price and I love how my skin feels after use.  The cream has a great texture.  I have started using the entire line of products. the scrub is to die for! :)</li>
            <li> I just love this moisturiser. It is an excellent night cream and does actually work. This is also real value for money.</li>
            <li> This night cream is excellent for day as well. It truly makes your skin feel smooth and eliminates any dryness. I use it both as day cream and night cream; I not also use it on my face and neck, but on my arms as well. It truly is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I really like the Palmer&#x27;s Skin Therapy Oil for Face, and Palmer&#x27;s body lotion, so I had high hopes for this cream. I&#x27;ve used it twice. For me, it does absolutely nothing. It doesn&#x27;t help my dry skin and it&#x27;s awful to use under foundation. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> use it AM and PM for extra fine skin</li>
            <li> A friend of mine makes her own cocoa butter and Vitamin E mixture because it is so good for your skin!  I found this product and it is great!  It is reasonably priced, has a pleasant smell, and is not greasy!  My husband even commented about the pleasant smell!  So, a great night cream!</li>
            <li> Dermatologist said these items are not good to use for acne, or to improve skin, I purchased a bunch of items that I threw out.</li>
            <li> I found this cream to be somewhat chalky and it seemed to tighten skin but not in a good way; more like a drying sensation.</li>
            <li> This product caused extreme breakouts. I was disappointed, I use Palmer&#x27;s products faithfully. My skin just isn&#x27;t a good fit for their facial products. The product was wonderfully moisturizing though, so for a person with dry and less acne-prone skin it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I used this as a daily moisturizer during our very dry winter months and it works wonderfully to keep dry skin in check.  I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it at all.  I used to be able to get this at our local drugstore and was excited to find it on Amazon when they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> Not getting enough effect from this as I do with  Perricone. Probably fine for someone younger, I am 59 , with combo skin.</li>
            <li> When I awake in the mornings and wash my face, it is so soft. Each night I use the night renewal cream after using a facial cleanser/wash.</li>
            <li> What a great product! This cream moisturize my dry skin very well overnight that it just feels amazing every morning. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This feels like candle wax on your skin, so I dont get the indication that it is sinking in, just laying on top. I absolutley hate feeling smothered with lotions, so I am very disappointed.  I am using it on my neck and chest and back of my hands, but I cannot stand it on my face.</li>
            <li> I wake up with dry skin on my forehead and cheeks (i do drink water before bed but still have dry skin) so i purchased this item because I was told dry skin can cause wrinkles :( I must say this cream is working wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very creamy and absorbs nicely in my skin also the cream has a light scent. At first the cream felt heavy but then my skin was becoming more soft and healthy so it does not bother me any more :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for people with dry skin like me or just becuase your worried about wrinkles, I give this product two thumbs up!!!!</li>
            <li> Non greasy formula right before bed is a wonderful night cream.  This is great to diminish imperfections in all skin types.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but this stuff is amazing. I am a biracial woman and my skin often looks blotchy and discolored.  I used to use regular cocoa butter lotion when I was younger and decided to give this stuff a try.  It is also excellent for acne-prone skin.  I agree with some of the other reviewers when they say they can go without make-up after using this.  It has faded old scars on my face, evened my skin tone and the crow&#x27;s feet that extended outward from my eyes have disappeared.  I will say it doesn&#x27;t do much for under the eye, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and they say retinol takes a long time to see results.  Very pleased with this product.  I would also like to mention that I put this cream all over my face at night, including around the eye area and it is totally non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I have not used it as yet but I did use some from a friend and it was great. I know that I will be ordering more of Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this night renewal cream for about 3 months and I am totally satisfied with the results. I use only at nights.  It acts as a moisturizer and has a nice fragrance. The price is very reasonable compared with other high priced products that serve the same purpose.  I will highly  recommend.</li>
            <li> too oily for my skin type.</li>
            <li> oh my  I love this night cream  it is great</li>
            <li> heavy creme, nice smell</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s skincare line and face line in general. I think it is extremely moisturizing and keeps my skin extremely hydrated!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my face moisturized at night and gives me a healthy glow in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out and I have very sensitive skin. Smells a little bit like an old lady perfume, but it does a good job moisturizing so I&#x27;m not mad about it.</li>
            <li> This is an ok night cream. It is really moisturizing, the smell is meh (not my favorite, but not unusable) but the price is right. I can&#x27;t really tell if it is helping reduce fine lines and/or wrinkles so that is why the 3 stars. It keeps my skin moisturized but that is about it. I will probably try something else when it is time to repurchase.</li>
    </ol>
