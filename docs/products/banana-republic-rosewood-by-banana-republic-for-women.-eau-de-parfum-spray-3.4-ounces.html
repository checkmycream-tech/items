            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to stockpile! :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping It would be authentic.</li>
            <li>I love that nobody has it &amp;</li>
            <li>i was in love with this when a uncle friend gave it to me</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>This smelled more alcohol to me than I believe an EDP should</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance, quick shipping</li>
            <li>This cologne smells nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>The original is floral and powdery.</li>
            <li>Musk is all you get because this is not the original perfume.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is pleasant enough, sweet with a hint of musk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really cool container.</li>
            <li>Be aware people!</li>
            <li>it is so worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, smell so good, fresh and last long.</li>
            <li>Smelled like pure alcohol!  </li>
            <li>Smell is soft, gentle and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty basic scent but good for those nights where you want to smell nice but not use your expensive perfume.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>This scent is very musky.</li>
            <li>Its has a very soft, almost ethereal smell, a bit flowery, with a hint of baby powder, without being cloying.  </li>
            <li>It is not worth spending money on perfume that smells NOTHING like the original.</li>
            <li>Once again please DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li>comments like, \\&quot;someone sure smells good\\&quot; are common and my only fear is what I will do if they ever stop making it...</li>
            <li>I bought a small size at an outlet store and had to buy the full bottle once I used that up.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Rosewood for a few years and it never fails to draw attention...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this perfume and I love it.  Its has a very soft, almost ethereal smell, a bit flowery, with a hint of baby powder, without being cloying.  I receive compliments every time I wear this.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Rosewood for a few years and it never fails to draw attention... comments like, \\&quot;someone sure smells good\\&quot; are common and my only fear is what I will do if they ever stop making it... I&#x27;m tempted to stockpile! :)</li>
            <li> It has been a year since I am using this product every now and then and I love it. Smell is soft, gentle and sophisticated. I am definitely buying this product again once I finish it.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, quick shipping</li>
            <li> This cologne smells nothing like the original. I have used rosewood which was purchased in banana republic store. It is totally different.</li>
            <li> Mine was fake also!  Smelled like pure alcohol!  Was even amber in color, which is NOT the color of Banana Republic&#x27;s Rosewood!  I know because I used it for years.  I was so disappointed because some of the other reviews were good and I was hoping It would be authentic.</li>
            <li> I just like that prefume</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! I bought a small size at an outlet store and had to buy the full bottle once I used that up.</li>
            <li> Always, my go to scent.  Haven&#x27;t smelled anything like it ever! Always get compliments on it! I love that nobody has it &amp; it is so worth the money. Great seller; authentic item!!</li>
            <li> great for travel or the purse</li>
            <li> Excelent.  My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem ordering perfume or cologne from amazon.  They have always smelled the same as what I would pay extra for in a department store.  Lasts just as long too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years....and get compliments both from men and women.  I love this product! Deb from SC</li>
            <li> i was in love with this when a uncle friend gave it to me so i went looking for it i love it</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, smell so good, fresh and last long.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.. Great perfume</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great price. Love it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume based on reviews alone not really knowing what to expect. I do not know if it is similar to the one bought in stores as I have never sampled it. I think the smell is pleasant enough, sweet with a hint of musk. It&#x27;s a pretty basic scent but good for those nights where you want to smell nice but not use your expensive perfume. On a scale of 1-5 I would give it a 2.5 for the perfume but bump it to a 3 because of the box. It&#x27;s a really cool container. This smelled more alcohol to me than I believe an EDP should but the price is low enough I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> This is an imitation! Once again please DO NOT waste your money. Go to the store and purchase it there. It is not worth spending money on perfume that smells NOTHING like the original. The original is floral and powdery. This scent is very musky. There are absolutely no floral or powdery notes. Musk is all you get because this is not the original perfume. Be aware people!</li>
            <li> my moms favorite,she loves it</li>
            <li> I saw a couple reviews indicating this is a knockoff perfume. I am not sure if it is a knockoff or a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34;, but the perfume does smell different than what is carried in BR stores (I used to work there and used it all the time).  However, the package was sealed and all details on the package (down to the ingredients) are identical to previous packages I purchased at the store. I am not sure what to think. I agree it has a somewhat musky smell as opposed to a floral, powdery smell. But, it still smells good and I wear it. Considering what I paid, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, great condition, unopened, exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> One of my faves luv it, just like it is, excellent price</li>
            <li> I liked it , it was a perfect gift</li>
