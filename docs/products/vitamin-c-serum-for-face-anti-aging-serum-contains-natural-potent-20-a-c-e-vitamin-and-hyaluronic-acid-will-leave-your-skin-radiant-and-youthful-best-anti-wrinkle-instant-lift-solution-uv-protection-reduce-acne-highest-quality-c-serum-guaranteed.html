            <li>Has a very neutral pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I used so many skin care products and finally, after getting vitamin C serum, I am so happy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and it is by far the most superior vitamin c serum I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This vitamin C Serum has to reduce fine lines and wrinkles within in a matter of days and now my skin looks youngful than ever before.</li>
            <li>This vitamin C product has made my skin feel tighter and it seems to fill in fine lines.</li>
            <li>The added bonus of organic ingredients is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Face feels so smooth</li>
            <li>My Mother who is 87 years old has used it two weeks also, and she is just so very amazed, excited and happy with her results too.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the results for the price, but they&#x27;re right here on my face!</li>
            <li>This serum feels so soothing and cool on the skin</li>
            <li>for me that is always good, so we can definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I have used other Vit C serums, this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>The faster effects are too good than I was expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a fresh skin and smooth face, which I really wanted to have for.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and smooth as it reduces wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my better half, upon her request :)</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my skin, which is amazing because I hardly ever wear makeup.</li>
            <li>This serum has such an interesting texture.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it , not only</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re saying I didn&#x27;t look good before?&amp;#34; trouble ...)</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and to work into your daily skin care.</li>
            <li>But I am very particular about product texture and that was what sold me on this product.</li>
            <li>I have not told my friends that I was using this product and after only 2 and half weeks, yesterday 3 different friends commented on how great my skin looks!</li>
            <li>My wife loves it so much now ...</li>
            <li>Upon application, it immediately dissolves, leaving a very silky finish.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much for my skin</li>
            <li>I was given a bottle of this serum, as a present for my partner, while on a recent trip to the US.&lt;br /&gt;Probably like most guys I had never heard of vitamin C serum and also pretty much ignore the whole face cream and makeup stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the silky finish is nice in its oil-free qualities or crepey, so I&#x27;m not absolutely positive that I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it is any more effective than other vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li>Who is thé one that really benefits from this New situation?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to those having problems with their skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to take care of their face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I have to say that after several weeks of use that my partner&#x27;s skin is clearly looking younger and more vibrant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I guess that means it works very well because otherwise my mom would never change from her regular brands</li>
            <li>My face and throat is soft and skin has a glow to it.</li>
            <li>Compared to other higher priced serum&#x27;s this completely outshines them!</li>
            <li>I am 57 and work outside, I was seeing lots of little fine wrinkles around my eyes, lips and chin area.</li>

            <li> the last few months, I have been a big fan of going to the gym and working out - as an effect - I look considerably younger.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of problems with skin discoloration due to my excessive sun exposure, this product has been very influential in the minimizing of skin discoloration and even some of my &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; wrinkles have disappeared.</li>
            <li> My skin in only two weeks - is so soft and silky that I can hardly believe it myself!  </li>
            <li> I have used similar products in the past, but I have never had them go on &amp;</li>
            <li> My partner of the other hand doesn&#x27;t have time to go to the gym as she has strict working hours...</li>
            <li> Some black eye shadows and lines have disappeared from my face.</li>
            <li> You can see the results in a few hours....  </li>
            <li> This product is far less expensive that some like Clinique that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a month but have not seen any dramatic results yet.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I was complemented on how radiant my skin looked, as in the past</li>
            <li> her request, I searched online for something like this (usually I just buy gadgets</li>
            <li> I have been know to suffer from a slight skin complaint but not anymore!</li>
            <li> I found that it was a too oily for me which is not good with my combination skin but</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> so it was difficult to find something like this - as I didn&#x27;t know what I was looking for).</li>

            <li> I found that it was a too oily for me which is not good with my combination skin but customer service was excellent in dealing with my concerns and enabled me to promptly return it.</li>
            <li> I have used similar products in the past, but I have never had them go on &amp;#34;feeling so silky&amp;#34; as this product.  I have hyperpigmentation and am hoping that this will help fade the spots.  I have only been using for a month but have not seen any dramatic results yet.  This product is far less expensive that some like Clinique that I have used in the past.</li>

            <li> This Vitamin C serum is by far the very best serum I have ever put on my face. The feeling of my skin is like silk. I love this stuff!  Thank you for bring it to Amazon!! A+ all the way!</li>
            <li> As a skin care, it worked well for me. I used so many skin care products and finally, after getting vitamin C serum, I am so happy. The faster effects are too good than I was expected. Some black eye shadows and lines have disappeared from my face. I&#x27;ve got a fresh skin and smooth face, which I really wanted to have for.

            <li> I love this product.  Leaves my skin soft and smooth as it reduces wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 3-4 months. I spend a lot of time outside and I have been worrying about the aging of my skin. I have had a lot of problems with skin discoloration due to my excessive sun exposure, this product has been very influential in the minimizing of skin discoloration and even some of my &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; wrinkles have disappeared. I get so many compliments on my skin, which is amazing because I hardly ever wear makeup. The added bonus of organic ingredients is fantastic. I do not want to be adding additional chemicals to my skin, that could eventually do harm! This product is easy to use and to work into your daily skin care. I can&#x27;t believe the results for the price, but they&#x27;re right here on my face!</li>
            <li> This is a great serum, it dosent pentrate as well as others, but I do see a difference in suppleness and brightness!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your face is nice and clean before application to recieve the optimal benefits.</li>
            <li> Bought this product as a gift for my Mom based on the recommendation of a friend and after about a week she asked me where I got it because she loved it and wanted to buy it for herself. So I guess that means it works very well because otherwise my mom would never change from her regular brands.. trust me :)</li>
            <li> I think this product is just Vitamin A or D oil. No telltale smell of as ascorbic acid (vitamin C) at all and no telltale tingling on skin of it either. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love it. Face feels so smooth</li>
            <li> got this for my wife at the recommendation of a friend, and there&#x27;s a definite &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; about it and the glow of her skin after only a couple of weeks (except I&#x27;ll refrain from mentioning it as that would lead me in all kinds of &amp;#34;so you&#x27;re saying I didn&#x27;t look good before?&amp;#34; trouble ...) Personally I actually eat (not apply externally) a supplement with very similar ingredients (but this one is for helping with a bone-fracture, not radiant skin), so I know how effective these ingredients are. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This vitamin C Serum has to reduce fine lines and wrinkles within in a matter of days and now my skin looks youngful than ever before. One of the best product I bought this year for my skin. I highly recommend it to those having problems with their skin.</li>
            <li> This product is à réal deal! !! My wife loves it so much now ...and i can tell you guys she tried so many before.This one brings visible results after some weeks ..OBVIOUSLY it centains vitamin c serum but i think thé nanotechnologies mit be keycode here! She looks younger her skin is smoother she feels more attractive and guéss Who is thé one that really benefits from this New situation? Guys if your wife was like mine complaining about her appearance and you Know not féeling in thé mood for you as before then you should ask her to give this vitamin c serum facial care à réal  try it changed our relationship for thé Best. ..hope this Will for you as well...</li>
            <li> This serum has such an interesting texture. Upon application, it immediately dissolves, leaving a very silky finish. I&#x27;m not sure if the silky finish is nice in its oil-free qualities or crepey, so I&#x27;m not absolutely positive that I love it. But it does feel great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for my skin</li>
            <li> This is a good serum. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I think it is overpriced. However, I will continue to buy this because it has the best texture for a Vitamin C serum that I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m not sure that it is any more effective than other vitamin C serums. But I am very particular about product texture and that was what sold me on this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it is by far the most superior vitamin c serum I have ever used. I was complemented on how radiant my skin looked, as in the past I have been know to suffer from a slight skin complaint but not anymore! Compared to other higher priced serum&#x27;s this completely outshines them! Extremely happy to have found this serum and the supplier - you now have a customer for life!</li>

            <li> This vitamin C product has made my skin feel tighter and it seems to fill in fine lines. My face and throat is soft and skin has a glow to it. Very happy with the results. This serum feels so soothing and cool on the skin you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re in a spa! Has a very neutral pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Ok so Listen guys I bought this product and I absolutely love it , not only does my skin look extremely healthy but it has a glow to it now. Now my face looks and feels refreshed and looks radiant. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to take care of their face. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my better half, upon her request :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last few months, I have been a big fan of going to the gym and working out - as an effect - I look considerably younger. My partner of the other hand doesn&#x27;t have time to go to the gym as she has strict working hours...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon her request, I searched online for something like this (usually I just buy gadgets so it was difficult to find something like this - as I didn&#x27;t know what I was looking for). After reading a lot of review and spending a ton of time deciding, we both agreed that this could be something useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we are glad we bought this. Both of us are happy with the results and appreciate the fast customer service too! Thank you so much - awesome product - will buy again (my partner has recommended this to her friends too!)</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of this serum, as a present for my partner, while on a recent trip to the US.&lt;br /&gt;Probably like most guys I had never heard of vitamin C serum and also pretty much ignore the whole face cream and makeup stuff.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have to say that after several weeks of use that my partner&#x27;s skin is clearly looking younger and more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it!&lt;br /&gt;And for me that is always good, so we can definitely recommend!</li>
