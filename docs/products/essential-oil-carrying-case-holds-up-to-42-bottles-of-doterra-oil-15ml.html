            <li>padding seems good enough to protect from bumps.</li>
            <li>The large sections in the back are great for roller bottles.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect size for the essential oils that I currently have.</li>

            <li>It fit almost all my collection of Young Living oils</li>
            <li>I only wish that this bag came in more varieties of colors/patterns to choose from.</li>
            <li>This case is EXACTLY what l wanted.</li>
            <li>The bag as a whole is super sturdy and just looks very high quality.  </li>
            <li>So far my case has stayed clean, but I do wish it came in a darker color</li>

            <li>I originally ordered the smaller size, but upon receiving it I returned it for the larger one.</li>
            <li>So far it is holding up and still looks new after a couple months of being carried around pretty extensively for a couple months.</li>
            <li>As you can see from my images i have this crammed full from 10ml to 30ml bottles plus  two different roller ball sizes for a total of 48 bottles.</li>
            <li>It is soft and well padded.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this case!  It has compartments for 42 oils plus two compartments for roller bottles or sample bottles or whatever.</li>
            <li> It is good enough for what I need it for now. The spaces could be spaced better, even after adjusting them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. First off the construction is good! Heavy canvas, sturdy and even my taller 30ml bottles with droppers fit perfectly inside. As you can see from my images i have this crammed full from 10ml to 30ml bottles plus  two different roller ball sizes for a total of 48 bottles. Of course how many well actually fit depends on how many of each size bottle you will have. I&#x27;m very impressed that the handle doesn&#x27;t strain nor the bottom sag when i carry it. I&#x27;m glad i went with this one even though it cost more than some others listed on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Stronger then I expected it to be. Made really well. My only regret is I went for the smaller carrying case. I think this is going to be a great.</li>
            <li> It was just what I need.</li>
            <li> It does not have 42 slots to put oils.  It only has 36 and some big open spaces.  Trying to decide if I will keep it.</li>
            <li> I love this bag! I have room for all of my Simply Aroma oils and they don&#x27;t roll around on the bottom. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oils case. It holds a lot of oils and is perfect for carrying around.</li>
            <li> Very happy with quality</li>
            <li> Great product, nice and sturdy strap, plenty of room to hold oils and other stuff.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect fit for my oils! I use Doterra and it holds a mixture of 5ml and 15ml with no problem! I will be ordering a 2nd one!</li>
            <li> This is a great bag.  It holds exactly what it says it does, and my bottles are all nestled well for travel.  Would definitely recommend this one. After reading all the reviews on the different cases on Amazon, this one was the winner.  I did scotchguard it to keep it nice looking, as one reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li> excellent vendor, product as described.  Liked it so much I bought another one!</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected! Really great fabric! It&#x27;s been the envy of my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this case! I take it everywhere with me.  It is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> THE BEST.  This EO carrying case is not only very well made, it&#x27;s beautiful, sturdy and holds oils perfectly well. I&#x27;m getting my third!</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal oil bag!  Much better than the one I&#x27;d previously purchased.  The material is a heavy weight canvas type, and very appealing.  The bag as a whole is super sturdy and just looks very high quality.  The large sections in the back are great for roller bottles.  I even have a couple of 1 oz glass spray bottles that I keep back there.  My 10 ml Simply Aroma bottles fit perfectly.  This is a really great case that I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> So far it is holding up and still looks new after a couple months of being carried around pretty extensively for a couple months. I wish they made this design in a bigger size. Not big enough to carry all my different oils. Keeps the bottles from touching, so I haven&#x27;t had any lids crack since I bought it.</li>
            <li> This case is perfect!  The fabric is sturdy and it is well made.</li>
            <li> Great quality! A little on the pricy side but so are the oils you&#x27;ll stick in them. Both are an investment and use my case daily! Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and fir all my various sized oils, i can now save drawer and closet space using this compact but spacious holder. The spacer pockets are nice and padded so there is no chance of the bottles breaking. There are 2 larger sections in the back part for larger bottles or other items that go along with your oils. The photo shows the color well, i&#x27;m into blue and would have loved that color but this is fine.</li>
            <li> This fits a lot of oils. I like it a lot. May get another one.</li>
            <li> Terrific case for essential oils! I love how you can adjust the sections and really get the bottles snug and secure. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments everywhere I&#x27;ve had this case. I have recommended this car and will buy another.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the smaller size, but upon receiving it I returned it for the larger one. Realistically if you have more than 25 or so bottles of essential oils (10-30ml), go with the larger one. This case is great! All of my various sized oils fit beautifully in this case, with room for additional oils :) it&#x27;s sturdy fabric, the handle on the top is really convenient - altogether a great buy!&lt;br /&gt;I live abroad in multiple countries and this case is perfect for all of the traveling I do!</li>
            <li> I am loving this carrying case for my essential oils.  It&#x27;s a lot sturdier that I thought it would be, no sagging in this bag.  The two larger dividers in the back are great for carrying rollerballs and other different shaped items.  If you&#x27;re looking for a bag for your precious oils then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Does what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I like this case.  It is soft and well padded.  I use this to hold small bottles of Aura Cacia essential oils.  The two larger pockets at the back can hold a few larger Now Foods essential oil bottles, but the case does not have the depth nor height for a lot of those larger size bottles.  The case is good to use for storing essential oils (I used to keep them in an old shoe box) in place, but I would caution against carrying this around.  The case is soft and does not have any hard protective casing.</li>
            <li> Great, but I need a larger one about 64 bottles of do Terra Oil.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday.....put the oils in...used it today...went to zip it up...and zippers literally fell of in my hand.....what a cheap peice of garbage....ohhh wait....not cheap!38.00! I had to give it one star....would not allow me to give a zero...</li>
            <li> Got to finally use my case. It worked great. It was easy to carry because it didn&#x27;t sag. It fit almost all my collection of Young Living oils ( will have to buy another one fast to hold whole collection). I put some of my roller balls in the larger areas. Easy to find each oil because I have the labels on the tops. I will be adding another one to my collection and giving for gifts. I already recommended it</li>
            <li> I originally bought the smaller bag and was not impressed however this one lives up to the description.  Very well made and protects bottles nicely.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife, and she loves it. seems to be made of good quality fabric like hemp or canvas. padding seems good enough to protect from bumps. Perfect for toteing around the house or potion parties, &#x27;boil and boil toil and truble&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Great bag! Fits the amount of bottles it says. Well made. I only wish they had the prints when I got mine 😄</li>
            <li> I love this carrier.  It was the largest with the handle on the top and I sprayed it 3 or 4 times with Scotchguard so it wouldn&#x27;t show if it was soiled and it is still as nice as the day I got it!  It holds just the right amount of oils I like to use on a regular basis at work and at home.  I have a diffuser at work too and it&#x27;s nice to use the oils to keep germs from settling in one place........my office!  I will buy another one next year to expand my collection.  I do wish it came in a darker color so it wouldn&#x27;t get dirty looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this case to carry all my oils to Europe.  It&#x27;s perfect.  Nothing broke in my luggage and they are all so accessible for use while I&#x27;m here.  The pockets don&#x27;t allow the bottles to slip underneath as some cases do.  So far my case has stayed clean, but I do wish it came in a darker color -- that is the only drawback I can see.  I highly recommend it, even though it&#x27;s pricey.</li>
            <li> Works great! Holds 15ml and 5ml perfectly. Very well made. I only have half full but will be full very soon</li>
            <li> Love this item, I use it to showcase the oils I use for my whipped shea butters. Each section is deep enough and none of my products slip underneath.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my oils.  Great quality.  I love the look and color.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  This is so much better than the makeup bag and bubble wrap I was using before, ha!</li>
            <li> Love this bag! It is the perfect size for the essential oils that I currently have. I can definitely see myself purchasing another as my collection grows over time. Strong and durable base and handle to withstand the weight of all of my bottles. I only wish that this bag came in more varieties of colors/patterns to choose from.</li>
            <li> This case is EXACTLY what l wanted. Its sturdy and does a great job of protecting my essential oils. To keep my oils protected l have placed this case in a platstic bag and put in the fridge. The case has not absorb any of the &amp;#34;fridge smell&amp;#34;. I do not travel with the case often but if l chose to, l trust that the case would withstand. Plan to purchase another once my current case is completely full.</li>
            <li> I love this case! My oils are so neat and organized now and easy to grab and go!</li>
            <li> Love it, very useful. It holds my 15 ml and 5 ml bottles even with glass dropper cap. It also holds upright my 10 ml roll-ons.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Perfectly fits my YL oils! 15ml fits perfectly... The bad is supwr nice... Well made materials! Durable and zippers are great :) will buy again if needed :)</li>
