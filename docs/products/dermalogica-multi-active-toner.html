            <li>It give your skin a bit more moisture to hold on to.</li>
            <li>I also love to use this product after I place my make up on for the day.</li>
            <li>Dermalogica toner is the most beneficial product for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a refreshing drink of water and dissolves the tightness that results from washing my face.</li>
            <li>Great way to healthy,  vibrant skin.</li>
            <li>I love the Multi-active Toner, I use it several times a day, and it leaves a nice fresh, light dew on your skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>works good but only if you moisturize after you use it.</li>
            <li>Recieved my product I ordered quickly.  </li>

            <li>I like the size of the bottle because it lasts much longer than you can buy in the normal stores.</li>
            <li>Been using this non-stop and i guess this big big one is really value for money and able to save a bit on my pocket.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This particular product comes with a large amount that will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Dermalogica, besides being more expensive than others, I like this toner with its mild finishing to the skin.</li>
            <li>This really works and makes a big difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica products for 10 years, and the Multi-active toner prevents breakouts and keeps my skin clear - plus it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>

            <li> Gentle on skin.  Does not burn or irritate skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 3 years and I love it! I can tell when I forget to put it on because my face feels dry. This really works and makes a big difference</li>
            <li> Awesome as with all Dermalogica products</li>
            <li> Dermalogica, besides being more expensive than others, I like this toner with its mild finishing to the skin.</li>
            <li> This toner actually moisturizes my face. When I want to give my skin a break at night, I just spritz the toner on my face and leave out the cream. It has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li> Great way to healthy,  vibrant skin. Didn&#x27;t realize how good it was till I ran out. Won&#x27;t let that happen again!</li>

            <li> I love the dermalogica products! The multi-active toner is no exception. This particular product comes with a large amount that will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> This product is great for use before putting moisturizer on. It give your skin a bit more moisture to hold on to. I also love to use this product after I place my make up on for the day. I spritz it on and it help set the make up and will also help if your face feel a bit dry after your make up application. If you ever have the frustration of flaky skin ruining your make up this will help those as well! You can also use this product through out the day if you want to freshen your make up back up and also revamp your skin.</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I love the light, barely perceptible scent, the fact that it helps to \\&quot;set\\&quot; my freshly-cleansed face, keeping it clean for the rest of the day.  I recommend it, without reservation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the generic packaging.  Makes you wonder if the product inside is generic as well and not the full strength</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all been said in the reviews, this stuff is amazing. I spray then apply lotion. I also spray on my throat and decolletage. The difference is noticeable right away for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for years. I love the simplicity and good value for the price. I&#x27;ve tried others but this Dermalogica works well for me. I highly recommend it.</li>
