            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Great brush.</li>
            <li>Nice hair brush!</li>
            <li>Love those Conair brushes!</li>
            <li>and they LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>LOVE this hairbrush!</li>
            <li>I thought this brush would be a better quality then what it is!</li>
            <li>The brush does glide nicely through my hair and detangles it.  </li>
            <li>The brush handle has a nice grip to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy brush that removes tangles quickly!</li>
            <li>My favorite brush of all time.</li>
            <li>I wish they would take better care of manufacturing the ball tip coatings.  </li>
            <li>By the way, if you are buying more than one, the 3 pack that is offered is a better value.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re follicly challenged like me, you&#x27;ll love this brush.  </li>
            <li>It also keeps your hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a pretty good comb.</li>
            <li>Best brush I&#x27;ve bought in a long time</li>
            <li>new brush is great.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t brush every single day, but when I do this works the best.</li>
            <li>This brush glides easily from root to tip.</li>
            <li>yes, it costs more , but worth it.</li>
            <li>These type of brushes with both the &#x27;boar hair&#x27; style and the more durable &#x27;plastic bristle&#x27; combined are rare and I always buy when I find.</li>
            <li>Still haven&#x27;t figured out how to clean those fuzzies out, making it a challenge for us</li>
            <li>kinda picky types who like clean, hairless brushes.</li>
            <li>It does not reduce frizz, or do anything special.</li>
            <li>Anyway, overall, it&#x27;s a good brush</li>
            <li>On the positive side, 95% are covered well with a smooth, ball surface.  </li>
            <li>Good brush that makes brushing my thin hair easy, and it doesn&#x27;t make me shed more.</li>
            <li>The cushions on the handles are much better than the ones on the old.</li>
            <li>Brush is a good one, as expected.</li>
            <li>Her hair seems to mat up easily because it is long and fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the money, long lasting and feels great on your head.</li>
            <li>This specific brush is a heavier brush (solid wood), and has a nice &#x27;easy grip&#x27; rubberized strips on the grip.</li>
            <li>I love these types of brushes and have couple from different manufacturers.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned, love this brush.</li>
            <li>She said it makes her hair more manageable and will only use this brush for smoothing and detangling.</li>
            <li>AND IT DOESN&#x27;T LOOK AS PRETTY</li>
            <li>Glides through and gently removes tangles!</li>
            <li>Great brush,but not gentle enough for hair.</li>
            <li>I like the rubber handle grips, and it works perfect for my waist length hair,  build sturdy large enough to handle my hair but just small enough to fit in my hobo purse.</li>
            <li>own several different porcupine style brushes and this is the one that everyone reaches for first.</li>
            <li>The brush is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The combination of the bristles and the porcupine cushion really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>This brush makes our mornings much easier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for 5 months now and it was really nice except a third of the ball tips on the white plastic bristles have fallen off.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that tangles a lot.</li>
            <li>My step-daughter has long curly hair, my youngest daughter has fine hair.</li>
            <li>: used the brush up, all the little plastic ends on the hard bristles started to come off after almost a year, so still happy with the product, bought it again!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any particular benefit to the design of this brush--</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t pop off the little balls on the end of the plastic porcupine bristles.</li>
            <li>It works great with my hair (long, thick, wavy) and I appreciate the boar and nylon bristles.  </li>
            <li>It does gather my hair better than a plain brush that does not have the longer, plastic bristle/tines.  </li>
            <li>My daughters both have super long hair.</li>
            <li>I also feel like they get out more loose hair than the standard</li>
            <li>The new, plastic de-tangling brushes tear my hair out.</li>
            <li>, I have not dropped the brush yet, and I love the dark red color!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid wood handle with two large rubber</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft to the scalp.</li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li>When I try to comb knots out, the soft bristles were not the way to go...other than that</li>
            <li>The new one started to lose its tips after only a month or two.  </li>
            <li>But nothing special, just something gimmicky in my opinion!</li>
            <li>Also, be careful not to stab your cuticles with the boarhair parts, because that really hurts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough not to rake across your scalp like cheaper brushes.  </li>
            <li>Many of the ball coated tips (probably about 5%) were poorly covered.  </li>
            <li>Have owned this brush for a few months now and after a few weeks of using this on my straight think blonde hair the nylon bristles started to break the little balls on top of bristles</li>
            <li>This is the main reason why I have thrown out other brushes that are similar in design.  </li>

            <li> This was recommended to me by someone with really thick hair, so this really is versatile.</li>
            <li> My complaint with it is that it is hard to clean out</li>
            <li> Not too soft, not too stiff!</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little too soft to brush my hair back into a pony tail when wet, but I have fairly thick hair.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when cleaning it out.</li>
            <li> It does what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love the way they make my hair look and how the brushing process is less painful.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other hairbrush.</li>
            <li> bristle came extremely bent..</li>
            <li> The poorly coated ball tips do not adequately cover the white, sharp, protruding plastic bristles/tines and they can be sharp.  </li>
            <li> Well, at least the last one that I had, that lasted a few years.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t go thru my hair any easier than a non-horsehair bristle brush would have, and I think I discarded it after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was a bad batch, but the quality of this one is very lacking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about porcupines.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 3 maybe 4 years, it&#x27;s still usable but a lot of the longer plastic tines have either disappeared or gotten pushed into the base of the brush.</li>
            <li> The new one, I&#x27;ve owned for 8 months and the plastic bristles have almost all lost their ball coatings and painfully scratch my head any time I try to use this brush.  </li>
            <li> I definable recommend buying and at least trying this style of brush.</li>
            <li> A 100% boar bristle brush doesn&#x27;t penetrate the thick hair.</li>
            <li> But this brush penetrates thick hair, detangles without all of the pain and loss of hair</li>
            <li> Really thick hair?  </li>
            <li> I did like the cushiony bristle base, that had a gentle effect.</li>
            <li> have all but a very few have broken off which now scrapes my scalp when brushing.</li>
            <li> The brush is useless without them because the &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; bristles hurt your scalp.</li>
            <li> THe packaged it poorly!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great brush. The one I bought about 5 years ago finally started losing the balls on the end of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new brush is great. The cushions on the handles are much better than the ones on the old. I have long, fine hair that tangles a lot. The new, plastic de-tangling brushes tear my hair out. A 100% boar bristle brush doesn&#x27;t penetrate the thick hair. But this brush penetrates thick hair, detangles without all of the pain and loss of hair (especially when I start brushing at the ends and work my way up). Faster than the plastic brushes. My favorite brush of all time.</li>
            <li> Good brush that makes brushing my thin hair easy, and it doesn&#x27;t make me shed more. This was recommended to me by someone with really thick hair, so this really is versatile. My complaint with it is that it is hard to clean out and it attracts and keeps those hair fuzzies (fibers). Still haven&#x27;t figured out how to clean those fuzzies out, making it a challenge for us kinda picky types who like clean, hairless brushes. Also, be careful not to stab your cuticles with the boarhair parts, because that really hurts. Anyway, overall, it&#x27;s a good brush and I like it.</li>
            <li> Many of the ball coated tips (probably about 5%) were poorly covered.  The poorly coated ball tips do not adequately cover the white, sharp, protruding plastic bristles/tines and they can be sharp.  On the positive side, 95% are covered well with a smooth, ball surface.  The brush does glide nicely through my hair and detangles it.  I love these types of brushes and have couple from different manufacturers.  The brush handle has a nice grip to it.  It does gather my hair better than a plain brush that does not have the longer, plastic bristle/tines.  This makes it easier to put my hair up in a clip or ponytail.  I do like this brush.  I wish they would take better care of manufacturing the ball tip coatings.  I had this brush for a week and I worry that the ball tips are going to fall off after a few months worth of usage making the brush unusable as those uncovered tips are very sharp and can scratch your scalp when they fall off.  This is the main reason why I have thrown out other brushes that are similar in design.  By the way, if you are buying more than one, the 3 pack that is offered is a better value.</li>
            <li> Love those Conair brushes!</li>
            <li> My husband loves the handle and the basic style of the brush.  After a year, however, the plastic tips started falling off white bristles.  The remaining ends hurt his head.  So I bought another of the same brush.  The new one started to lose its tips after only a month or two.  Now we&#x27;re in search of a similar style hairbrush that is better-made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for 5 months now and it was really nice except a third of the ball tips on the white plastic bristles have fallen off. Now it hurts my scalp to use this brush because of the plastic edges.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re follicly challenged like me, you&#x27;ll love this brush.  It&#x27;s soft enough not to rake across your scalp like cheaper brushes.  yes, it costs more , but worth it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush. The bristles are soft to the scalp. The brush is very sturdy. Great price too!!</li>
            <li> My daughters both have super long hair. This is the only hair brush that they like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft. When I try to comb knots out, the soft bristles were not the way to go...other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty good comb.</li>
            <li> My step-daughter has long curly hair, my youngest daughter has fine hair. This brush works for both and they LOVE IT! No pulling, no pain, nothing. Detangles perfectly!</li>
            <li> Really thick hair?  This brush gets all the way to your scalp unlike most upscale and expensive boars bristle brushes. Long Hair?  This brush glides easily from root to tip. It also keeps your hair shiny and healthy looking. No pigs need to die for you to have a great brush.  I&#x27;m not sure about porcupines. And what is a porcupine cushion anyway?</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned, love this brush. My first one lasted 3 maybe 4 years, it&#x27;s still usable but a lot of the longer plastic tines have either disappeared or gotten pushed into the base of the brush. It&#x27;s a solid wood handle with two large rubber grips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We own several different porcupine style brushes and this is the one that everyone reaches for first. It&#x27;s a sad day when the last person that used it forgot to put it up. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money, long lasting and feels great on your head.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve bought in a long time</li>
            <li> This is like a regular brush, but with horsehair bristles around the regular plastic bristles. I couldn&#x27;t find any particular benefit to the design of this brush-- it didn&#x27;t go thru my hair any easier than a non-horsehair bristle brush would have, and I think I discarded it after a few uses. I did like the cushiony bristle base, that had a gentle effect. But nothing special, just something gimmicky in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Great price. No problems at all.</li>
            <li> Brush is a good one, as expected.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other hairbrush. I even keep an extra on hand. I have curly hair so I don&#x27;t brush every single day, but when I do this works the best. The combination of the bristles and the porcupine cushion really makes a difference. It&#x27;s good quality and comfortable to use. Just be careful when cleaning it out. Make sure you don&#x27;t pop off the little balls on the end of the plastic porcupine bristles. The brush is useless without them because the &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; bristles hurt your scalp.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hairbrush! These type of brushes with both the &#x27;boar hair&#x27; style and the more durable &#x27;plastic bristle&#x27; combined are rare and I always buy when I find. I love the way they make my hair look and how the brushing process is less painful. I also feel like they get out more loose hair than the standard just &#x27;boar brush&#x27; or just &#x27;plastic bristle&#x27; brush. I definable recommend buying and at least trying this style of brush. This specific brush is a heavier brush (solid wood), and has a nice &#x27;easy grip&#x27; rubberized strips on the grip.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I love this brush.  Well, at least the last one that I had, that lasted a few years.  The new one, I&#x27;ve owned for 8 months and the plastic bristles have almost all lost their ball coatings and painfully scratch my head any time I try to use this brush.  Maybe it was a bad batch, but the quality of this one is very lacking.</li>
            <li> THe packaged it poorly!!! bristle came extremely bent..</li>
            <li> Have owned this brush for a few months now and after a few weeks of using this on my straight think blonde hair the nylon bristles started to break the little balls on top of bristles have all but a very few have broken off which now scrapes my scalp when brushing. I thought this brush would be a better quality then what it is! I wish I didn&#x27;t spend the 10$ on this item if the quality was going to be so low! Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I was looking for one with a mix of boar and nylon bristles.  The combination seems to help detangle hair.  It is the only brush I can use on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair seems to mat up easily because it is long and fine.  This brush makes our mornings much easier.  My mother was recently at our house and she tried this brush and asked me to get her one.  She said it makes her hair more manageable and will only use this brush for smoothing and detangling.</li>
            <li> Nice hair brush! Solid construction. The rubber on the handle makes it easier to control. Leaves the hair shine.</li>
            <li> Great brush,but not gentle enough for hair.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy brush that removes tangles quickly!😊</li>
            <li> THIS WAS THE BEST BRUSH IVE EVER HAD AND I LOST IT AND IT HAS A DIFFERENT GRIP NOW AND IT DOESN&#x27;T LOOK AS PRETTY UGH</li>
            <li> It does what I expected. It is a brush and it brushes my hair! It does not reduce frizz, or do anything special. The bristles are a little too soft to brush my hair back into a pony tail when wet, but I have fairly thick hair. I do like the rubber hand grips, I have not dropped the brush yet, and I love the dark red color!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any difference between this brush and a 100% nylon bristle brush, or difference in drying time because of the ceramic ring.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Not too soft, not too stiff! Glides through and gently removes tangles!</li>
            <li> I like the rubber handle grips, and it works perfect for my waist length hair,  build sturdy large enough to handle my hair but just small enough to fit in my hobo purse. I like the two types of bristles for getting those tangles at the nape of your neck  Update: used the brush up, all the little plastic ends on the hard bristles started to come off after almost a year, so still happy with the product, bought it again!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brushes over time, and no brush works as well as this one.  It works great with my hair (long, thick, wavy) and I appreciate the boar and nylon bristles.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
