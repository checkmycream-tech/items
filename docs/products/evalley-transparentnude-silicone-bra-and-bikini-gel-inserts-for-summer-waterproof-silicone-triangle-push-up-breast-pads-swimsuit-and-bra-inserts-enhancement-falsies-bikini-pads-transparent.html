    <ol>
            <li>These sounded like they&#x27;d be awesome, to add some umph to my girls in a swimsuit.</li>
            <li>It works perfect, and you can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing these.</li>
            <li>Great sturdy material tho!</li>
            <li>Make me look very good in a bikini.</li>
            <li>working great until I get to my target weight.</li>
            <li>These are also great for your bra.</li>
            <li>Great to add in a bra not a bikini top!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>They are made nicely though.</li>
            <li>They are both comfortable and give an amazing lift!</li>
            <li>I love this thay are nice.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my triangle bikini top.</li>
            <li>I have not used them in a bathing suit top yet though, which I think is how they might be advertised for.  </li>
            <li>They look funny lmao!</li>
            <li>many many sizes</li>
            <li>Add up about 2 sizes :)</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect for me and it gives me that extra bust I need in my boobs.</li>
            <li>They would be perfect if they were just a little wider and gave more volume.</li>
            <li>Oh so comfortable.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy unless you get free returns.</li>
            <li>These fit nicely in my triangle swim suit and are high quality well made.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they would look good in other bikini top shapes.</li>
            <li>The inserts are great at blending in due to the almost transparent color, but it doesn&#x27;t give as much lift and size increase as I would like.</li>
            <li>They probably enhanced me by one cup size while wearing it with a standard triangle top since there&#x27;s no under wiring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d work for some but definitely not the majority.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what is shown</li>
            <li>and I got this as the first product.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re probably nice if you have absolutely no boobies!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will have them a long time.</li>
            <li>Even if you already have large breast</li>
            <li>Nice little lifting effect.  </li>
            <li>I do not use them on a daily basis, just when a top needs a little help.  :-)</li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>There was an obvious triangular shape visible through a lightly padded bra.</li>
            <li>and they weigh down my bikini top.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>These felt fine in a regular bra &amp; did not feel heavy.  </li>

            <li> When they got wet they actually stuck to me.</li>
            <li> They give me that little extra to fill my B cup bra.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> They were way too small and barely made any difference.</li>
            <li> So tiny in width- unrealistically narrow- even for 34 A !</li>
            <li> They were firm and didn&#x27;t conform to the shape of the breast like a product like this should.</li>
            <li> But these are really heavy</li>
            <li> I had read previous reviews that complained about them slipping, but I did not experience that in the least.</li>
            <li> too small.</li>
            <li> They seemed too small and were moving all over the place in my bikini.</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> At least not in my swim suit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s toooo thick.</li>
            <li> They are too big and they look very fake as you go up</li>
            <li> Would have been much worse in a swim suit.  </li>
            <li> Not attractive.</li>
            <li> unhappy.</li>
            <li> Very awkward.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> unhappy. not what I had planned for. too small.</li>
            <li> These sounded like they&#x27;d be awesome, to add some umph to my girls in a swimsuit. All they do is make your boobs look lopsided and saggy on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Use them in my swimsuit for swimming class and haven&#x27;t had a problem at all.!</li>
            <li> So tiny in width- unrealistically narrow- even for 34 A !</li>
            <li> These fit nicely in my triangle swim suit and are high quality well made. I&#x27;m sure I will have them a long time.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t really work for me. They didn&#x27;t hold me up at all like I thought they would. I returned them.</li>
            <li> The inserts are great at blending in due to the almost transparent color, but it doesn&#x27;t give as much lift and size increase as I would like. I had read previous reviews that complained about them slipping, but I did not experience that in the least. At least not in my swim suit. When they got wet they actually stuck to me. They would be perfect if they were just a little wider and gave more volume.</li>
            <li> working great until I get to my target weight. Fills out my bra</li>
            <li> They seemed too small and were moving all over the place in my bikini.</li>
            <li> I love them. Oh so comfortable. They give me that little extra to fill my B cup bra. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my triangle bikini top. It works perfect, and you can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing these. They probably enhanced me by one cup size while wearing it with a standard triangle top since there&#x27;s no under wiring. I don&#x27;t know if they would look good in other bikini top shapes. These are also great for your bra. Under wiring makes your boobs, like, 2 cups sizes bigger with these in. These will do the trick until I get glorious fake boobs :)</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Thought they could be used in bikini tops, not the case.</li>
            <li> These felt fine in a regular bra &amp; did not feel heavy.  Nice little lifting effect.  I have not used them in a bathing suit top yet though, which I think is how they might be advertised for.  I do not use them on a daily basis, just when a top needs a little help.  :-)</li>
            <li> Very awkward. They were firm and didn&#x27;t conform to the shape of the breast like a product like this should.

I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d work for some but definitely not the majority.</li>
            <li> I needed swimsuit pads. The see do not work. They look funny lmao! Great to add in a bra not a bikini top! Even if you already have large breast it&#x27;s toooo thick. Great sturdy material tho!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re probably nice if you have absolutely no boobies! But these are really heavy and they weigh down my bikini top. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> They are both comfortable and give an amazing lift!</li>
            <li> i thought these were inserts that you could use for bikinis and such. They are too big and they look very fake as you go up many many sizes</li>
            <li> Love them! Make me look very good in a bikini. Add up about 2 sizes :)</li>
            <li> Smaller than i thought</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. Small and I didnt see a difference with my swim suits on.</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for.  They were way too small and barely made any difference.</li>
            <li> Love these.  They are perfect for me and it gives me that extra bust I need in my boobs.</li>
            <li> They came stapled to a plastic case. Was worried when i unstapled packaging it would tear the insert, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt; They did not provide any lift, just fell to the botttom of swimsuit/bra. Made it look like lump under breast. Not attractive. Returned</li>
            <li> They are exactly what is shown</li>
            <li> I love this thay are nice. I order around 8 things at the same time and I got this as the first product.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought they would be!  If advertised for a gel insert for a bathing suit they should be larger.  They are made nicely though.</li>
