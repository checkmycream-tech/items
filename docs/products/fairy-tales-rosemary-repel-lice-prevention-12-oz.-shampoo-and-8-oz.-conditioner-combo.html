            <li>We have been lice free since and my girls like using this shampoo every now and then because it smells so good.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does have a strong smell but after you wash your hair with it it smells very nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Great item, shipped fast!</li>
            <li>purchased this for a family to help with a lice situation and the smell was very light and not over powering.</li>
            <li>And it smells nice and makes it easy to comb hair after.</li>
            <li>smell good and make her hair smooth and easy to brush.</li>
            <li>First of all this shampoo is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We love the smell.</li>
            <li>Must be working too, as we&#x27;re lice free!</li>
            <li>It seems to be keeping further outbreaks at bay and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair and I use the shampoo on my hair too and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>and I was sure he had to have SOMETHING in his hair until he told me that.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this shampoo and conditioner and the leave-in spray.  </li>
            <li>bug.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner smells great that my whole family uses it routinely; including my toddler.&lt;br /&gt;Recommending</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>So glad to finally find these wonderful products that work so wonderful, and actually do what they say it does.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It does have a distinct smell but seems to be a good shampoo that is keeping my daughter&#x27;s hair healthy.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>We love the smell and it helps bring peace of mind when sending them off to school.  </li>
            <li>I get migraines from scents and I am able to handle the fragrance even with my sensitivity to smells.  </li>
            <li>I might still use it intermittently on my son to make sure he doesn&#x27;t get lice from school again</li>
            <li>Even I enjoyed the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the texture... nice and rich and lathers up well.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Lather up nicely and wash out cleanly.</li>
            <li>Who knows whether this product does its job, but it smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li>She smells very clean, and maybe a bit like a Christmas candle.  </li>
            <li>but my husband liked it so much that I had to buy some more!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this to get rid of lice if you are already dealing with them, but it does work very well paired with another product to keep them away, and also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>now I think, but it really wasn&#x27;t pleasant for me to use this product.  </li>
            <li>Working great so far!</li>
            <li>My daughter kept getting lice over and over and after using Fairy Tales she has been clean since using it!</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my kids and my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>The hair is soft, smells great.</li>
            <li>no inside seal on the shampoo or conditioner Which aggravates me since the shampoo isn&#x27;t filled to the top.  </li>
            <li>Best money I have ever spent on Amazon to never have to go through that nightmare ever again.</li>
            <li>Smells great, no lice so far</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo with a fresh smell that repels lice well.</li>
            <li>Good product to use for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Now as far as keeping bugs away, I am sure it works, it just wasn&#x27;t pleasant to use for me.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It is too strong, it broke my daughter out severely</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried that this product would make my daughters hair smell to strongly of the rosemary and tea tree</li>
            <li>and my daughters hair has stayed healthy and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and it really works!</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the smell and my hair which is curly actually looked better than it does with all the gobs of stuff I use to try and make it look cute.</li>
            <li>so I really would not know what good shampoo is supposed to do except clean.....</li>
            <li>I love the Fair Tails products in general.  </li>
            <li>or we have been lucky!</li>
            <li>It lease my daughter&#x27;s hair smooth</li>
            <li>I also bought the spray, which I still use sometimes to help smooth out snarly hair.</li>
            <li>, they are both lice free all year.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but dries out my 2 year old&#x27;s scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it&#x27;s all natural, I would feel good about using it as an every day shampoo/conditioner anyway.  </li>
            <li>It is great to have a natural product not made of synthetic pesticide harmful ingredients that can be absorbed in the body.  </li>
            <li>so I trust their recommendation and so far so good.</li>
            <li>smells good, leaves hair soft</li>
            <li>I think it smells very nice, and it seems to work well simply as regular shampoo and conditioner too.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for an upcoming mission trip with my daughter, so I can&#x27;t provide a review as to a lice deterrent yet, but as a normal shampoo/conditioner I can tell you it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this how this shampoo and conditioner has worked for my 6-year-old daughter.</li>
            <li>She has that super-fine hair that lice just love to grab on to, so whenever some kid comes to school with lice, she is one of the first to get it.</li>
            <li>Also great for detangling  long hair .</li>
            <li>Smells great, cute packaging, a little pricey but</li>
            <li>Within 2 days the lice were gone and the product is safe so you can use it everyday, also it spells good and is not a bad shampoo either way!</li>
            <li>It smells incredible and the little one likes it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about Fairy tale products.</li>
            <li>love the smell also that the whole family uses it to prevent and keep nits and lice at bay.</li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t worry about lice as much now that the outbreak has subsided at her school, I love using these all-natural, great-smelling hair products on her.</li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner are lightweight and have a light fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>But it does smell nice and it leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Still full of chemicals, just not the pesticides found in lice shampoo.</li>
            <li>I gave it a good try and even a second chance</li>
            <li>I do use other shampoo and conditioner on days she doesn&#x27;t attend, because I don&#x27;t think this conditions her hair that great.</li>
            <li>And luckily we had been using it for about 3 weeks when there was an outbreak of lice at school.</li>
            <li>I am sure it does the job, but I actually had better results from covering my son&#x27;s head with food grade oil and letting it sit for an hour then combing with a terminator pic.  </li>
            <li>I only wish they were a bit more affordable!</li>
            <li>It smells really great too, so your kids don&#x27;t smell funny as with the other products.</li>
            <li>Great product, was recommended for use by Naughty Nits - who knew lice don&#x27;t like the smell of rosemary?!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and no lice for my daughter so far this school year</li>
            <li>And lice pops up repeatedly in the elementary schools throughout the year.</li>
            <li>We use Fairy Tale products for both of my elementary school girls.  </li>
            <li>Had a lice outbreak at the elementary school.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my daughter was free and clear.</li>
            <li>but I also would use it for camping since bugs generally avoid most of the oils in it too.</li>
            <li>Really, a good alternative to the typical lice shampoos.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s doing its job thanks!</li>
            <li>I have been shampooing and conditioning my daughter&#x27;s hair with Fairy Tales since the first time she got lice three years ago.  </li>
            <li>Whatever can prevent lice infection, I&#x27;m willing to try.</li>
            <li>My daughters have not had lice while using it yet, but there also haven&#x27;t been any lice outbreaks that I know of recently either, so we have not been able to test it in that regard.</li>
            <li>Now I check her hair 2-3 times a week to make sure it hasn&#x27;t come back</li>
            <li>and I have a piece of mind knowing I am being proactive against a school epidemic ;)</li>
            <li>I actually need to buy more of these.</li>
            <li>Not only about lice, but because the product contains ingredients that are healthier for children than most store-bought shampoos.  </li>
            <li>: What do you like about your new special shampoo and conditioner?&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Leaves my daughter hair super soft!!</li>
            <li>I have never used an all natural product that worked....until now!!!!</li>
            <li>We have heard lots of positive feedback about this and have been using it for 4 months since we had an outbreak in the house of lice.  </li>
            <li>And the most important thing is actually pick the nits daily.  </li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the minty smell, but it faded into a soft, almost sweet, scent and left my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Lice do not like certain smells,</li>
            <li>Not sure if my kids were ever really exposed or not, but this shampoo/conditioner smells good and is gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the product itself is very strong, but I could have gotten used to that if it had left my hair feeling soft and normal, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely use this product again for lice prevention</li>
            <li>Two years later and still lice free.</li>
            <li>That being said, they are very close</li>
            <li>Its very pungent, but nothing about it is offensive to me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really look at that as being a downer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this line of products!</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t Lather all that much</li>
            <li>and they are coming out so much easier.</li>
            <li>My child and I both really like the smell</li>
            <li>and I will keep using it throughout the school year because no one wants a repeat lice experience.</li>
            <li>My hair is also NOT chemically treated, I do not color nor have I really ever permed my hair so there is no way it is reacting to a chemical I already had in my hair.  </li>
            <li>mine has always been very fine dark blonde hair, almost light brown</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that I have a little peace of mind, especially since no hitchhikers have jumped on for a ride since we&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel a little more secure about the lice situation, but I don&#x27;t know if it does actually help repel them or not.</li>
            <li>The reason I have given this item such a low rating is because I used it too just to make sure I didn&#x27;t get the lice from my son when he had it and</li>
            <li>We had a lot of success using LiceMD for the initial treatment and using this to prevent</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell healthy and protects from getting lice without the use of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe I&#x27;m crazy, but I love the smell of these products.  </li>
            <li>And then daily after that for the first one week.  </li>
            <li>yr old kids have never had lice (KNOCK WOOD!)</li>
            <li>co-worker of mine recommended the product and cross my fingers that she made it through the first month without a</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, it totally took care of the problem, and fast!  </li>
            <li>her hair is smooth and shiny and a lot less tangled too.</li>
            <li>We were much more successful using this with the stainless steel comb than using the terrible Rit shampoo and plastic shaver comb.  </li>
            <li>defense!&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are mild enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling shampoo, a little hard to work into a lather</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be affecting my 4 year old&#x27;s scalp.</li>
            <li>Hopefully will repel any critters, so far my children have had no problem.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d go natural from now on</li>
            <li>So far, she has not had lice.</li>
            <li>So far after 3 use in 5 days while using a head lice comb 90% of the population has died in none have return or wish to get in my hair</li>
            <li>So far it has worked.</li>
            <li>So far no lice.</li>
            <li>I treated her, used this to wash and checked her everyday after and we are free.</li>
            <li>It has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>We hired a professional company at that time to get rid of the lice and they recommended it</li>
            <li>So far no reoccurrence</li>
            <li>I bought this after my 2 year old came home with lice after staying the night at her cousins.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s just not fair to the children, when it&#x27;s not their fault and they are too young to be able to help it.</li>
            <li>Almost ready to pay for a nit-picker service, to go through her long blond</li>
            <li>but if you really want to get something worth the money and all your hard work, but not have to spend hours wokimg to get rid of them, then I recommend these products.</li>
            <li>So far the shampoo and conditioner have kept my daughter clear, despite several girls in her class getting lice.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and shiny and I came home with no lice!</li>
            <li>Whether it actually prevents or not, I don&#x27;t know but so far, no outbreak</li>
            <li>My 11-year old granddaughter uses this exclusively because head-lice has traveled though her school several times.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product actually helps or not, but I like the scent and that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I never expected this..</li>
            <li>Only downfall is that it&#x27;s not tear-free, so I had to help my 7 year old daughter wash her hair with it.</li>
            <li>The first rise produced two dead louse floaters.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed it does make your hair feel very soft, as some other reviewers have noted.  </li>

            <li> The fragrance is pleasant, the packaging is charming, and my child doesn&#x27;t feel like she&#x27;s doing a treatment.  </li>
            <li> Product is good, but the containers leaked when arrived.</li>

            <li> I have recommended this product to many clients and it has helped!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over a year now, and I love it!</li>
            <li> So I scoured Amazon looking for the best products, based on reviews and first tried Lice Killer.</li>
            <li> We love that they are all-natural and not oily!</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> it also smells pretty great!</li>
            <li> One of my girl has curly hair that gets tangled easily and this shampoo and conditioner works great, as well as their detangler product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> They smell great and my daughters hair looks silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tear free, it smells great, and gives me peace of mind.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice too.  </li>
            <li> I bought products to have in  my home as well as for my daughter to keep handy to use in her home.</li>
            <li> great product with quick shipping and sturdy packaging</li>
            <li> We have been lice free since and my girls like using this shampoo every now and then because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does have a strong smell but after you wash your hair with it it smells very nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Great item, shipped fast!</li>
            <li> purchased this for a family to help with a lice situation and the smell was very light and not over powering.</li>
            <li> And it smells nice and makes it easy to comb hair after.</li>
            <li> smell good and make her hair smooth and easy to brush.</li>
            <li> First of all this shampoo is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> We love the smell.</li>
            <li> Must be working too, as we&#x27;re lice free!</li>
            <li> It seems to be keeping further outbreaks at bay and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair and I use the shampoo on my hair too and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> and I was sure he had to have SOMETHING in his hair until he told me that.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this shampoo and conditioner and the leave-in spray.  </li>
            <li> bug.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner smells great that my whole family uses it routinely; including my toddler.&lt;br /&gt;Recommending</li>
            <li> I love these products.</li>
            <li> So glad to finally find these wonderful products that work so wonderful, and actually do what they say it does.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It does have a distinct smell but seems to be a good shampoo that is keeping my daughter&#x27;s hair healthy.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> We love the smell and it helps bring peace of mind when sending them off to school.  </li>
            <li> I get migraines from scents and I am able to handle the fragrance even with my sensitivity to smells.  </li>
            <li> I might still use it intermittently on my son to make sure he doesn&#x27;t get lice from school again</li>
            <li> Even I enjoyed the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the texture... nice and rich and lathers up well.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Lather up nicely and wash out cleanly.</li>
            <li> Who knows whether this product does its job, but it smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li> She smells very clean, and maybe a bit like a Christmas candle.  </li>
            <li> but my husband liked it so much that I had to buy some more!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this to get rid of lice if you are already dealing with them, but it does work very well paired with another product to keep them away, and also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> now I think, but it really wasn&#x27;t pleasant for me to use this product.  </li>
            <li> Working great so far!</li>
            <li> My daughter kept getting lice over and over and after using Fairy Tales she has been clean since using it!</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my kids and my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The hair is soft, smells great.</li>
            <li> no inside seal on the shampoo or conditioner Which aggravates me since the shampoo isn&#x27;t filled to the top.  </li>
            <li> Best money I have ever spent on Amazon to never have to go through that nightmare ever again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, no lice so far</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo with a fresh smell that repels lice well.</li>
            <li> Good product to use for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Now as far as keeping bugs away, I am sure it works, it just wasn&#x27;t pleasant to use for me.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.  </li>
            <li> It is too strong, it broke my daughter out severely</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried that this product would make my daughters hair smell to strongly of the rosemary and tea tree</li>
            <li> and my daughters hair has stayed healthy and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and it really works!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the smell and my hair which is curly actually looked better than it does with all the gobs of stuff I use to try and make it look cute.</li>
            <li> so I really would not know what good shampoo is supposed to do except clean.....</li>
            <li> I love the Fair Tails products in general.  </li>
            <li> or we have been lucky!</li>
            <li> It lease my daughter&#x27;s hair smooth</li>
            <li> I also bought the spray, which I still use sometimes to help smooth out snarly hair.</li>
            <li> , they are both lice free all year.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but dries out my 2 year old&#x27;s scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it&#x27;s all natural, I would feel good about using it as an every day shampoo/conditioner anyway.  </li>
            <li> It is great to have a natural product not made of synthetic pesticide harmful ingredients that can be absorbed in the body.  </li>
            <li> so I trust their recommendation and so far so good.</li>
            <li> smells good, leaves hair soft</li>
            <li> I think it smells very nice, and it seems to work well simply as regular shampoo and conditioner too.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for an upcoming mission trip with my daughter, so I can&#x27;t provide a review as to a lice deterrent yet, but as a normal shampoo/conditioner I can tell you it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this how this shampoo and conditioner has worked for my 6-year-old daughter.</li>
            <li> She has that super-fine hair that lice just love to grab on to, so whenever some kid comes to school with lice, she is one of the first to get it.</li>
            <li> Also great for detangling  long hair .</li>
            <li> Smells great, cute packaging, a little pricey but</li>
            <li> Within 2 days the lice were gone and the product is safe so you can use it everyday, also it spells good and is not a bad shampoo either way!</li>
            <li> It smells incredible and the little one likes it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about Fairy tale products.</li>
            <li> love the smell also that the whole family uses it to prevent and keep nits and lice at bay.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t worry about lice as much now that the outbreak has subsided at her school, I love using these all-natural, great-smelling hair products on her.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner are lightweight and have a light fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> But it does smell nice and it leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Still full of chemicals, just not the pesticides found in lice shampoo.</li>
            <li> I gave it a good try and even a second chance</li>
            <li> I do use other shampoo and conditioner on days she doesn&#x27;t attend, because I don&#x27;t think this conditions her hair that great.</li>
            <li> And luckily we had been using it for about 3 weeks when there was an outbreak of lice at school.</li>
            <li> I am sure it does the job, but I actually had better results from covering my son&#x27;s head with food grade oil and letting it sit for an hour then combing with a terminator pic.  </li>
            <li> I only wish they were a bit more affordable!</li>
            <li> It smells really great too, so your kids don&#x27;t smell funny as with the other products.</li>
            <li> Great product, was recommended for use by Naughty Nits - who knew lice don&#x27;t like the smell of rosemary?!  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and no lice for my daughter so far this school year</li>
            <li> And lice pops up repeatedly in the elementary schools throughout the year.</li>
            <li> We use Fairy Tale products for both of my elementary school girls.  </li>
            <li> Had a lice outbreak at the elementary school.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my daughter was free and clear.</li>
            <li> but I also would use it for camping since bugs generally avoid most of the oils in it too.</li>
            <li> Really, a good alternative to the typical lice shampoos.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s doing its job thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been shampooing and conditioning my daughter&#x27;s hair with Fairy Tales since the first time she got lice three years ago.  </li>
            <li> Whatever can prevent lice infection, I&#x27;m willing to try.</li>
            <li> My daughters have not had lice while using it yet, but there also haven&#x27;t been any lice outbreaks that I know of recently either, so we have not been able to test it in that regard.</li>
            <li> Now I check her hair 2-3 times a week to make sure it hasn&#x27;t come back</li>
            <li> and I have a piece of mind knowing I am being proactive against a school epidemic ;)</li>
            <li> I actually need to buy more of these.</li>
            <li> Not only about lice, but because the product contains ingredients that are healthier for children than most store-bought shampoos.  </li>
            <li> : What do you like about your new special shampoo and conditioner?&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Leaves my daughter hair super soft!!</li>
            <li> I have never used an all natural product that worked....until now!!!!</li>
            <li> We have heard lots of positive feedback about this and have been using it for 4 months since we had an outbreak in the house of lice.  </li>
            <li> And the most important thing is actually pick the nits daily.  </li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the minty smell, but it faded into a soft, almost sweet, scent and left my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Lice do not like certain smells,</li>
            <li> Not sure if my kids were ever really exposed or not, but this shampoo/conditioner smells good and is gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the product itself is very strong, but I could have gotten used to that if it had left my hair feeling soft and normal, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely use this product again for lice prevention</li>
            <li> Two years later and still lice free.</li>
            <li> That being said, they are very close</li>
            <li> Its very pungent, but nothing about it is offensive to me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really look at that as being a downer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this line of products!</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t Lather all that much</li>
            <li> and they are coming out so much easier.</li>
            <li> My child and I both really like the smell</li>
            <li> and I will keep using it throughout the school year because no one wants a repeat lice experience.</li>
            <li> My hair is also NOT chemically treated, I do not color nor have I really ever permed my hair so there is no way it is reacting to a chemical I already had in my hair.  </li>
            <li> mine has always been very fine dark blonde hair, almost light brown</li>
            <li> The most important thing is that I have a little peace of mind, especially since no hitchhikers have jumped on for a ride since we&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel a little more secure about the lice situation, but I don&#x27;t know if it does actually help repel them or not.</li>
            <li> The reason I have given this item such a low rating is because I used it too just to make sure I didn&#x27;t get the lice from my son when he had it and</li>
            <li> We had a lot of success using LiceMD for the initial treatment and using this to prevent</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell healthy and protects from getting lice without the use of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe I&#x27;m crazy, but I love the smell of these products.  </li>
            <li> And then daily after that for the first one week.  </li>
            <li> yr old kids have never had lice (KNOCK WOOD!)</li>
            <li> co-worker of mine recommended the product and cross my fingers that she made it through the first month without a</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, it totally took care of the problem, and fast!  </li>
            <li> her hair is smooth and shiny and a lot less tangled too.</li>
            <li> We were much more successful using this with the stainless steel comb than using the terrible Rit shampoo and plastic shaver comb.  </li>
            <li> defense!&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are mild enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Great smelling shampoo, a little hard to work into a lather</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be affecting my 4 year old&#x27;s scalp.</li>
            <li> Hopefully will repel any critters, so far my children have had no problem.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d go natural from now on</li>
            <li> So far, she has not had lice.</li>
            <li> So far after 3 use in 5 days while using a head lice comb 90% of the population has died in none have return or wish to get in my hair</li>
            <li> So far it has worked.</li>
            <li> So far no lice.</li>
            <li> I treated her, used this to wash and checked her everyday after and we are free.</li>
            <li> It has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> We hired a professional company at that time to get rid of the lice and they recommended it</li>
            <li> So far no reoccurrence</li>
            <li> I bought this after my 2 year old came home with lice after staying the night at her cousins.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s just not fair to the children, when it&#x27;s not their fault and they are too young to be able to help it.</li>
            <li> Almost ready to pay for a nit-picker service, to go through her long blond</li>
            <li> but if you really want to get something worth the money and all your hard work, but not have to spend hours wokimg to get rid of them, then I recommend these products.</li>
            <li> So far the shampoo and conditioner have kept my daughter clear, despite several girls in her class getting lice.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and shiny and I came home with no lice!</li>
            <li> Whether it actually prevents or not, I don&#x27;t know but so far, no outbreak</li>
            <li> My 11-year old granddaughter uses this exclusively because head-lice has traveled though her school several times.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product actually helps or not, but I like the scent and that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I never expected this..</li>
            <li> Only downfall is that it&#x27;s not tear-free, so I had to help my 7 year old daughter wash her hair with it.</li>
            <li> The first rise produced two dead louse floaters.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed it does make your hair feel very soft, as some other reviewers have noted.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I feel it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> Wow, in tandem with Lice MD this product wiped out my children&#x27;s Lice problem, when four other products did nothing.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really prevents lice infection but don&#x27;t mind letting my daughters using it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair and does not want any friends riding along.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping</li>
            <li> After contacting the nurse and being told that lice wasn&#x27;t considered a &#x27;health hazard&#x27; by AISD, so no classroom wide lice checks would be performed, even after several kids were found to have it, I bought this stuff as well and the detangle spray.  </li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a girl&#x27;s long hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always make sure I have these in my household just in case, and to keep these nasty bugs away from my family!!!you really want to get something worth the money and all your hard work, but not have to spend hours wokimg to get rid of them, then I recommend these products.</li>
            <li> The second week, I picked every other day.</li>
            <li> She has very long curly hair and the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather have dry hair than head lice.</li>
            <li> Done wonders for detangling my daughters hair and also For curing our dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li> They single them out like they got the plague</li>
            <li> We had previously tried the Rid and another OTC product definitely go with this over that stuff.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for kids hair products especially if you use it 4x/week.</li>
            <li> After a few infestations, I finally placed an order for this and the Fairy Tales Repel Conditioning Spray.  </li>
            <li> All times we spent HOURS washing clothes and checking her hair.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this as long as my child is around other children!</li>
            <li> it to other parents who don&#x27;t want to deal with the bugs.</li>
            <li> My kids are having issues with lice between their father&#x27;s house, school, and other kids at church that we have noticed lice in their hair, which they say is dandruff and its not.</li>
            <li> Went to use it on her hair after her treatment and found the bottles half empty.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out and made a head dry and flaky</li>
            <li> Just as expected!!</li>
            <li> I have treated my kids with all of the over the counter mess for lice and used the lice checklist (cleaning bedding, etc).</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for avoiding the treatment chemicals and the endless cleaning that lice brings.</li>
            <li> I got it for the little one</li>
            <li> but I think it works well, it does give me a little bit of comfort in knowing it helps repel bugs</li>
            <li> given all the harsh stuff in the chemicals...</li>
            <li> so decided to use this as an everyday shampoo/conditioner as preventative.  </li>
            <li> I use that everyday, it smells good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> During the school year this is my kids everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> My sister in law introduced US to this a few weeks before school started.</li>
            <li> I have even gone back at a later date and used it on a camping trip because I thought it would help keep the bugs away and thinking maybe I imagined how horrible it dried my hair out, but I got the same dry straw feeling result.  </li>
            <li> Nobody&#x27;s  gotten lice since we started using it a few months ago, which is due to either this product or dumb luck.</li>
            <li> No more lice.</li>
            <li> Harsh product!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have done it a few months ago!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet</li>
            <li> We had an outbreak of lice a few months ago, and a woman I work with recommended these products to keep the lice away once we were rid of them (thank God!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always make sure I have these in my household just in case, and to keep these nasty bugs away from my family!!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this helped re-infestation</li>
            <li> Using the small bottles to test to see if it would work.</li>
            <li> My mom bought these for the elementary aged girls after we had a horrible instance of head lice.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed, product was taped closed for shipping, I had to peel tape off to open shampoo and now the bottle is sticky.</li>
            <li> After using Nix and spending two hours combing, I desperately wanted something that would kill any lice still left.</li>
            <li> was at wits end with doing two rounds of chemical treatment at least every year.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had to fight these nasty little bugs quite a bit lately.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, but I think that these lice are infesting their school, but the school personnel haven&#x27;t done anything about this problem at all.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the shampoo and conditioner, after the treatment, keep washing hair with shampoo and apply the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Parents you need this for yourself and for your kids even if you don&#x27;t have any this bad boys will keep them out.</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> The way they treat the poor kids that get caught having lice is just cruel.</li>
            <li> We also bought the repellent spray.</li>
            <li> I now use it, and my daughter does too because she now knows how miserable it is.</li>

            <li> Great item, shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and no lice for my daughter so far this school year so it&#x27;s doing its job thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been shampooing and conditioning my daughter&#x27;s hair with Fairy Tales since the first time she got lice three years ago.  Despite the use of the shampoo and conditioner every day, she got lice AGAIN!  Her friend that she plays with at recess had lice so maybe it was inevitable.  I now have her wear her hair in a pony tail and spray the conditioning spray on her daily to see if that helps.  I went online to read reviews of products because I am now looking for a different product.</li>
            <li> First of all this shampoo is AMAZING!  It smells great and makes my kids and my hair soft and manageable.  I am a nurse and often have to assess clients for lice. I have seen a lot of people struggle with lice removal and keeping them away.  I have recommended this product to many clients and it has helped! I like having this product at home to use regularly in case I bring home lice from my work, or my kids do from school.  Lice do not like certain smells, tea tree oil, rosemary, lavender, all are in this shampoo. The lice will not stay by smells they don&#x27;t like.  This shampoo does what it says REPELS them!  Great products!</li>
            <li> Product is good, but the containers leaked when arrived.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  Not too strong.  My daughter has long hair and does not want any friends riding along.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping it works good</li>
            <li> We use all the products and my daughter had not gotten lice even with two outbreaks in her class! Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well it works for lice prevention since my girls have only been using it for a short period of time, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t condition well enough. My kids have never had lice and I hope they never do, so I bought this when I saw and email go out to the school about lice. It didn&#x27;t say there was a case of it in the school but I don&#x27;t remember getting this email last year so it freaked me out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teacher. My school is infested with lice but I haven&#x27;t gotten it yet. I swear by this stuff. Get the spray in conditioner too. I like to sprtitz my hair and an occasional kid or two or twenty while at work. Smells like Rosemary. It is an acquired scent but I&#x27;ve grown to like it. Dries my hair out but I&#x27;d rather have dry hair than head lice.</li>
            <li> I like these and definitely want to prevent lice in our household.  It smells pleasant and would recommend.</li>
            <li> its great product, Love it. The hair is soft, smells great. No more lice.</li>
            <li> My daughter kept coming home from school with lice last year.  After contacting the nurse and being told that lice wasn&#x27;t considered a &#x27;health hazard&#x27; by AISD, so no classroom wide lice checks would be performed, even after several kids were found to have it, I bought this stuff as well and the detangle spray.  She hasn&#x27;t had any problems since!  I think it&#x27;s a lifesaver!!!</li>
            <li> So far the shampoo and conditioner have kept my daughter clear, despite several girls in her class getting lice. We are on our second order, since the stuff worked so well last year. Here&#x27;s to hoping it continues to work so well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for kids but makes my hair too oily.</li>
            <li> the best anti lice product out there. I started my daughter on this before she started pre k. since then in two years, both her classes broke out in lice. my daughter didn&#x27;t.....this stuff works!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great and does a great job in the detangling department. My daughter&#x27;s hair was damaged from sun and chlorine from the pool this summer and it repaired her damaged hair as well. Shiny, healthy looking hair and recommended by her school as great product to deter lice.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. My daughter likes using these shampoo and conditioner because of the smell. Not sure if it really prevents lice infection but don&#x27;t mind letting my daughters using it. Whatever can prevent lice infection, I&#x27;m willing to try. Had to deal with the problem once when my daughter got it from her school. What a pain to treat and fix the problem!</li>
            <li> Just as expected!! Leaves my daughter hair super soft!!</li>
            <li> We love the smell. Will be keeping a stock during the school year.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great product</li>
            <li> Smells good, but dries out my 2 year old&#x27;s scalp. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be affecting my 4 year old&#x27;s scalp. Must be working too, as we&#x27;re lice free!</li>
            <li> Nice smelling product that makes hair look great.  Hopefully will repel any critters, so far my children have had no problem.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  I think it smells very nice, and it seems to work well simply as regular shampoo and conditioner too.  My daughters have not had lice while using it yet, but there also haven&#x27;t been any lice outbreaks that I know of recently either, so we have not been able to test it in that regard.</li>
            <li> Smells great, cute packaging, a little pricey but product goes along way</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the texture... nice and rich and lathers up well.  I bought it initially because we had a lice outbreak.  But I had already treated the family with chemicals.  Thought I&#x27;d go natural from now on given all the harsh stuff in the chemicals... so decided to use this as an everyday shampoo/conditioner as preventative.  Whether it actually prevents or not, I don&#x27;t know but so far, no outbreak again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s all natural, I would feel good about using it as an every day shampoo/conditioner anyway.  About to reorder!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about Fairy tale products. After our daughter had lice we all began using this stuff a couple of times a week. It seems to be keeping further outbreaks at bay and it smells wonderful. We also use the leave in conditioner as an extra precaution.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo with a fresh smell that repels lice well.</li>
            <li> Great works as stated</li>
            <li> I assume it works well since we use it as a precaution.. I just can&#x27;t stand the smell..</li>
            <li> well she&#x27;s been using it for a month and i haven&#x27;t seen any Lice. she was coming home like every week or so with lice before.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It lease my daughter&#x27;s hair smooth and I feel like it might be helping with the lice at my daughter&#x27;s school.</li>
            <li> I used both items as a preventative measure while working in an orphanage overseas where lice was prevalent. I absolutely loved the smell and my hair which is curly actually looked better than it does with all the gobs of stuff I use to try and make it look cute. It left my hair soft and shiny and I came home with no lice! I would absolutely use this product again for lice prevention but I also would use it for camping since bugs generally avoid most of the oils in it too. Best item ever!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  Two years later and still lice free.</li>
            <li> Harsh product! Causes almost burn like rash on my daughter after only two days of spraying her hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter attends day care and they have had lice outbreaks a couple of times. I use this on her day care days along with the conditioning spray. So far, she has not had lice. I am giving it 5 stars because it seems to have worked for my initial purpose. I do use other shampoo and conditioner on days she doesn&#x27;t attend, because I don&#x27;t think this conditions her hair that great.</li>
            <li> purchased this for a family to help with a lice situation and the smell was very light and not over powering.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, product was taped closed for shipping, I had to peel tape off to open shampoo and now the bottle is sticky. no inside seal on the shampoo or conditioner Which aggravates me since the shampoo isn&#x27;t filled to the top.  Not up to amazon standards</li>
            <li> Have been using this for the last week on my kindergartener. She has very long curly hair and the shampoo and conditioner smell good and make her hair smooth and easy to brush. Hopefully it will keep the bugs away! If it does, I would give this product 5 stars!! So far, so good!</li>
            <li> After using Nix and spending two hours combing, I desperately wanted something that would kill any lice still left. This shampoo and conditioner did it. And it smells nice and makes it easy to comb hair after. I also bought the spray, which I still use sometimes to help smooth out snarly hair. Thank you Fairy Tales!</li>
            <li> Great product, smells great</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted this head lice out. So far after 3 use in 5 days while using a head lice comb 90% of the population has died in none have return or wish to get in my hair lol. I recommend this along with the spray too. Parents you need this for yourself and for your kids even if you don&#x27;t have any this bad boys will keep them out. People with head lice this are your helpers.</li>
            <li> It is great to have a natural product not made of synthetic pesticide harmful ingredients that can be absorbed in the body.  Ofcourse, like any treatment, you need to do another treatment after 2 weeks.  We did it after 1 week actually, and repeated it the following week.  And the most important thing is actually pick the nits daily.  I picked my daughters nits for 7 hours the day after I found out she got infected.  And then daily after that for the first one week.  The second week, I picked every other day. The third week, I picked 2-3 times that week.  Now I check her hair 2-3 times a week to make sure it hasn&#x27;t come back or she hasn&#x27;t been reinfected by schoolmates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love the smell also that the whole family uses it to prevent and keep nits and lice at bay.</li>
            <li> This product did not work! When we found out that the kids in school had lice again.. I checked my daughter and she did not have it. So we purchased the shampoo, conditioner and the hair spray to keep the lice away. It did not work!  She got lice after all the preventative measurements we went through! I ended up taking her to a lice removal place and paying 150 dollars for their services. Don&#x27;t bother sepnding your money on  these products...</li>
            <li> great product with quick shipping and sturdy packaging</li>
            <li> I bought this to help keep my daughters from getting lice. So far it has worked. It also has a great smell to it. I wouldn&#x27;t mind just buying it for myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over a year now, and I love it! Works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair and I use the shampoo on my hair too and it works very well.  So far no lice. But I also hair spray my daughter&#x27;s hair because lice do not like hairspray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this how this shampoo and conditioner has worked for my 6-year-old daughter. She has that super-fine hair that lice just love to grab on to, so whenever some kid comes to school with lice, she is one of the first to get it. We had a lot of success using LiceMD for the initial treatment and using this to prevent re-infestation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t take my word for it. I went to the source for a testimonial...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: What do you like about your new special shampoo and conditioner?&lt;br /&gt;My 6yo daughter: I like that I don&#x27;t get lice anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Me : Do you like the way it smells?&lt;br /&gt;6yo: Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Me: Do you like the way it feels?&lt;br /&gt;6yo: Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Me: Is there anything else you like about it?&lt;br /&gt;6yo: It makes my hair sooooooooooo silky!</li>
            <li> If you are dealing with lice let me tell you, you NEED this. I got this for my daughter as a preventative measure for the school year. She didn&#x27;t use it. She got lice. Bad. Checked my son and nothing. Went to use it on her hair after her treatment and found the bottles half empty. So I asked her if she wasn&#x27;t using it why so much was missing. My son chimes in and says &amp;#34;oh I use that everyday, it smells good&amp;#34;. That being said, they are very close and I was sure he had to have SOMETHING in his hair until he told me that. The relief I felt of not having to pick at two kids was unmeasurable. I now use it, and my daughter does too because she now knows how miserable it is. This is not a treatment. This will not rid you of lice. But I have seen it keep lice off of a kid who couldn&#x27;t be any closer to somebody infested. I treated her, used this to wash and checked her everyday after and we are free. I just recently purchased the biggest bottles I could because we are almost out. Best money I have ever spent on Amazon to never have to go through that nightmare ever again.</li>
            <li> After a few infestations, I finally placed an order for this and the Fairy Tales Repel Conditioning Spray.  I can&#x27;t believe it, but I haven&#x27;t seen a nit in 2 weeks now.  I wish I would have done it a few months ago!  The fragrance is pleasant, the packaging is charming, and my child doesn&#x27;t feel like she&#x27;s doing a treatment.  I will definitely keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe I&#x27;m crazy, but I love the smell of these products.  Its very pungent, but nothing about it is offensive to me.  She smells very clean, and maybe a bit like a Christmas candle.  :)  I don&#x27;t really look at that as being a downer.  The most important thing is that I have a little peace of mind, especially since no hitchhikers have jumped on for a ride since we&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Living in south Florida, nothing dies. And lice pops up repeatedly in the elementary schools throughout the year. We use the shampoo, conditioner and leave-in conditioning spray and my 6 and 8 yr old kids have never had lice (KNOCK WOOD!) I also mandate that my daughter&#x27;s hair is worn up for school, no exceptions. Small price to pay for avoiding the treatment chemicals and the endless cleaning that lice brings. I highly recommend this line of products!</li>
            <li> I bought this for an upcoming mission trip with my daughter, so I can&#x27;t provide a review as to a lice deterrent yet, but as a normal shampoo/conditioner I can tell you it&#x27;s amazing. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the minty smell, but it faded into a soft, almost sweet, scent and left my hair very soft and shiny. I love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this shampoo and conditioner and the leave-in spray.  Her hair is so shiny and manageable and smells so good after.</li>
            <li> Good product. My son&#x27;s hair is shinny and I have a piece of mind knowing I am being proactive against a school epidemic ;)</li>
            <li> I have never used an all natural product that worked....until now!!!! Wow, in tandem with Lice MD this product wiped out my children&#x27;s Lice problem, when four other products did nothing. The first rise produced two dead louse floaters. Within 2 days the lice were gone and the product is safe so you can use it everyday, also it spells good and is not a bad shampoo either way! I am of course the father so I really would not know what good shampoo is supposed to do except clean.....all you hair shampoo Nazis out there hahahhaa.</li>
            <li> My 11-year old granddaughter uses this exclusively because head-lice has traveled though her school several times.  She wound up getting a case of them and heard about Fairy Tales from a friend.  No head lice for her since -- and it has travelled through the school since.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet but my child loves the smell and said that it feels good on her hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter was getting lice every fall.&lt;br /&gt;I was at wits end with doing two rounds of chemical treatment at least every year. Almost ready to pay for a nit-picker service, to go through her long blond hair.&lt;br /&gt;A co-worker of mine recommended the product and cross my fingers that she made it through the first month without a bug.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner smells great that my whole family uses it routinely; including my toddler.&lt;br /&gt;Recommending it to other parents who don&#x27;t want to deal with the bugs.</li>
            <li> I love these products. We had an outbreak of lice a few months ago, and a woman I work with recommended these products to keep the lice away once we were rid of them (thank God!) Even though I don&#x27;t worry about lice as much now that the outbreak has subsided at her school, I love using these all-natural, great-smelling hair products on her. I only wish they were a bit more affordable!</li>
            <li> I have 4 children and I&#x27;ve had to fight these nasty little bugs quite a bit lately. Three of my kids are school age and all three has been sent home from school 3 times already this school year! Sad to say, but I think that these lice are infesting their school, but the school personnel haven&#x27;t done anything about this problem at all. The way they treat the poor kids that get caught having lice is just cruel. They single them out like they got the plague and that&#x27;s just not fair to the children, when it&#x27;s not their fault and they are too young to be able to help it. I have treated my kids with all of the over the counter mess for lice and used the lice checklist (cleaning bedding, etc). I&#x27;d keep my kids home for the 3 days they mandate they remain at home, then I&#x27;d bring them back in to the school nurse to get cleared to go back to school. My kids would go maybe about 2 months without any itching or anything, then all of a sudden, here is the school nurse calling me again to go pick them up, with yet another case of the lice!!! So I scoured Amazon looking for the best products, based on reviews and first tried Lice Killer. It is another great product! Then after I got that in, I was still browsing for something to keep the lice out. That&#x27;s when I saw Fairy Tales. I ordered the shampoo, conditioner, conditioning spray and also Happy Heads Bye Bye LiceTreatment Family size box. The Happy Heads works amazing! It feels awesome on your head and it kills all the lice in 20 minutes!! I followed up with the Fairy Tales items and ever since, not one lice has been back!! My kids and I wash our hair with the shampoo and conditioner every night, and in the morning before school I spray them with the conditioning spray. So glad to finally find these wonderful products that work so wonderful, and actually do what they say it does. It smells really great too, so your kids don&#x27;t smell funny as with the other products. Yes you can still use Rid or Nix or the others at WalMart but if you really want to get something worth the money and all your hard work, but not have to spend hours wokimg to get rid of them, then I recommend these products. I&#x27;ll always make sure I have these in my household just in case, and to keep these nasty bugs away from my family!!!you really want to get something worth the money and all your hard work, but not have to spend hours wokimg to get rid of them, then I recommend these products. I&#x27;ll always make sure I have these in my household just in case, and to keep these nasty bugs away from my family!!!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Dubious repelling power.  Smells wonderful though.  :)</li>
            <li> Works great, kids like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell healthy and protects from getting lice without the use of harsh chemicals. Wonderful spa like smell.</li>
            <li> Works great and never had a problem with lice even if another kid in class has them. Gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I actually need to buy more of these. They smell great and my daughters hair looks silky and smooth. Also no lice back since using this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this to get rid of lice if you are already dealing with them, but it does work very well paired with another product to keep them away, and also has a pleasant smell. I use it on my children once a week and haven&#x27;t had a problem in years, and I have two in public school.</li>
            <li> It has worked well so far. It does have a distinct smell but seems to be a good shampoo that is keeping my daughter&#x27;s hair healthy.</li>
            <li> It is too strong, it broke my daughter out severely</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about a week now. No lice have returned to our house. The shampoo does have a strong smell but after you wash your hair with it it smells very nice and clean. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t Lather all that much but that is because of the ingredients it is made from. Done wonders for detangling my daughters hair and also For curing our dry scalp issues.I am really impressed with this product and will buy Again. Good product to use for the whole family.</li>
            <li> During the school year this is my kids everyday shampoo. We have the entire line.  None of my kids have gotten lice yet, so its either working or we have been lucky!</li>
            <li> Really, a good alternative to the typical lice shampoos.  We were much more successful using this with the stainless steel comb than using the terrible Rit shampoo and plastic shaver comb.  We have been lice free since and my girls like using this shampoo every now and then because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried that this product would make my daughters hair smell to strongly of the rosemary and tea tree but it doesn&#x27;t.  I bought it to prevent my daughter from getting any lice because it had been going around her class at school. She never did get them so I will continue to use this as a prevention.</li>
            <li> My sister in law introduced US to this a few weeks before school started. And luckily we had been using it for about 3 weeks when there was an outbreak of lice at school. Luckily, my daughter was free and clear. Both the shampoo and conditioner are lightweight and have a light fresh fragrance. Lather up nicely and wash out cleanly. Coupled with the daily leave in conditioning repellant spray, she is well armed! :)  her hair is smooth and shiny and a lot less tangled too. Buy it if you don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> Received products yesterday, my granddaughter just loved them saying that she smelled like a flower</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing! Last year we used the fairy take spray and my girls never got lice but this year I decided to get the shampoo set too for extra protection since there was a big lice outbreak in her class and this seems to help using this set and the spray , they are both lice free all year.</li>
            <li> Great smell and we didn&#x27;t get lice knock on wood!!</li>
            <li> Worked for us. Everyone else got lice and couldn&#x27;t get rid of it but we kept it away with this product.</li>
            <li> Does what it says.  Have to use it regularly to get the benefits.</li>
            <li> We use Fairy Tale products for both of my elementary school girls.  We love the smell and it helps bring peace of mind when sending them off to school.  We love that they are all-natural and not oily!</li>
            <li> Great deal; wonderful, family-friendly products.</li>
            <li> My niece was getting lice over and over again...Everything we tried did not work and thus she missed almost 3 months of school. When my mother called me from Kentucky to let me know what was going on...I immediately purchased this and the lice eradicator foam mouse....she has had no problems since using this.</li>
            <li> I work in a school and have been freaked out by a big surge in head lice cases this year! I don&#x27;t know if this product actually helps or not, but I like the scent and that it is all natural. It makes me feel a little more secure about the lice situation, but I don&#x27;t know if it does actually help repel them or not.</li>
            <li> Great product to prevent lice</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this helped re-infestation or it was something else we did.  As we were doing and using multiple things at once.  It does have a great smell we all liked.  But, they didn&#x27;t get reinfected.</li>
            <li> It does not prevent lice. Period. But it does smell nice and it leaves hair soft and shiny. But lice prevention? NO. We used it. Religiously. We got lice. And then we had to spend $300 getting rid of the lice.</li>
            <li> Working great so far!</li>
            <li> Not as natural as their bottle or marketing tries to portray. Still full of chemicals, just not the pesticides found in lice shampoo.</li>
            <li> We have heard lots of positive feedback about this and have been using it for 4 months since we had an outbreak in the house of lice.  We hired a professional company at that time to get rid of the lice and they recommended it so I trust their recommendation and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I never expected this.. but it did do the job of removing all the lice !!!</li>
            <li> Every year you can guarantee that there will be a case of lice in the classroom.  This is your best defense!&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are mild enough for daily use.  I get migraines from scents and I am able to handle the fragrance even with my sensitivity to smells.  The rosemary smell is what is supposed to repel the lice.  We have begun to use it daily and my daughters hair has stayed healthy and so far so good.  Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My kids are having issues with lice between their father&#x27;s house, school, and other kids at church that we have noticed lice in their hair, which they say is dandruff and its not. We put this in their hair and there is a great lice comb they sell here on Amazon and they are coming out so much easier. We had previously tried the Rid and another OTC product definitely go with this over that stuff. We also bought the repellent spray.</li>
            <li> Smells great, no lice so far</li>
            <li> smells good, leaves hair soft</li>
            <li> It smells great!  My child and I both really like the smell and I have noticed it does make your hair feel very soft, as some other reviewers have noted.  We will keep using this one.</li>
            <li> Smells good and repels lice. I bought these for my daughter for camp and now that&#x27;s all we use for her hair. Also great for detangling  long hair . A little pricey for kids hair products especially if you use it 4x/week.</li>
            <li> Had a lice outbreak at the elementary school. Once we got rid of them, we started using this plus the repel spray religiously. So far no reoccurrence and I will keep using it throughout the school year because no one wants a repeat lice experience.</li>
            <li> Who knows whether this product does its job, but it smells nice and clean. Nobody&#x27;s  gotten lice since we started using it a few months ago, which is due to either this product or dumb luck.</li>
            <li> It worked great thank u for the product</li>
            <li> I am sure it does the job, but I actually had better results from covering my son&#x27;s head with food grade oil and letting it sit for an hour then combing with a terminator pic.  The reason I have given this item such a low rating is because I used it too just to make sure I didn&#x27;t get the lice from my son when he had it and this shampoo made my hair feel like straw.  I might still use it intermittently on my son to make sure he doesn&#x27;t get lice from school again but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a girl&#x27;s long hair.  I don&#x27;t know, maybe it is different for different types of hair........mine has always been very fine dark blonde hair, almost light brown now I think, but it really wasn&#x27;t pleasant for me to use this product.  The smell of the product itself is very strong, but I could have gotten used to that if it had left my hair feeling soft and normal, but it didn&#x27;t.  I have even gone back at a later date and used it on a camping trip because I thought it would help keep the bugs away and thinking maybe I imagined how horrible it dried my hair out, but I got the same dry straw feeling result.  My hair is also NOT chemically treated, I do not color nor have I really ever permed my hair so there is no way it is reacting to a chemical I already had in my hair.  I gave it a good try and even a second chance but, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Now as far as keeping bugs away, I am sure it works, it just wasn&#x27;t pleasant to use for me.</li>
            <li> Here it is a couple of months later of using this product on a regular basis. At the time of purchase my daughter had the rid x system done twice and the prescription lice treatment done twice. All times we spent HOURS washing clothes and checking her hair. It just kept coming back. After the second prescription treatment we ordered this product. Using the small bottles to test to see if it would work. We also ordered the conditioning spray. We would wash and condition. Then every day before school use the spray. She has not had lice since. This stuff is amazing and it really works!</li>
            <li> This is one incredible shampoo.  It smells incredible and the little one likes it a lot.  Also used to keep Lice away.  I got it for the little one but my husband liked it so much that I had to buy some more!</li>
            <li> Great smelling shampoo, a little hard to work into a lather but I think it works well, it does give me a little bit of comfort in knowing it helps repel bugs</li>
            <li> I bought this after my 2 year old came home with lice after staying the night at her cousins.  I bought the combo pack that has the leave in conditioner along with the shampoo and conditioner.  We love it! The smell is nice too.  She recently stayed the night at her cousins (Who STILL had head lice) and my daughter did NOT get it!  I will keep buying this as long as my child is around other children!</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I now use on my kiddos.  It&#x27;s tear free, it smells great, and gives me peace of mind.  Not only about lice, but because the product contains ingredients that are healthier for children than most store-bought shampoos.  A little goes a long way, and I feel it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out and made a head dry and flaky</li>
            <li> My daughter kept getting lice over and over and after using Fairy Tales she has been clean since using it! Gonna continue to buy when needed.</li>
            <li> My daughter had lice...twice...she kept bringing it home.  Chemical shampoos didn&#x27;t take care of her problem.  I used the Fairy Tales shampoo, conditioner, conditioning spray and hair spray. Oh my goodness, it totally took care of the problem, and fast!  I spray her hair before school now, and it&#x27;s totally gone.  I also use the products, as she had shared the lice with me.  Now we don&#x27;t have lice anymore but still use the products because they&#x27;re awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product, was recommended for use by Naughty Nits - who knew lice don&#x27;t like the smell of rosemary?!  Even I enjoyed the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo, conditioner and repel spray on my kindergartner and I have to say that it definitely provides me with some comfort and reassurance.... it also smells pretty great!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a preventative for my kiddos after some friends had a lice outbreak among their children.  Not sure if my kids were ever really exposed or not, but this shampoo/conditioner smells good and is gentle on the hair.  Only downfall is that it&#x27;s not tear-free, so I had to help my 7 year old daughter wash her hair with it.</li>
            <li> My mom bought these for the elementary aged girls after we had a horrible instance of head lice.  I don&#x27;t know if it repelled any lice, but we haven&#x27;t had any lice since we started using this shampoo.  I love the Fair Tails products in general.  One of my girl has curly hair that gets tangled easily and this shampoo and conditioner works great, as well as their detangler product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the shampoo and conditioner, after the treatment, keep washing hair with shampoo and apply the conditioner.  I also use their detangler and apply to the head prior to my grandaughter (5) going to school to prevent re-infestation.  I bought products to have in  my home as well as for my daughter to keep handy to use in her home.</li>
