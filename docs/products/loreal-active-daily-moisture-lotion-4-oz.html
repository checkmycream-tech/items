            <li>What a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Draw your own conclusions.</li>
            <li>No one liked it so ended up throwing it</li>
            <li>This is a very nice light moisture lotion.</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective!</li>
            <li>If you need to order online, Amazon has the best price I have found so far.</li>
            <li>This is very light weight</li>
            <li>This lotion was nice, but it smelled kind of funny and didn&#x27;t have a nice squeeze lid.</li>
            <li>So glad it is on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mosturizer - I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can find this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used L&#x27;Oreal SPF Futur-E Moisturizer for many years and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I can receive it again.</li>
            <li>I tried several face lotions and found this to work perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>I disagree that this product is appropriate for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer works better than my neutrogena.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d be better off buying from the mall, save yourself the worries.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I would try to find more drug store products for my face from now on.</li>
            <li>A must-have product to maintain youthful, healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part is the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 15 years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was available in CVS and Waldgreens!</li>
            <li>It is his favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Have used this for years and never found anything better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Def recommended. :)</li>
            <li>What a drugstore gem:)  </li>
            <li>Glad to see that Amazon still carries it.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it leaves my skin greasy and clammy.</li>
            <li>I mentioned to the clerk one time, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think this stuff makes me look any better&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal moisture lotion for many years.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT, have to order 2 more</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>This is okay</li>
            <li>i love that it&#x27;s spf and a quality product.</li>
            <li>and i love the porduct.</li>
            <li>and I often pour out a lot more than I needed.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I like it as well as department-store products costing much, much more.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>Definitely satisfied with the product and value though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they need a better bottle</li>
            <li>I like this stuff because it&#x27;s NOT very expensive and it feels great on my face.</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer that I have used and I have been using it for a long time (more than 5 years).</li>
            <li>While it wouldn&#x27;t be good if you have very dry skin, it is a great, lightweight lotion with SPF 15 for those with oily or combination skin.</li>
            <li>so I transferred it to a container that I had in my house, which would allow me to more easily access the lotion.</li>
            <li>You have to tip it over and shake out what you need, which makes it really easy to get WAY more product than you need.</li>
            <li>To get a sunscreen that offers ideal protection from both skin cancer &amp; premature aging, one needs what is called \\&quot;full spectrum\\&quot; sunscreen, that is, a sunscreen which blocks both UVA &amp; UVB rays.</li>
            <li>It does not have a powerful scent which is really nice.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easily absorted by the skin.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.</li>
            <li>This has a nice fresh fragrance, light weight and sun protection.</li>
            <li>Super affordable and the texture is so silky and light!  </li>
            <li>It just opens up with a huge 1 inch opening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light feel when applied, but it does not seem to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; and it leaves a greasy feeling film on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light weight but moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Make-up goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>it is incredibly light and spreads easily.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>it is so light that it does not bother me</li>
            <li>it is light but keeps my face moisturized all day...</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, enough balance to moisturize yet not make my face oily!  </li>
            <li>It does have my face looking oily and my powder goes on so smooth that I don&#x27;t even need foundation.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes lightly and doesn&#x27;t make your face greasy.  </li>
            <li>It feels so smooth on your skin,  </li>
            <li>Also wish it had higher sun screen protection!!</li>
            <li>Also like that it has simple and nice light refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and feels clean on my face.</li>
            <li>It feels silky to the touch and leaves my skin feeling clean and cool.  </li>
            <li>I always though it was because she is very well read and keeps up with her kids and grand kids.</li>
            <li>I love this product and to find it at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;m wearing moisturizer but that my face feel moisturized the WHOLE day.</li>
            <li>This last time I searched for this wonderful facial moisturizer with SPF15, I turned to the Internet and Amazon.com popped up as having it.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing anything.</li>
            <li>It feels great, relieves dryness and personally, I like the scent very well, though some may not.</li>
            <li>Absorbs in quickly and I like</li>
            <li>and secondly my dematologist said it was the best lotion for daily use on the market.</li>
            <li>The only thing better would be if the lid wasn&#x27;t removable as I seem to misplace it many mornings...</li>
            <li>I thought I might have to switch now that I&#x27;m pregnant but this moisturizer continues to prove itself.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into the skin quickly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this to be a very good moisturizer -- does not absorb as readily as others, and my face does not feel as hydrated as other products, either.</li>
            <li>Especially good on the neck area, and gentle enough to be used  near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Light, non-greasy, easily absorbed, soft lovely fragrance</li>
            <li>there is no unpleasant odor, while there IS fragrance in the lotion</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good for such a price.</li>
            <li>Dries fast on my skin and does not wash off easy.</li>
            <li>For the price, it was worth trying and may work well for others.  </li>
            <li>I use other L&#x27;Oreal products and makeup and have been very happy with them, but this moisturizer was a big disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too oily and the price was right.</li>
            <li>price was right</li>
            <li>Has SPF protection and has right thickness for a moisturizer without thinking your splashing water or alternatively putting clay on your face.  </li>
            <li>that was the exact reason I was buying this stuff in the first place!</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, absorbs quickly and has a light fragrence.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I have a fairly oily skin and this cream makes it worse.</li>
            <li>It is half the price of neutrogena too, so I think it is a good bargain.</li>
            <li>As a male, I find the fragrance light, clean and fresh with just a wee hint of hyacinth floral.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, light scent and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s daily moisturizer for 10+ years and enjoy its light feeling when I put it on my face.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>But the bottle is fairly hard and it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of spout on the top, so when you shake it you often get too much cream</li>
            <li>Many reviews say they like the scent, but I don&#x27;t personally care for it.</li>
            <li>This really can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I just love it!</li>
            <li>I was hooked on this after my first use.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>but I do really like the product inside!</li>
            <li>my forehead looks pretty greasy if i put it there, so i just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that I can&#x27;t find it in drug-stores any more.</li>
            <li>love this daily moisturizer…easy…non greasy….</li>
            <li>my face ;) for 24 hours</li>
            <li>and it does absorbed fast</li>
            <li>(I work in a very dry warehouse environment and many lotions have not passed the test of keeping my face reasonably moist throughout the full day).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products (including L&#x27;oreal products) and find they don&#x27;t offer the SPF15 or light and easy application on my face.  </li>
            <li>One of the best daily moisturizers I&#x27;ve used lately.  </li>
            <li>feel good for the entire day after applying in the morning, last till end of the day,</li>
            <li>Maybe this will be suitable for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Found the price VERY reasonable on Amazon as well, compared to  others that I found less effective.</li>
            <li>have combination skin, maybe it works better for people with dry skin?</li>
            <li>it has a large opening, so it releases a lot of moisturizer at one time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too large and</li>
            <li>I immediately placed an order for 5 bottles of it and to my surprise it was at a much lower price than I have ever purchased it before.</li>
            <li>and it did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very greasy.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>It really works well.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive - I like that.</li>
            <li>I found that it made my oily skin very shiny.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, has a light fragrance and is big: has a lot of product!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Arrived really really fast.</li>
            <li>much...</li>
            <li>and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I also wonder if it&#x27;s really supposed to be yellowish (in contrast to most moisturizers that I have tried, which are white), so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a really old stock or what.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using Future E and love the results (50 yrs old).</li>
            <li>This is a nice medium between a heavy cream and a lighter moisturizer.</li>
            <li>While it might work well for people with dry or normal skin, I think there are better choices out there for people with oily skin.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this cream L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisture Lotion on her face and body and smell so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m part Filipina, so I was brought up to not be too concerned with SPF because I never burn, but now that I&#x27;m older and realize I should be taking care of my skin, its become a real concern for me.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Active Daily Moisturizer is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would at first, because it seemed to be more liquid than I usually prefer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this as a basic daily moisturizer for many years..</li>
            <li>I have always found L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisturizer with an SPF 15 rating to be a very effective facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for women and men of all ages.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s better to use this in the colder months, as it is quite heavy and has a somewhat greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li>Very happy that Amazon still offers it since it&#x27;s impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Excellent non irritating lotion for face and other sensitive areas ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy enough to really do its job but light enough that it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face feeling refreshed all day, which is saying a lot since I live in the Vegas area...</li>
            <li>It is a new face cream given to me and it works well.</li>
            <li>and they were all new in boxes.</li>
            <li>I LIVE IN THE CARIBBEAN, SO</li>
            <li>After reading all of the great reviews, I was expecting a nice thick, soft moisturizer, but when I opened the bottle to try it out, I realized it was very thin and watery.</li>
            <li>Just spent three days at an amusement park in the middle of summer in shorts and tank top with this as my sunscreen and no sunburn.</li>
            <li>a large blob of lotion comes out sometimes when I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin(allergies) but this?&lt;br /&gt;it does what it suppose to do which is moisturizing</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and every time I would run low, I had to look for it at numerous places only to find that the item had been removed from the inventory.</li>
            <li>I like it so much better than any of the department store brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>:(  I still gave it 5 stars because what&#x27;s inside is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE about L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisture</li>
            <li>Applies easily without a heavy film.  </li>
            <li>Wow, wow, wow!  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find now though in the stores but am able to get it throught Amazon.</li>
            <li>What is great about this product is that it draws moisture from the air, and it does not clog your pores with unwanted and possibly dangerous oils.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I only wish that a product such as this was available for the entire body.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal has come up with which cost twice as much for virtually the same product.</li>
            <li>For those who are sensitive about the things they apply on their face, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>This does what far costlier moisturizers do.</li>
            <li>I have bought her 3 so far</li>
            <li>When I complained they sent me one more bottle.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth, just dab a few dots of it around your face and neck, then blend it in.</li>
            <li>to have the spf included in your face moisturizer rather than use a whole different sunscreen after lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my face soft and no flakes.</li>
            <li>With SPF 15 protection it&#x27;s really a well rounded and well priced facial moisturizer, also non-comedogenic</li>
            <li>I like how light it is where it doesn&#x27;t feel like a heavy cream.</li>
            <li>as a result, you are usually left with more moisturizer than you need for your face, which is a waste.</li>
            <li>the bottle is so hard that you have to actually really press and put strength on it to squeeze the product out, even when it is full.</li>
            <li>With this particular L&#x27;Oreal moisturizer, even after an entire day I could feel the film of moisturizer on my skin everywhere I had applied it.</li>
            <li>I occasionally use this on my face when I run out of my usual face spf, but mostly I use this as suntan lotion for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>I just got a new bottle with the label \\&quot;This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, not skin cancer or early skin</li>
            <li>but I can use it sometime on less hot summer days..!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would like L&#x27;Oreal to improve upon is the fact that the cap doesn&#x27;t have a small opening to squirt the cream, just a gaping hole that you need to manage to get the right amount of cream from, makes it a little more of a task.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but even when I tried to apply this very sparingly, I had the same feel.</li>
            <li>While I like the way it feels (not too thick, blends in easy)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s barely noticeable, SPF 15, and doesn&#x27;t break the bank to buy it.</li>
            <li>and I barely can feel it on my skin.</li>
            <li>Unnecessary to pay more.</li>
            <li>However, as nice as the bottle looks, it is difficult to handle.</li>
            <li>I never use the same lotion two bottles in a row, but I do like to revisit previous lotions if they prove their worth to me.  </li>
            <li>The container is exactly the same as the L&#x27;Oreal makeup removers, so it will probably be an issue getting the product out when it gets low (also, you may have trouble controlling the amount that comes out), otherwise, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I have what I would consider to be dry skin, and I live in an area with 25%-50% humidity.</li>
            <li>Not the best product on the market but far from the worst.</li>
            <li>This lotion does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a long time, it&#x27;s not as expensive as those department store brands, and it works even better!</li>
            <li>I tried other lotions to try to take the place of this one, in case it ever becomes completely unavailable, but I always go right back to this Active Daily lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super hard to control the flow of lotion coming out for this reason.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, yet keeps skin soft and never feeling, or looking, dry.</li>
            <li>Says on the label it is for all skin types, however I have really dry mature skin and it did nothing to hydrate.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because my skin seems to be irritated by other daily SPF moisturizers, so I decided to get this one because of the high rating it has been given.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well -- almost too well (sometimes leaving your face a little moist).</li>

            <li> This is a very nice light moisture lotion.</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective!</li>
            <li> If you need to order online, Amazon has the best price I have found so far.</li>
            <li> This is very light weight</li>
            <li> This lotion was nice, but it smelled kind of funny and didn&#x27;t have a nice squeeze lid.</li>
            <li> So glad it is on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite mosturizer - I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can find this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal SPF Futur-E Moisturizer for many years and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I can receive it again.</li>
            <li> I tried several face lotions and found this to work perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> I disagree that this product is appropriate for all skin types.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer works better than my neutrogena.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d be better off buying from the mall, save yourself the worries.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I would try to find more drug store products for my face from now on.</li>
            <li> A must-have product to maintain youthful, healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 15 years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was available in CVS and Waldgreens!</li>
            <li> It is his favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and never found anything better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Def recommended. :)</li>
            <li> What a drugstore gem:)  </li>
            <li> Glad to see that Amazon still carries it.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it leaves my skin greasy and clammy.</li>
            <li> I mentioned to the clerk one time, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think this stuff makes me look any better&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal moisture lotion for many years.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT, have to order 2 more</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> This is okay</li>
            <li> i love that it&#x27;s spf and a quality product.</li>
            <li> and i love the porduct.</li>
            <li> and I often pour out a lot more than I needed.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I like it as well as department-store products costing much, much more.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> Definitely satisfied with the product and value though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they need a better bottle</li>
            <li> I like this stuff because it&#x27;s NOT very expensive and it feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer that I have used and I have been using it for a long time (more than 5 years).</li>
            <li> While it wouldn&#x27;t be good if you have very dry skin, it is a great, lightweight lotion with SPF 15 for those with oily or combination skin.</li>
            <li> so I transferred it to a container that I had in my house, which would allow me to more easily access the lotion.</li>
            <li> You have to tip it over and shake out what you need, which makes it really easy to get WAY more product than you need.</li>
            <li> To get a sunscreen that offers ideal protection from both skin cancer &amp; premature aging, one needs what is called \\&quot;full spectrum\\&quot; sunscreen, that is, a sunscreen which blocks both UVA &amp; UVB rays.</li>
            <li> It does not have a powerful scent which is really nice.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easily absorted by the skin.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This has a nice fresh fragrance, light weight and sun protection.</li>
            <li> Super affordable and the texture is so silky and light!  </li>
            <li> It just opens up with a huge 1 inch opening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a light feel when applied, but it does not seem to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; and it leaves a greasy feeling film on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light weight but moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Make-up goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> it is incredibly light and spreads easily.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> it is so light that it does not bother me</li>
            <li> it is light but keeps my face moisturized all day...</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, enough balance to moisturize yet not make my face oily!  </li>
            <li> It does have my face looking oily and my powder goes on so smooth that I don&#x27;t even need foundation.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes lightly and doesn&#x27;t make your face greasy.  </li>
            <li> It feels so smooth on your skin,  </li>
            <li> Also wish it had higher sun screen protection!!</li>
            <li> Also like that it has simple and nice light refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and feels clean on my face.</li>
            <li> It feels silky to the touch and leaves my skin feeling clean and cool.  </li>
            <li> I always though it was because she is very well read and keeps up with her kids and grand kids.</li>
            <li> I love this product and to find it at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;m wearing moisturizer but that my face feel moisturized the WHOLE day.</li>
            <li> This last time I searched for this wonderful facial moisturizer with SPF15, I turned to the Internet and Amazon.com popped up as having it.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing anything.</li>
            <li> It feels great, relieves dryness and personally, I like the scent very well, though some may not.</li>
            <li> Absorbs in quickly and I like</li>
            <li> and secondly my dematologist said it was the best lotion for daily use on the market.</li>
            <li> The only thing better would be if the lid wasn&#x27;t removable as I seem to misplace it many mornings...</li>
            <li> I thought I might have to switch now that I&#x27;m pregnant but this moisturizer continues to prove itself.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into the skin quickly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this to be a very good moisturizer -- does not absorb as readily as others, and my face does not feel as hydrated as other products, either.</li>
            <li> Especially good on the neck area, and gentle enough to be used  near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Light, non-greasy, easily absorbed, soft lovely fragrance</li>
            <li> there is no unpleasant odor, while there IS fragrance in the lotion</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good for such a price.</li>
            <li> Dries fast on my skin and does not wash off easy.</li>
            <li> For the price, it was worth trying and may work well for others.  </li>
            <li> I use other L&#x27;Oreal products and makeup and have been very happy with them, but this moisturizer was a big disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too oily and the price was right.</li>
            <li> price was right</li>
            <li> Has SPF protection and has right thickness for a moisturizer without thinking your splashing water or alternatively putting clay on your face.  </li>
            <li> that was the exact reason I was buying this stuff in the first place!</li>
            <li> It is not heavy, absorbs quickly and has a light fragrence.  </li>
            <li> Ok so I have a fairly oily skin and this cream makes it worse.</li>
            <li> It is half the price of neutrogena too, so I think it is a good bargain.</li>
            <li> As a male, I find the fragrance light, clean and fresh with just a wee hint of hyacinth floral.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, light scent and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s daily moisturizer for 10+ years and enjoy its light feeling when I put it on my face.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> But the bottle is fairly hard and it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of spout on the top, so when you shake it you often get too much cream</li>
            <li> Many reviews say they like the scent, but I don&#x27;t personally care for it.</li>
            <li> This really can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I just love it!</li>
            <li> I was hooked on this after my first use.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> but I do really like the product inside!</li>
            <li> my forehead looks pretty greasy if i put it there, so i just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I can&#x27;t find it in drug-stores any more.</li>
            <li> love this daily moisturizer…easy…non greasy….</li>
            <li> my face ;) for 24 hours</li>
            <li> and it does absorbed fast</li>
            <li> (I work in a very dry warehouse environment and many lotions have not passed the test of keeping my face reasonably moist throughout the full day).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products (including L&#x27;oreal products) and find they don&#x27;t offer the SPF15 or light and easy application on my face.  </li>
            <li> One of the best daily moisturizers I&#x27;ve used lately.  </li>
            <li> feel good for the entire day after applying in the morning, last till end of the day,</li>
            <li> Maybe this will be suitable for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Found the price VERY reasonable on Amazon as well, compared to  others that I found less effective.</li>
            <li> have combination skin, maybe it works better for people with dry skin?</li>
            <li> it has a large opening, so it releases a lot of moisturizer at one time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too large and</li>
            <li> I immediately placed an order for 5 bottles of it and to my surprise it was at a much lower price than I have ever purchased it before.</li>
            <li> and it did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very greasy.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> It really works well.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive - I like that.</li>
            <li> I found that it made my oily skin very shiny.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, has a light fragrance and is big: has a lot of product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Arrived really really fast.</li>
            <li> much...</li>
            <li> and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I also wonder if it&#x27;s really supposed to be yellowish (in contrast to most moisturizers that I have tried, which are white), so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a really old stock or what.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Future E and love the results (50 yrs old).</li>
            <li> This is a nice medium between a heavy cream and a lighter moisturizer.</li>
            <li> While it might work well for people with dry or normal skin, I think there are better choices out there for people with oily skin.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this cream L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisture Lotion on her face and body and smell so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m part Filipina, so I was brought up to not be too concerned with SPF because I never burn, but now that I&#x27;m older and realize I should be taking care of my skin, its become a real concern for me.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Active Daily Moisturizer is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would at first, because it seemed to be more liquid than I usually prefer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this as a basic daily moisturizer for many years..</li>
            <li> I have always found L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisturizer with an SPF 15 rating to be a very effective facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for women and men of all ages.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s better to use this in the colder months, as it is quite heavy and has a somewhat greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> Very happy that Amazon still offers it since it&#x27;s impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent non irritating lotion for face and other sensitive areas ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough to really do its job but light enough that it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face feeling refreshed all day, which is saying a lot since I live in the Vegas area...</li>
            <li> It is a new face cream given to me and it works well.</li>
            <li> and they were all new in boxes.</li>
            <li> I LIVE IN THE CARIBBEAN, SO</li>
            <li> After reading all of the great reviews, I was expecting a nice thick, soft moisturizer, but when I opened the bottle to try it out, I realized it was very thin and watery.</li>
            <li> Just spent three days at an amusement park in the middle of summer in shorts and tank top with this as my sunscreen and no sunburn.</li>
            <li> a large blob of lotion comes out sometimes when I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin(allergies) but this?&lt;br /&gt;it does what it suppose to do which is moisturizing</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and every time I would run low, I had to look for it at numerous places only to find that the item had been removed from the inventory.</li>
            <li> I like it so much better than any of the department store brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> :(  I still gave it 5 stars because what&#x27;s inside is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE about L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisture</li>
            <li> Applies easily without a heavy film.  </li>
            <li> Wow, wow, wow!  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find now though in the stores but am able to get it throught Amazon.</li>
            <li> What is great about this product is that it draws moisture from the air, and it does not clog your pores with unwanted and possibly dangerous oils.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I only wish that a product such as this was available for the entire body.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal has come up with which cost twice as much for virtually the same product.</li>
            <li> For those who are sensitive about the things they apply on their face, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This does what far costlier moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> I have bought her 3 so far</li>
            <li> When I complained they sent me one more bottle.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smooth, just dab a few dots of it around your face and neck, then blend it in.</li>
            <li> to have the spf included in your face moisturizer rather than use a whole different sunscreen after lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my face soft and no flakes.</li>
            <li> With SPF 15 protection it&#x27;s really a well rounded and well priced facial moisturizer, also non-comedogenic</li>
            <li> I like how light it is where it doesn&#x27;t feel like a heavy cream.</li>
            <li> as a result, you are usually left with more moisturizer than you need for your face, which is a waste.</li>
            <li> the bottle is so hard that you have to actually really press and put strength on it to squeeze the product out, even when it is full.</li>
            <li> With this particular L&#x27;Oreal moisturizer, even after an entire day I could feel the film of moisturizer on my skin everywhere I had applied it.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use this on my face when I run out of my usual face spf, but mostly I use this as suntan lotion for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I just got a new bottle with the label \\&quot;This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, not skin cancer or early skin</li>
            <li> but I can use it sometime on less hot summer days..!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would like L&#x27;Oreal to improve upon is the fact that the cap doesn&#x27;t have a small opening to squirt the cream, just a gaping hole that you need to manage to get the right amount of cream from, makes it a little more of a task.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but even when I tried to apply this very sparingly, I had the same feel.</li>
            <li> While I like the way it feels (not too thick, blends in easy)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s barely noticeable, SPF 15, and doesn&#x27;t break the bank to buy it.</li>
            <li> and I barely can feel it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Unnecessary to pay more.</li>
            <li> However, as nice as the bottle looks, it is difficult to handle.</li>
            <li> I never use the same lotion two bottles in a row, but I do like to revisit previous lotions if they prove their worth to me.  </li>
            <li> The container is exactly the same as the L&#x27;Oreal makeup removers, so it will probably be an issue getting the product out when it gets low (also, you may have trouble controlling the amount that comes out), otherwise, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have what I would consider to be dry skin, and I live in an area with 25%-50% humidity.</li>
            <li> Not the best product on the market but far from the worst.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a long time, it&#x27;s not as expensive as those department store brands, and it works even better!</li>
            <li> I tried other lotions to try to take the place of this one, in case it ever becomes completely unavailable, but I always go right back to this Active Daily lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super hard to control the flow of lotion coming out for this reason.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, yet keeps skin soft and never feeling, or looking, dry.</li>
            <li> Says on the label it is for all skin types, however I have really dry mature skin and it did nothing to hydrate.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my skin seems to be irritated by other daily SPF moisturizers, so I decided to get this one because of the high rating it has been given.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well -- almost too well (sometimes leaving your face a little moist).</li>
            <li> I have been using it for quite a few years (at last 15)--since reading about it in Consumers Report which gave it high marks.  </li>
            <li> Other than the normal monthly breakouts (which are few and far between)</li>
            <li> Will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I think it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Active Daily Moisturizer is part of my daily facial regimen.</li>
            <li> This Loreal daily active moisturizer is my number one facial lotion.</li>
            <li> If you use this, just be aware that it is NOT good for sunscreen purposes.</li>
            <li> and then you have to put some back in, not very hygienic.</li>
            <li> You get plenty of cream in this bottle, and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is not too thick like some moisturizers so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> Very thin and light.</li>
            <li> Also, maybe due to extra (unintentional) generous pour, my face often feel a bit greasy after I put on the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too greasy, and it hasn&#x27;t made me dry ever.  </li>
            <li> I judge moisturizers by whether or not at the end of the day/when I wake up, there are dry flakes on my face.</li>
            <li> It never seems to dry on my skin and feels sticky.</li>
            <li> I have both oily and dry skin</li>
            <li> I  have extrememly dry skin</li>

            <li> If you look at the 2 active ingredients listed, they only protect against UVB, not UVA, rays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily moisturizer off and on for the last few years.</li>
            <li> I realized a few years ago that everyone thinks my mom is ten to fifteen years younger than she is ...</li>
            <li> I found out she uses l&#x27;oreal active daily moisture lotion day and night,</li>
            <li> However, just a small amount is enough to cover my entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li> it is that a little bit of product is enough for my hole face and neck.</li>
            <li> makes my face a little oily, especially by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I needed a little moister in the mornings and no longer go outside without a bit of sunscreen  </li>
            <li> My daughter, who has Ichthyosis (a serious dry skin problem loves it, and cannot do without it for her daily facial moisturizing needs)</li>
            <li> While I was in my late fifties I developed Rosacea...</li>
            <li> You also need only a small quantity; therefore, it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> there is absolutely no sticky feel</li>
            <li> Also do not like the twist-top bottle, which makes getting an amount harder than need be.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times and was reminded of how gross it is after every use.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive thin skin.</li>
            <li> moisturizer I usually use is &amp;#34;Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer&amp;#34; which leaves no film and allows makeup to be applied afterward.  </li>
            <li> I use it instead of shaving lotion, and at other times also.</li>
            <li> The bottle packaging is not right for a moisturizer that claims to contain active sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Rather than waste this, I am using it on the very dry skin on my heels and bottom of my feet in summertime.</li>
            <li> Bottle is hard to get last of product out!</li>
            <li> My skin turning a bit red is of secondary concern to me, compared to getting skin cancer or premature wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My second bottle has come in on my auto ship already, so I will probably have to slow down the shipment times.  </li>
            <li> I always start my daily routine with a Vit C serum such as Mad Hippie and then a little while later put a layer of this on my face..</li>
            <li> After the previous reviews I decided to by this product.</li>
            <li> If I could go less that 1 star...</li>
            <li> but I thought it would be less oily and ordered it..</li>
            <li> It feels silkier and less heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal products in the past and have since tried other brands of  moisturizers.</li>
            <li> but I am a little dissapointed with the feel of the moisterizer.</li>
            <li> I kept it around for a little while, but eventually just threw it out.  </li>
            <li> Leaves no significant residue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this L&#x27;Oreal product for a very long time, but it&#x27;s difficult to find in the stores in the last few years.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, I think I will go through this bottle (4 oz) quicker than my usual cream moisturizers (typically 1.7 oz).</li>
            <li> Not greasy, no strong perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> Little hard to find in drug store.</li>
            <li> Not exactly a place that I needed a sunscreening moisturizer, but at least the greasy feel is not noticable there!</li>
            <li> (I am one who often falls ill from various fragranced</li>
            <li> Not many of skincare products work for me.</li>
            <li> But it is way too expensive to a point that I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore finally.   </li>
            <li> A thick layer everyday would help me to survive this winter.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find it in local stores.</li>
            <li> once you past the texture</li>
            <li> The bottle for this moisturizer is also super annoying - it&#x27;s hard to get product out in a sanitary way.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to come by in a drug store.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to find</li>
            <li> It is also hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is hard  to find this product in stores now</li>
            <li> but if you want to pick it up yourself in a store, you&#x27;ll have a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this stuff for ages but can not find it in stores lately .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late to stop using it now.</li>
            <li> I mean just that...there is no re-adjusting of moisturizer during the day.  </li>
            <li> boy, don&#x27;t get this stuff anywhere near your eye area, makes them sting like crazy just being around the eye without getting any in it!</li>
            <li> However, it came in a container that is difficult for you to get a small amount without \\&quot;contaminating\\</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again just because the bottle is inconvenient</li>
            <li> Seriously, this bottle is really awful but you can definitely get it all out and into another container if you want to!</li>
            <li> nothing but dry brutal desert climate which dries out the skin</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports rated this product number one - well ahead of department store brands and the expensive hype that comes with them.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> There packaging is very poor.</li>
            <li> This product smells bad and is an awful yellow color.</li>
            <li> This product had a water texture and it is hands down one of the worst mositurizers I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed to see it gone from my drug store.  </li>
            <li> AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I hate an oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> something awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and every time I would run low, I had to look for it at numerous places only to find that the item had been removed from the inventory. This last time I searched for this wonderful facial moisturizer with SPF15, I turned to the Internet and Amazon.com popped up as having it. I immediately placed an order for 5 bottles of it and to my surprise it was at a much lower price than I have ever purchased it before. Thank-you, Amazon.com! I am thrilled with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> I usually really love Loreal products, but I&#x27;m not impressed with this moisturizer at all. After reading all of the great reviews, I was expecting a nice thick, soft moisturizer, but when I opened the bottle to try it out, I realized it was very thin and watery. I put it on anyway and it did absolutely nothing for my skin. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wonderful moisturizer for 10 years.  So glad it is on Amazon.  I am 57, and it works great on me.  It contains SPF 15.  Great price.  I was so disappointed to see it gone from my drug store.  It isn&#x27;t too greasy, and it hasn&#x27;t made me dry ever.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very thin and light. Absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing anything. Would be great under makeup if I ever bothered to wear it. Many reviews say they like the scent, but I don&#x27;t personally care for it. It is somewhat perfume/cologne-like.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mosturizer - I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It is not heavy, absorbs quickly and has a light fragrence.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I use other L&#x27;Oreal products and makeup and have been very happy with them, but this moisturizer was a big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;It has a light feel when applied, but it does not seem to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; and it leaves a greasy feeling film on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer I usually use is &amp;#34;Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer&amp;#34; which leaves no film and allows makeup to be applied afterward.  With this particular L&#x27;Oreal moisturizer, even after an entire day I could feel the film of moisturizer on my skin everywhere I had applied it. It contains Shea Butter and Apricot Kernel Oil so this may explain the greasy feel. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but even when I tried to apply this very sparingly, I had the same feel. For the price, it was worth trying and may work well for others.  Rather than waste this, I am using it on the very dry skin on my heels and bottom of my feet in summertime. Not exactly a place that I needed a sunscreening moisturizer, but at least the greasy feel is not noticable there!</li>
            <li> It is so hard to come by in a drug store.  Why?  I don&#x27;t know.  So you can always count on Amazon to come through!  Getting back to my review...by effortless I mean just that...there is no re-adjusting of moisturizer during the day.  Don&#x27;t let the words \\&quot;daily\\&quot; fool you, it is just as good for nightly use.  I hate an oily feeling.  What is great about this product is that it draws moisture from the air, and it does not clog your pores with unwanted and possibly dangerous oils. My daughter, who has Ichthyosis (a serious dry skin problem loves it, and cannot do without it for her daily facial moisturizing needs) this in itself is an endorsement. I only wish that a product such as this was available for the entire body. I would buy it in tubs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a long time, it&#x27;s not as expensive as those department store brands, and it works even better! This is very light weight so it&#x27;s easily absorted by the skin. I&#x27;m glad I can find this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have been using this moisturizer for years -- ever since Consumers Reports rated it as an excellent moisturizer.  It is not greasy, yet keeps skin soft and never feeling, or looking, dry.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very greasy. Got pimples after I started using this. I have used L&#x27;Oreal SPF Futur-E Moisturizer for many years and I love it. Maybe this will be suitable for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a decent moisturizer. I have what I would consider to be dry skin, and I live in an area with 25%-50% humidity. I judge moisturizers by whether or not at the end of the day/when I wake up, there are dry flakes on my face. I had mixed results with this moisturizer. I was only using it for day use and I wasn&#x27;t consistently happy with how my skin felt at the end of the day. The bottle for this moisturizer is also super annoying - it&#x27;s hard to get product out in a sanitary way. I&#x27;ve discontinued use in favor of CeraVe AM lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 yrs... &amp; was lost when it was discontinued at stores.  I am glad I can receive it again.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff because it&#x27;s NOT very expensive and it feels great on my face. I&#x27;ve used it for years and everyone thinks I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I am. Also, you can get every bit of it out of the bottle if you poke your fingers in--unlike those pump bottles L&#x27;Oreal has come up with which cost twice as much for virtually the same product. I know it&#x27;s hard to find--I have to order it off the internet. I think L&#x27;Oreal is trying to force its fans to switch to a more expensive moisturizer. Unnecessary to pay more.</li>
            <li> I would give this a five stars if it wasnt for the way the bottle is designed. The product itself is very light, moisturizing, and feels nice on the skin, which is all great. It doesnt smell and is a good value for the price. However, as nice as the bottle looks, it is difficult to handle. the bottle is so hard that you have to actually really press and put strength on it to squeeze the product out, even when it is full. as a result, you are usually left with more moisturizer than you need for your face, which is a waste. However, i have found that the opening is big enough  to put the content back in.</li>
            <li> While I was in my late fifties I developed Rosacea...had never had a problem with acne.  I tried several face lotions and found this to work perfect for me.  I would highly recommend this lotion.  I use it faithfully...twice a day.</li>
            <li> This lotion is absolutely AMAZING! This lotion does not dry out your skin and you do not need a lot to moisturize your face. I would highly recommend this lotion! It does not have a powerful scent which is really nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal products in the past and have since tried other brands of  moisturizers. This feels great on my skin when applied, and doesn&#x27;t   feel oily. Especially good on the neck area, and gentle enough to be used  near my eyes.  Found the price VERY reasonable on Amazon as well, compared to  others that I found less effective.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every day before I go out and even if I don&#x27;t go out. Especially when the weather is warm or if its cold outside.</li>
            <li> Using this for years under my makeup and just daily moisturizer. Grea porduct.&lt;br /&gt;Actually a couple of my friends started using this product also.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion. Good uv protection and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Light, non-greasy, easily absorbed, soft lovely fragrance that&#x27;s barely noticeable, SPF 15, and doesn&#x27;t break the bank to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I didn&#x27;t think I would at first, because it seemed to be more liquid than I usually prefer.  However, just a small amount is enough to cover my entire face and neck.  I have been using one bottle for over two months every day, and have yet to get to close to the bottom.  My second bottle has come in on my auto ship already, so I will probably have to slow down the shipment times.  It keeps my face feeling refreshed all day, which is saying a lot since I live in the Vegas area...nothing but dry brutal desert climate which dries out the skin something awful.  I would highly recommend this product for women and men of all ages.  It really works well.[[ASIN:B000NP7K1E L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisturizer, SPF 15, 4-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> My favorite. Little hard to find in drug store. Light weight but moisturizing.Make-up goes on smoothly. Very inexpensive - I like that. You don&#x27;t have to pay a lot of money to find some good products.</li>
            <li> Wow, wow, wow!  Add this to my list of repeat lotions!  I never use the same lotion two bottles in a row, but I do like to revisit previous lotions if they prove their worth to me.  This one is a definite yes to the revisit list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I LOVE about L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisture Lotion:&lt;br /&gt;- it is incredibly light and spreads easily.&lt;br /&gt;- there is absolutely no sticky feel afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;-  the moisture lasts all day (I work in a very dry warehouse environment and many lotions have not passed the test of keeping my face reasonably moist throughout the full day).&lt;br /&gt;- there is no unpleasant odor, while there IS fragrance in the lotion it is so light that it does not bother me (I am one who often falls ill from various fragranced products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that I get all the benefits of this lotion at an amazing price.  This really can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> My wife has used this stuff for ages but can not find it in stores lately . I told her that &amp;#34;I bet Amazon has it &amp;#34; and you did.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have a fairly oily skin and this cream makes it worse. It never seems to dry on my skin and feels sticky.</li>
            <li> I disagree that this product is appropriate for all skin types.  I found that it made my oily skin very shiny.  While it might work well for people with dry or normal skin, I think there are better choices out there for people with oily skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works better than my neutrogena. It feels silkier and less heavy. It is half the price of neutrogena too, so I think it is a good bargain. However, it came in a container that is difficult for you to get a small amount without \\&quot;contaminating\\&quot; the rest of the product. It was not properly sealed, in my opinion. So I don&#x27;t know if that is how L&#x27;Oreal intended its packaging, or if it has already been tampered with. I also wonder if it&#x27;s really supposed to be yellowish (in contrast to most moisturizers that I have tried, which are white), so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a really old stock or what. For those who are sensitive about the things they apply on their face, I would not recommend this product. They&#x27;d be better off buying from the mall, save yourself the worries.</li>
            <li> Not the best product on the market but far from the worst. A little goes a long way. Has kind of a greasy feel. Will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to use during daytime, but I am using it at night time as this looks greasy/oily on me...I would not recommend</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s better to use this in the colder months, as it is quite heavy and has a somewhat greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> If you look at the 2 active ingredients listed, they only protect against UVB, not UVA, rays. If you use this, just be aware that it is NOT good for sunscreen purposes.</li>
            <li> After the previous reviews I decided to by this product. It is really great! Not greasy, has a light fragrance and is big: has a lot of product! Another good thing it is that a little bit of product is enough for my hole face and neck. I think it will last a long time! My only complain is about the bottle. it has a large opening, so it releases a lot of moisturizer at one time. Other than that, I just love it! Cheap and effective! Just the way I look for!</li>
            <li> This product had a water texture and it is hands down one of the worst mositurizers I have ever come across. Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This does what far costlier moisturizers do. It feels great, relieves dryness and personally, I like the scent very well, though some may not. Otherwise, you will find it serves the purpose as intended. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive thin skin. Not many of skincare products work for me. I used lots of Clarins over the years. But it is way too expensive to a point that I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore finally.   This product works pretty good for such a price. A thick layer everyday would help me to survive this winter. I would try to find more drug store products for my face from now on.</li>
            <li> One of the best daily moisturizers I&#x27;ve used lately.  Just a drop is enough to moisturize.  Also has SPF15 protection.</li>
            <li> good moisture lotion. feel good for the entire day after applying in the morning, last till end of the day,</li>
            <li> I occasionally use this on my face when I run out of my usual face spf, but mostly I use this as suntan lotion for the rest of my body. It keeps me from smelling like a coconut. I&#x27;m fair skinned. Just spent three days at an amusement park in the middle of summer in shorts and tank top with this as my sunscreen and no sunburn.</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports rated this product number one - well ahead of department store brands and the expensive hype that comes with them. I was hooked on this after my first use. As a male, I find the fragrance light, clean and fresh with just a wee hint of hyacinth floral. I am a diehard bargain shopper, so I purchase mine at my local Target store for under $6 - and no shipping cost. If you need to order online, Amazon has the best price I have found so far. I am a big Amazon devotee, so order away!</li>
            <li> I like this product line from Loreal. I hadn&#x27;t tried it before and this is a good daytime moisturizer. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product for coverage either which makes it last longer!</li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have the oily feel after it&#x27;s applied to the face. Also like that it has simple and nice light refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li> A must-have product to maintain youthful, healthy skin.  Applies both day and night.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> This is a facial care product that I have used for years!  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face!</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered. I was unable to find it in local stores. It is a new face cream given to me and it works well. My favorite part is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 15 years, and I love it. While it wouldn&#x27;t be good if you have very dry skin, it is a great, lightweight lotion with SPF 15 for those with oily or combination skin. Very happy that Amazon still offers it since it&#x27;s impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Light and smooth and great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a basic daily moisturizer for many years.. it is a good value for the money and contains sunscreen. I always start my daily routine with a Vit C serum such as Mad Hippie and then a little while later put a layer of this on my face..it is light but keeps my face moisturized all day... will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> If I could go less that 1 star...</li>
            <li> My grandma loves this lotion. I have bought her 3 so far and they were all new in boxes. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was Consumer Reports No. 1 rated moisturizer a while back and I have been using it ever since. It moisturizes very well -- almost too well (sometimes leaving your face a little moist). You also need only a small quantity; therefore, it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This lotion was nice, but it smelled kind of funny and didn&#x27;t have a nice squeeze lid. It just opens up with a huge 1 inch opening. It&#x27;s super hard to control the flow of lotion coming out for this reason. Once I finished it up I didn&#x27;t buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a great face lotion. I just noticed that it&#x27;s mislabeled as lipstick somehow but I got moisturizer. I really like it! It has a nice, light scent and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin. Absorbs in quickly and I like that it has SPF so I can use it in the morning! The only reason it&#x27;s not getting 5 stars is the bottle. It&#x27;s not squeezable so I transferred it to a container that I had in my house, which would allow me to more easily access the lotion. Seriously, this bottle is really awful but you can definitely get it all out and into another container if you want to! Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again just because the bottle is inconvenient but I do really like the product inside!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily moisturizer off and on for the last few years. While I like the way it feels (not too thick, blends in easy) I just got a new bottle with the label \\&quot;This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, not skin cancer or early skin aging\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that was the exact reason I was buying this stuff in the first place! My skin turning a bit red is of secondary concern to me, compared to getting skin cancer or premature wrinkles. So it&#x27;s time for me to switch! According to a news article, I understand sunscreen manufacturer&#x27;s are now being required by the FDA to put these labels onto their sunscreens. To get a sunscreen that offers ideal protection from both skin cancer &amp; premature aging, one needs what is called \\&quot;full spectrum\\&quot; sunscreen, that is, a sunscreen which blocks both UVA &amp; UVB rays.</li>
            <li> Bottle is hard to get last of product out! Also wish it had higher sun screen protection!!</li>
            <li> PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME IN EXCELLENT PACKAGING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS MOISTURISER FOR OVER A DECADE AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED. IT IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND HAS A PLEASANT SCENT. I LIVE IN THE CARIBBEAN, SO THE U/V PROTECTION IS PERFECT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores where I shopped.  I was told to check out Amazon.com and there it was.  I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to look for items that I need.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice light moisture lotion. It is not sticky and has a nice, silky feel. I have used it for years, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore.  I will never order it or anything else  from AMERICAN WHOLESALE again. There packaging is very poor. They mailed it in 2 separate padded manila envelopes. One was not sealed when I received it and the box  the bottle comes in that was sent in one envelope was crumpled. When I complained they sent me one more bottle. I only received two out of the three bottles that I ordered. I don&#x27;t understand why they couldn&#x27;t send all three bottles together in one properly packaged box.</li>
            <li> Good source for scarce product</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. It&#x27;s not too oily and the price was right. Only thing I don&#x27;t like was the smell but everyone else might.</li>
            <li> Dries fast on my skin and does not wash off easy. I looked like Michael Jackson with all that white stuff on his/her face.</li>
            <li> I realized a few years ago that everyone thinks my mom is ten to fifteen years younger than she is ... I always though it was because she is very well read and keeps up with her kids and grand kids. Then two things happened I found out she uses l&#x27;oreal active daily moisture lotion day and night, and secondly my dematologist said it was the best lotion for daily use on the market. Its light weight doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and the SPF is perfect to reduce sun damage. Just wish it was available in CVS and Waldgreens!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was bought for my husband.  It is his favorite.  Not greasy, no strong perfume smell.  I like it too.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and never found anything better.  Keeps skin moist and supple and smells good.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I like it so much better than any of the department store brands I&#x27;ve used in the past. I have both oily and dry skin and it is the perfect face lotion for my type. I was really sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and am just glad that I can purchase it online still. I tried other lotions to try to take the place of this one, in case it ever becomes completely unavailable, but I always go right back to this Active Daily lotion. I try to stock up so that I will never run out! Loreal, please bring this back to the stores!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my skin seems to be irritated by other daily SPF moisturizers, so I decided to get this one because of the high rating it has been given. I&#x27;m part Filipina, so I was brought up to not be too concerned with SPF because I never burn, but now that I&#x27;m older and realize I should be taking care of my skin, its become a real concern for me. It goes on really smooth, just dab a few dots of it around your face and neck, then blend it in. The container is exactly the same as the L&#x27;Oreal makeup removers, so it will probably be an issue getting the product out when it gets low (also, you may have trouble controlling the amount that comes out), otherwise, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got it a couple of days ago. feels and smells great. and it&#x27;s always a plus to have the spf included in your face moisturizer rather than use a whole different sunscreen after lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Def recommended. :)</li>
            <li> Super affordable and the texture is so silky and light!  I like that it has shea butter - which has been known to be a great wrinkle fighter!  Perfect under makeup and makes my skin feel so smooth.  The scent is nice and doesn&#x27;t bother me.  They need to change the opening - it&#x27;s too large and a large blob of lotion comes out sometimes when I&#x27;m not careful:(  I still gave it 5 stars because what&#x27;s inside is wonderful.  What a drugstore gem:)  My skin just feels so hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this L&#x27;Oreal product for a very long time, but it&#x27;s difficult to find in the stores in the last few years.  Glad to see that Amazon still carries it.</li>
            <li> Arrived really really fast. What a nice surprise. I love this product and to find it at a reasonable price was like giving myself a gift. Thank You</li>
            <li> This product is getting more difficult to find in store now.  Getting it online is convenient.  No issue at all.  Same product at from store.</li>
            <li> This product smells bad and is an awful yellow color. On top of that, it leaves my skin greasy and clammy. It is also hard to get out of the bottle. You have to tip it over and shake out what you need, which makes it really easy to get WAY more product than you need.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, enough balance to moisturize yet not make my face oily!  Other than the normal monthly breakouts (which are few and far between) I can&#x27;t complain.  The only thing better would be if the lid wasn&#x27;t removable as I seem to misplace it many mornings...</li>
            <li> I am in my 80&#x27;s, and I have been using this stuff for decades. I use it instead of shaving lotion, and at other times also. I mentioned to the clerk one time, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think this stuff makes me look any better&#x27;. She replied &#x27;can you imagine what you would look like if you hadn&#x27;t been using it&#x27;.Draw your own conclusions. It&#x27;s too late to stop using it now.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal moisture lotion for many years.  It&#x27;s great to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have always found L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisturizer with an SPF 15 rating to be a very effective facial moisturizer.  The addition of the SPF 15 works well for me since I like to spend a lot of time outside in the sus.</li>
            <li> Made me break out! I have oily and acne prone skin. It is not for all skin types</li>
            <li> This works like a charm. It does have my face looking oily and my powder goes on so smooth that I don&#x27;t even need foundation. LOVE IT, have to order 2 more</li>
            <li> Excellent non irritating lotion for face and other sensitive areas ...</li>
            <li> price was right but I am a little dissapointed with the feel of the moisterizer. It was a bit greasy. The product works okay once you past the texture</li>
            <li> Moisturizes lightly and doesn&#x27;t make your face greasy.  I have sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all.</li>
            <li> I know creams with SPF are oily but I thought it would be less oily and ordered it.. so I didnt like it much... yeah but I can use it sometime on less hot summer days..!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not greasy and has a 15 spf.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer that I have used and I have been using it for a long time (more than 5 years). Not greasy but with SPF 15 UV protection. The price is good. However, it does not come with a pump.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Active Daily Moisturizer is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  It feels silky to the touch and leaves my skin feeling clean and cool.  It is not too thick like some moisturizers so you don&#x27;t have to use as much. Unfortunately it is hard  to find this product in stores now so I buy it online. This is okay but if you want to pick it up yourself in a store, you&#x27;ll have a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li> My mother has been using this product for 20+ years.  She&#x27;s in her mid 70&#x27;s and looks like 60+!!!!!  I&#x27;m using Future E and love the results (50 yrs old).</li>
            <li> (1)  The bottle packaging is not right for a moisturizer that claims to contain active sunscreen.  It makes me doubt the efficacy of this product.</li>
            <li> i love that it&#x27;s spf and a quality product. makes my face a little oily, especially by the end of the day. my forehead looks pretty greasy if i put it there, so i just don&#x27;t. and i love the porduct. been using it for a year.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;m wearing moisturizer but that my face feel moisturized the WHOLE day. I thought I might have to switch now that I&#x27;m pregnant but this moisturizer continues to prove itself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this to be a very good moisturizer -- does not absorb as readily as others, and my face does not feel as hydrated as other products, either. Lukewarm. Also do not like the twist-top bottle, which makes getting an amount harder than need be.</li>
            <li> My mother and sister were extremely pleased to find this item at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product with a great price tag for a moisturizer.  I have been using it for quite a few years (at last 15)--since reading about it in Consumers Report which gave it high marks.  It is hard to find now though in the stores but am able to get it throught Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, although it is difficult to find in stores and I have to order it online, I will do that because it works well for me and it is reasonably priced. I  have extrememly dry skin and it keeps my face soft and no flakes.</li>
            <li> The bottle contain a lot of moisturizer, so in that way, you get a lot of bang for your bucks. But the only way to get the moisturizer is pour it out and I often pour out a lot more than I needed. Because of this, I think I will go through this bottle (4 oz) quicker than my usual cream moisturizers (typically 1.7 oz). Also, maybe due to extra (unintentional) generous pour, my face often feel a bit greasy after I put on the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This Loreal daily active moisturizer is my number one facial lotion. I am 63 and just absolutely love this lotion! I have been using it for years and get compliments on my skin. Thank you Loreal!!!!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Active Daily Moisturizer is part of my daily facial regimen. It is lightweight and feels clean on my face.</li>
            <li> boy, don&#x27;t get this stuff anywhere near your eye area, makes them sting like crazy just being around the eye without getting any in it! Says on the label it is for all skin types, however I have really dry mature skin and it did nothing to hydrate.</li>
            <li> I needed a little moister in the mornings and no longer go outside without a bit of sunscreen  This product is great. Applies easily without a heavy film.  Does not leave a white residue on the skin.  Washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times and was reminded of how gross it is after every use.  It is greasy and stays greasy, doesn&#x27;t absorb in to the skin.  I kept it around for a little while, but eventually just threw it out.  I had some friends try it out to see if somebody could use it.  No one liked it so ended up throwing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, maybe it works better for people with dry skin?</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It feels so smooth on your skin,  I have very oily skin and I barely can feel it on my skin. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10+ years. I like it as well as department-store products costing much, much more. This has a nice fresh fragrance, light weight and sun protection. The only problem is that I can&#x27;t find it in drug-stores any more. The drug stores carry more expensive L&#x27;Oreal moisturizers, but I prefer this one, so I order it online.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this cream L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisture Lotion on her face and body and smell so good.</li>
            <li> I love the cream, feels good on my skin and my skin looks great. But the bottle is fairly hard and it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of spout on the top, so when you shake it you often get too much cream and then you have to put some back in, not very hygienic.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  Only moisturizer that I will buy.  Will be ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for years morning and night. Love it. No greasy feel and wears well under makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a nice medium between a heavy cream and a lighter moisturizer. It&#x27;s heavy enough to really do its job but light enough that it&#x27;s easy to apply. Absorbs into the skin quickly so you don&#x27;t feel greasy. With SPF 15 protection it&#x27;s really a well rounded and well priced facial moisturizer, also non-comedogenic so it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  I&#x27;ve been been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for the price.</li>
            <li> Has SPF protection and has right thickness for a moisturizer without thinking your splashing water or alternatively putting clay on your face.  Leaves no significant residue.  I use before exercising, in AM and PM.</li>
            <li> love this daily moisturizer…easy…non greasy….</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s daily moisturizer for 10+ years and enjoy its light feeling when I put it on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried other products (including L&#x27;oreal products) and find they don&#x27;t offer the SPF15 or light and easy application on my face.  I like how light it is where it doesn&#x27;t feel like a heavy cream.</li>
            <li> You get plenty of cream in this bottle, and it goes a long way. My fianc&amp;eacute; got me hooked on using a daily SPF-15 moisturizer because she doesn&#x27;t want me to look like I&#x27;m 40 when I&#x27;m 30. I would say this works just as well as more expensive creams that she has. The only thing I would like L&#x27;Oreal to improve upon is the fact that the cap doesn&#x27;t have a small opening to squirt the cream, just a gaping hole that you need to manage to get the right amount of cream from, makes it a little more of a task. Definitely satisfied with the product and value though.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin(allergies) but this?&lt;br /&gt;it does what it suppose to do which is moisturizing skin(on my face ;) for 24 hours and it does absorbed fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only problem is&lt;br /&gt;theres no way to get the lotion out of the bottle without contaminating the rest XD&lt;br /&gt;they need a better bottle</li>
    </ol>
