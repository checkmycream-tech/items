            <li>The product feels nice and solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not flatten, yet is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>It needs to be maybe 3 or 4&amp;#34; in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;m changing my initial star rating because of this company&#x27;s excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m better by the morning..</li>
            <li>Now I want one of these for myself because I like this one much more than my Tempurpedic roll pillow.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to order 2 more.  </li>
            <li>so many pillows are needed for the rehab and comfort while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for under the knees to relieve back problems.</li>
            <li>Nice cover and comfortable foam.</li>
            <li>And that is mostly my fault.</li>
            <li>This pillow is of nice quality and attractive, although it is a bit too big for what I purchased it for.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to help sleep more comfortably while pregnant and it is a nice pillow for under the legs as well.</li>
            <li>Worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Very comfy -should probably buy one more !</li>
            <li>Excellent support but a bit firm.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and is firm.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>This pillow is exactly the type of pillow that my son wanted but be sure to read the dimensions...  </li>
            <li>The size was perfect, but I think it should mention that it is VERY firm.</li>
            <li>I tried sleeping on it - if you&#x27;re a side sleeper, this is great (although a little too &amp;#34;tall&amp;#34; for me).  </li>
            <li>Is high for what I wanted, but is nice and soft</li>
            <li>Its just right for me..</li>
            <li>I ordered this one and it was just too large in diameter for his needs, so I returned it and the company quickly sent me the medium sized one and refunded me the credit.  </li>
            <li>Very firm, great on my &amp;#</li>
            <li>When I sent an email to the company stating I wanted to return the item I received a very polite and quick response from the company.  </li>
            <li>This one is longer and doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not having as many problems with an achy back as I was before buying this.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased w/pillow!&lt;br /&gt;Takes just a few times to get used to</li>
            <li>Too large for my neck.  </li>
            <li>Round pillows are definitely much better to sleep on!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable but be careful unwrapping it.</li>
            <li>so it does not squish in as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>doc said not to use it the whole</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>This product holds up very well.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>I think next time I will look for one that isn&#x27;t so stuff and will contour to your back better.</li>
            <li>I got this product mainly for neck support.</li>
            <li>The firmness of this is a little more than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>; in diameter, take my advice, take a towel, roll it up until it is 7&amp;#34; wide and you&#x27;ll see how huge this pillow is.  </li>
            <li>This pad is much too soft for use as lumbar support.  </li>
            <li>This pillow is too high and firm to lay comfortably with it under my knees.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not a heavy guy by any means.  </li>
            <li>The cover is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>So far, it is filling the need.</li>
            <li>It been more than a year and a half of nightly use, and the foam is finally starting to &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; a bit - still very firm and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The diameter is way too big for any normal person&#x27;s neck.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought this pillow was too firm to sleep on, but after sleeping on it for the past several nights it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>If I wasn&#x27;t able to push it down into my chair, it would be too firm to use.</li>
            <li>Be aware this pillow is EXTREMELY firm.  </li>
            <li>It really just sags down when you put any weight on it</li>
            <li>At first it was too stiff to serve as a neck roll</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with the product is the cover - I ordered the one in Grey -- the grey has a bit of a green tint to it... and the other grey furniture in my living room is a bit more &amp;#34;blue-ish&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a firm support pillow (especially for your lower back), buy this product - you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>

            <li> Very firm memory foam.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she was having trouble with numb arms and shoulders at night and was trying to elevate her head without affecting her shoulders.  </li>
            <li> They stated they were sorry the pillow did not work for me and included a return label.  </li>
            <li> I tried to sleep with it, but it proved to be too uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It;s an awkward size in my opinion, and I am disappointed that I can&#x27;t use it for what I need it for.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very comfy -should probably buy one more !</li>
            <li> I love this thing. So did my dog (who promptly chewed up one end of the cover and pillow). I was suffering with sciatica when I ordered this, and it relieved enough pressure when I would lie down that I could at least get a little rest at night. I&#x27;ve been using it since.</li>
            <li> This pillow is exactly the type of pillow that my son wanted but be sure to read the dimensions...  I ordered this one and it was just too large in diameter for his needs, so I returned it and the company quickly sent me the medium sized one and refunded me the credit.  Good quality pillow with a cover that can be removed for washing!  Prompt customer service.</li>
            <li> This neck roll was designed for a giant.  The diameter is way too big for any normal person&#x27;s neck.  I read some of the reviews that said it was 7&amp;#34; in diameter, take my advice, take a towel, roll it up until it is 7&amp;#34; wide and you&#x27;ll see how huge this pillow is.  I didn&#x27;t realize how wide it would be and I thought the foam would be squishy so I thought 7&amp;#34; wouldn&#x27;t be that bad.  The foam is very firm so it does not squish in as much as I thought it would.  It needs to be maybe 3 or 4&amp;#34; in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;m changing my initial star rating because of this company&#x27;s excellent customer service.  When I sent an email to the company stating I wanted to return the item I received a very polite and quick response from the company.  They stated they were sorry the pillow did not work for me and included a return label.  As soon as they got the pillow back they issued me a refund.</li>
            <li> Not as hard as I expected</li>
            <li> I sit on it,put it under my legs,i know this Memory foam will get softer as time goes by..Its just right for me..I like it..I got a smaller one as firm as this, it got softer .,just give it a lil time you will like it.,we are all different but for me I will keep it.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable but be careful unwrapping it. The soft, washable cover tore a seam a little and I will have to stitch that up.</li>
            <li> works perfect for my camper as a sofa pillow or a bed pillow</li>
            <li> Very pleased w/pillow!&lt;br /&gt;Takes just a few times to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;My doc said not to use it the whole night.&lt;br /&gt;So i use it as I dose off then I&#x27;m better by the morning..</li>
            <li> The firmness of this is a little more than I thought it would be.  It doesn&#x27;t sink in well when you are laying against it so it makes it hard to relax with it at your back.  I think next time I will look for one that isn&#x27;t so stuff and will contour to your back better.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazin&#x27;! At first it was too stiff to serve as a neck roll so I used it as am arm rest. Worked just fine. Later I used it too cushion my arthritic knees while lying on my side. Worked just fine. Now that I have swushed it and mushed it for about a week, it is getting soft enough to use as neck roll without losing it other jobs. Three-in-one pillow, bolster and neck roll. Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she was having trouble with numb arms and shoulders at night and was trying to elevate her head without affecting her shoulders.  She loved this pillow and it&#x27;s worked great for her.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Product received as advertised.</li>
            <li> This pillow is great for lounging, watching TV, listening to music with earphones. I recommend this product for the above mentioned uses.</li>
            <li> This pad is much too soft for use as lumbar support.  It really just sags down when you put any weight on it and I&#x27;m not a heavy guy by any means.  well-made though.</li>
            <li> This pillow has been great! I bought it a couple of months ago,and it gives me the support I have needed for my lower back while sitting in my chair. The memory foam is great. My back doesn&#x27;t hurt now when I get up.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because he kept &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; my roll pillow. Now I want one of these for myself because I like this one much more than my Tempurpedic roll pillow. This one is longer and doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one like this forever.  I had one, but it is wearing out.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Helps with neck pain.</li>
            <li> Use for lower back support at office desk.</li>
            <li> Very firm memory foam.</li>
            <li> very nice quality for the money, IMO. I got it to replace the foam in the headrest of my Kardiel Le Corbusier reproduction recliner/lounger. I then used the foam from the Kardiel headrest inside the cover for the Dreamsweet pillow to prop up knees while watching TV and reading in bed.</li>
            <li> Too large for my neck.  5 feet 155 lbs women</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to use on my couch for support of my lower back.  I&#x27;m not having as many problems with an achy back as I was before buying this.  Excellent pillow!</li>
            <li> Great price. Be aware this pillow is EXTREMELY firm.  It is good for cervical support. I bought it to help sleep more comfortably while pregnant and it is a nice pillow for under the legs as well.</li>
            <li> Very firm, great on my &amp;#34;too cush-ey/soft couch&amp;#34; because it helps support your lower back.  I tried sleeping on it - if you&#x27;re a side sleeper, this is great (although a little too &amp;#34;tall&amp;#34; for me).  I&#x27;m planning to order 2 more.  The only issue I have with the product is the cover - I ordered the one in Grey -- the grey has a bit of a green tint to it... and the other grey furniture in my living room is a bit more &amp;#34;blue-ish&amp;#34;.  Not a problem, just wanted to mention it if you&#x27;re concerned about the color.  If you&#x27;re looking for a firm support pillow (especially for your lower back), buy this product - you won&#x27;t be sorry.  Edit:  Jun 2015 - It been more than a year and a half of nightly use, and the foam is finally starting to &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; a bit - still very firm and comfortable.  This product holds up very well.</li>
            <li> Excellent support but a bit firm.</li>
            <li> A great additiion to my sleep.  Recently had shoulder surgery so many pillows are needed for the rehab and comfort while sleeping.  Very versatile.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and is firm.  Does not flatten, yet is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Perfect for under the knees to relieve back problems. My husband uses it every night while watching tv in bed. Nice cover and comfortable foam.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. The foam is heavy and dense.  The cover is soft and silky. The product feels nice and solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one slight problem however.  And that is mostly my fault. I got this product mainly for neck support. But the thickness (diameter) is larger than I expected. For neck support I would recommend one size smaller.  Maybe two sizes.</li>
            <li> This pillow is of nice quality and attractive, although it is a bit too big for what I purchased it for.  I like to support my back when I am relaxing in bed/ sleeping, by placing a pillow under my knees.  This pillow is too high and firm to lay comfortably with it under my knees.  I tried to sleep with it, but it proved to be too uncomfortable.  I try to use it as a neck pillow, but again it is just too big. It;s an awkward size in my opinion, and I am disappointed that I can&#x27;t use it for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this pillow was too firm to sleep on, but after sleeping on it for the past several nights it is very comfortable. My neck didn&#x27;t hurt like it does with regular pillows. Round pillows are definitely much better to sleep on!</li>
            <li> I bought to use for my neck, because of back surgery but did not work. Is high for what I wanted, but is nice and soft</li>
            <li> I bought this for lumbar support for my leather chair. The size was perfect, but I think it should mention that it is VERY firm. If I wasn&#x27;t able to push it down into my chair, it would be too firm to use. So far, it is filling the need. I wish it was softer though.</li>
