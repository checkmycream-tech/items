            <li>This shampoo is fine, but I prefer the Jhirmack shampoo.</li>
            <li>It reeks like the cheapest of cheap drugstore shampoos..</li>
            <li>May be a bit drying on the hair, so I use a good strong conditioner with occasional treatments to keep the shine.  </li>

            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product which I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Great at keeping brassiness down.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth my money.</li>
            <li>honestly, I did not see a big difference in the brassy color of my hair.</li>
            <li>Funny smell but leaves lots of sparkle.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and my silver hair really shines after shampooing with Shimmer lights!</li>
            <li>Product really works well !</li>
            <li>This is not the first blonde-toning product I have used.</li>
            <li>It may do a good job at toning, but for me I couldn&#x27;t even stand letting it sit in my hair for a few moments.</li>
            <li>but it makes your hair feel super soft!</li>
            <li>After only one use, my overall color is more natural brown, with bright blonde</li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY works.</li>
            <li>This really works for lightening/taking brassy tones out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really helped me</li>
            <li>So much so, that my hairdresser took a picture of my hair, for the color.  </li>
            <li>Price is very on point.</li>
            <li>product is fantastic for blonde and silver hair!</li>
            <li>After using this product ,a couple of months now it is so much lighter .</li>
            <li>I cant say anything much yet .first time used</li>
            <li>Works better than any other &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I noticed it made some strands of my hair brighter and more blonde than yellow.</li>
            <li>I was trying to get the red tones out and bring out more blonde).</li>
            <li>(I wanted to get from my natural hair color, dark brown, to a platinum blonde/white color) but it still had a fair amount of yellow pigment in it.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this shampoo, it makes her Blonde hair very shiny and soft, so I made sure she had enough.</li>
            <li>my research about hair bleaching it is normal for your hair to have a purple haze after using this product, but it is by no means distracting.</li>
            <li>My Spanish bronze is just about gone!I certainly was NOT dissatisfied!</li>
            <li>Although my hair isn&#x27;t a light blonde(medium golden yellow from bleaching) but it reduced the brassiness a little bit.</li>
            <li>my fault for not reading it clearly.</li>
            <li>Makes my white hairs really shine.  </li>
            <li>Natural &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like an old lady.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Redken&#x27;s blonde idol and Paul Mitchell as well, but after seeing this at my new stylist&#x27;s salon, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This is so disappointing since I have been so careful and went to great lengths to not damage my hair before the wedding.</li>
            <li>Its a miracle for brassy blond hair either because your water is hard, or your original color wasn&#x27;t ash enough.</li>
            <li>This shampoos keeps my grey hair looking alive.</li>
            <li>A lady with no grey hair said &amp;#34;I want that.  </li>

            <li> A lady with no grey hair said &amp;#34;I want that.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I gave 2 stars is that it works on color as long as you don&#x27;t care about the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I know without a doubt my hair is damaged from this product because I recommended it to my friend (she had thin, straight &amp; soft hair)</li>
            <li> My hair is mingled grey.  </li>
            <li> These products make my grey hair POP with silver shine</li>
            <li> It takes dullness out of grey hair, making it shine.</li>
            <li> this is a must for keeping the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; out of your grey hair.</li>
            <li> I have ombré hair with grey tips</li>
            <li> blonde with substantial gray throughout, but absolutely NO brassiness.</li>
            <li> Just dont leave it on too long</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was because I was not a huge fan of the smell - definitely &amp;#34;old-lady-perfume-esque&amp;#34; as another reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> Just the smell of it is the only down part of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly never had a shampoo smell I disliked so much.</li>
            <li> Also be careful when ordering.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly thick hair</li>
            <li> After two washes my hairs already less bronze.</li>
            <li> I used it carefully, but a small amount ran down the side of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> smells a little funky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit harsh</li>
            <li> My hair is so damaged and now I have to cut a bunch off right before my wedding :(</li>
            <li> Shipping bad, arrived bottles open in a blue covered box.</li>
            <li> It has a silver sheen instead of a dull gray/yellow.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest buying each one separately, because it appears to be a common issue.</li>
            <li> We stopped using it because we both realized (too late)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the smell of this product is hardly bearable to me..</li>
            <li> The worst part about this product is that is completely dries your hair out.</li>
            <li> Oh, and my bad....</li>
            <li> and they are so crap.</li>
            <li> Crap I thought this was shampoo AND conditioner - not just 2 shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have terrible split ends and my hair strands snap when I brush them or twist my hair into a bun.</li>
            <li> Dries out my hair horribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works. The fragrance is different, almost reminds me hair dye. I had reddish,brassy brown hair with blonde highlights. After only one use, my overall color is more natural brown, with bright blonde highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this combo but received two shampoos instead. I would suggest buying each one separately, because it appears to be a common issue.</li>
            <li> This shampoos keeps my grey hair looking alive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a while now and they are so crap. I bought these because of the overwhelming reviews but designline&#x27;s silver shine is SO MUCH better. Even with my hair chelated, these clairol shampoos and the conditioner does nothing. One use of my designline pair has my hair white.</li>
            <li> Perfect for hair that pulls orange tones, keeps you blonde in between salon visits</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fine, but I prefer the Jhirmack shampoo.</li>
            <li> Although my hair isn&#x27;t a light blonde(medium golden yellow from bleaching) but it reduced the brassiness a little bit. I noticed it made some strands of my hair brighter and more blonde than yellow.</li>
            <li> This really works for lightening/taking brassy tones out. I am preparing my hair before I go grayish silver and it&#x27;s made my hair super light in just 2 washes. I&#x27;m almost a fully white/blonde now. Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to my silver hair! Also be careful when ordering. I thought this was shampoo and conditioner but it is actually just two shampoo bottles. Totally worth my money. Also make sure you are keeping your hair moisturized while using this product. Conditioning with the clairol conditioner or I use the Redkin lightening blonde conditioner. It will really prevent your hair from drying out. :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo is 100% necessary if you have blond hair that you want to keep from being brassy. It&#x27;s a bit harsh so I don&#x27;t use it every day, maybe once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Funny smell but leaves lots of sparkle. This pack had 2 bottles of shampoo. wish it came with one shampoo and one conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Works well at getting brassy tones out. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I use them and they do an excellent job.  My hair is mingled grey.  These products make my grey hair POP with silver shine and I get lots of compliments.  I do cheat and leave it in my hair a bit longer.  A lady with no grey hair said &amp;#34;I want that.  How do I get THAT color?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the product, but I thought I was buying both the shampoo and conditioner.  Not,  its two shampoos.  my fault for not reading it clearly.</li>
            <li> Love these shampoos. strong smell but great results</li>
            <li> Works great on my grey and colored hair.  This was recommended to me by my hairdresser to use once a week or so.  Lathers great and smells good to.</li>
            <li> Makes my white hairs really shine.  I love it!</li>
            <li> It takes dullness out of grey hair, making it shine. If you&#x27;re around a lot of smoke, it takes yellowness out caused by smoke. Nice fresh smell</li>
            <li> smells a little funky</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  If you had blond hair as a kid... this is a must for keeping the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; out of your grey hair.</li>
            <li> omg I love this shampoo. I have ombré hair with grey tips and I love this so much!!! After two washes my hairs already less bronze. And it smells so rich. like perfume. Lol my husband loves it too hehehe</li>
            <li> Brings out the silver in my hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo it&#x27;s really helped me</li>
            <li> I am going to have to refinish my bathtub to get rid of the purple stains. I used it carefully, but a small amount ran down the side of the bottle.  Now I have a stained tub.  I threw the conditioner out.  I still have the shampoo, and don&#x27;t know why because I can&#x27;t see any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Its a miracle for brassy blond hair either because your water is hard, or your original color wasn&#x27;t ash enough.</li>
            <li> Product ok. Shipping bad, arrived bottles open in a blue covered box.</li>
            <li> It got here on time and both the caps were taped shut to prevent any leakage. I love this stuff amazing results to get to that platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years to keep the yellow out... and it works.  May be a bit drying on the hair, so I use a good strong conditioner with occasional treatments to keep the shine.  But, for color it works great.  So much so, that my hairdresser took a picture of my hair, for the color.  Natural &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; blonde with substantial gray throughout, but absolutely NO brassiness.</li>
            <li> The best product for white hair....good savings and delivery too.</li>
            <li> This product works great! I recently decided to bleach my hair and after a few treatments it was really close to the color i wanted (I wanted to get from my natural hair color, dark brown, to a platinum blonde/white color) but it still had a fair amount of yellow pigment in it. After just one use of this shampoo (I only let it sit in for about 30 seconds) I washed it out and my hair was NOTICEABLE more of a purplish/gray color - exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my research about hair bleaching it is normal for your hair to have a purple haze after using this product, but it is by no means distracting. Think grayish-white hair with a tint of purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a good value for what you pay for. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was because I was not a huge fan of the smell - definitely &amp;#34;old-lady-perfume-esque&amp;#34; as another reviewer mentioned. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product which I would recommend. Blessings!</li>
            <li> Everything turn out to be great. Shipping was great.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my platinum hair. Not brassy whatsoever. Deducted a star for the public bathroom/air freshener/old lady smell but that&#x27;s not why I bought it so hey</li>
            <li> This shampoo was just okay--It has a very strong smell that I did not like and honestly, I did not see a big difference in the brassy color of my hair. I would not buy it again. Oh, and my bad....I thought it was shampoo and conditioner, not two shampoos.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended I use this to neutralize the red &amp; brassy tones in my hair (I have brunette hair with highlights. I was trying to get the red tones out and bring out more blonde). It works, no doubt about that. The smell is tolerable, not my favorite but I can deal with it. The worst part about this product is that is completely dries your hair out. I have naturally wavy/curly thick hair and it now feels like straw after using this 2x a week for about 2 months.  My hair is so damaged and now I have to cut a bunch off right before my wedding :( I have terrible split ends and my hair strands snap when I brush them or twist my hair into a bun. It should be noted, I have not used heat or tools on my hair for about 4 months. This is so disappointing since I have been so careful and went to great lengths to not damage my hair before the wedding. I wanted to keep the length and now I have ruined it trying to fix the color with this shampoo...  Also, I know without a doubt my hair is damaged from this product because I recommended it to my friend (she had thin, straight &amp; soft hair) and now she&#x27;s in the same boat as me. We stopped using it because we both realized (too late) it was damaging our hair. Now she has split ends and brittle hair too. Only reason I gave 2 stars is that it works on color as long as you don&#x27;t care about the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> Good price, and quality</li>
            <li> After one use, I notice a definite difference with my highlights. Really solid shampoo for color. The only problem is the smell. It&#x27;s like an old lady. Reminds me of Prell or Breck from the 80&#x27;s in my abuela&#x27;s shower. Price is very on point.</li>
            <li> Dries out my hair horribly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for over twenty years its the best at fighting brassy and orange highlights!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t pass up this pack at $14.99! Love this shampoo. Keeps my bleached blonde hair from getting brassy.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair, and this helps to get the yellow out.</li>
            <li> Love these products!  Leaves my hair silky and shiny.  It has a silver sheen instead of a dull gray/yellow.  I recommend it to anyone with gray hair.</li>
            <li> Crap I thought this was shampoo AND conditioner - not just 2 shampoos. *sigh*</li>
            <li> Took all the brassy out</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a bad/flowery scent to it but it makes your hair feel super soft! Just the smell of it is the only down part of it but otherwise i love it.</li>
            <li> honestly, I thought I was buying shampoo and conditioner, but good thing I didn&#x27;t! This would be the better choice if you are torn between the two packs! The shampoo works great on it&#x27;s own; I let the shampoo sit in my hair for 3 minutes, then use a cheap conditioner. It keeps my color looking nice! Using the shimmer lights conditioner might be overkill.&lt;br /&gt;The con is, it kinda has a chemical smell that lingers...</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and my silver hair really shines after shampooing with Shimmer lights!</li>
            <li> I definitely see a diffrence in my hair .This product is fantastic for blonde and silver hair! After using this product ,a couple of months now it is so much lighter . My Spanish bronze is just about gone!I certainly was NOT dissatisfied! This stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> I cant say anything much yet .first time used also i havent see any diffrent on my hair ..maybe i need to get the conditioner w it.next purchase might be.</li>
            <li> my favorite product  thanks</li>
            <li> Its a very drying purple shampoo, but its very good. Just dont leave it on too long</li>
            <li> Great at keeping brassiness down.  Great conditioners!</li>
            <li> Product really works well ! Will be buying another one !</li>
            <li> the scent is too girly for mens use\</li>
            <li> Amazing! Works better than any other &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this shampoo, it makes her Blonde hair very shiny and soft, so I made sure she had enough. If you buy this at some retail stores it cost $14.99 just for one bottle so this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is not the first blonde-toning product I have used. I&#x27;ve used Redken&#x27;s blonde idol and Paul Mitchell as well, but after seeing this at my new stylist&#x27;s salon, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the smell of this product is hardly bearable to me.. It reeks like the cheapest of cheap drugstore shampoos.. I&#x27;ve honestly never had a shampoo smell I disliked so much. It may do a good job at toning, but for me I couldn&#x27;t even stand letting it sit in my hair for a few moments.</li>
