            <li>Something isn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>Now that &amp;#34;Coral Calcium Supreme&amp;#34; is available on Amazon at such a reasonable price for the 3 Pack, we&#x27;ll be using it even more consistently from now on, for many reasons, such as (to name a few)..&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>

            <li> Bob&#x27;s Coral Calcium has been a part of my daily supplement intake for years. I&#x27;m nearly eighty and&lt;br /&gt;very rarely get sick...or get colds...and I never get headaches. I give Coral Calcium credit for a part&lt;br /&gt;of my good health.</li>
            <li> Delivery and product as expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and this is a great price!  We try to never run out of this supplement.</li>
            <li> This calcium seems to be more easily absorbed than other brands of coral calcium.  At least for me, I find very obvious improvement in the health of both my hair and nails.</li>
            <li> A miracle sent from God.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Authentic coral calcium, (original from Okinawa Japan) was introduced over a decade ago on TV by Bob Barefoot. We&#x27;ve been taking it almost continually ever since, with amazing results! Now that &amp;#34;Coral Calcium Supreme&amp;#34; is available on Amazon at such a reasonable price for the 3 Pack, we&#x27;ll be using it even more consistently from now on, for many reasons, such as (to name a few)..&lt;br /&gt;1) It eliminates any problems (we formerly had) with muscle cramps.&lt;br /&gt;2) We sleep better at night.&lt;br /&gt;3) Fluids in the body are kept slightly alkaline, benefits of which are now well known!&lt;br /&gt;Plus many other health benefits for the heart &amp; over-all general health!</li>
            <li> Coral calcium is suppose to have a alkaline base,but this product has a acid base,so there is no coral calcium in this product</li>
            <li> I love Bob Barefoot&#x27;s Coral Calcium Supreme and have taken it on and off for many years. This time, the order was different than I remember.  One capsule was broken and spilled all over the inside which was not a good thing.  I wondered that when I collected the excess and put nearly every bit of it back inside the broken capsule, it only filled about half the capsule.  In the past, I thought the capsules were always firm and this was because they probably contained more.  I discovered by checking all the capsules that all of them were only about half full.  So, I am concerned that this is not the normal amount I am accustomed to receiving.  I am taking these capsules now because I need them and I don&#x27;t know if there is a problem or not.  It haunts me though, because I don&#x27;t remember having this experience ever before and I have taken Bob Barefoot&#x27;s Coral Calcium Supreme  for lots of years and have ordered it from Amazon.com before for this same package.  I have also previously ordered from elsewhere.  I never suspected capsules only being half full before.  Can you tell me what might be going on? I can tell when I bite down on them that they are not full  because they collapse when I do that. Something isn&#x27;t right.  I am so familiar with Coral Calcium Supreme that I immediately noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> How in the world do you find 20 words to talk about calcium. Could not tell you if it really works without a bone density test which wouldn&#x27;t show anything for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> quick ship &amp; what  I wanted</li>
            <li> I love this product,  the best I have found, easily digested for good bones and health</li>
            <li> Cannot take regular calcium but I can take this.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for over 15 years. It just makes sense. The greatest percentage of our body is composed of calcium and water. We all know the benefits of vitamin D as well. I am 58 yrs. old, relatively healthy, and medication free. Its working for me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to move without it</li>
            <li> I have taken Barefoot Coral Calcium for the past 10 years, so I ordered this product based on the fact that it was an authentic Bob Barefoot product, picture and signature and all.  But....is it really?  After reading the reviews I saw that some noticed their capsules were only half-full, as opposed to the full firm capsules I am familiar with.  So I checked my bottle and sure enough mine were lacking too!!!!  They collapse when you bend them, only a fraction of the product was in there, and I wonder now if its really coral calcium at all, as one reviewer stated they tested it and found an acid base to it (supposed to be alkaline, which is the basis for it working right in the body).  I am stunned at this fraud and will contact the manufacturer.  I will NEVER order from this seller again, check your capsules people, we are being ripped off!  And at $20 a bottle, that&#x27;s a big loss.</li>
            <li> Calcium is great for good sleep, pain controll, and general health.  I am 75 and consider my good health to be from top choices in suppliments.</li>
            <li> I like Bob Barefoots coral calcium, and will order it again.with just one pill a day, my husbands leg cramps went away.</li>
            <li> This item came in one package. Three bottles inside and bottles were sealed and was new, unopened. I bought it for my mother and she loved it.  Uses it everyday. Will definitely buy again soon.</li>
