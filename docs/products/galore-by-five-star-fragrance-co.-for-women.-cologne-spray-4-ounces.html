            <li>My wife used this 30 years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it any more.  </li>

            <li>Galore is sometimes hard to find - I will always buy two bottles when Galore is available - It is an awesome gift!</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, tried many others through the years and always end up going back to this one.</li>
            <li>Thank You, waiting forever and finally satified, and waited a short time for my best birthday gift in 2014.</li>
            <li>Only wish they were not discontinuing...  been using for almost 40-years and can&#x27;t believe I won&#x27;t be able to get more when I run out of this bottle.</li>
            <li>Get a lot of positive feedback from people when l wear this particular popular fragrance</li>
            <li>This is a great product for small jobs and I found it easy to assemble</li>
            <li>I do love the soft fragrance of Galore.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and have worn it since I was 16 years old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Galore is simply a clean and pleasant fragrance that is not overwhelming nor intrusive.  </li>
            <li>the Galore by five Star  was very close to the original and brought back many memories.</li>
            <li>It is a soft, easy to wear fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that ANYONE could write a positive review about this perfume</li>
            <li>THE ENTIRE PROCESS WAS EASY AND I WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER  MY GALORE FROM &amp;#34;FIVE STAR FRAGRANCE COMPANY&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li>THE ORDER WAS RECEIVED IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER.  </li>
            <li>light but lasting</li>
            <li>I do not believe the fragrance itself has changed much.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for years and will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I have ordered it a few times and we are always pleased.</li>
            <li>have not been able to find it for the past year, then just happened on it in Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I have enough for the whole year</li>
            <li>She has used it for at least 50 years or more.</li>
            <li>That statement, however, is simply my feeling about this particular fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and she says it does not sour on her body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells a little like the original Galore.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I buy this for my mother because she cannot find it in brick and mortar stores any longer.  It always arrives in very good condition and in a sealed package.  The price is a value compared to what she used to pay in department stores.</li>
            <li> So glad to find that this product is still around. Have LOVED it for years. My husband &amp; grown children think it is the ONLY fragrance I&#x27;m supposed to wear. When I&#x27;ve tried others, they all say--hmmmmm, i still like Galore the best. After 40 odd years using it--guess I&#x27;m sticking with it!!!!!</li>
            <li> That perfume is simply nauseating. I cannot believe that ANYONE could write a positive review about this perfume it smells terrible. I cannot even use it as an air freshener. All my air fresheners are more pleasant to the nose.BEWARE if you plan to return an Item to Amazon do Not buy Perfumes They are not returnable.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOGNE!!!  HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS AND BOTH OF MY SISTERS DO ALSO. I HOPE IT IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> My Mom&#x27;s favorite fragrance...she loves it.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and arrived in a timely manner.  I have used it for years and will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Have worn this for 40 years. Still the same. Cannot find this in a retail store so love being able to still buy this.</li>
            <li> Received the items very quickly.  Totally satisfied with my purchase.  I have used this product for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of compliments from friends and strangers quite often.  I will continue to use Galore until it is&lt;br /&gt;discontinued.  I hope it never is!  I am glad I found it on Amazon....price was cheaper</li>
            <li> I have used Galore for more than 20 years.  It was produced by Scandia way back when.  It is a soft, easy to wear fragrance.  I have always received many compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to find it for the past year, then just happened on it in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt; Yeah!!&lt;br /&gt;Mary Ann</li>
            <li> Galore is sometimes hard to find - I will always buy two bottles when Galore is available - It is an awesome gift!</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law loves this cologne.  Fast shipping and the perfect gift.  I buy six or eight at a time so I have enough for the whole year so I can give her a couple at Christmas, then a couple at Valentines, then a couple for her Birthday!  Perfect all the way around!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, tried many others through the years and always end up going back to this one. It is somewhat hard to find and the price is steadily rising. It arrived on time and yes, I will order it again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best light fragrances.  It is clean and flowery, great for the summer!  If your are looking for a light, clean yet elegant fragrance... this is it.</li>
            <li> Loved this as a young woman; thrilled to be able to get it again.</li>
            <li> This Galore cologne is not the same.&lt;br /&gt;Beware buyers.Its a replica of the authentic Galore. It was made in the sixty&#x27;s by a company called &amp;#34;Scandia&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It was then in the 80&#x27;s bought by&lt;br /&gt;Germaine Monteil. Five Star Fragrance has imitated the scent. The scent only last for an hour with each spray.&lt;br /&gt;It smells a little like the original Galore.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not the same. The price of the imitation one is way too expensive for a Fake.</li>
            <li> My wife likes Galore and she says it does not sour on her body. She has used it for at least 50 years or more. The only problem she has had in our area is finding it. You service was excellent.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for small jobs and I found it easy to assemble</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can find this item and it is a family members favorite.  I have ordered it a few times and we are always pleased. The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my best friend for Christmas. It is her favorite scent. Very good value.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having my Mom&#x27;s cologne.  She is 83 and this has been her favorite for years. So you have made her very happy.</li>
            <li> I can only say Thank You Thank You, waiting forever and finally satified, and waited a short time for my best birthday gift in 2014. Hats off to a fantastic company . I recommend this to all friends and family cannot wait to order  again. Margee Garippo</li>
            <li> This cologne has a wonderful, clean, fresh air smell ! !  It is NOT an over powering perfume with a sickening smell that affects your sinuses ! !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the fragrance on me.</li>
            <li> I do love the soft fragrance of Galore. Does not over power you. Just perfect...sort of like the smell of baby powder.</li>
            <li> Only wish they were not discontinuing...  been using for almost 40-years and can&#x27;t believe I won&#x27;t be able to get more when I run out of this bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this fresh engaging scent!  Get a lot of positive feedback from people when l wear this particular popular fragrance</li>
            <li> I love this scent and have worn it since I was 16 years old. Please continue to carry it. So many individuals ask about it and compliment me on it. Thank you again.</li>
            <li> I WAS SO PLEASED TO FIND THE FRAGRANCE,  HAVE WORN IT FOR OVER 30 YEARS &amp; IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND IT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.  A VERY CLEAN &amp; PLEASANT FRAGRANCE.. PLEASED AT THE PRICE!  THE ORDER WAS RECEIVED IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER.  THE ENTIRE PROCESS WAS EASY AND I WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER  MY GALORE FROM &amp;#34;FIVE STAR FRAGRANCE COMPANY&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> Best product for Day &amp; Nighty. . . light but lasting</li>
            <li> My wife used this 30 years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it any more.  the Galore by five Star  was very close to the original and brought back many memories.</li>
            <li> Recieved in a timely fashion.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the price and  it was all it was described as and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;I will shop again when I run out and hope to find another great deal on it!</li>
            <li> The gamut of stinkies is unbelievable and many are just awful but not Galore.  That statement, however, is simply my feeling about this particular fragrance.  It has been around for years and even though there have been some changes in the brand I do not believe the fragrance itself has changed much.  The fragrance alone is a personal matter and no matter what I say or do not say it matters not if another does not like the output.  Some of today&#x27;s odors are just that and nothing more.  Then you look at the price charged for awful smelling products and bewilderment flushes the skin more than the fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Galore is simply a clean and pleasant fragrance that is not overwhelming nor intrusive.  To top it off it is not a bankrupter.  It remains one of several chosen products and I just hope it does not disappear again.</li>
