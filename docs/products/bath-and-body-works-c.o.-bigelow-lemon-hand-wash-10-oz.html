            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and creamy and leaves your skin feeling refreshed!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and the moisturizing effect of this soap.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon when Bath &amp; Body removed it from their stores.</li>
            <li>It has the most pleasant, understated lemon scent, something this perfume-adverse person really appreciates.  </li>
            <li>I keep this in my own bathroom and don&#x27;t share since I love it so much.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Smooth.  </li>
            <li>It seems to last forever, too making it an amazing bargain!</li>
            <li>Rich.</li>
            <li>It is like rubbing your hands with fresh lemons!</li>
            <li>You feel like your hands are clean when done washing with this soap..</li>
            <li>Even though it is labeled \\&quot;hand soap\\&quot;, I also use it in the shower because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>It feels so silky on my skin, smells great and truly does brighten up my skin a bit due to the lemon oil.</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite soap.</li>
            <li>and this reminds me of fresh picked lemons.  </li>
            <li>Smells just like fresh lemons.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh lemon scent (not artificial) and cleans hands w/o over-drying my skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell fake at all - it just smells perfectly wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This lemon soap has been my favorite for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like most soaps do.  </li>
            <li>It feels so much more healthy and less chemically infused than the big name brands and the smell is AMA-ZING.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle, lightly scented, non-drying soap that not only works well but makes my jewelry shine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t tell her how much I had to spend plus shipping as she would probably blow a gut, but hey, she&#x27;s my wife</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the gentle cleansing, and the lemon fragrance is unisex.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does cost a few dollars more than you would pay for a hand soap in say, a grocery store, but I think it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff but try to make it last by using just half a squirt of soap.  </li>
            <li>Since I wash my hands frequently, I am prone to skin problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so luxurious feeling and doesn&#x27;t bother my uber sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin on my hands and most liquid soaps make them worse</li>

            <li> This is a gentle, lightly scented, non-drying soap that not only works well but makes my jewelry shine.</li>
            <li> I gave one of these to my wife for Christmas and she loves it. She says that only a tiny amount is needed to produce mountains of suds. She loves the lemon scent. I didn&#x27;t tell her how much I had to spend plus shipping as she would probably blow a gut, but hey, she&#x27;s my wife and I love her, so- so what.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite soap. Even though it is labeled \\&quot;hand soap\\&quot;, I also use it in the shower because I love it so much. It feels so silky on my skin, smells great and truly does brighten up my skin a bit due to the lemon oil. Yes, it does cost a few dollars more than you would pay for a hand soap in say, a grocery store, but I think it&#x27;s really worth it. In fact, because of the lightening effect of the lemon oil, a scar on my hand has faded quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful soup! It feels so much more healthy and less chemically infused than the big name brands and the smell is AMA-ZING. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands. I have it in every bathroom in my house. It seems to last forever, too making it an amazing bargain!</li>
            <li> VERY Nice soap, Smells great</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has the most pleasant, understated lemon scent, something this perfume-adverse person really appreciates.  Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like most soaps do.  It&#x27;s incredibly expensive to buy on Amazon though and I only do so if I can&#x27;t get to a store that sells this.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and when you wash with it and then use the hand cream, you have the softest hands and the fragrance is wonderful.  I keep this in my own bathroom and don&#x27;t share since I love it so much.  It isn&#x27;t cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My husband received this at work as a gift and we didn&#x27;t think we were going to like it. However, we loved it and have found that we could get it from Amazon. We will be repeated buyers!</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean smell. Is a very effective cleaner too! Lemon oil is one of the best oils and this product has a lot of lemon oil in it. It is the best!</li>
            <li> This will always be in my kitchen.  Rich. Smooth.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> By far the best kitchen hand soap!  It smells perfect.. we had a big lemon tree in out backyard when I was a kid and this reminds me of fresh picked lemons.  It doesn&#x27;t smell fake at all - it just smells perfectly wonderful.  The consistency is creamy and soft.. not too thin.  You feel like your hands are clean when done washing with this soap.. it&#x27;s like a mini spa experience.  I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Would not be without this on my bathroom sink. It is like rubbing your hands with fresh lemons!</li>
            <li> This lemon soap has been my favorite for a long time.  It goes on smooth and creamy and leaves your skin feeling refreshed!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but try to make it last by using just half a squirt of soap.  Just a lovely wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Since I wash my hands frequently, I am prone to skin problems. I really appreciate the gentle cleansing, and the lemon fragrance is unisex. A great choice for guest bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this soap!!  I have VERY sensitive skin on my hands and most liquid soaps make them worse (dry like sandpaper, red, cracking/bleeding). I can only use a couple brands (Zum, Nubian Heritage bar soap) and Bath &amp; Body Works revamped their formula and I cannot use theirs anymore. This is a great lifesaver!!  It&#x27;s so luxurious feeling and doesn&#x27;t bother my uber sensitive skin. Yay!!</li>
            <li> Smells just like fresh lemons. My favorite!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the moisturizing effect of this soap. I have it beside all my sinks. It makes me feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This has been a staple on my kitchen sink for about five years.  It has a fresh lemon scent (not artificial) and cleans hands w/o over-drying my skin. I was glad to find it on Amazon when Bath &amp; Body removed it from their stores.</li>
