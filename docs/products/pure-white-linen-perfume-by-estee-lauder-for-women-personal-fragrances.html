            <li> Dose not last on your skin  like most e l fragrances.  it is to expensive for a  product that  hold up</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother and she loves it. It&#x27;s a very light crisp clean smell that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Was a christmas gift for my mother. She loved it. It seems very nice i always take a few pumps of it myself</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite. I love the smell also and recommend Pure White Linen. It&#x27;s not overpowering and is just right.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and distribición by supplier</li>
            <li> The product came in record time and it came with stuff that I was not expecting.  It was perfume and it came in a nice bag that can be used as a pocket book and it came with a facial scrubbing pad and it was packaged very nicely.  By the way, the price was right!   Better than anyone else and that is one reason I bought it!</li>
            <li> Another greatly appreciated holiday gift to my wife.</li>
            <li>  love it!! Feel comfortable when I used. Just&#x27;s got last week! So sweet!! </li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for years. It has a lovely, light scent.  I only strayed once when I could not find it in the store where I went to purchase a new bottle. I was very happy to find it on Amazon, and to be able go back to using Pure White Linen.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite. It made the perfect Christmas gift. I would recommend this for a wonderful gift for your wife.</li>
            <li> Not sure why Estee Lauder chose to name this perfume so similarly to the old standby White Linen. It smells nothing like its heavy namesake. Light, clean, slightly green, fresh but not childish. Reminds me of daffodils. This is my personal signature fragrance and I always receive compliments on it. It is also a great price as I&#x27;ve price shopped this product extensively.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the parfum but there is something wrong with the spray bottle which is very irritating. I thought it would loosen up -it hasn&#x27;t and seems to be blocked. Probably should have returned it but didn&#x27;t just due to the inconvenience!!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this perfume and I changed to another. I came back because I like the scent better than anyother perfum.</li>
