            <li> It took a really long time to arrive and it looked nothing like the picture on the Internet.</li>
            <li> If you have anything heavy, like textbooks for school, be careful because the straps may break and you will have to re attach them to a new spot.</li>
            <li> Not at all what i expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected, zipper already broke</li>
            <li> I would not recommend anyone purchasing unless you hardly ever stick with one specific purse.</li>
            <li> but i think comes from the packaging i put a few fabric softener sheets in it</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It broke within a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave bad reviews, but this purse is not at all what the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I would rate in no stars but it made me do at least 1.</li>
            <li> Not the same color or quality in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Not a horrible bag.</li>

            <li> The zippers fell off and the bag started changing colors :(</li>
            <li> A very disappointing Christmas gift for my daughter</li>
            <li> Literally a crap bag.</li>

            <li> Really big and beautifull, useful and wonderful. Loved it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love the purse looks great. Carried on your arm, cross body, or on your shoulder! Did come with smell but i think comes from the packaging i put a few fabric softener sheets in it and now its good to go no smell.</li>
            <li> Cheap bag when I received the bag it was nice, the next day it was ripping apart!!! Cheap, Cheap, Cheap bag</li>
            <li> My daughter used it 3 days in school and the handle broke. Leather looks cheap and almost plasticity.  For the price we got what we paid for. I would rate in no stars but it made me do at least 1.</li>
            <li> love the bag and i was able to get it for a great price so that is even better, was just expecting the leather to look more distressed and worn.</li>
            <li> It was terrible ! I had it for 1 week and now it&#x27;s on my garbage..very cheap material</li>
            <li> More than three things broke in the first day I used it. Literally a crap bag.</li>
            <li> I really like the bag, it&#x27;s great and there&#x27;s a perfect amount of space for anything you need. The only thing I found wrong with it was the cheap material. If you have anything heavy, like textbooks for school, be careful because the straps may break and you will have to re attach them to a new spot. Also beware of zippers breaking.</li>
            <li> Not the same color or quality in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Not a horrible bag. But I was expecting more than what I got.</li>
            <li> Not at all what i expected. The bag is very large and the color is more of an orange brown. It doesn&#x27;t look like the photo, its very square. Its made very cheap and the zipper is very rough. Kind of seems like something you could buy at a dollor store. Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Terrible!!  ugly. El-Cheap-O.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected, zipper already broke</li>
            <li> HANDLE BROKE IN 5 DAYS</li>
            <li> Looks and price were good, but after getting the bag, i had used it for about two weeks until the zipper broke and seams started to come undone. I would not recommend anyone purchasing unless you hardly ever stick with one specific purse.</li>
            <li> The strap broke after 2 weeks:-(</li>
            <li> the bag broke after using it for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I love this bag. However, I gave it a four because the material in the outside pocket was so fragile, I couldn&#x27;t put my keys in there because it tore a hole in there. Nonetheless, I still love this bag. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys having a spacious bag, without effecting how cute it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for school and it&#x27;s lasted two months. Inside material rips, the handles and strap rips, everything rips. Very cheap material, I do not recommend it to students at all. Or mothers. Or women who carry a lot of crap (like me).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave bad reviews, but this purse is not at all what the picture shows. It looks very cheap. The hardware is flimsy and tarnished. Like others mentioned, the inside smells awful. I tried Febreeze and dryer sheets and it still smells bad. I would love to get my money back, but it took so long to get here that I don&#x27;t feel like going through the hassle.</li>
            <li> Fell apart in about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> love this purse. just big enough to fit everything i need and toss in an umbrella too.</li>
            <li> Before i even got the chance to wear the purse one of the buckles broke. Thank god i wasn&#x27;t out and about when it happened. also more sqaure looking than shown in the picture</li>
            <li> I ordered this a few weeks ago. This bag is terrible!! It broke within a few days of using it. The zippers fell off and the bag started changing colors :(</li>
            <li> My daughter just loves this and it is really nice.</li>
            <li> very poor quality and they denied a request for a return.  A very disappointing Christmas gift for my daughter</li>
