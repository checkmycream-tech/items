            <li>So I am truly impressed with these.  </li>
            <li>The wand is the perfect length also.</li>
            <li>Best applicator for eyeliner in a pot</li>

            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>great deal for a great price!</li>
            <li>They are great for sampling gel eyeliner, liquid eyeliner and even a pencil eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Great size.</li>
            <li>These are so very handy.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but they look like they will be perfect!!!!  : )</li>
            <li>These come in handy for cat eyes!</li>
            <li>AND they came in cute zip-close packaging, which makes for travel nice and orderly!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered more!</li>
            <li>Clients can get a really precised look &amp; they leave happy!</li>
            <li>Good for eyeliner, and healthy.</li>
            <li>Good service and adequate packaging.  </li>
            <li>LOVE these.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that I love everything about them.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest that these are better served in the hands of more skilled makeup artists.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad to have these.</li>
            <li>The brushes are okay.</li>
            <li>I suggest packing these better.</li>
            <li>Perfect little disposable &#x27;brushes&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Love these, they are very convenient !</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer them that way because I will be able to create a line with just the very tip of the brush, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I use these not so much for eyeliner (I use my brushes for that) but to make sure false eyelashes are put in the right place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional Makeup artist.  </li>
            <li>VERY VERY SMALL, but good for eyeliner not really for lips.....</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small and so are the brush tips, which I&#x27;m fine with.  </li>
            <li>Halloween makeup designs are often messy and sticky, so it&#x27;s nice that I can just dispose of these once they&#x27;re a mess without losing a lot of money.</li>
            <li>Received it faster than what I expected ;-)</li>
            <li>Another user said the hairs are stiff and it&#x27;s true.</li>

            <li> Definitely recommend this if you have trouble with your tips.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I do appreciate how sharp a line you can get with them and know that it can be attributed in part to their sturdy structure.  </li>
            <li> Especially since my eyes are small.</li>
            <li> So I decided to just try them for little things;  </li>
            <li> The brush is too firm</li>
            <li> I wanted these wands for gel eye liner application, but they are too stiff for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I wish the bristles were not as stiff.</li>
            <li> Even after softening them with my fingers and a little water, these applicators are VERY stiff.  </li>
            <li> I use these for making thin lines and wrinkles for Halloween makeup</li>
            <li> I tried them as false eyelash applicators and worked</li>
            <li> Gets in very small spaces!  </li>

            <li> Is not what i expect.</li>

            <li> Love these, they are very convenient ! great deal for a great price!</li>
            <li> Item as described.  Good service and adequate packaging.  Use for liquid liners, not gel liners!</li>
            <li> The brush is too firm</li>
            <li> Good for eyeliner, and healthy.</li>
            <li> VERY VERY SMALL, but good for eyeliner not really for lips.....</li>
            <li> Not only do I use these to apply my gel eyeliner, I use them to apply glue to my falsies. I&#x27;ve already ordered more!</li>
            <li> I wanted these wands for gel eye liner application, but they are too stiff for that purpose. I tried them as false eyelash applicators and worked okay. I wish the bristles were not as stiff.</li>
            <li> Perfect little disposable &#x27;brushes&#x27;.  I use these for making thin lines and wrinkles for Halloween makeup and they&#x27;re a big help.  Halloween makeup designs are often messy and sticky, so it&#x27;s nice that I can just dispose of these once they&#x27;re a mess without losing a lot of money.</li>

            <li> Best applicator for eyeliner in a pot</li>

            <li> These are so very handy.  Always having to look for my eyeliner pencil so I&#x27;m glad to have these.</li>
            <li> Got them in time!  Great product!</li>
            <li> The brushes are okay. They&#x27;re small and so are the brush tips, which I&#x27;m fine with.  Another user said the hairs are stiff and it&#x27;s true. Personally, I prefer them that way because I will be able to create a line with just the very tip of the brush, but that&#x27;s just me. Also, the brushes arrived in a ripped plastic case. When I took it out of the shipping box, all my brushes spilled on the floor. I suggest packing these better.</li>
