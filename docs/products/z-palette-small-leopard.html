            <li>Nice design on them as well.</li>
            <li>Love my large pallet but this is great for travel.</li>
            <li>I love this things.</li>
            <li>I love it to because the top is visable to all you makeup</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this mini palette.  </li>
            <li>Love the leopard print.....easy to find in my collection of palettes.  </li>
            <li>Super cute and useful!!!</li>
            <li>Its compact and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Travels just fine in checked or carry on bags</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic item.  </li>
            <li>It is so sleek and cute, fits right in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>All I know is that I am glad that I bought the large palette and received some magnets.  </li>
            <li>The magnets to keep it closed are great- no makeup fallout.</li>
            <li>Very compact and stylish.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be ordering again:)</li>
            <li>I put all of the colors I normally use into one place - that&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>It is perfect for ladies who have multiple palettes of makeup and want to use only certain colors.</li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>For only $5 more I get nearly three times more product to put my eye-shadow in.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my The Balm products utilized a metal that really stuck to the magnet since this palette did not come with any magnets.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The item was packages well and shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I think I may need the next size up soon! :)</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing this product and was worried that the box would be flimsy.</li>
            <li>I own three other Z palettes, all large.</li>
            <li>It has a strong snap, but I have to put a pen in the fold to hold it open while I use it.</li>
            <li>it is done and ready to be put in a z pallette.</li>
            <li>They are compact and ready to go when you are.  </li>
            <li>I love how small it is, you can fit 9 different palettes in.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommened this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love this little palette to hold my trans powder and bronzer that I throw in my purse for work, instead of carrying each product separately.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it will slowly close on its own.</li>
            <li>They have a strong magnet to hold your products in tightly</li>
            <li>I paid $17.99 for this tiny thing and $23.00 for all three of my large size Z palettes.</li>
            <li>I only needed this for a few loose pans I had in my makeup bag, I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist by any means, but it really helps to organize and keep products in good condition</li>
            <li>It is big enough to fit multiple things, but small enough that it wont take up too much space in your purse.</li>

            <li> It is big enough to fit multiple things, but small enough that it wont take up too much space in your purse.</li>
            <li> Each palette was covered in bubble wrap to protect the clear front from scratching and the cardboard material used to make the product was extremely sturdy.</li>
            <li> I know that you can buy them separately, and I know you could buy magnet strips for cheap; but I think that they should have included a few to use the product properly, and so I didn&#x27;t have to use a thick magnet not meant for it.  </li>

            <li> but it is less than half the size of a large.</li>

            <li> and I took a knife and pulled it loose and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got all my daily shadows in this convenient little case.  </li>
            <li> the color was just like I expected.</li>
            <li> Palette was so small only held like six shadows!</li>
            <li> The other brands don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention when I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t realize how small it would be.</li>
            <li> I use to have all kinds of this little compacts everyone until I discovered this things.</li>
            <li> Carries a few eyeshadow Ong with apace for a blush.  </li>
            <li> I rated this 5 stars because the delivery time wasn&#x27;t bad at all, and the product looks EXACTLY like the photo</li>
            <li> Would also recommend for beginners with a small collection they are building on.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>

            <li> I love my Z Palette! the color was just like I expected. It is so sleek and cute, fits right in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> This makes the 3rd one of these I have bought. I love this things. I have bought a lot of eyeshadow from makeup geek and I plan to buy some of mac eyeshadow and this thing is the greatest thing for organizing your eyeshadow, blushes, bronzers and etc.  and having them all together in one place. I use to have all kinds of this little compacts everyone until I discovered this things. I have also depotted some eyeshadow I already had to go in this to. I love it to because the top is visable to all you makeup so it can be seen even before you open it. I would highly recommened this to anyone. If you have a lot of makeup in compacts already just google search ways to depot them. It&#x27;s simple. The way I done mine is, I set my oven on 200, placed my compacts on a cookie sheet and plaeced it in the oven. After about 10 minutes or so the plastic started melting away from the metal and I took a knife and pulled it loose and wala it is done and ready to be put in a z pallette. Go ahead buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Perfect size, great magnetic closure, super sleek. Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Happy with product, easy way to carry eyeshadows and great for travelling.</li>
            <li> Palette was so small only held like six shadows! So disappointed! Good for traveling though. If you want a bigger palette don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
            <li> I rated this 5 stars because the delivery time wasn&#x27;t bad at all, and the product looks EXACTLY like the photo and it was perfect for what I needed. The magnets to keep it closed are great- no makeup fallout. Will be buying another!</li>
            <li> product Arrived in a timely fashion, wrapped/ packaged very well and in great condition. I only needed this for a few loose pans I had in my makeup bag, I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist by any means, but it really helps to organize and keep products in good condition</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great packaging and quality product. Very happy and will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I love how small it is, you can fit 9 different palettes in. Its compact and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I love this little palette to hold my trans powder and bronzer that I throw in my purse for work, instead of carrying each product separately.  Luckily, my The Balm products utilized a metal that really stuck to the magnet since this palette did not come with any magnets.&lt;br /&gt;This is why I only rated it 3 stars, or maybe it was the fault of the seller.  All I know is that I am glad that I bought the large palette and received some magnets.  I know that you can buy them separately, and I know you could buy magnet strips for cheap; but I think that they should have included a few to use the product properly, and so I didn&#x27;t have to use a thick magnet not meant for it.  It also bothered me that the magnets are pictured next to the palette, but aren&#x27;t included and it is not mentioned in the description whether they are included or not.  Definitely a fault of Amazon!</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Exactly what I wanted. Ordered on a holiday and my package shipped within 3 hours and was on my doorstep 2 days later! I will most definitely be ordering again:)</li>
            <li> Z Palette is where it&#x27;s at!! The other brands don&#x27;t compare. They have a strong magnet to hold your products in tightly and they are just too cute!! The item was packages well and shipped fast! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s so cute... I love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for holding all of my Mary Kay eye colors! I think I may need the next size up soon! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my blush pans in my makeup kit. It holds four of them perfectly. Very compact and stylish.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing this product and was worried that the box would be flimsy. I was very happy when I received it. Each palette was covered in bubble wrap to protect the clear front from scratching and the cardboard material used to make the product was extremely sturdy. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I love this mini palette.  I&#x27;ve got all my daily shadows in this convenient little case.  It is about 4X4 in and fits the basic shadows that I typically use daily.  What a great accessory!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for ladies who have multiple palettes of makeup and want to use only certain colors. It is big enough to fit multiple things, but small enough that it wont take up too much space in your purse. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic item.  I put all of the colors I normally use into one place - that&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is nice to keep all of your pan eye-shadows and/or blush.  I wish I would&#x27;ve purchsed a larger pallet-LOL. They are compact and ready to go when you are.  Nice design on them as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention when I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t realize how small it would be. I own three other Z palettes, all large. I expected this to be only slightly smaller but it is less than half the size of a large. Now, if I&#x27;d paid attention, it does say it&#x27;s 3.8\\&quot; x 3.8\\&quot; and the product is a good quality. It&#x27;s a good size for travel. My reason for giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. I paid $17.99 for this tiny thing and $23.00 for all three of my large size Z palettes. For only $5 more I get nearly three times more product to put my eye-shadow in. Again, it&#x27;s a quality product, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love my large pallet but this is great for travel. Carries a few eyeshadow Ong with apace for a blush.  Would also recommend for beginners with a small collection they are building on. Sturdy quality. Travels just fine in checked or carry on bags</li>
            <li> Love the leopard print.....easy to find in my collection of palettes.  Great size for travel!</li>
            <li> I got this because it was on sale. I needed a palette, but I don&#x27;t like the pattern on this one. However, the size is great, it feels sturdy and since I don&#x27;t travel with it, I don&#x27;t worry about damaging it. It has a strong snap, but I have to put a pen in the fold to hold it open while I use it. Otherwise, it will slowly close on its own.</li>
            <li> Super cute and useful!!!</li>
