            <li>KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK: ) ..</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I have been bleaching my hair for a couple months &amp; heard it was good for restoring/protecting softness.</li>
            <li>I am a NPC Figure Competitor and I purchased this to make my own body scrub before I get my body spray tan before any shows.  </li>
            <li>Use it to  make my own pomade.</li>
            <li>Loving this oil.</li>
            <li>Received product and looking forward to using so I can make my own sunblock.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>The oil maybe in a liquefied form if it arrives in warm weather, but it solidifies under 70 degrees in my house.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any type of smell to me, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I order this connect oil to use on my hair, it does liquify upon touch but doesn&#x27;t have that nice coconut smell</li>
            <li>Good stuff, but a better deal if you buy the mayonnaise jar size at the grocery or health food store.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using coconut oil - and I&#x27;m more than impressed.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to work with and added a nice scent.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly and I was happy with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>i love it will buy more after i run out thank you!</li>
            <li>I like this coconut oil, very good quality and the prize is reasonable.</li>
            <li>This oil has turned out to be awesome for moisturizing my natural hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Love the way it melts and works in so nicely.</li>
            <li>Great quality and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Would have liked this better if it was edible.  </li>
            <li>:) This product is nice for skin and hair.</li>
            <li>This a great product that made my hair super manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is great for cuticles and much more.</li>
            <li>It melts easily , which works well with me!</li>
            <li>I bought this brand because it was the cheapest and even though it works great, just be aware that it is odorless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality oil with a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this coconut oil :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the coconut smell, more of a chemical smell which throws me off.  </li>
            <li>Love this product--- you can use it everywhere.</li>
            <li>Yes, love coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t apply it to the top of my hair or bangs because it just makes them oily, but on the ends of my hair</li>
            <li>so it helps keeps those parts healthy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and it is cheap!</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil for many things now.  </li>
            <li>but I love the price.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on the driest parts of my body, like elbows, etc.</li>
            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>THERE IS NOTHING ON THE TOP OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE</li>
            <li>AND THE SELLER DOES IT INTENTIONALLY, SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD BUY IT BY MISTAKE.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal, works great in my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it in my hair after every shower.</li>
            <li>It is cloth diaper safe (no build up, repelling or stinkies) and it prevents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great product for the price and not greasy, but moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>This works better on my hair than my hair lotions and anti-frizz hair sprays, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Although I love the smell, sometimes I&#x27;m ok with not smelling a coconut cream pie under my nose:)</li>
            <li>and I am going to order more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased coconut oil before, but i love putting this in my hair.  </li>
            <li>This oil is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love using on feet and hands, even highlighting cheekbones over blush.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it is working.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>It has worked for me and I am sure it will work for you.</li>
            <li>I love coconut oil and use it both for cooking and hair/skin care.</li>
            <li>like eit and will probably order more</li>
            <li>better the baby oil, it has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting more, and it keeps my skin morse all day.</li>
            <li>Most products leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Arrived in a liquid forum with the top off in the box from transport.</li>
            <li>But i love it</li>
            <li>but will do some more research so that I get what I&#x27;m looking for before ordering again.</li>
            <li>I love the coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Love for making homemade stuff.</li>
            <li>and I find it&#x27;s much better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried through the years.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and shinier, more manageable.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>It is not horrible by any means, and I will use it til it gone, but will not be  buying it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my skin more than in my hair, but I plan on using it in combination with castor oil for my hair.</li>
            <li>so make sure you put it on before you go to bed and let it soak over night.</li>
            <li>I washed it out three times with Prell, didn&#x27;t use a conditioner after, and my hair was the softest, shiniest and most well behaved I&#x27;ve seen it in two decades.  </li>
            <li>I may get one for my sisters:)</li>
            <li>An olive oil treatment works much better.</li>
            <li>It is much better than any hair oil I have ever used before.  </li>
            <li>Still love it though</li>
            <li>It absorbs well into my skin, and I can use it on my comb to smooth out my hair WITHOUT it looking greasy!  </li>
            <li>Okay product does what it says it will do, but congealed once opened.</li>
            <li>The container could have been a squirt bottle for better access.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>

            <li>It can even be used on sore/tender nipples while breastfeeding and is safe for you and baby.  </li>
            <li>My skin has NEVER looked better.</li>
            <li>Most oils bother me and leave a glossy film.</li>
            <li>My feet and nails LOVE</li>
            <li>I bought this as part of a transition into a more natural/organic lifestyle.</li>

            <li>dog and my cat love this stuff after rubbing it on my hands, my cat jumped up in my lap and started to lick it off.</li>

            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>There are so many uses for coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I thought it might have more of a petroleum jelly consistency.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better deal.</li>

            <li>Great natural makeup remover!!</li>
            <li>It works perfect and leaves your body super soft.</li>
            <li>Still watching for better personal results because if the benefits can be produced this is a good value and good to have around.</li>
            <li>So as long as you don&#x27;t mind the lack of scent, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Firstly it arrived in time and we&#x27;ll sealed and good condition.</li>
            <li>love the oil and the ordering and shipping was easy, will recommend</li>
            <li>It is also a good conditioner to put in after you was your hair it makes it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>good moisturizer, does liquify at a certain temperature depending on your planned use.</li>
            <li>also used it to twist my daughters hair and it was light and took away frizzy magically.</li>
            <li>This would be great for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT FAST SERVICE</li>
            <li>All I will say is this, this is some real 100% coconut oil, it is not just good</li>
            <li>I love coconut oil and this is nothing less than the best product ever</li>
            <li>It is packaged nicely and seems very pure.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t easily melt in my hand</li>
            <li>Great for many uses, especially for hair and skin.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>yes I&#x27;m easily amused</li>
            <li>It melts easily, so I didn&#x27;t need to heat it up to apply it to my hair.</li>
            <li>Was not creamy enough..could not spread on my skin easily</li>
            <li>Takes off my eye makeup so easily.</li>
            <li>i thought that because it was 100% coconut oil it would smell strongly of coconut-there is no coconut smell at all</li>
            <li>The seller was kind enough to follow up on the order to make sure I was happy with everything, which I absolutely was.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>but otherwise for slight skin issues, it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li>so my sister and I could make hairs masks which it works fine for.  </li>
            <li>This is an odorless, quickly absorbed, all-purpose moisturizer that is wonderful for dry skin, as a moisture pack for hair or as a non-irritating eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>This is a good size for someone like me who wants to just try it out first!</li>
            <li>My skin seems to really enjoy this coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Melts and is smooth.</li>
            <li>and I are silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my skin mixed with some lotion and it feels great  </li>
            <li>however I noticed my batch to have a smell to it that I didn&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li>I also use it in my hair, it makes it so smooth.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy the smell of coconut</li>
            <li>Its a nice and economic coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Coconut has a light  smell to it.</li>
            <li>I put it on in the morning and my skin stays so smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>It makes a fantastic moisturizers and gives smoothness and body to a homemade deodorant.</li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>great deal on this totally unscented coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;feels</li>
            <li>So far ... so good.</li>
            <li>Good for natural hair.</li>
            <li>far as in my hair, I haven&#x27;t found yet a good amount.</li>
            <li>Cococare Coconut Oil is a really good product for hair that is relaxed or natural.</li>
            <li>, I use it as a top coat over my face cream and it keeps my skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Words of wisdom to all you young ladies who want good skin in the long run: ALWAYS wear a good sunblock when you go outdoors, wash your makeup off before you sleep, and find and use a good moisturizer every day.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the right thing for my skin but in the two weeks</li>
            <li>I will be buying more as it arrived very quickly and it is very clean and fresh, not stale as others have said.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful product.</li>
            <li>smooth rich coconut oil thank you.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite oil!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;m new to using coconut oil, I&#x27;m not too experienced or familiar with it, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s really legit or not.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT; )</li>
            <li>I originally bought this oil for my hair</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural.:)</li>
            <li>has been a great help with my dry feet.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot nice and light not heavy on the skin or hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It is also great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Just coat your hair with it, leave it on for at least an hour (and don&#x27;t forget to put a plastic bag on/or apply heat on it so the hair cuticle absorbs it better) and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in a large container when y ou have another sale.</li>
            <li>Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money!</li>
            <li>So far is feels nice</li>
            <li>Its a good size , especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The oil is as described but the containers did not &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; to be as full as they should have been.</li>
            <li>And this is a good price because I&#x27;ve seen this same one in a store</li>
            <li>I have been searching for different oils to put in my hair, and I read that Coconut oil would be a good oil to try.</li>
            <li>my hair shines more and texture&#x27;s much softer.</li>
            <li>just a warning though to keep it in a mildy cool place because if it goes under 76 degrees F it WILL melt.</li>
            <li>I think its cool</li>
            <li>Kinda cool</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon had it and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Have not used the emu oil yet,the coconut oil is not bad</li>
            <li>Makes a really good body softener, among so many other uses!</li>
            <li>I like it on my face and is absorbed pretty quickly though I believe the coconut oil with the fragrance seems to work better.  </li>
            <li>It does melt quickly however.</li>
            <li>Quick Ship, Just  as described</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>Received the product quickly.  </li>
            <li>Starts out oily but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this oil at an acceptable price too, I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I started out using the liquidized form of this product, but the more solid oil is to my liking much more.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly</li>
            <li>Maybe it had settled more than normal???</li>
            <li>so far so good, working well as moisturizer daily, glad i trusted the reviews.</li>
            <li>It came quick and exactly as described!</li>
            <li>This is good coconut oil, and it does really help with your hair and skin, but it is more processed than other oils.  </li>
            <li>&quot; This oil seems pretty good for hair (though I only did 1 treatment).</li>
            <li>but I like it good for dry hair or skin but</li>
            <li>so good for your dry hands</li>
            <li>I first got it at my salon for twice the price!</li>
            <li>exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, makes my hair very soft and also looks nice on my beard.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  love the product,  has certainly helped my face dryness go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I reluctantly bought this coconut oil because it&#x27;s really inexpensive, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was 100% pure even though the jar says so.</li>
            <li>The packaging is also nice, a cute little container, and it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>In the warm weather, the product would liquify, and the jar would leak, getting oil all over the bag i had it stored in, AND the ziplock I put it in later on.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>The shipment came on time as expected and the product was good</li>
            <li>It is liquid in warm temperatures and solid in cooler temperatures.  </li>
            <li>I like this one so far :)</li>
            <li>So far I have ordered five jars, so it seems I am satisfied with the item.</li>
            <li>I am currently all natural and it is still giving me great results.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and exactly as described - 100% coconut oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but it does not have the aroma of other coconut oils I have used.</li>
            <li>Highly processed, it is not white like good coconut oil is nor does it smell like coconut.</li>
            <li>I used it on my hair; but don&#x27;t have feedback right now.</li>
            <li>just the right consistency.  </li>
            <li>it is not greasey at  all on your skin it soaks right in .</li>
            <li>My hair soaks this right up</li>
            <li>Came right on time.</li>
            <li>that I have had it, I started using it and it cleared my acne prone skin right up.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed in the skin pretty well.  </li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT GOOD FOR DARK CIRCLE AROUND EYES</li>
            <li>I take nice quarter/half palm size and rub between hands then distribute through damp hair (my hair is long),</li>
            <li>It seems to cost more than lotion but considering how you don&#x27;t need much of it, even if you wipe off the excess, you really don&#x27;t use that much.</li>
            <li>So far, no bad reactions!</li>
            <li>It is light, moisturizes very well, and lasts a while on my very thirsty scalp.</li>
            <li>Great consistency, solid above 75 degrees, liquid below.</li>
            <li>Pure coconut oil has a light, natural fragrance that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great, nice and easy, cheap, lasts next to forever, no scary or unpleasant chemicals or smells.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>, I guess; I use this along with shea butter to seal my natural hair and along with my Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie for my twist outs, and it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>Never used before, luv it, really help my alligator skin!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and this is the first brand I tried.</li>
            <li>Yes, you do have to be careful if the temperature is warm, because it will turn into a liquid.</li>
            <li>I also use more during the weekend for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>i have a different coconut oil that seems more....</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product if you want extra virgin coconut oil because this is more like a hair grease to me.</li>
            <li>So this is not the real deal people!</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering coconut oil</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s hot out, it turns to oil.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is so universal, and I love it.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit nervous because of the price.  </li>
            <li>I also love how it is solid form but turns into oil when you mix it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to order more next time.</li>
            <li>and evidently I didn&#x27;t know what to look for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were hoping for.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it keep my hair in place, but when I washed it out, my hair was more lustrous and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many creams and even medical creams to no avail.</li>
            <li>This is my first brand trying coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil on my skin, and everyone remarked on how smooth and soft my skin looked.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>I use it 2 times a month and my hair thanks me!</li>
            <li>I love how it stays a solid form until you spread it in your hand.  </li>
            <li>As a first time user of coconut oil I am learning how to use it.</li>
            <li>I like more of a solid state to use as a makeup removal.</li>
            <li>This small jar is perfect for using on a daily basis when applying to hair and skin.</li>
            <li>At most room temps, it is solid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It went pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rub the coconut oil on my feet because my puppy licks my feet and commercial body lotions would not be safe for him.</li>
            <li>I definitely will be ordering  more.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product was hesitant to use it at first b/c</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely by coconut oil from Costco from now one.  </li>
            <li>High quality product, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought it to use on my dry hair, skin, and toe nails/cuticles and so far it seems to be a good product</li>
            <li>Product is very temperature sensitive as stated and liquefied at about 75 degrees which is fine if you want to transfer into a bottle for easier use.</li>
            <li>As I continue to use it, I&#x27;ll add more detailed info in a few months.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll go back to the Dabur Vatika or try one from Whole Foods because I&#x27;m not too sure if this one is pure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>both are super soft now!</li>
            <li>Being scentless might be a positive to some people.</li>
            <li>I first put it on my hands and gently rubbed through my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, all year long.</li>
            <li>That being said, still great for your skin, I also use in my hair with barely a touch of it warmed up in my hands when my hair needs a little control.  </li>
            <li>i LOVE that you can take a small solid piece out, rub between your hands and it melts right there and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy open container,</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, but I do kinda wish it would stay solid.  </li>
            <li>I do love using it for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Been using it for more than 4 months and my skin is no longer dry.</li>
            <li>I slather it on my face at night and wake to super soft skin.</li>
            <li>I heard pure coconut oil is a healthier way to remove makeup</li>
            <li>100% pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Beautician suggest pure coconut oil not the petroleum based stuff,</li>
            <li>pure</li>
            <li>I use a large jar in the kitchen for toasts and cooking.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t dry or rough as is, but it made it amazingly supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that this particular item is NOT to be eaten.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what the description says it is, I highly recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to make lipstick with the oil.</li>
            <li>plus it didn&#x27;t really work well as a diaper cream (the reason we bought it)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay to use as a moisturizer but not really for your face or hair.</li>
            <li>This coconut oil brought my hair back from completely free</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It really does condition your cuticles.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand and use it for my skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really figured out what to use this on.</li>
            <li>And the seal was not broken.</li>
            <li>She uses it after the sauna and states it really helps her skin.  </li>
            <li>Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li>if you travel with this stuff --- it can migrate out of a very well sealed bottle.  </li>
            <li>It seems that I&#x27;m going to have to pay up to get the real deal.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this item very helpful for my hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this coconut if you are looking for the REAL deal.</li>
            <li>Leaky, very leaky.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I got this to try on my face as a moisturizer and it has really improved on my complexion.  </li>
            <li>That added to much.</li>
            <li>I always put too much in my hair and it gets too oily.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product, but will buy virgin coconut oil in the future.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well in my hair and on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Cant really notice a difference, both times I&#x27;ve used on my hair.</li>
            <li>The oil then will melt in your hand once your ready to use it.</li>
            <li>SO much cheaper than buying it at a grocery store</li>
            <li>It worked really well for the cream</li>
            <li>You should try this product because its really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my hands when they are chapped, I put it on my legs to help get rid of the stretch marks and it does work</li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my hands and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with my order.</li>
            <li>I will continue to order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the coconut oil on my very dry lips and it is helping! :)</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft!!!</li>
            <li>the only thing is if it&#x27;s warm outside the butter melts, other than that i love the product and will&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply out of the jar without making a mess.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same creamy richness as other coconut oils I have used, but it still does a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Most recently I started using this as my night cream because I get super dry patches during the winter.</li>
            <li>I put it in my daughters hair &amp; we can tell a difference very soft &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li>Pretty soon it will be sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>It does melt and work like coconut oil should for the most part, but it has a slight rubbing alcohol scent to it that really bothers me, plus the color seems a bit off.</li>
            <li>Cococare Coconut Oil helps remove dry, flaky skin and eventually leaves you with better hydrated, soft skin with a silky sheen.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it is a naturally method of dealing with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Coconut oil is solid when cool, melts at body temperature and does not leave skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Some kind of small spatula would be helpful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value, and feels just like other more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>It really helps to soothe and smooth my rough and chapped hands.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this every few days until my ends feel like the top of my hair, and it&#x27;s almost there now thanks to this coconut oil.</li>
            <li>The main thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell, some people said it is odorless</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it&#x27;s super oily</li>
            <li>This particular oil has no scent.  </li>
            <li>It has done a great job healing and then preventing the cracked and rough hands from this harsh winter.</li>
            <li>In particular, I used it as part of a deodorant mix.</li>
            <li>I am currently enjoying this item, however it arrived solid (white) form, and now is an oil.</li>
            <li>It melts at about body temperature which makes it great for mixing with other products to make a hair mask (I like to throw in a little honey and a couple drops of olive oil).</li>
            <li>High quality and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Do highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product &amp; seller.</li>
            <li>Once it hits the heat of your skin, it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; to a slick oil that smooths onto your skin very easily.</li>
            <li>and I had to transfer it to other containers which wasn&#x27;t easy becoz of its shape ( in liquid form)</li>
            <li>If you find it is too solid to be able to apply, simply leave the jar out in warm temperature for a little while and it will melt enough for you apply.  </li>
            <li>when I ran out of this (because the Viva was cheaper at the time) &amp; discovered that is not a common thing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few weeks, and I love it!I</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d try this brand because both brands that I normally use (Viva and Spectrum)</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>It has no odor and is solid at certain temperatures and liquid at certain temperatures, just like it should be.</li>
            <li>Other than that small thing, the stuff is great.</li>
            <li>, easy liquifies--- be REAL CAREFUL</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting more amazing results, as my hair is badly damaged from perms, but I will&lt;br /&gt;continue</li>
            <li>My hair is SO very soft now.</li>
            <li>It has a very soft, practically unnoticeable scent of coconut.  </li>
            <li>The product description matched the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>my mother used coconut oil on her skin to avoid stretch marks when she was pregnant with me and never got a single one, so now I&#x27;m doing the same thing with my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy but your hands definitely feel coated at first and slippery</li>
            <li>The first time, I paid $10 for a smaller jar then this size but the oil melted in my hand.</li>
            <li>They should be more specific on the website, because when I received the product it says for external use only.</li>
            <li>Completely scentless and makes my skin feel silky!</li>
            <li>It melts then and stays fresh for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only bought coconut oil twice - first Dabur Vatika</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s making fine lines less noticeable as well.</li>
            <li>It has a faint, mild smell that is light and flat which is fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Since i cloth diaper its hard to find creams that are cloth diaper safe.</li>
            <li>EDIT - I originally rated low because the coconut oil felt dry on my skin</li>
            <li>I have dyshidrosis on my hands and feet and after about two weeks of using this, my hands began to clear up</li>
            <li>My friend gave me some of her coconut oil when my baby had a diaper rash to help clear it up.  </li>
            <li>I sew professionally, have lots of animals and I garden.</li>
            <li>It makes it soft and tames out the dryness and does not make it greasy.</li>
            <li>IT DOES WONDERS FOR MY NATURAL</li>
            <li>..KEEPS HER SOFT AND MANAGEABLE..</li>
            <li>makes hair soft and shiny.....</li>
            <li>I use unrefined coconut oil for my hair and it helps keep it soft.</li>
            <li>but like it so far and would consider buying it again.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, leave skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>The skin is soft, and not greasy.</li>
            <li>so far this product (coconut oil) has met or exceded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face as well, and my skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li>I use it on my sensitive skin and face.</li>
            <li>so far i have used it on my hair and hands.</li>
            <li>So far... I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair and skin REALLY soft.</li>
            <li>but it leaves it soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>It was very shiny the next day though.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin/hair soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural and it leaves skin feeling so moisturized, but not the greasy feeling you would imagine from an oil.  </li>
            <li>Takes off makeup like a charm  and after washing face, eye area is soft not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>For those of you who like to use natural instead of stuff with chemicals.</li>
            <li>This has completely cleared up all the issues.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone, oily skin</li>
            <li>I use it on my skin, not heavy or greasy at  all.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my seven year old son&#x27;s face in the winter months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find good coconut oil.</li>
            <li>It really helps to moisturize but it is not to heavy like many other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>No putting the oil in the night before to condition - now I can apply it to my hair (I apply it to the comb first, then comb through) when it&#x27;s dry, clean, and styled, and it smooths it out without weighing it down!  </li>
            <li>I have well past my waist dreads or locks if you will and this is just fine for my hair,</li>
            <li>At first the oil was liquid, but depending on the weather and temperature it&#x27;ll either remain liquid or turn white (into a solid).  </li>
            <li>I bought it with HIGH HOPES that it will help my hair grow back.  </li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for Cococare 100% coconut oil</li>
            <li>This is def worth the money if you have dry hair, skin, or yellow teeth.  </li>
            <li>They say this stuff can be taken internally for all kinds of benefits, but I use it for my skin, which suffers greatly int he</li>
            <li>A small package goes a long way :)</li>
            <li>I have used coconut oil many times in the past, tried different brands, and this one exceeds them all at a low price!  </li>
            <li>Large amount so will last a long time.</li>
            <li>As a fluke, i tried it on my arms where i have kerosis plaris and have tried different lotions all summer to clear it up and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for natural hair sisters if you have not had any luck with olive oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d from bleaching, to almost soft, and that&#x27;s only with 3 uses.</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and it&#x27;s already starting to look healthier.</li>
            <li>I can see this jar lasting a year or more!&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil is a natural way to combat and prevent diaper rashes.</li>
            <li>have no complaints so far, but I will come back and change my review if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only did it work on that but made  my hands really soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this as a moisturizer after washing my face and it leaves it so soft and smooth--my skin looks younger!</li>
            <li>I try to go as natural as possible</li>
            <li>Simply and naturally.</li>
            <li>Just know that it comes in a completely melted form, not solid looking like the picture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d prefer my coconut oil to be all natural, especially if it says it is on the jar.</li>
            <li>(the other oils seem to leave my scalp very itchy/irritated).</li>
            <li>There are a million uses for coconut oil and, thus far, I&#x27;m only up to ten.</li>
            <li>I am a natural African American with</li>
            <li>The container is good when its solid but bad when its liquid</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> and she really liked it.</li>
            <li> KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK: ) ..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I have been bleaching my hair for a couple months &amp; heard it was good for restoring/protecting softness.</li>
            <li> I am a NPC Figure Competitor and I purchased this to make my own body scrub before I get my body spray tan before any shows.  </li>
            <li> Use it to  make my own pomade.</li>
            <li> Loving this oil.</li>
            <li> Received product and looking forward to using so I can make my own sunblock.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> The oil maybe in a liquefied form if it arrives in warm weather, but it solidifies under 70 degrees in my house.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any type of smell to me, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I order this connect oil to use on my hair, it does liquify upon touch but doesn&#x27;t have that nice coconut smell</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but a better deal if you buy the mayonnaise jar size at the grocery or health food store.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using coconut oil - and I&#x27;m more than impressed.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to work with and added a nice scent.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and I was happy with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> i love it will buy more after i run out thank you!</li>
            <li> I like this coconut oil, very good quality and the prize is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This oil has turned out to be awesome for moisturizing my natural hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Love the way it melts and works in so nicely.</li>
            <li> Great quality and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Would have liked this better if it was edible.  </li>
            <li> :) This product is nice for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> This a great product that made my hair super manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is great for cuticles and much more.</li>
            <li> It melts easily , which works well with me!</li>
            <li> I bought this brand because it was the cheapest and even though it works great, just be aware that it is odorless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality oil with a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the coconut smell, more of a chemical smell which throws me off.  </li>
            <li> Love this product--- you can use it everywhere.</li>
            <li> Yes, love coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t apply it to the top of my hair or bangs because it just makes them oily, but on the ends of my hair</li>
            <li> so it helps keeps those parts healthy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and it is cheap!</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil for many things now.  </li>
            <li> but I love the price.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on the driest parts of my body, like elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> Lovely product.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NOTHING ON THE TOP OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE</li>
            <li> AND THE SELLER DOES IT INTENTIONALLY, SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD BUY IT BY MISTAKE.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal, works great in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it in my hair after every shower.</li>
            <li> It is cloth diaper safe (no build up, repelling or stinkies) and it prevents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and not greasy, but moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> This works better on my hair than my hair lotions and anti-frizz hair sprays, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Although I love the smell, sometimes I&#x27;m ok with not smelling a coconut cream pie under my nose:)</li>
            <li> and I am going to order more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased coconut oil before, but i love putting this in my hair.  </li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love using on feet and hands, even highlighting cheekbones over blush.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it is working.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> It has worked for me and I am sure it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil and use it both for cooking and hair/skin care.</li>
            <li> like eit and will probably order more</li>
            <li> better the baby oil, it has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting more, and it keeps my skin morse all day.</li>
            <li> Most products leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a liquid forum with the top off in the box from transport.</li>
            <li> But i love it</li>
            <li> but will do some more research so that I get what I&#x27;m looking for before ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Love for making homemade stuff.</li>
            <li> and I find it&#x27;s much better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried through the years.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and shinier, more manageable.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> It is not horrible by any means, and I will use it til it gone, but will not be  buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my skin more than in my hair, but I plan on using it in combination with castor oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> so make sure you put it on before you go to bed and let it soak over night.</li>
            <li> I washed it out three times with Prell, didn&#x27;t use a conditioner after, and my hair was the softest, shiniest and most well behaved I&#x27;ve seen it in two decades.  </li>
            <li> I may get one for my sisters:)</li>
            <li> An olive oil treatment works much better.</li>
            <li> It is much better than any hair oil I have ever used before.  </li>
            <li> Still love it though</li>
            <li> It absorbs well into my skin, and I can use it on my comb to smooth out my hair WITHOUT it looking greasy!  </li>
            <li> Okay product does what it says it will do, but congealed once opened.</li>
            <li> The container could have been a squirt bottle for better access.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this coconut oil</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This oil is okay.</li>
            <li> It can even be used on sore/tender nipples while breastfeeding and is safe for you and baby.  </li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER looked better.</li>
            <li> Most oils bother me and leave a glossy film.</li>
            <li> My feet and nails LOVE</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a transition into a more natural/organic lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency, texture, and scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your hair feel very moisturized.</li>
            <li> dog and my cat love this stuff after rubbing it on my hands, my cat jumped up in my lap and started to lick it off.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you are not allergic to coconuts.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is 100%</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more at another time.</li>

            <li> A great price, delivered fast.</li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> if but it again for sure</li>
            <li> but I use it mostly for my skin now.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I thought it might have more of a petroleum jelly consistency.  </li>
            <li> I just love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better deal.</li>

            <li> so I was very excited about this oil, recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> Great natural makeup remover!!</li>
            <li> It works perfect and leaves your body super soft.</li>
            <li> Still watching for better personal results because if the benefits can be produced this is a good value and good to have around.</li>
            <li> So as long as you don&#x27;t mind the lack of scent, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Firstly it arrived in time and we&#x27;ll sealed and good condition.</li>
            <li> love the oil and the ordering and shipping was easy, will recommend</li>
            <li> It is also a good conditioner to put in after you was your hair it makes it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> good moisturizer, does liquify at a certain temperature depending on your planned use.</li>
            <li> also used it to twist my daughters hair and it was light and took away frizzy magically.</li>
            <li> This would be great for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT FAST SERVICE</li>
            <li> All I will say is this, this is some real 100% coconut oil, it is not just good</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil and this is nothing less than the best product ever</li>
            <li> It is packaged nicely and seems very pure.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t easily melt in my hand</li>
            <li> Great for many uses, especially for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> yes I&#x27;m easily amused</li>
            <li> It melts easily, so I didn&#x27;t need to heat it up to apply it to my hair.</li>
            <li> Was not creamy enough..could not spread on my skin easily</li>
            <li> Takes off my eye makeup so easily.</li>
            <li> i thought that because it was 100% coconut oil it would smell strongly of coconut-there is no coconut smell at all</li>
            <li> The seller was kind enough to follow up on the order to make sure I was happy with everything, which I absolutely was.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> but otherwise for slight skin issues, it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li> so my sister and I could make hairs masks which it works fine for.  </li>
            <li> This is an odorless, quickly absorbed, all-purpose moisturizer that is wonderful for dry skin, as a moisture pack for hair or as a non-irritating eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This is a good size for someone like me who wants to just try it out first!</li>
            <li> My skin seems to really enjoy this coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Melts and is smooth.</li>
            <li> and I are silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my skin mixed with some lotion and it feels great  </li>
            <li> however I noticed my batch to have a smell to it that I didn&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li> I also use it in my hair, it makes it so smooth.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy the smell of coconut</li>
            <li> Its a nice and economic coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Coconut has a light  smell to it.</li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning and my skin stays so smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> It makes a fantastic moisturizers and gives smoothness and body to a homemade deodorant.</li>
            <li> Fantastic</li>
            <li> great deal on this totally unscented coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;feels</li>
            <li> So far ... so good.</li>
            <li> Good for natural hair.</li>
            <li> far as in my hair, I haven&#x27;t found yet a good amount.</li>
            <li> Cococare Coconut Oil is a really good product for hair that is relaxed or natural.</li>
            <li> , I use it as a top coat over my face cream and it keeps my skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Words of wisdom to all you young ladies who want good skin in the long run: ALWAYS wear a good sunblock when you go outdoors, wash your makeup off before you sleep, and find and use a good moisturizer every day.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the right thing for my skin but in the two weeks</li>
            <li> I will be buying more as it arrived very quickly and it is very clean and fresh, not stale as others have said.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!!!</li>
            <li> Very useful product.</li>
            <li> smooth rich coconut oil thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite oil!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;m new to using coconut oil, I&#x27;m not too experienced or familiar with it, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s really legit or not.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT; )</li>
            <li> I originally bought this oil for my hair</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.:)</li>
            <li> has been a great help with my dry feet.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot nice and light not heavy on the skin or hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It is also great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Just coat your hair with it, leave it on for at least an hour (and don&#x27;t forget to put a plastic bag on/or apply heat on it so the hair cuticle absorbs it better) and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in a large container when y ou have another sale.</li>
            <li> Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money!</li>
            <li> So far is feels nice</li>
            <li> Its a good size , especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The oil is as described but the containers did not &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; to be as full as they should have been.</li>
            <li> And this is a good price because I&#x27;ve seen this same one in a store</li>
            <li> I have been searching for different oils to put in my hair, and I read that Coconut oil would be a good oil to try.</li>
            <li> my hair shines more and texture&#x27;s much softer.</li>
            <li> just a warning though to keep it in a mildy cool place because if it goes under 76 degrees F it WILL melt.</li>
            <li> I think its cool</li>
            <li> Kinda cool</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon had it and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Have not used the emu oil yet,the coconut oil is not bad</li>
            <li> Makes a really good body softener, among so many other uses!</li>
            <li> I like it on my face and is absorbed pretty quickly though I believe the coconut oil with the fragrance seems to work better.  </li>
            <li> It does melt quickly however.</li>
            <li> Quick Ship, Just  as described</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> Received the product quickly.  </li>
            <li> Starts out oily but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this oil at an acceptable price too, I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I started out using the liquidized form of this product, but the more solid oil is to my liking much more.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly</li>
            <li> Maybe it had settled more than normal???</li>
            <li> so far so good, working well as moisturizer daily, glad i trusted the reviews.</li>
            <li> It came quick and exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This is good coconut oil, and it does really help with your hair and skin, but it is more processed than other oils.  </li>
            <li> &quot; This oil seems pretty good for hair (though I only did 1 treatment).</li>
            <li> but I like it good for dry hair or skin but</li>
            <li> so good for your dry hands</li>
            <li> I first got it at my salon for twice the price!</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, makes my hair very soft and also looks nice on my beard.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  love the product,  has certainly helped my face dryness go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I reluctantly bought this coconut oil because it&#x27;s really inexpensive, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was 100% pure even though the jar says so.</li>
            <li> The packaging is also nice, a cute little container, and it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> In the warm weather, the product would liquify, and the jar would leak, getting oil all over the bag i had it stored in, AND the ziplock I put it in later on.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> The shipment came on time as expected and the product was good</li>
            <li> It is liquid in warm temperatures and solid in cooler temperatures.  </li>
            <li> I like this one so far :)</li>
            <li> So far I have ordered five jars, so it seems I am satisfied with the item.</li>
            <li> I am currently all natural and it is still giving me great results.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and exactly as described - 100% coconut oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but it does not have the aroma of other coconut oils I have used.</li>
            <li> Highly processed, it is not white like good coconut oil is nor does it smell like coconut.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair; but don&#x27;t have feedback right now.</li>
            <li> just the right consistency.  </li>
            <li> it is not greasey at  all on your skin it soaks right in .</li>
            <li> My hair soaks this right up</li>
            <li> Came right on time.</li>
            <li> that I have had it, I started using it and it cleared my acne prone skin right up.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed in the skin pretty well.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT GOOD FOR DARK CIRCLE AROUND EYES</li>
            <li> I take nice quarter/half palm size and rub between hands then distribute through damp hair (my hair is long),</li>
            <li> It seems to cost more than lotion but considering how you don&#x27;t need much of it, even if you wipe off the excess, you really don&#x27;t use that much.</li>
            <li> So far, no bad reactions!</li>
            <li> It is light, moisturizes very well, and lasts a while on my very thirsty scalp.</li>
            <li> Great consistency, solid above 75 degrees, liquid below.</li>
            <li> Pure coconut oil has a light, natural fragrance that fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great, nice and easy, cheap, lasts next to forever, no scary or unpleasant chemicals or smells.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> , I guess; I use this along with shea butter to seal my natural hair and along with my Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie for my twist outs, and it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> Never used before, luv it, really help my alligator skin!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and this is the first brand I tried.</li>
            <li> Yes, you do have to be careful if the temperature is warm, because it will turn into a liquid.</li>
            <li> I also use more during the weekend for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> i have a different coconut oil that seems more....</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product if you want extra virgin coconut oil because this is more like a hair grease to me.</li>
            <li> So this is not the real deal people!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering coconut oil</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s hot out, it turns to oil.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is so universal, and I love it.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit nervous because of the price.  </li>
            <li> I also love how it is solid form but turns into oil when you mix it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to order more next time.</li>
            <li> and evidently I didn&#x27;t know what to look for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were hoping for.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it keep my hair in place, but when I washed it out, my hair was more lustrous and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many creams and even medical creams to no avail.</li>
            <li> This is my first brand trying coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil on my skin, and everyone remarked on how smooth and soft my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I use it 2 times a month and my hair thanks me!</li>
            <li> I love how it stays a solid form until you spread it in your hand.  </li>
            <li> As a first time user of coconut oil I am learning how to use it.</li>
            <li> I like more of a solid state to use as a makeup removal.</li>
            <li> This small jar is perfect for using on a daily basis when applying to hair and skin.</li>
            <li> At most room temps, it is solid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It went pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rub the coconut oil on my feet because my puppy licks my feet and commercial body lotions would not be safe for him.</li>
            <li> I definitely will be ordering  more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product was hesitant to use it at first b/c</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely by coconut oil from Costco from now one.  </li>
            <li> High quality product, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use on my dry hair, skin, and toe nails/cuticles and so far it seems to be a good product</li>
            <li> Product is very temperature sensitive as stated and liquefied at about 75 degrees which is fine if you want to transfer into a bottle for easier use.</li>
            <li> As I continue to use it, I&#x27;ll add more detailed info in a few months.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go back to the Dabur Vatika or try one from Whole Foods because I&#x27;m not too sure if this one is pure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> both are super soft now!</li>
            <li> Being scentless might be a positive to some people.</li>
            <li> I first put it on my hands and gently rubbed through my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, all year long.</li>
            <li> That being said, still great for your skin, I also use in my hair with barely a touch of it warmed up in my hands when my hair needs a little control.  </li>
            <li> i LOVE that you can take a small solid piece out, rub between your hands and it melts right there and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy open container,</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, but I do kinda wish it would stay solid.  </li>
            <li> I do love using it for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Been using it for more than 4 months and my skin is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I slather it on my face at night and wake to super soft skin.</li>
            <li> I heard pure coconut oil is a healthier way to remove makeup</li>
            <li> 100% pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Beautician suggest pure coconut oil not the petroleum based stuff,</li>
            <li> pure</li>
            <li> I use a large jar in the kitchen for toasts and cooking.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t dry or rough as is, but it made it amazingly supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that this particular item is NOT to be eaten.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what the description says it is, I highly recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to make lipstick with the oil.</li>
            <li> plus it didn&#x27;t really work well as a diaper cream (the reason we bought it)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay to use as a moisturizer but not really for your face or hair.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil brought my hair back from completely free</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It really does condition your cuticles.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand and use it for my skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really figured out what to use this on.</li>
            <li> And the seal was not broken.</li>
            <li> She uses it after the sauna and states it really helps her skin.  </li>
            <li> Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li> if you travel with this stuff --- it can migrate out of a very well sealed bottle.  </li>
            <li> It seems that I&#x27;m going to have to pay up to get the real deal.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this item very helpful for my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this coconut if you are looking for the REAL deal.</li>
            <li> Leaky, very leaky.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I got this to try on my face as a moisturizer and it has really improved on my complexion.  </li>
            <li> That added to much.</li>
            <li> I always put too much in my hair and it gets too oily.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product, but will buy virgin coconut oil in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well in my hair and on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Cant really notice a difference, both times I&#x27;ve used on my hair.</li>
            <li> The oil then will melt in your hand once your ready to use it.</li>
            <li> SO much cheaper than buying it at a grocery store</li>
            <li> It worked really well for the cream</li>
            <li> You should try this product because its really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my hands when they are chapped, I put it on my legs to help get rid of the stretch marks and it does work</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my hands and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with my order.</li>
            <li> I will continue to order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the coconut oil on my very dry lips and it is helping! :)</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft!!!</li>
            <li> the only thing is if it&#x27;s warm outside the butter melts, other than that i love the product and will&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply out of the jar without making a mess.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same creamy richness as other coconut oils I have used, but it still does a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Most recently I started using this as my night cream because I get super dry patches during the winter.</li>
            <li> I put it in my daughters hair &amp; we can tell a difference very soft &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li> Pretty soon it will be sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> It does melt and work like coconut oil should for the most part, but it has a slight rubbing alcohol scent to it that really bothers me, plus the color seems a bit off.</li>
            <li> Cococare Coconut Oil helps remove dry, flaky skin and eventually leaves you with better hydrated, soft skin with a silky sheen.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it is a naturally method of dealing with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Coconut oil is solid when cool, melts at body temperature and does not leave skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Some kind of small spatula would be helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value, and feels just like other more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> It really helps to soothe and smooth my rough and chapped hands.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this every few days until my ends feel like the top of my hair, and it&#x27;s almost there now thanks to this coconut oil.</li>
            <li> The main thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell, some people said it is odorless</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s super oily</li>
            <li> This particular oil has no scent.  </li>
            <li> It has done a great job healing and then preventing the cracked and rough hands from this harsh winter.</li>
            <li> In particular, I used it as part of a deodorant mix.</li>
            <li> I am currently enjoying this item, however it arrived solid (white) form, and now is an oil.</li>
            <li> It melts at about body temperature which makes it great for mixing with other products to make a hair mask (I like to throw in a little honey and a couple drops of olive oil).</li>
            <li> High quality and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Do highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product &amp; seller.</li>
            <li> Once it hits the heat of your skin, it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; to a slick oil that smooths onto your skin very easily.</li>
            <li> and I had to transfer it to other containers which wasn&#x27;t easy becoz of its shape ( in liquid form)</li>
            <li> If you find it is too solid to be able to apply, simply leave the jar out in warm temperature for a little while and it will melt enough for you apply.  </li>
            <li> when I ran out of this (because the Viva was cheaper at the time) &amp; discovered that is not a common thing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks, and I love it!I</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try this brand because both brands that I normally use (Viva and Spectrum)</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> It has no odor and is solid at certain temperatures and liquid at certain temperatures, just like it should be.</li>
            <li> Other than that small thing, the stuff is great.</li>
            <li> , easy liquifies--- be REAL CAREFUL</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting more amazing results, as my hair is badly damaged from perms, but I will&lt;br /&gt;continue</li>
            <li> My hair is SO very soft now.</li>
            <li> It has a very soft, practically unnoticeable scent of coconut.  </li>
            <li> The product description matched the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> my mother used coconut oil on her skin to avoid stretch marks when she was pregnant with me and never got a single one, so now I&#x27;m doing the same thing with my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy but your hands definitely feel coated at first and slippery</li>
            <li> The first time, I paid $10 for a smaller jar then this size but the oil melted in my hand.</li>
            <li> They should be more specific on the website, because when I received the product it says for external use only.</li>
            <li> Completely scentless and makes my skin feel silky!</li>
            <li> It melts then and stays fresh for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought coconut oil twice - first Dabur Vatika</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making fine lines less noticeable as well.</li>
            <li> It has a faint, mild smell that is light and flat which is fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Since i cloth diaper its hard to find creams that are cloth diaper safe.</li>
            <li> EDIT - I originally rated low because the coconut oil felt dry on my skin</li>
            <li> I have dyshidrosis on my hands and feet and after about two weeks of using this, my hands began to clear up</li>
            <li> My friend gave me some of her coconut oil when my baby had a diaper rash to help clear it up.  </li>
            <li> I sew professionally, have lots of animals and I garden.</li>
            <li> It makes it soft and tames out the dryness and does not make it greasy.</li>
            <li> IT DOES WONDERS FOR MY NATURAL</li>
            <li> ..KEEPS HER SOFT AND MANAGEABLE..</li>
            <li> makes hair soft and shiny.....</li>
            <li> I use unrefined coconut oil for my hair and it helps keep it soft.</li>
            <li> but like it so far and would consider buying it again.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, leave skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> The skin is soft, and not greasy.</li>
            <li> so far this product (coconut oil) has met or exceded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face as well, and my skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> I use it on my sensitive skin and face.</li>
            <li> so far i have used it on my hair and hands.</li>
            <li> So far... I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair and skin REALLY soft.</li>
            <li> but it leaves it soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> It was very shiny the next day though.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin/hair soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% natural and it leaves skin feeling so moisturized, but not the greasy feeling you would imagine from an oil.  </li>
            <li> Takes off makeup like a charm  and after washing face, eye area is soft not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> For those of you who like to use natural instead of stuff with chemicals.</li>
            <li> This has completely cleared up all the issues.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone, oily skin</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin, not heavy or greasy at  all.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my seven year old son&#x27;s face in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find good coconut oil.</li>
            <li> It really helps to moisturize but it is not to heavy like many other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> No putting the oil in the night before to condition - now I can apply it to my hair (I apply it to the comb first, then comb through) when it&#x27;s dry, clean, and styled, and it smooths it out without weighing it down!  </li>
            <li> I have well past my waist dreads or locks if you will and this is just fine for my hair,</li>
            <li> At first the oil was liquid, but depending on the weather and temperature it&#x27;ll either remain liquid or turn white (into a solid).  </li>
            <li> I bought it with HIGH HOPES that it will help my hair grow back.  </li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for Cococare 100% coconut oil</li>
            <li> This is def worth the money if you have dry hair, skin, or yellow teeth.  </li>
            <li> They say this stuff can be taken internally for all kinds of benefits, but I use it for my skin, which suffers greatly int he</li>
            <li> A small package goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> I have used coconut oil many times in the past, tried different brands, and this one exceeds them all at a low price!  </li>
            <li> Large amount so will last a long time.</li>
            <li> As a fluke, i tried it on my arms where i have kerosis plaris and have tried different lotions all summer to clear it up and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for natural hair sisters if you have not had any luck with olive oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d from bleaching, to almost soft, and that&#x27;s only with 3 uses.</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft and it&#x27;s already starting to look healthier.</li>
            <li> I can see this jar lasting a year or more!&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil is a natural way to combat and prevent diaper rashes.</li>
            <li> have no complaints so far, but I will come back and change my review if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only did it work on that but made  my hands really soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this as a moisturizer after washing my face and it leaves it so soft and smooth--my skin looks younger!</li>
            <li> I try to go as natural as possible</li>
            <li> Simply and naturally.</li>
            <li> Just know that it comes in a completely melted form, not solid looking like the picture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer my coconut oil to be all natural, especially if it says it is on the jar.</li>
            <li> (the other oils seem to leave my scalp very itchy/irritated).</li>
            <li> There are a million uses for coconut oil and, thus far, I&#x27;m only up to ten.</li>
            <li> I am a natural African American with</li>
            <li> The container is good when its solid but bad when its liquid</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in my hair when its wet (too much will get really oily and weighed down) and my hair has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty small container, BUT it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> i kept mine in the fridge during the hot months but it got too hard</li>
            <li> Like I said, I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about coconut oil, so I am not sure if &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; coconut oil is supposed to have that scent or not, but this one did not.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s why I do it last, but it soaks in after not too long.</li>
            <li> Somehow, this was the only product that helped relieve the itching as my skin stretched during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> The 4 oz last a long time.</li>
            <li> Since I live in Phoenix Arizona, I have to keep in the fridge and take out a few minutes before I use.</li>
            <li> These small jars fit in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, I like the quality of the product, but the size is a little small.</li>
            <li> I do like that it is pure and not filled with a lot of other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes of oiliness, which I like because my skin is dry, and then all that&#x27;s left is soft skin.</li>
            <li> so I was a little disappointed by that, but the product works great.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so this product is not good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My hands are completely clear now, so long as I keep using this a few times a day.</li>
            <li> It lasts a lot longer than I expected, even after letting others use the oil countless times.</li>
            <li> Also has a strange smell to it, doesnt have that coconut smell.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I did not realize this would be plain old coconut oil, I should have just purchased  plain old coconut oil that is cooking grade in the Health Food Store.  </li>
            <li> I use this probably once a month in addition with other products similar.</li>
            <li> When I received it, the product had been shipped with the lid partially open, so coconut oil leaked all over the box and other items in the box.  </li>
            <li> This is a long story!</li>
            <li> but my hands get very rough, especially after digging in the dirt.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time on my skin as it is so flakey and dry.</li>
            <li> Using on my daughter for her dry skin</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin on my face</li>
            <li> Helps with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair had become dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I used it for dry, flaky skin and saw visible results immediately.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your sk8n</li>
            <li> My baby has eczema and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Used it after breastfeeding when I was still having cracking, use it on my babies dry skin, my dry skin, my hair, diaper rash, you name it.</li>
            <li> and I also use it for dry hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my hair dresser recommended Coconut oil for dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have excessively dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on hands and feet</li>
            <li> This is an extremely thin oil, very much like sesame oil.</li>
            <li> Sooooo effective for cold weather-cracked hands!</li>
            <li> love coconut oil, this wasnt very expensive.</li>
            <li> But the lid was loose.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to take my twists down later.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and even though I use it several times a day I still have plenty of it.</li>
            <li> - it is a solid in the container, but once you have it on your hand, it turns liquidy, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It also has very little coconut scent, so if you want something that is fairly neutral in smell, this wouldn&#x27;t be a bad choice.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin..period !</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like to have to write reviews about why I buy mundane, daily use items.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil for an elderly friend who had very dry skin that was quite irritated.</li>
            <li> I have very dry &amp; cracked hands in the winter.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dog who has very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin and have been getting scaly patches.</li>
            <li> I use this as a hair mask when my hair is feeling very dry and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little to cover his bum and cracks and crevices.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find pure coconut oil in my local stores.  </li>
            <li> I use this every other day in my hair &amp; have noticed that I no longer have dry flakes.  </li>
            <li> Got my package as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have to stay away from products with fragrances and had absolutely no problem with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this only a few times</li>
            <li> This is definitely not real coconut oil</li>
            <li> It will liquefy below 70 degrees so be careful.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy once it sinks into your skin.</li>
            <li> Just what we expected</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> It wasnt as mosturizing as i expected it to be either.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, so I have to be careful with what I use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even harder as the jar empties.</li>
            <li> but it makes me not really trust</li>
            <li> This wasnt what I expected out the oil.</li>
            <li> The oil is a bit harder than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I use it when I straighten my naturally curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> My skin is SO dry in the summer and just a little bit of coconut oil goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this coconut oil was not as white and fluffy looking as my other coconut oil ..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used it on my nails and cuticles to moisturize in the cold northern environment I live.  </li>
            <li> I have very short hair &amp; usually rub a thumb sized amount in before bed</li>
            <li> four or five bleach baths in the past several weeks</li>
            <li> , I USUALLY BUY BIG JARS OF COCONUT BUTTER , AT THIS TIME</li>
            <li> I received my jar, sealed and wrapped in plastic inside the box, but it had still leaked out the jar, seal and plastic all over the other items that were shipped with it.</li>
            <li> Use this in combo with other oils for my hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my scalp due to dryness.  </li>
            <li> to use it and any other product which can restore my hair to its gloriouss condition when I was</li>
            <li> I am putting it with my other oils.</li>
            <li> I mix other oils with the coconut</li>
            <li> I  have one recommendation, keep it well refridgerated or it will liquify on you, other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t get on the other items in the shipment, but when opening the bag the jar was oily all over.</li>
            <li> NOT REAL COCONUT OIL!</li>
            <li> but on the other hand, it won&#x27;t interfere with your preferred cologne or after shave.</li>
            <li> and she licked the other hand too.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> However the container was half empty.</li>
            <li> it kept leaking even when I closed it tight</li>
            <li> The oil that did not leak out, did not have the coconut smell that the other oil I had previously used had.  </li>
            <li> Product did come as a liquid and had a hard time getting solid by itself</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it has no scent of coconut whatsoever, and I find it somewhat greasy and not easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It has a slightly weird smell that I can&#x27;t really describe</li>
            <li> and I also use it on my dog.s nose as she tends to get a dried out and rough littlee nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times (medium length thick hair) and I still have 2/3 of it left.</li>
            <li> I use it in my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> In the jar, the coconut oil is white and thick.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it has not been irritating.</li>
            <li> But when it came to me, the bottom half of the cap had snapped off.</li>
            <li> Also, beware that this item cannot be returned, so if it spills everywhere, you end up with much less than the 4 oz.</li>
            <li> I put it in the refrigerator before opening so that it wouldn&#x27;t spill &amp; make a mess.</li>
            <li> so I keep it in the bag it came in to avoid making a mess on my stuff.</li>
            <li> I feel I spill it and doesn&#x27;t close tight for liquid</li>
            <li> with a little shea butter added this keeps my scalp and my dreads tight.</li>
            <li> My only issue with this product is getting it out of the jar usually results in coconut oil under at least one finger nail.</li>
            <li> do wish it had a little sent to it.</li>
            <li> I leave it on my changing table and just swipe on a little after cleaning him.</li>
            <li> Even refined coconut oil still has a little scent to it.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day and put a little of this in my hair and go.  </li>
            <li> I like to add a little Coconut Oil to the ends of my hair after.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase because of the word &#x27;oil&#x27; but it doesn&#x27;t leave your head or hair looking greasy and unwashed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very hard and you can really only rub the surface of it to get it on your fingers.  </li>
            <li> I use a little bit of it after washing my hair to moisturize my hair and scalp everyday.</li>
            <li> It can be a little messy.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using your oil, his skin started healing.</li>
            <li> Waste of two bucks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on the heels of my feet because they were dried &amp; cracked &amp; after a couple of hours I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> So it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff for my hair, and it lasted me a few months.</li>
            <li> so i just had to pop it in the microwave for a few mins.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I was a bit confused because I bought this to be used for cooking, but the jar says &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is neither too runny nor too heavy;</li>
            <li> but you got to apply it everyday for it to keep on working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have used it instead of hydrocortisone cream, which can be harsh on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I also use a thin layer on my lips and around my hair line as well as on my elbows and back of my hands.  </li>
            <li> THERE IS NO STRONG SMELL</li>
            <li> I have also now been using it by swishing a tablespoon in my mouth everyday and it has made a small difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I want to see how the coconut oil does which is why today I&#x27;m giving 3 stars and not more.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I would cook with this.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the food grade virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I NEEDED SMALL AMOUNT TO USE FOR MAKING CHOCOLATE, JUST TO SEE IF IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> any excess I usually put on my legs.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get pimples usually</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s 100%.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i will buy again????</li>
            <li> not sure if I like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this company is telling the truth, but I think I&#x27;ll just stick with Dabur Vatika coconut oil because I trust it.</li>
            <li> A small amount of this product works wonders.  </li>
            <li> VERY VERY messy, it kept leaking over everything when it melted.</li>
            <li> For skin though, it seems to not absorb well, merely &#x27;coating&#x27; dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick for a hair gel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I mean, it works like it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> Ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> It comes as no surprise but coconut oil is seriously a miracle oil.</li>
            <li> Packaging was not good.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be semi-solid when at room temperature, but it seems I should have bought virgin coconut oil, cold pressed.</li>
            <li> My complaints about coconut oil in the past were:  overpowering coconut scent, too greasy, too runny, difficult to apply neatly, didn&#x27;t absorb well, etc.  </li>
            <li> THIS SUCKS!</li>
            <li> I am somewhat new to coconut oil, so I don&#x27;t know a ton about it, but I was very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the oil, but I truly do not understand why it is packaged in a jar instead of a bottle as it&#x27;s so thin</li>
            <li> Very small amount and the container is awkward and leaks when the oil is liquid.</li>
            <li> No longer do I use expensive moisturizer and primer for my face, I use this.  </li>
            <li> Expensive and the oil leaks from the bottom for some reason.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; thing got me and before I could cancel my order, it was already shipped.</li>
            <li> It is vey irritating !</li>
            <li> This is definitely fake.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a terrible mess to try to use the product.</li>
            <li> And when it&#x27;s cold, it becomes condensed.</li>
            <li> I have tried A&amp;D, Neosporin, rubbing alcohol, orajel for cold sores.</li>
            <li> My derm sells me this very expensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> so i was disappointed about that</li>
            <li> Depending on the temperature, it will melt into a oil, but I like that, and when it gets cold will solidify again!</li>
            <li> The product, I suppose, works as it should, but the packaging was simply awful.</li>
            <li> AND FEELS LIKE PLASTIC, TERRIBLE FOR YOUR HAIR AND SKIN!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!!!</li>

            <li> Got my package as expected.  It works great. It melts easily , which works well with me! (:</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil :)</li>
            <li> I like the size of the containers but not the product.  It doesn&#x27;t have the coconut smell, more of a chemical smell which throws me off.  I need to find organic coconut oil in a travel container this size.</li>
            <li> Great product.  High quality and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I work with my hands and they take a lot of abuse. I sew professionally, have lots of animals and I garden. I wear gloves whenever possible but my hands get very rough, especially after digging in the dirt. A friend happened to mention that she got coconut oil on Amazon and she really liked it. I do too! I try to remember to put it on every night before bed. It really helps to soothe and smooth my rough and chapped hands. It&#x27;s not greasy but your hands definitely feel coated at first and slippery, that&#x27;s why I do it last, but it soaks in after not too long. I also use it in my hair every now and again. It makes it soft and tames out the dryness and does not make it greasy. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product--- you can use it everywhere. My skin has never felt so soft!!!</li>
            <li> My skin seems to really enjoy this coconut oil. So far, no bad reactions! It is packaged nicely and seems very pure. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT; ) AND SO DOES MY HAIR..IT DOES WONDERS FOR MY NATURAL..KEEPS HER SOFT AND MANAGEABLE..KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK: ) ..THANKS</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin and hair have never looked and felt better! I have already recommended this product to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it had a little sent to it.</li>
            <li> As advertised - good packaging, quick delivery - good quality - thanks!</li>
            <li> Yes, love coconut oil.  I use it daily and I also use it on my dog.s nose as she tends to get a dried out and rough littlee nose.  Both of us are happy with th product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil for an elderly friend who had very dry skin that was quite irritated. Within a few days of using your oil, his skin started healing. Diffently a good product</li>
            <li> Never used before, luv it, really help my alligator skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It oils and moisturizers great! I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s a reasonable price as well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Use it all the time on my skin as it is so flakey and dry. My Dr. was amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> Great product and a lot for the price</li>
            <li> Its&#x27;s alright. I can&#x27;t apply it to the top of my hair or bangs because it just makes them oily, but on the ends of my hair it&#x27;s fine. The ends of my hair are bleached as well so it helps keeps those parts healthy. But when it came to me, the bottom half of the cap had snapped off. I can still close it, but it bugs me that some of it is gone.</li>
            <li> Love it. Getting ready to make lipstick with the oil.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I have been bleaching my hair for a couple months &amp; heard it was good for restoring/protecting softness. This stuff works like a dream. I have very short hair &amp; usually rub a thumb sized amount in before bed, I&#x27;ve been though four or five bleach baths in the past several weeks but my hair has never felt softer. It melts at about body temperature which makes it great for mixing with other products to make a hair mask (I like to throw in a little honey and a couple drops of olive oil). Also great for winter skin, going to recommend it to my boyfriend for this cracked knuckles.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Wanted to add, there is basically no smell from this product. I purchased [[ASIN:B00DS842HS Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce]] when I ran out of this (because the Viva was cheaper at the time) &amp; discovered that is not a common thing. Being scentless might be a positive to some people.</li>
            <li> I used to use regular cleaning pads to remove makeup. I heard pure coconut oil is a healthier way to remove makeup and this is the first brand I tried. There is a huge difference!! I love it and it is cheap!</li>
            <li> love the oil and the ordering and shipping was easy, will recommend</li>
            <li> makes hair soft and shiny.....without feeling greasy!!</li>
            <li> I used this in my lip balm and lotion bars.  It was very easy to work with and added a nice scent. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This product got me hooked.  I use coconut oil for many things now.  I love that it congeals and how rapidly it melts when in contact with skin!</li>
            <li> It is Not organic. Has no smell.</li>
            <li> For the price I could have bought something bigger. Otherwise, the product is good.</li>
            <li> Great product...fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this oil for about a week now. I bought it with HIGH HOPES that it will help my hair grow back.  So far is feels nice (the other oils seem to leave my scalp very itchy/irritated). I want to see how the coconut oil does which is why today I&#x27;m giving 3 stars and not more.  I will write another review in the future.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and exactly as described - 100% coconut oil</li>
            <li> Great product! I have very dry &amp; cracked hands in the winter. Have been applying nightly with a moisturizer &amp; wearing gloves. In just two days, the cracks are gone!</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing coconut oil. The first time, I paid $10 for a smaller jar then this size but the oil melted in my hand. This product doesn&#x27;t easily melt in my hand but I love the price. I paid around $2 for 4.0z and it is lasting a longer than my 10$ jar. I plan to make this a staple in my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would cook with this. I bought it for skin care.</li>
            <li> I use unrefined coconut oil for my hair and it helps keep it soft. I usually buy the food grade virgin coconut oil. I saw this at the beauty supply store and picked it up for its convenient size. It does melt and work like coconut oil should for the most part, but it has a slight rubbing alcohol scent to it that really bothers me, plus the color seems a bit off. I will stick with the food grade one instead.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use it on my face twice a day!</li>
            <li> 100% pure coconut oil. Perfect size, the way I wanted.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, I like the quality of the product, but the size is a little small.</li>
            <li> i would go with something els would never buy again if you want something good buy the coconut oil organic</li>
            <li> Good product. Great for hydration on both skin &amp; hair. A little goes a very long way. There is no scent, there are no added perfumes or unnatural dyes.  Shipping was prompt.  I will reorder &amp; recommend this product. I love that it is all natural.:)</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I use it on my hands, feet, and on healed scars from a recent surgery.  I have to stay away from products with fragrances and had absolutely no problem with this product.  Yes, you do have to be careful if the temperature is warm, because it will turn into a liquid. I will definitely buy this again, without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for Cococare 100% coconut oil and I&#x27;m so happy to have found it here on Amazon. This is an odorless, quickly absorbed, all-purpose moisturizer that is wonderful for dry skin, as a moisture pack for hair or as a non-irritating eye makeup remover. Coconut oil is solid when cool, melts at body temperature and does not leave skin feeling greasy. Pure coconut oil has a light, natural fragrance that fades quickly. My shipment arrived promptly and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> This oil has turned out to be awesome for moisturizing my natural hair and scalp. It is light, moisturizes very well, and lasts a while on my very thirsty scalp. I definitely recommend this for natural hair sisters if you have not had any luck with olive oil.</li>
            <li> Using on my daughter for her dry skin and it&#x27;s been 3 applications and it has gotten so much better! I can&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and although it&#x27;s oil, it&#x27;s not overly oilly.</li>
            <li> In the warm weather, the product would liquify, and the jar would leak, getting oil all over the bag i had it stored in, AND the ziplock I put it in later on. plus it didn&#x27;t really work well as a diaper cream (the reason we bought it)</li>
            <li> best skin and hair lotion ever.</li>
            <li> The oil is great! Came as a solid but soon after being at room temperature it melted. However the container was half empty. Boo!</li>
            <li> I am a NPC Figure Competitor and I purchased this to make my own body scrub before I get my body spray tan before any shows.  It works perfect and leaves your body super soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay to use as a moisturizer but not really for your face or hair. I use it mostly on the driest parts of my body, like elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> Lovely product. Smells delicious just like cocoa. Melts and is smooth. Would definitely buy this again.  Beats anything you could buy in the store.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. This coconut oil brought my hair back from completely free I&#x27;d from bleaching, to almost soft, and that&#x27;s only with 3 uses. I plan on using this every few days until my ends feel like the top of my hair, and it&#x27;s almost there now thanks to this coconut oil. Without it, I would have had to shave my head! The packaging is also nice, a cute little container, and it doesn&#x27;t leak. Its a good size , especially for the price. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times (medium length thick hair) and I still have 2/3 of it left. I&#x27;ll definitely being ordering again!</li>
            <li> good moisturizer, does liquify at a certain temperature depending on your planned use.</li>
            <li> Use it to  make my own pomade. Worked perfect. Wish it came in with twice the amount.</li>
            <li> I need a hair moisturizer for my curly hair. Beautician suggest pure coconut oil not the petroleum based stuff,</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT FAST SERVICE</li>
            <li> I have been using this only a few times but like it so far and would consider buying it again. Thanks</li>
            <li> ONE STAR ONLY FOR THE PRODUCT, WHICH I DID NOT INTEND TO BUY, I USUALLY BUY BIG JARS OF COCONUT BUTTER , AT THIS TIME I NEEDED SMALL AMOUNT TO USE FOR MAKING CHOCOLATE, JUST TO SEE IF IT WORKS. THERE IS NOTHING ON THE TOP OF THE DESCRIPTION PAGE TO INDICATE THAT ITS NOT THE FOOD, AND ITS  ONLY FOR EXTERNAL USE. AND THE SELLER DOES IT INTENTIONALLY, SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD BUY IT BY MISTAKE.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I first got it at my salon for twice the price! I use a little bit of it after washing my hair to moisturize my hair and scalp everyday. I also use more during the weekend for deep conditioning. You can also use it on your face and body.</li>
            <li> wife lives it quick service very pleased thx.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  Not greasy, leave skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find good coconut oil. This stuff is the real deal, works great in my hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is a must! It has many purposes to it, works good for skin, hair, and I experimented and made my own lipsticks! Do your own research to see all the wonderful things you can do with this product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product! The skin is soft, and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff mixed about 1:2 parts with beeswax to make a moustache styling wax for my handlebar. Works great, nice and easy, cheap, lasts next to forever, no scary or unpleasant chemicals or smells.</li>
            <li> Great for many uses, especially for hair and skin. Great consistency, solid above 75 degrees, liquid below. It lasts for a while and it is 100% coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not real coconut oil it doesn&#x27;t even have a smell. Its gets oily but just doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair</li>
            <li> I cannot stop putting it on me. I bought it for my dog who has very dry skin. But when I felt it on my hands I fell in love with it! Now Cassie (my pit bull) and I are silky smooth. Great as a moisturizer and shiner for my hair too.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it in my hair after every shower. My hair stays soft and it&#x27;s already starting to look healthier.</li>
            <li> Package was promptly received within the promised two day shipping. I am very satisfied with the coconut oil&#x27;s ability to bring the results I was hoping to achieve. Already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> It really does condition your cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks, and I love it!I am using it on my infants bum. I leave it on my changing table and just swipe on a little after cleaning him. It is solid at room temp in my house, but just running my fingertips over it melts it. It only takes a little to cover his bum and cracks and crevices. I can see this jar lasting a year or more!&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil is a natural way to combat and prevent diaper rashes. It has antifungal and antimicrobial properties. My son had rash from disposable diapers that cleared up after switching to cloth. After switching to to cloth diapers, I looked for an alternative to the well known diaper rash creams, as they are not cloth diaper friendly.&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect thing! It is cloth diaper safe (no build up, repelling or stinkies) and it prevents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints so far, but I will come back and change my review if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering a second jar to use on his body.</li>
            <li> Great product and lives up to all the claims</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands beard 3 days ago! Yes.. I ordered it 3 day&#x27;s ago &amp; got it in mail today! FAST SHIPPING!!! Took it out &amp; rubbed it in his beard and it is great! Pretty soon it will be sooooo soft! Love the way it melts and works in so nicely. Were in Washington state so it was solid when it arrived &amp; will stay that way in the house, so it is easier to get out what we need at a time. No bad odor &amp; very pleasant for me. Also going to use it on his nails to cure his nail fungus-amongus &amp; to soften his skin for his psoriasis. GREAT all the way around! I thank those who helped answer all my questions before buying!</li>
            <li> keeps my face looking moisturize...</li>
            <li> The oil is as described but the containers did not &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; to be as full as they should have been. Maybe it had settled more than normal???</li>
            <li> Bought this to try on my toddler son&#x27;s eczema. It does seem to help quite a bit. I will buy a big jug of it now.</li>
            <li> so far this product (coconut oil) has met or exceded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is just what is advertised. Great product for the price and not greasy, but moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> Smells good but didn&#x27;t realize you have to warm it for it to be liquid but it works well</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time, product was as advertised</li>
            <li> Awesome product, love it on my hair</li>
            <li> I just received this as it did arrive at a timely manner. I was told by the doctor to use it on my face for skin problems , I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Product did come as a liquid and had a hard time getting solid by itself so I put it in the fridge for abt 30 minutes now it is solid. It does melt quickly however. I&#x27;ve used it on my skin mixed with some lotion and it feels great  has been a great help with my dry feet. also used it to twist my daughters hair and it was light and took away frizzy magically. Def a great  buy will post another review in a weeks for any results.</li>
            <li> i have a different coconut oil that seems more.... pure i guess you could say ... this coconut oil was not as white and fluffy looking as my other coconut oil .. and it doesnt smell quite as good ! for use in your hair though, etc. i think it could get the job done</li>
            <li> I mistakenly left it out while on vacay and it spilled all over my comforter...but what I got to use has done wonders for my skin.  I used it on my hair; but don&#x27;t have feedback right now.</li>
            <li> It is 100% coconut oil, as described. Beware though, even though the container has a seal inside the cap it does not keep the oil in. I received my jar, sealed and wrapped in plastic inside the box, but it had still leaked out the jar, seal and plastic all over the other items that were shipped with it.</li>
            <li> I just needed something to keep my scalp moist.  This works.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product if you want extra virgin coconut oil because this is more like a hair grease to me. They should be more specific on the website, because when I received the product it says for external use only. So this is not the real deal people!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but it does not have the aroma of other coconut oils I have used.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of coconut oil.  I really like this brand and use it for my skin and hair.  Do highly recommend.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Meh\\&quot; This oil seems pretty good for hair (though I only did 1 treatment). For skin though, it seems to not absorb well, merely &#x27;coating&#x27; dry skin. I think for the future, I&#x27;ll stick to cocoa and shea butter....</li>
            <li> I had this product. It did nothing at all. Its serves no purpose. Waste of two bucks</li>
            <li> Easy open container, smooth rich coconut oil thank you.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the coconut oil a couple of weeks ago so it&#x27;s not like I have had enough time to use it and see the effects.  I bought it to use on my dry hair, skin, and toe nails/cuticles and so far it seems to be a good product so I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star rating.  The product came quickly and I was happy with the packaging.  It will liquefy below 70 degrees so be careful.  I always put the oil in my refrigerator over night so that it becomes solid again.  As I continue to use it, I&#x27;ll add more detailed info in a few months.</li>
            <li> the only thing is if it&#x27;s warm outside the butter melts, other than that i love the product and will&lt;br /&gt;consider buying from them again</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing I Used it for soothing my nipples from  breastfeeding,  it gives me instant relief also I used it for my hair and it was great,  the only problem is a the container I made a hole in the inside seal and it kept leaking even when I closed it tight and I had to transfer it to other containers which wasn&#x27;t easy becoz of its shape ( in liquid form)</li>
            <li> Use this in combo with other oils for my hair my hair loves coconut n the smell is amazing. A small package goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> I received the package on time. I put it in the refrigerator before opening so that it wouldn&#x27;t spill &amp; make a mess. I put it in my daughters hair &amp; we can tell a difference very soft &amp; pretty. I&#x27;ve used it on the heels of my feet because they were dried &amp; cracked &amp; after a couple of hours I could tell a difference.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very small amount and the container is awkward and leaks when the oil is liquid.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, makes my hair very soft and also looks nice on my beard. The main thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell, some people said it is odorless however I noticed my batch to have a smell to it that I didn&#x27;t enjoy. However that&#x27;s just me and you might love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that its a great deal and I would recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Cococare!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering coconut oil and I have to say that I am so happy I did!!  I have read so many reviews about how great this stuff is so I had to see for myself.  I have really dry skin on my face so I got this coconut oil to see if it would work...it does wonders!!!  It arrived 4 days after ordering it which is really impressive to me and it was packaged nicely.  Definitely will be ordering from this company again!</li>
            <li> This works better on my hair than my hair lotions and anti-frizz hair sprays, and is not greasy. And this is a good price because I&#x27;ve seen this same one in a store and it was almost $9</li>
            <li> As expected. It&#x27;s just oil. When it&#x27;s hot out, it turns to oil. And when it&#x27;s cold, it becomes condensed. I haven&#x27;t really figured out what to use this on. I bought it for my tattoo when I had a picnic reaction. But was told not to use it for that. So it was a waste of money. I used it on my nails I think once. I guess I was looking for a miracle of them looking nice and growing lol. Packaging was not good. Some how oil seeped out and got all over the package and cardboard. And the seal was not broken. But the lid was loose. It was quite the mystery lol.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cococare Cocoa Butter sticks for years and I absolutely love them! I have been searching for different oils to put in my hair, and I read that Coconut oil would be a good oil to try. I didn&#x27;t notice that the brand was Cococare until I received the oil in the mail. I am happy to have another Cococare product to add to the family. I will use this oil on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is so universal, and I love it. Great quality and well worth the price. I use it for many things, great for moisturizing hair, hands, feet, everything.</li>
            <li> the results for this product are excellent for my afro-ccentic texture.  i use it on the ends of my hair. my hair shines more and texture&#x27;s much softer.</li>
            <li> Used this product before was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry scalp. Just put on your head and let it sit for a couple hours. Makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Helps my wife&#x27;s skin condition. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> EDIT - I originally rated low because the coconut oil felt dry on my skin but I take it back. I started using the oil about a month ago on my eyebrows and lashes after seeing a Youtube video. I don&#x27;t know why we all overplucked in the 90&#x27;s but my brows seem to be growing back thicker where I apply the oil and my lashes are starting to look longer with no change in mascara. The instructions were to mix with castor oil.</li>
            <li> My spouse swears by it.  She uses it after the sauna and states it really helps her skin.  She hasn&#x27;t compared it to others yet.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil as a makeup remover and moisturizer. I like the fact that is brand doesn&#x27;t have a scent. Although I love the smell, sometimes I&#x27;m ok with not smelling a coconut cream pie under my nose:)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It smells good and I use it all the time!  No longer do I use expensive moisturizer and primer for my face, I use this.  It  makes for a great lotion replacement on legs and hands and I am going to order more.  If you&#x27;re looking to try this product (like I was) then give this one a try for $6.  That&#x27;s a bargain!</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the yellow tint threw me off. It is low grade and since I purchased it for my hair; I cannot use it. I will be heading to the grocery store for food grade.</li>
            <li> Awesome for skin, hair, scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased coconut oil before, but i love putting this in my hair.  I put a small amount in my hair when its wet (too much will get really oily and weighed down) and my hair has never been so soft. I tried putting all over my body but it made my skin break out. The product was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic! I have eczema, and it has helped immensely. It&#x27;s not greasy once it sinks into your skin. I use it on my face as well, and my skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the crack on the end of my nose. I do think it&#x27;s stress. I have tried A&amp;D, Neosporin, rubbing alcohol, orajel for cold sores. This is the best coconut oil I have had for my nose, skin, hair. It healed my nose! I would suggest this product to anyone that has like a paper cut on their nose. It&#x27;s great for your hands, hair, face, body. I did not like it for my feet. A&amp;D works best at the heals of my feet.</li>
            <li> Many uses!! I love using on feet and hands, even highlighting cheekbones over blush.</li>
            <li> I received it as promised and I love the way it is working.</li>
            <li> QUESTION&lt;br /&gt;IS THIS PRODUCT GOOD FOR DARK CIRCLE AROUND EYES</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s a pretty small container, BUT it does last a long time. I use this stuff for my hair, and it lasted me a few months.</li>
            <li> Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money! Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it to soothe radiation dermatitis burns, and it doesn&#x27;t ever sting or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this probably once a month in addition with other products similar. I take nice quarter/half palm size and rub between hands then distribute through damp hair (my hair is long), any excess I usually put on my legs. Leave in for about an hour and rinse hair. My hair is SO very soft now.</li>
            <li> Very nice for skin and hair</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just as described. I like that it has no scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my scalp due to dryness.  I applied this to my scalp and I will tell you it has eliminate the dryness.  I will continue to order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> so far so good, working well as moisturizer daily, glad i trusted the reviews.</li>
            <li> Excellent, delivery on time</li>
            <li> I love this.  At first I was a bit nervous because of the price.  However, the oil is awesome.  At first the oil was liquid, but depending on the weather and temperature it&#x27;ll either remain liquid or turn white (into a solid).  I use it on my face, hair, etc.</li>
            <li> I use it on my sensitive skin and face. I also use it in my hair, it makes it so smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with the keratosis on my arms. It does seem to help and can&#x27;t be beat for the price! It came quick and exactly as described!</li>
            <li> stuff is awesome. just a warning though to keep it in a mildy cool place because if it goes under 76 degrees F it WILL melt. i kept mine in the fridge during the hot months but it got too hard so i just had to pop it in the microwave for a few mins. i LOVE that you can take a small solid piece out, rub between your hands and it melts right there and is very easy to use. it has no smell whatsoever ( i kinda wanted a coconut smell but no biggie) so my husband likes it too. so far i have used it on my hair and hands. both are super soft now!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot nice and light not heavy on the skin or hair</li>
            <li> I needed this for the bamboo steamer, it was used as a protectant and seal.  It does not leave a film.</li>
            <li> This a great product that made my hair super manageable and healthy. I also love how it is solid form but turns into oil when you mix it.</li>
            <li> Sooooo effective for cold weather-cracked hands!</li>
            <li> Loving this oil. Completely scentless and makes my skin feel silky! This would be great for someone with sensitive skin. I got my mom a jar as well, because the slightest bit of scent makes her break out, and she likes it! I&#x27;ll need to order more next time. This is a good size for someone like me who wants to just try it out first!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my skin and in my hair.  I have also now been using it by swishing a tablespoon in my mouth everyday and it has made a small difference in the color of my teeth. it&#x27;s not a miracle worker but when they say coconut oil is where the money is, they were not lying.  This is def worth the money if you have dry hair, skin, or yellow teeth.  It has worked for me and I am sure it will work for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I like this coconut oil, very good quality and the prize is reasonable. I use for my body, my hair, my eyes browns, and also for cook.</li>
            <li> What can one say about coconut oil?  It&#x27;s very oily, easy liquifies--- be REAL CAREFUL if you travel with this stuff --- it can migrate out of a very well sealed bottle.  There are a million uses for coconut oil and, thus far, I&#x27;m only up to ten.</li>
            <li> I recently read a lot about coconut oil so when I saw this I thought I&#x27;d try it. This stuff is great! It is not greasy,  there is no smell. Even though it is solid in the jar, once I put a dollop in my hand it just melts into my skin. My skin soaks it up. It doesn&#x27;t just lay on the surface of my skin. I use it everywhere, face, hair, hands, elbows. . I will never be without this stuff again. Don&#x27;t buy the coconut oil cream. Buy this.solid coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Great for hair and body</li>
            <li> This is a great product as described. No issues with the product or delivery. It absorbs quickly and is great for cuticles and much more.</li>
            <li> The description of this product says that it is 100% Coconut oil and while that might be so it is processed. Highly processed, it is not white like good coconut oil is nor does it smell like coconut. Even refined coconut oil still has a little scent to it. I love coconut oil and use it both for cooking and hair/skin care. While  I prefer the glass jarred oil for cooking, I like the tubs for hair/skin care as it is easier to scoop out with your hands. I figured I&#x27;d try this brand because both brands that I normally use (Viva and Spectrum) have gone up in price. It seems that I&#x27;m going to have to pay up to get the real deal. Any benefit you would receive by using coconut oil has been processed out of this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> like eit and will probably order more</li>
            <li> I am a natural African American with I&#x27;d say 4c hair. It keeps my hair moist especially if I apply it after shampooing and/or conditioning my hair. I then place shea butter over it to seal it in. Works well and really makes my hair and its curls pop after plaiting it up with the coconut oil and unplaiting it after a few days.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed in the skin pretty well.  Since I&#x27;m 69 miracles can&#x27;t happen.  I like it on my face and is absorbed pretty quickly though I believe the coconut oil with the fragrance seems to work better.  I don&#x27;t know why it would, but it seems too.</li>
            <li> better the baby oil, it has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting more, and it keeps my skin morse all day. miss spelling</li>
            <li> No flakes, no greasy film.  I wash my hair every day and put a little of this in my hair and go.  Most products leave a residue.  This one does not.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes my skin silky smooth! Arrived in a liquid forum with the top off in the box from transport. But i love it</li>
            <li> Quick Ship, Just  as described</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a short time and find no change.  I bought it for skin and nails.  It is easy to use, but I do kinda wish it would stay solid.  It changes with the temperature of the room.  I do like that it is pure and not filled with a lot of other ingredients.  So far ... so good.</li>
            <li> Makes a really good body softener, among so many other uses!</li>
            <li> never used it before so i can&#x27;t compare...i&#x27;m happy with my purchase...:)</li>
            <li> found coconut to use on the skin which is good since books say is good for skin.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting more amazing results, as my hair is badly damaged from perms, but I will&lt;br /&gt;continue to use it and any other product which can restore my hair to its gloriouss condition when I was&lt;br /&gt;considerably younger</li>
            <li> Appears to be of good quality and a good bargain for the money.</li>
            <li> Just what we expected</li>
            <li> Expensive and the oil leaks from the bottom for some reason. I advise you to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered coconut oil before and evidently I didn&#x27;t know what to look for. I expected this to be semi-solid when at room temperature, but it seems I should have bought virgin coconut oil, cold pressed. This is an extremely thin oil, very much like sesame oil. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the oil, but I truly do not understand why it is packaged in a jar instead of a bottle as it&#x27;s so thin it&#x27;s a terrible mess to try to use the product. It wasn&#x27;t expensive so I&#x27;m keeping it but will do some more research so that I get what I&#x27;m looking for before ordering again.</li>
            <li> Too greasy  and after it finally dries, it also dries out my skin. Big zero for this product. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I love the coconut oil. I am putting it with my other oils. I will be ordering more in a large container when y ou have another sale. I mix other oils with the coconut and it is looking real fine!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were hoping for.  No hassles or concerns to note with this transaction - thank you!</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS WELL.  IT&#x27;S NOT DAMAGING TO YOUR HAIR.  I&#x27;VE ORDERED THIS SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE.  I WILL ORDER IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> A great leave-in hair moisturizer product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s a great value, and feels just like other more expensive brands I have tried. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Love for making homemade stuff.</li>
            <li> Received product and looking forward to using so I can make my own sunblock.</li>
            <li> I used it for a while, it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;Too oily at times</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this item very helpful for my hair. I do love using it for dry skin. It&#x27;s the best product I ever used for my hands and feet. It can be a little messy. I rub it on my skin and then wipe the palms of my hands or my feet with a paper towel and I find it&#x27;s much better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried through the years. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. A little goes a long way and even though I use it several times a day I still have plenty of it. I would buy this again and again. It seems to cost more than lotion but considering how you don&#x27;t need much of it, even if you wipe off the excess, you really don&#x27;t use that much. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair. My hair had become dry and unmanageable. I put it on my hair three times a week before I go to sleep and then shampoo in the morning. My hair is softer and shinier, more manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Been using it for more than 4 months and my skin is no longer dry. If anyone reading this is into the organic lifestyle rinsing your mouth with coconut oil is very good for you!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I have never used this product before but always heard it was great for hear and skin.  I use it everyday and I love it</li>
            <li> I used this on nail fungus.  Not only did it work on that but made  my hands really soft.</li>
            <li> Loved this product! It is odorless and smothens the skin. I used it for dry, flaky skin and saw visible results immediately.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Shipped fast. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your sk8n</li>
            <li> i thought that because it was 100% coconut oil it would smell strongly of coconut-there is no coconut smell at all so i was disappointed about that but its still a good oil just no fragrance at all</li>
            <li> Misleading. Do not buy this coconut if you are looking for the REAL deal. Unfortunately, the &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; thing got me and before I could cancel my order, it was already shipped. It is not horrible by any means, and I will use it til it gone, but will not be  buying it again.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. Just started using, feels great.</li>
            <li> I happy with it! I use for my feet every night.</li>
            <li> I have dyshidrosis on my hands and feet and after about two weeks of using this, my hands began to clear up and I&#x27;ve been using this product since I bought it. It&#x27;s wonderful! My hands are completely clear now, so long as I keep using this a few times a day. It lasts a lot longer than I expected, even after letting others use the oil countless times.</li>
            <li> Have not used the emu oil yet,the coconut oil is not bad</li>
            <li> I have used this as a moisturizer after washing my face and it leaves it so soft and smooth--my skin looks younger!</li>
            <li> My baby has eczema and dry skin. She doesn&#x27;t complain when I put this on her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the coconut oil on my very dry lips and it is helping! :)</li>
            <li> The shipment came on time as expected and the product was good</li>
            <li> Leaky, very leaky. It was everywhere in the packaging. The product, I suppose, works as it should, but the packaging was simply awful.</li>
            <li> So far... I&#x27;m a fan. I&#x27;ve used it on my skin more than in my hair, but I plan on using it in combination with castor oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> High quality product, shipped quickly. The seller was kind enough to follow up on the order to make sure I was happy with everything, which I absolutely was. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I use this a lot! I use it as moisturizer for my body and I also use it on my bf who has psoriasis. It helps when you put it on after you shower to seal in the moisture. The only downside is that it&#x27;s super oily so make sure you put it on before you go to bed and let it soak over night.</li>
            <li> No smell, great for skin!</li>
            <li> Best oil got it on time use it on my hair i love it will buy more after i run out thank you!</li>
            <li> I have bought this coconut oil for my hair. I haven&#x27;t use it yet but it is liquid so I don&#x27;t think I will have a problem.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using coconut oil - and I&#x27;m more than impressed.  My skin isn&#x27;t dry or rough as is, but it made it amazingly supple and smooth.  I used it on my hair (which I&#x27;ve been bleaching/dying/destroying for years), left it on overnight, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results.  I washed it out three times with Prell, didn&#x27;t use a conditioner after, and my hair was the softest, shiniest and most well behaved I&#x27;ve seen it in two decades.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> Like the no scent, but does the work. If u choose to put in hair, on skin or to oil pull, all works great. I may get one for my sisters:)</li>
            <li> used this in my lip balm recipe! worked great......thanks</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I left it on for a couple of hours and rinsed it out. An olive oil treatment works much better.</li>
            <li> Still watching for better personal results because if the benefits can be produced this is a good value and good to have around.</li>
            <li> I used this in my hair, and I have never had so many compliments on my hair before!  It is much better than any hair oil I have ever used before.  Not only did it keep my hair in place, but when I washed it out, my hair was more lustrous and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Package was not sealed great and it was leaking when I got it.  Still love it though</li>
            <li> It makes my hair and skin REALLY soft. I can&#x27;t stop rubbing my legs or my hair. I cant wait to take my twists down later. I think its cool how it melts when I touch it. When i took it out of the mailbox it was liquid and i was wondering why it was in a jar but later it thickened up. Kinda cool lol yes I&#x27;m easily amused</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009P4PZC Cococare Coconut Oil -- 4 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;Because of Psoriasis my skin was left with out the ability to perspire or oil at all. I&#x27;ve used many creams and even medical creams to no avail. I have dry skin..period ! It is vey irritating ! I&#x27;ve learned to apply Coconut oil in an amount for me. It keeps my skin oiled with out being greasy. Irritation gone.</li>
            <li> I was a bit confused because I bought this to be used for cooking, but the jar says &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34;. But isn&#x27;t it 100% coconut oil?</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff!  I have used coconut oil many times in the past, tried different brands, and this one exceeds them all at a low price!  My complaints about coconut oil in the past were:  overpowering coconut scent, too greasy, too runny, difficult to apply neatly, didn&#x27;t absorb well, etc.  This particular oil has no scent.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply out of the jar without making a mess.  It is neither too runny nor too heavy; just the right consistency.  It absorbs well into my skin, and I can use it on my comb to smooth out my hair WITHOUT it looking greasy!  No putting the oil in the night before to condition - now I can apply it to my hair (I apply it to the comb first, then comb through) when it&#x27;s dry, clean, and styled, and it smooths it out without weighing it down!  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Okay product does what it says it will do, but congealed once opened. Can still use it as the hardened oil liquifies on contact with skin.</li>
            <li> The container could have been a squirt bottle for better access. It drips all over.</li>
            <li> I use this for everything. Used it after breastfeeding when I was still having cracking, use it on my babies dry skin, my dry skin, my hair, diaper rash, you name it.</li>
            <li> Good for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I got this to try on my face as a moisturizer and it has really improved on my complexion.  As a fluke, i tried it on my arms where i have kerosis plaris and have tried different lotions all summer to clear it up and nothing worked. Two weeks after using coconut oil it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It has no odor and is solid at certain temperatures and liquid at certain temperatures, just like it should be. I use it on my hair, skin and nails and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil for everything.  I use it to moisturize my face, my hair, to take off my make up and I also use it for dry hands and feet.  There is nothing this stuff isn&#x27;t good for body wise.</li>
            <li> just as advertised and like the picture this is just like the picture some solid some liquid in the bottle it kinda reminds me of lard or Crisco when solid but melts at 75 degrees so its liquid oil but I like it good for dry hair or skin but because its oil I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face sometimes it makes me break up and I don&#x27;t get pimples usually but I avoid oils and chemicals. Just depends on the person but I like this product a lot . The container is good when its solid but bad when its liquid I feel I spill it and doesn&#x27;t close tight for liquid so I keep it in the bag it came in to avoid making a mess on my stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in some different body scrubs. It preforms fairly well - it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same creamy richness as other coconut oils I have used, but it still does a good job of moisturizing. It also has very little coconut scent, so if you want something that is fairly neutral in smell, this wouldn&#x27;t be a bad choice.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is so good for your hair! If you&#x27;re trying to grow out your hair, this is the way to go! Just coat your hair with it, leave it on for at least an hour (and don&#x27;t forget to put a plastic bag on/or apply heat on it so the hair cuticle absorbs it better) and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  love the product,  has certainly helped my face dryness go away.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I bought this brand because it was the cheapest and even though it works great, just be aware that it is odorless. I actually enjoy the smell of coconut so I was a little disappointed by that, but the product works great. So as long as you don&#x27;t mind the lack of scent, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my cuticles and my hair. I first put it on my hands and gently rubbed through my hair. That added to much. Now I just put it on the ends. Some works it&#x27;s way through my hair but it leaves it soft and shiney. No frizzies either.&lt;br /&gt;It was liquid when it arrived but I knew it would be if above 80 degrees. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my first brand trying coconut oil. I use it in my thick, coarse hair. It melts easily, so I didn&#x27;t need to heat it up to apply it to my hair. I think I might need to try another brand, this didn&#x27;t leave my hair moisturized. It was very shiny the next day though. I also want to try an organic brand, this brand doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Will order again</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this coconut oil it is not greasey at  all on your skin it soaks right in .</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this coconut oil. It leaves my skin/hair soft.</li>
            <li> (This is his wife) Somehow, this was the only product that helped relieve the itching as my skin stretched during pregnancy. I wish I had known about it with my last pregnancy! It&#x27;s fragrance free and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair soaks this right up I love the consistency of it too!</li>
            <li> Very useful product. Firstly it arrived in time and we&#x27;ll sealed and good condition. We use the oil for massage on cracked/dry skin and feet and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> Received the product quickly.  My hands and fingernails thank you.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil on my skin, and everyone remarked on how smooth and soft my skin looked. My skin is SO dry in the summer and just a little bit of coconut oil goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as in my hair, I haven&#x27;t found yet a good amount. I always put too much in my hair and it gets too oily. I guess I have to just put a tiny tiny bit in. I have noticed that it has calmed my hair a bit though (I have wavy, frizzy hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who hasn&#x27;t used coconut oil before, just beware - it is a solid in the container, but once you have it on your hand, it turns liquidy, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Was not creamy enough..could not spread on my skin easily</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It has no smell to it. Use on skin and nails. Starts out oily but it absorbs quickly. I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> Its a nice and economic coconut oil. I apply it all over my body to fight winter dryness and it works.</li>
            <li> All I will say is this, this is some real 100% coconut oil, it is not just good it is great, great for your skin and your hair. I have well past my waist dreads or locks if you will and this is just fine for my hair, with a little shea butter added this keeps my scalp and my dreads tight. I  have one recommendation, keep it well refridgerated or it will liquify on you, other than that I have no complaints. The oil is oderless, if you want a scent, an essence oil may be added if you would like a scent added, it is a carrier oil. I will be buying more as it arrived very quickly and it is very clean and fresh, not stale as others have said. I would not recommend this oil for cooking, this is not a cooking oil. I am so glad I found this oil at an acceptable price too, I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It has NO smell to it, and it is NOT greasy! Depending on the temperature, it will melt into a oil, but I like that, and when it gets cold will solidify again! I use it everywhere, hair, nails, knees, elbows. It is an excellent moisturizer. This is one product I will continue buying. Wish I had known about it sooner.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, good service.</li>
            <li> This is good coconut oil, and it does really help with your hair and skin, but it is more processed than other oils.  I enjoy this product, but will buy virgin coconut oil in the future.</li>
            <li> Not at all 100% coconut oil and the container is the smallest thing I ever ordered. Would never order again.</li>
            <li> good price, great quality. I have used it all over me...</li>
            <li> I like this product!!!</li>
            <li> Didnt smell like coconut. VERY VERY messy, it kept leaking over everything when it melted. It wasnt as mosturizing as i expected it to be either.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my dd had a diaper rash and i heard it works well. Since i cloth diaper its hard to find creams that are cloth diaper safe. This has not made liquid repel or damaged the diapers at all!</li>
            <li> This oil is okay. i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s 100%. Coconut has a light  smell to it. This brand don&#x27;t smeell anything like coconut! Not sure if i will buy again????</li>
            <li> I received the product within a week and it is just as described. Melts as soon as it touches my fingertips.</li>
            <li> I love this product, all year long. Now that Im in my 50&#x27;s, I use it as a top coat over my face cream and it keeps my skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Words of wisdom to all you young ladies who want good skin in the long run: ALWAYS wear a good sunblock when you go outdoors, wash your makeup off before you sleep, and find and use a good moisturizer every day.</li>
            <li> Received this product in the time frame.  Blends well into my hair and smells great! I use it 2 times a month and my hair thanks me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the itchies from all the stretching going on here and this is THE cure.  It&#x27;s 100% natural and it leaves skin feeling so moisturized, but not the greasy feeling you would imagine from an oil.  It can even be used on sore/tender nipples while breastfeeding and is safe for you and baby.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> The product is great, but it leaks out of the jar during shipping. It was in a bag so it didn&#x27;t get on the other items in the shipment, but when opening the bag the jar was oily all over.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE; SWIFT DELIVERY, NO COMPLAINTS</li>
            <li> Not for human consumption.</li>
            <li> Best coconut oil for hair.</li>
            <li> I try to go as natural as possible so I was very excited about this oil, recommended by a friend. I have rosacea, so I have to be careful with what I use. My derm sells me this very expensive moisturizer. Well, no longer. In the jar, the coconut oil is white and thick. Once it hits the heat of your skin, it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; to a slick oil that smooths onto your skin very easily. A few minutes of oiliness, which I like because my skin is dry, and then all that&#x27;s left is soft skin. I have had no break outs or sensitivity to it. My skin has NEVER looked better. It works. Simply and naturally.</li>
            <li> This is an oil so don&#x27;t expect a cream.  I don&#x27;t like that it has no scent of coconut whatsoever, and I find it somewhat greasy and not easily absorbed.  I initially purchased this for use on my skin, but now I may try it on my hair instead.  Next time I will buy a cream for my skin instead.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is great for the skin and scalp.  I was unable to find pure coconut oil in my local stores.  So glad Amazon had it and at a reasonable price.  It works well and absorbs beautifully.  The 4 oz last a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I love how it stays a solid form until you spread it in your hand.  It melts then and stays fresh for a long time.  This stuff works really well in my hair and on my skin.  There is no scent.  Does not irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the texture of the oil. Most oils bother me and leave a glossy film. This oil felt nice and made my hair smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Cant really notice a difference, both times I&#x27;ve used on my hair. Also made my face breakout...not sure if I like it</li>
            <li> love it smells so good!</li>
            <li> As a first time user of coconut oil I am learning how to use it. Takes off makeup like a charm  and after washing face, eye area is soft not greasy feeling. Since I live in Phoenix Arizona, I have to keep in the fridge and take out a few minutes before I use. Product is very temperature sensitive as stated and liquefied at about 75 degrees which is fine if you want to transfer into a bottle for easier use. I like more of a solid state to use as a makeup removal. Great price.</li>
            <li> This small jar is perfect for using on a daily basis when applying to hair and skin. I like to add a little Coconut Oil to the ends of my hair after. The oil maybe in a liquefied form if it arrives in warm weather, but it solidifies under 70 degrees in my house. The oil then will melt in your hand once your ready to use it.</li>
            <li> Bad. No coconut st all.</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful! I highly recommend this product &amp; seller. I will be ordering this product again!</li>
            <li> THIS SUCKS! NOT REAL COCONUT OIL! SMELLS AND FEELS LIKE PLASTIC, TERRIBLE FOR YOUR HAIR AND SKIN!</li>
            <li> Good price.  Works good.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite oil! I use this on my skin, mostly my face! I put it on in the morning and my skin stays so smooth and moisturized. I also use it on the bottom is my feet and leave on overnight. It doesn&#x27;t have any type of smell to me, which is nice.</li>
            <li> My hair and my body loves this coconut oil.  This will help reduce a lot of the stuff I buy for grooming as this can be used for a lot of grooming issues.  My feet and nails LOVE this</li>
            <li> I gave this product 1 star because I do not believe this 100 percent coconut oil. I used it for about a couple days and noticed my arms start to itch. I have sensitive skin so this product is not good for people with sensitive skin. Also has a strange smell to it, doesnt have that coconut smell. This product is cheap for a reason. I recommend buying \\&quot;nature&#x27;s way\\&quot; organic coconut oil. works well and smells aot better and that expensive.</li>
            <li> I order this connect oil to use on my hair, it does liquify upon touch but doesn&#x27;t have that nice coconut smell I&#x27;m used to. It has no smell at all which some people may like. Otherwise it does the job.</li>
            <li> Just know that it comes in a completely melted form, not solid looking like the picture. Other than that it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> I use it when I straighten my naturally curly thick hair.Keeps my hair soft and shiney. I also mix it in with my body lotion to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> The BEST coconut oil ever.</li>
            <li> Coconut seems to be the miracle item of this decade. Be aware that this particular item is NOT to be eaten. It is strictly for external use as a moisturizer for hair, skin and nails. It is odorless so you won&#x27;t get that day-on-the-beach thing but on the other hand, it won&#x27;t interfere with your preferred cologne or after shave. It liquifies at anything over 75 degrees. At most room temps, it is solid. My only issue with this product is getting it out of the jar usually results in coconut oil under at least one finger nail. It&#x27;s even harder as the jar empties. Some kind of small spatula would be helpful. Other than that small thing, the stuff is great. I use it as under eye cream, all over body moisturizer and cuticle softener. It has done a great job healing and then preventing the cracked and rough hands from this harsh winter. A little goes a long way so the price is good too. I give it only 4 stars because of the finger nail thing. The product itself is a winner.</li>
            <li> I started out using the liquidized form of this product, but the more solid oil is to my liking much more. I use it on my face, elbows and heels for replinshed skin and my hair for the hydration qualities. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy again but I don&#x27;t like to have to write reviews about why I buy mundane, daily use items.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a transition into a more natural/organic lifestyle. In particular, I used it as part of a deodorant mix. It makes a fantastic moisturizers and gives smoothness and body to a homemade deodorant. I love the consistency, texture, and scent.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly bought this coconut oil because it&#x27;s really inexpensive, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was 100% pure even though the jar says so. I&#x27;ve only bought coconut oil twice - first Dabur Vatika then this one. I think I&#x27;ll go back to the Dabur Vatika or try one from Whole Foods because I&#x27;m not too sure if this one is pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m new to using coconut oil, I&#x27;m not too experienced or familiar with it, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s really legit or not. I mean, it works like it&#x27;s supposed to, I guess; I use this along with shea butter to seal my natural hair and along with my Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie for my twist outs, and it seems to be working fine. But the smell. It has a slightly weird smell that I can&#x27;t really describe but it makes me not really trust it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer my coconut oil to be all natural, especially if it says it is on the jar. I&#x27;m not sure if this company is telling the truth, but I think I&#x27;ll just stick with Dabur Vatika coconut oil because I trust it.</li>
            <li> exactly as described! SO much cheaper than buying it at a grocery store</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your hair feel very moisturized. I use with my safflower oil, and water</li>
            <li> They say this stuff can be taken internally for all kinds of benefits, but I use it for my skin, which suffers greatly int he Florida climate. This is truly a great product and lubricant.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Make skin and hair feel great. I use for skin and hair. Nothing else works like this. Fantastic</li>
            <li> love the smell and works great</li>
            <li> It worked really well for the cream I was making</li>
            <li> great deal on this totally unscented coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;feels great when I rub it on my hands and the&lt;br /&gt;smoothness lasts.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my hair dresser recommended Coconut oil for dry scalp.  I was a little hesitant to purchase because of the word &#x27;oil&#x27; but it doesn&#x27;t leave your head or hair looking greasy and unwashed.  The product works great if used sparingly.  It absorbs quickly into the skin.  You can use it for skin too.  A small amount of this product works wonders.  I thank my hair dresser every time I go for recommending this product.  Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I thought It would be an oil form its not !! I dont now if it will work the same ?? now i got to look or a liquid !!</li>
            <li> For those of you who like to use natural instead of stuff with chemicals. You should try this product because its really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my hands when they are chapped, I put it on my legs to help get rid of the stretch marks and it does work but you got to apply it everyday for it to keep on working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my face and it keeps it moisturized. I felt like it even got rid of the zits on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dog and my cat love this stuff after rubbing it on my hands, my cat jumped up in my lap and started to lick it off. my dog Abby begged to sit in my lap too and she licked the other hand too. So I guess its good for them too. Abby&#x27;s skin looks healthier since she&#x27;s been licking the stuff off my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all together I would rate  this as a 5 star product!</li>
            <li> I did not realize this would be plain old coconut oil, I should have just purchased  plain old coconut oil that is cooking grade in the Health Food Store.  That being said, still great for your skin, I also use in my hair with barely a touch of it warmed up in my hands when my hair needs a little control.  Good stuff, but a better deal if you buy the mayonnaise jar size at the grocery or health food store.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat new to coconut oil, so I don&#x27;t know a ton about it, but I was very disappointed with this product.  My friend gave me some of her coconut oil when my baby had a diaper rash to help clear it up.  That oil smelled great and helped with her rash.  After that, I wanted to buy some for myself to have on hand, so I bought this.  When I received it, the product had been shipped with the lid partially open, so coconut oil leaked all over the box and other items in the box.  I contacted Amazon and they gave me a refund.  The oil that did not leak out, did not have the coconut smell that the other oil I had previously used had.  Like I said, I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about coconut oil, so I am not sure if &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; coconut oil is supposed to have that scent or not, but this one did not.</li>
            <li> This is definitely fake. It has no smell of coconut! In fact it smells of nothing. I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> My skin is best moisturized by this coconut oil.  I have excessively dry skin and I recommend this product.  Just make sure you are not allergic to coconuts.  Cococare Coconut Oil helps remove dry, flaky skin and eventually leaves you with better hydrated, soft skin with a silky sheen.  I love this product because it is a naturally method of dealing with dry skin.  I have used it instead of hydrocortisone cream, which can be harsh on your skin.  It has a very soft, practically unnoticeable scent of coconut.  It is liquid in warm temperatures and solid in cooler temperatures.  If you find it is too solid to be able to apply, simply leave the jar out in warm temperature for a little while and it will melt enough for you apply.  If it&#x27;s too liquidy for you to apply, refrigerate until it solidifies enough to your liking.</li>
            <li> This wasnt what I expected out the oil. When I recvd the package it was no in good shape and the oil was leaking out the package</li>
            <li> Would have liked this better if it was edible.  I made a mistake to purchase it.  But anything coconut is good for your skin and hair so I kept it.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day in my hair &amp; have noticed that I no longer have dry flakes.  I am now considering adding it to my lotion.</li>
            <li> Leaked all over the box and everything else that shipped with it.  Also, beware that this item cannot be returned, so if it spills everywhere, you end up with much less than the 4 oz. it&#x27;s advertised as.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment great product a ton of uses!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is 100% and it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconuts. Some coconut products are overbearing but this one is not.</li>
            <li> Came right on time. It&#x27;s a good quality oil with a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> Came quickly but I&#x27;m unsure if I should refrigerate it lol !!</li>
            <li> It comes as no surprise but coconut oil is seriously a miracle oil. Love it. I use it for everything. Most recently I started using this as my night cream because I get super dry patches during the winter. This has definitely helped my skin!</li>
            <li> My daughter raves that it is amazing. She uses for her face and hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels on my face. I would continue buying your product. My jar had a space space bubble that didn&#x27;t fill all the way, but I still would recommend your product.</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil and this is nothing less than the best product ever</li>
            <li> I used some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff melts at room temperature, though, so, you know, look out for that.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone.  This is a quality product.  I will purchase more at another time. Great deal and price</li>
            <li> love coconut oil, this wasnt very expensive. i love to use this in so many ways</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product. I got it to stop hair loss and it seems to be working. It is also great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil in many ways. It goes into my homemade face wash, plant polish, hair gel, toy lubricant and lots more. This product was just what I thought it would be. A great price, delivered fast. Will order more.</li>
            <li> my mother used coconut oil on her skin to avoid stretch marks when she was pregnant with me and never got a single one, so now I&#x27;m doing the same thing with my first pregnancy. I like this one so far :)</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I have VERY dry skin and have been getting scaly patches. This has completely cleared up all the issues. I slather it on my face at night and wake to super soft skin. It&#x27;s making fine lines less noticeable as well.</li>
            <li> is as advertised. very good value.  would recommend.  So far I have ordered five jars, so it seems I am satisfied with the item.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my hands and cuticles.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product if but it again for sure</li>
            <li> I originally bought this oil for my hair but I use it mostly for my skin now. I LOVE it. It really helps to moisturize but it is not to heavy like many other products I have tried. I have sensitive, acne prone, oily skin and I always wake up glowing when I use this at night. Though, I would NOT use this on my skin during that day.</li>
            <li> Great natural makeup remover!! Takes off my eye makeup so easily. Large amount so will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Lovely,awesome and amazing! and the price,is the best!</li>
            <li> Received opened and used! Gross!  I am so disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on hands and feet un winter and this did an excellent job.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am currently enjoying this item, however it arrived solid (white) form, and now is an oil. With the Ohio heat it has melted! :) This product is nice for skin and hair. I have sensitive skin, and it has not been irritating. Great for the summer!</li>
            <li> I use this as a hair mask when my hair is feeling very dry and it works wonders. I also dab a tiny bit on my lips when they are feeling chapped. There are so many uses for coconut oil. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I got it to try it out and now i need another jar</li>
            <li> This is a long story! I use a large jar in the kitchen for toasts and cooking. These small jars fit in my small bathroom. I rub the coconut oil on my feet because my puppy licks my feet and commercial body lotions would not be safe for him.</li>
            <li> Cococare Coconut Oil is a really good product for hair that is relaxed or natural. I started using it when my relaxed hair start to shed a lot and it worked. I grease my scout with it 2 times a week as well as moisturize my ends. It is also a good conditioner to put in after you was your hair it makes it nice and soft. For me it took about 2 weeks to see a difference and it made my hair grow a lot. I am currently all natural and it is still giving me great results.</li>
            <li> Another Great Stocking Stuff. Hasn&#x27;t done what others said it would yet:&amp;#60;(</li>
            <li> The oil is a bit harder than I expected.  It&#x27;s a very hard and you can really only rub the surface of it to get it on your fingers.  I thought it might have more of a petroleum jelly consistency.  That said, I like that it&#x27;s NOT petroleum based and it smells pleasant.  So far, I&#x27;ve used it on my nails and cuticles to moisturize in the cold northern environment I live.  It&#x27;s too thick for a hair gel.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT . EXCELLENT VALUE. THERE IS NO STRONG SMELL</li>
            <li> so good for your dry hands</li>
            <li> I am very please with my order. The product description matched the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;The price was very reasonable. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  My daughter  turned  me on to it. I use it on my skin, not heavy or greasy at  all.  I also use it on my hair  it provides great sheen without making my hair feel greasy. I definitely will be ordering  more.</li>
            <li> I use this for everything from my lips, to my legs, to removing my eye make up! It is exactly what the description says it is, I highly recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product was hesitant to use it at first b/c I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the right thing for my skin but in the two weeks that I have had it, I started using it and it cleared my acne prone skin right up.  I also use a thin layer on my lips and around my hair line as well as on my elbows and back of my hands.  It has a faint, mild smell that is light and flat which is fine for me.  If you are looking for something that has a coconut smell, this is not the oil for you but otherwise for slight skin issues, it&#x27;s awesome.  I also use it on my seven year old son&#x27;s face in the winter months.  Will buy again when this batch runs out.</li>
            <li> It works.  I bought it so my sister and I could make hairs masks which it works fine for.  I will not repurchase this size of container again.  I&#x27;ll most likely by coconut oil from Costco from now one.  It&#x27;s a better deal.</li>
