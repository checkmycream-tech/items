            <li>This is a great light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and they all think it is an amazing moisturizer for the price.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion, but the smell is not the best.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice fragrant lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and has a very nice smell.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has a VERY strong smell of clove.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and is a great value for the money.</li>
            <li>so I thought that this would be a good day lotion because of how light it is</li>
            <li>This could also easily be used by men!</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>It is also interesting to note that this company has been around since the &#x60;30&#x27;s and located in India.</li>
            <li>This product works ok.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes ok and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love Himalya products and purchased this based on all the positives reviews.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love this face lotion.  </li>
            <li>It may be the answer you&#x27;ve been looking for! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells pretty dang good</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how excited I was (and still am!)</li>
            <li>It moisturizes nicely, but is also light and blends in smoothly under makeup.  </li>
            <li>I think it will be perfect for spring and summer because I will be able to use just a little and not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer with Neem as a major ingredient.  </li>
            <li>that I do use one (hello fine lines).  </li>
            <li>This light textured lotion absorbs fast, but is amazingly intensive.  </li>
            <li>so light and airy feeling.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this lotion to someone who wants more natural products that deliver great results.</li>
            <li>has a light spicy</li>
            <li>Feel free to ask me any questions that you may have.</li>
            <li>But at 35 I feel it&#x27;s getting important</li>
            <li>It is light on you skin and does not clog your pores.  </li>
            <li>I love how gentle it feels and it leaves a light, ungreasy feeling.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li>[the only truly good one</li>
            <li>Also, for those outside of the 18-24 age range, this product appears to be good for all skin types.</li>
            <li>However, the smell does fade fairly quickly so that&#x27;s a plus.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly and no perfume smell.</li>
            <li>This facial moisturizer is great for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have skin that is more on the oily side, *very* sensitive and prone to acne and seborrhoeic dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind it, but my husband hates it!!</li>
            <li>this product is very light weight and non greasy, it nourishes your skin leaving it soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>If you have super oily skin and dont care about ingredients then this might be right for you</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine with the scent, but my mom didn&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
            <li>It really does a great job of moisturizing my very dry skin</li>
            <li>Naturally, when I found Himalaya Herbals by mistake in Whole Foods, I was amazed by the honest ingredients list.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, all the ingredients are mainly natural oils, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>those chemicals your smearing on your face are getting absorbed into your skin and can be just like poison to your body.</li>
            <li>so the ingredients are right up our ally.</li>
            <li>When working the product into my skin it turns white for a bit, but that&#x27;s ok because it goes away pretty quick.      </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m sure you already know, it&#x27;s so hard to find an effective moisturizer that dosen&#x27;t cost a fortune, smells</li>
            <li>so effective i have used it for years and can&#x27;t really compare it to any American product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it during the day because I can only handle the feel of so many things on my face while I&#x27;m awake.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using their Invigorating Face Wash (equally amazing) for the last 2-3 weeks, so my acne is nearly gone!</li>
            <li>And for the longest time I used Clean and Clear moisturizer (the one with the purple cap).</li>
            <li>It leaves your face looking smooth, fresh and nourished all date and has a terrific scent to boot.</li>
            <li>For my, my skin is dry, so I need something more in the winter.</li>
            <li>cannot stress how important it is to listen to your body--it is telling you exactly what you need and all you need to do is open your mind and listen.</li>
            <li>and we really like it.</li>
            <li>This smells really earthy.</li>
            <li>It is gentle.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>Never really heard about this product before, but I love it.</li>
            <li>There is some gentle exfoliation with the wash</li>
            <li>I really like this loiton</li>
            <li>I dont use it that much</li>
            <li>I really like the texture of my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin in winter and need more moisture than this lotion provides.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is derived from essential oils and dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is the only moisturizer that has ever truly made my skin look healthy -- and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried moisturizers that target every possible skin type.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten more and more difficult for me to find a moisturizer that will do</li>
            <li>In fact, I think it may be causing me to break out a little bit more.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes just right and actually calms my skin.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, if you read the ingredients of the Clean and Clear moisturizer (or just about any other big name lotion brand) you&#x27;ll find what ingredient?!</li>
            <li>In my opinion the scent is easily unisex, but I will admit there is something odd about it.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and tempermental skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I made the mistake of wandering past that aisle.     </li>
            <li>Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t take much for each application, about a dine size amount or less.</li>
            <li>It smells spicy, but not overpowering and leaves our faces soft and doesn&#x27;t appear to clog pores.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to dryness and breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Let me preface this by saying that I&#x27;m 21 with sensitive combination normal/dry/oily skin and some chronic (hormone-related) acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy nor too light.  </li>
            <li>Natural is ALWAYS the way to go--the closer to the Earth, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first day of using it and my skin feels so fresh, and the redness has actually died down in one day.</li>
            <li>Not bad, just odd.</li>
            <li>And what natural ingredients it does have are all listed towards the bottom of the label so there are barely any in there at all.</li>
            <li>If your body is having a bad reaction, pay attention to what you&#x27;re putting on it and, more importantly, what you&#x27;re putting IN it.</li>
            <li>Well wouldn&#x27;t you know it; two weeks after using this stuff, my skin is so incredibly soft and I the dry patches that have been bothering me for years have completely vanished.</li>
            <li>My mother (who has extremely dry and sensitive skin, occasional hormonal acne, and some redness) ADORES this product!</li>
            <li>Other brands I used required an extra serum to treat acne and keep my pores unclogged -- meaning extra cash for more ridiculous problems that only mask the problems.</li>

            <li> In fact, I would put the lotion on and the dry patchy skin would BURN SO BAD and the patchy spots would turn bright red.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last you a very long time even if used liberally.</li>
            <li> it put nothing into my skin, it only takes away and makes my skin dry.</li>
            <li> , I could have gotten something 100% natural for half the price.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously hoping it would help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves your skin very soft and firm.  </li>
            <li> Its a little thin and not my top pick for dry skin.</li>

            <li> The scent is different from other lotions and I like it.  </li>
            <li> A faint hint of cinnamon, mild herbal scent that doesn&#x27;t linger long.  </li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t like the scent which makes it hard to put on my face!</li>
            <li> I use benzoyl peroxide so it gets very dry.</li>
            <li> I tried to stick to natural products, but my Clarina cream(Himalaya product) was not effective at all anymore.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is sometimes the lotion isn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough</li>
            <li> Made my face red, and I broke out pretty bad the next day.</li>
            <li> Three other family members have picked it up and used it</li>

            <li> Also small regret that it doesn&#x27;t contain any sunscreen.</li>

            <li> but boy was I wrong....</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is a line not to be missed! so light and airy feeling. so effective i have used it for years and can&#x27;t really compare it to any American product. haven&#x27;t found one like it yet.</li>
            <li> Good lotion and great quantity for the price but I really don&#x27;t like the scent which makes it hard to put on my face! Also small regret that it doesn&#x27;t contain any sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter and I have been using this lotion for about two weeks now and we really like it. It smells spicy, but not overpowering and leaves our faces soft and doesn&#x27;t appear to clog pores. It&#x27;s somewhat thin so sometimes I apply it twice in small amounts. I think it will be perfect for spring and summer because I will be able to use just a little and not feel greasy. We don&#x27;t put lotions or soaps with nasty chemicals on our skin so the ingredients are right up our ally. I would recommend this lotion to someone who wants more natural products that deliver great results. This could also easily be used by men! In my opinion the scent is easily unisex, but I will admit there is something odd about it. Not bad, just odd. We came back and bought the invigorating cleanser to use with our Clairsonics and we like that too. Great lotion!</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer, this is great stuff.  Soothing, hydrating, non greasy, seems to help control middle age acne.  Personally, I think the smell is really bad but I use it anyway because it works so well.</li>
            <li> This is a great light moisturizer. Absorbs quickly, not too fragrant that my husband won&#x27;t use it. :)  This is a great moisturizer for spring, summer, and fall. For my, my skin is dry, so I need something more in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to dryness and breakouts.  As I&#x27;m sure you already know, it&#x27;s so hard to find an effective moisturizer that dosen&#x27;t cost a fortune, smells nice,(it has a light spicy fragrance)and has a good texture.  This moisturizer delivers on all accounts.  The fragrance is derived from essential oils and dissipates quickly.  This light textured lotion absorbs fast, but is amazingly intensive.  It is also interesting to note that this company has been around since the &#x60;30&#x27;s and located in India.</li>
            <li> This smells really earthy. I never tried it as a moisturizer because I thought it smelled so bad, I did not want to smear it on my face.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that I&#x27;m 21 with sensitive combination normal/dry/oily skin and some chronic (hormone-related) acne. I have tried just about everything (Clinique, Lancome, Chanel, Prescriptives, Clarins, Avalon Organics, Dessert Essence, peppermint castile soap, Earth Science, AquaRose, Origins, Aura Science [the only truly good one but it went out of business a few years ago]). This is the only moisturizer that has ever truly made my skin look healthy -- and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried moisturizers that target every possible skin type.     Other brands I used required an extra serum to treat acne and keep my pores unclogged -- meaning extra cash for more ridiculous problems that only mask the problems. These other brands, I discovered, put in nasty chemicals or pore-clogging materials under different names. Naturally, when I found Himalaya Herbals by mistake in Whole Foods, I was amazed by the honest ingredients list. I&#x27;m so glad I made the mistake of wandering past that aisle.     This is the only moisturizer that absorbs fully and actually calms on contact. I&#x27;ve been using their Invigorating Face Wash (equally amazing) for the last 2-3 weeks, so my acne is nearly gone! But, last night, I felt a small pimple emerging on my nose and after cleansing and moisturizing with these Himalaya Herbals products, my pimple was much less visible, almost on contact with the lotion! And it doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all! It truly feels like my skin uses all of the product, no shine or unpleasant film. It just feels good.    Also, for those outside of the 18-24 age range, this product appears to be good for all skin types. My mother (who has extremely dry and sensitive skin, occasional hormonal acne, and some redness) ADORES this product! She said that she&#x27;s been looking for products like this since her 30s, when her skin began drying out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Himalaya products and have been using them for years.    I really like this lotion, but the smell is not the best.  It reminds me of something similar to cinnamon and other herbal products.  However, the smell does fade fairly quickly so that&#x27;s a plus.     The lotion doesn&#x27;t feel as thick as the Loreal lotion I was previously using and this absorbs well into the skin.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily.    This is an excellent lotion, but might not be the best choice for those who are peculiar about the smell.  I&#x27;m a guy so I&#x27;m fine with the scent, but my mom didn&#x27;t like it as much.  Like I mentioned earlier, the strength of the scent will fade after some mins.    Feel free to ask me any questions that you may have.</li>
            <li> This product works ok.  Fairly thin consistency which I believe is common for natural / organic products.   Moisturizes ok and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily.  When working the product into my skin it turns white for a bit, but that&#x27;s ok because it goes away pretty quick.      Scent lasts a little longer than other products I&#x27;ve tried.   Not the greatest scent.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the entire bottle, but probably will keep looking for other natural alternatives.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Nothing negative to say.  It is gentle.  Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  It moisturizes nicely, but is also light and blends in smoothly under makeup.  It does have a fragrance - some users have complained, but I really like the scent.  Three other family members have picked it up and used it and they all think it is an amazing moisturizer for the price.</li>
            <li> I have skin that is more on the oily side, *very* sensitive and prone to acne and seborrhoeic dermatitis.  It&#x27;s gotten more and more difficult for me to find a moisturizer that will do it&#x27;s job without irritating my skin and causing problems.  But at 35 I feel it&#x27;s getting important that I do use one (hello fine lines).  I have been using this moisturizer for about 2-3 months.  It moisturizes just right and actually calms my skin.  It&#x27;s not too heavy nor too light.  After wearing my skin is happy and you can tell by looks and feel that it is more moisturized.  I will mention that I only use it at night though.  I don&#x27;t use it during the day because I can only handle the feel of so many things on my face while I&#x27;m awake.  If I&#x27;m going to wear makeup or sunscreen I can&#x27;t deal with another layer under that.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer with Neem as a major ingredient.  It goes on very smooth and makes your face feel great, very light.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I tried to stick to natural products, but my Clarina cream(Himalaya product) was not effective at all anymore. This is my first day of using it and my skin feels so fresh, and the redness has actually died down in one day. I hope it works, ill keep you guys posted(:</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is great for normal to oily skin. Its a little thin and not my top pick for dry skin. Over time evens out the tone and texture of skin. Good for acne and acne scars. Very good for oily skin because its extremely light and soothing. Sometimes 2 applications is necessary. This bottle will last you a very long time even if used liberally.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the product. I have VERY sensitive acne prone skin. I use benzoyl peroxide so it gets very dry. This burned when I applied it. Made my face red, and I broke out pretty bad the next day. Will stay away from it for now</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrant lotion but it is just too lightweight for me in winter.  I have dry sensitive skin in winter and need more moisture than this lotion provides.  I will save it and use it this summer.</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves your skin very soft and firm.  It smells fresh and is a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe it.  I ordered this moisturizing lotion to go with the facial cleasner and they really do a great job.  Never really heard about this product before, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Himalya products and purchased this based on all the positives reviews. It really does a great job of moisturizing my very dry skin but I have not seen any imporvement in my acne as others described.In fact, I think it may be causing me to break out a little bit more.  It&#x27;s light weight and has a very nice smell.  I have very sensitive and tempermental skin so it&#x27;s probably me and not the product. I also use the Neem &amp; Tumeric face wash which is simply awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this face wash and the lotion of the same brand. I love how gentle it feels and it leaves a light, ungreasy feeling. There is some gentle exfoliation with the wash but I need something a little courser once a week. The smell is good and not overpowering. It controls my acne well and I love the smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering. My only complaint is sometimes the lotion isn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough and I have to apply it twice. Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t take much for each application, about a dine size amount or less.</li>
            <li> For once I&#x27;ve found a face loiton that doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or give me zits!!  I really like this loiton and I&#x27;ll buy it again before I run out, it&#x27;ll always be on hand, try it!!</li>
            <li> This is great for problem skin. Buy it!  My daughter loves this and we will buy again when it is needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly and no perfume smell. I would recommend this for any skin type. Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> Its same as from years...nice,original and much less from himalaya website of USA Would buy again from here .big bottle for months</li>
            <li> Not only did it take me a month or so to get this lotion (it came from Egypt) but its loaded w/ synthetic ingredients! &amp;#34;Nourishing&amp;#34; shouldn&#x27;t even be in the description. I have combination skin so I thought that this would be a good day lotion because of how light it is but boy was I wrong....it put nothing into my skin, it only takes away and makes my skin dry. And what natural ingredients it does have are all listed towards the bottom of the label so there are barely any in there at all. If you have super oily skin and dont care about ingredients then this might be right for you but I was crazy for paying so much for this, I could have gotten something 100% natural for half the price. Learn from my mistake and DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> My first organic lotion and i&#x27;m not satisfied with it. My face has broken out since using this product. Also dries my face very bad it leaves dry patches everywhere like I have eczema witch I don&#x27;t but it seems like it from using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion.  It is light on you skin and does not clog your pores.  It leaves your face looking smooth, fresh and nourished all date and has a terrific scent to boot.</li>
            <li> I dont use it that much but my boyfriend does and he cant do without it now! We will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great lotion, all the ingredients are mainly natural oils, which is a big plus. This face lotion does not make face look oily but mosturized fantastically!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and was delighted to discover this lotion.  I use the Himalaya facewash, and hoped they&#x27;d make a moisturizer that was equally good.  I like the subtle scent.  A faint hint of cinnamon, mild herbal scent that doesn&#x27;t linger long.  And I like that it&#x27;s not too creamy, soaks in, and keeps my skin moisturized well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be a regular for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> For the past couple years I have had a horrible time with dry, patchy skin on my face--especially around my eyes. And for the longest time I used Clean and Clear moisturizer (the one with the purple cap). I used it religiously hoping it would help my dry skin. Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t. In fact, I would put the lotion on and the dry patchy skin would BURN SO BAD and the patchy spots would turn bright red. Then after the lotion dried, the skin would be flakey and oh-so-terribly painful; it was awful and I was miserable. I got so sick of it that I finally gave in and went to a dermatologist who prescribed prescription-strength hydrocortisone cream. For months, I smeared that nasty greasy crap on the dry patches. Low and behold, still no improvement whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Well a couple months ago I saw a documentary that talked about how makeup, moisturizers, lotions, hair products, etc., all contain alcohol, which is absolutely horrible for your hair and skin. Sure enough, if you read the ingredients of the Clean and Clear moisturizer (or just about any other big name lotion brand) you&#x27;ll find what ingredient?! That&#x27;s right! ALCOHOL. Which is absolutely fantastic if you want to dry the crap out of your skin! Huzzah!&lt;br /&gt;So I chucked that crap in the garbage where it belongs and went to a local organic produce store and found this Himalaya brand and decided to try the moisturizer. Well wouldn&#x27;t you know it; two weeks after using this stuff, my skin is so incredibly soft and I the dry patches that have been bothering me for years have completely vanished. I cannot tell you how excited I was (and still am!) that I found this stuff. Plus, it smells pretty dang good and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts or blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot stress how important it is to listen to your body--it is telling you exactly what you need and all you need to do is open your mind and listen. I wish I would have realized this years ago! If your body is having a bad reaction, pay attention to what you&#x27;re putting on it and, more importantly, what you&#x27;re putting IN it. Learn how to understand labels and always, always, always check the ingredients for everything you buy--those chemicals your smearing on your face are getting absorbed into your skin and can be just like poison to your body. Natural is ALWAYS the way to go--the closer to the Earth, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re having the same problems I had, I recommend trying this. Give a shot. It may be the answer you&#x27;ve been looking for! :)</li>
            <li> this product is very light weight and non greasy, it nourishes your skin leaving it soft and hydrated. HIghley recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a VERY strong smell of clove. I don&#x27;t really mind it, but my husband hates it!! The smell wears off after an hour though. It moisturizes, but the product is kinda runny and thin. I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li> Unsure of what to expect but very happy with this product.  The scent is different from other lotions and I like it.  After just a couple of days I looked forward to using this lotion. I really like the texture of my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it. Received as promised and will definitely buy again.</li>
