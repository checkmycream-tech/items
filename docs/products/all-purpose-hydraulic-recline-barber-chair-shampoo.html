            <li>Easy to move or take to destination.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in one box and was easy to assemble; looked just like the picture.</li>
            <li>Good price point for the new Barber in the Family.</li>
            <li>The product picture was accurate.</li>
            <li>it performs what a huge barber chair would...</li>
            <li>i needed it.. comfortable for any size of person..</li>
            <li>This chair in our beauty salon is so comfortable.</li>
            <li>The movements are smooth and it pumps well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what i expected and the quality is awesome.</li>
            <li>and when I am ready to order more chairs it will be from this supplier.</li>
            <li>Overall good chair.</li>
            <li>overall, good for the price.</li>
            <li>I tried to bypass my warning and purchase but the warnings are true.</li>
            <li>The chair arrived quickly by UPS.  </li>
            <li>My wife just love the new styling chair, even though it didn&#x27;t make it for christmas.  </li>
            <li>May be good for minimal use.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail very fast.</li>
            <li>Could be a little more sturdy,  but the style and shape is fabulous,  and gives you an upscale look, to a very modern salon!</li>
            <li>Firstly, there is a chunky block of wood on the pump shaft that you have to remove.</li>
            <li>Needed to save some money until I can afford a higher end</li>
            <li>The first thing this item did was brake on a weld.</li>
            <li>Works exactly how I need it too.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>No problems at all the chair was delivered on time everything was simple to put together comfortable seat for my clients.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The chair was very unstable.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel polished</li>
            <li>this chair looks nice but is not secure for use with costumers is danger.</li>
            <li>First of all they did not make it clear</li>
            <li>With the high price to ship it</li>
            <li>It came a few days late but all in all its a nice comfortable chair!</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am so far from impressed with my purchase that I knew I needed to share my review with any other prospective buyer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for big people, and you will be limited to who can fit in it.</li>
            <li>Lastly, you will need to have someone sit on the chair so you can really tighten the bolts for the foot rest.</li>
            <li>I fixed it by stabilizing the bar underneath with pipe clamps.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone opening a professional salon and need an all purpose salon chair to get this.</li>
            <li>I wasnt expecting the high quality that a more expensive chair woud cost.</li>
            <li>There were two cables barely holding the ripped cardboard together.  </li>
            <li>Not safe for my clients safe to say I am not pleased with this product for how much I paid.</li>
            <li>It looks too old, maybe it was leaved in ware house too long time</li>
            <li>I ended up filing a claim and the company said I could send the whole chair back and they would reimburse me, when I just wanted to get a new head rest (which is a small piece) and tool to put in the chair to let the foot rest have all three screws in.</li>
            <li>The chair was brand new with absolutely no marks or scuffs or tears etc.</li>
            <li>Just pay a little more and go with a reputable company:(</li>

            <li> Just pay a little more and go with a reputable company:(</li>
            <li> my friend I bought it for did not like as a little too cheap and not substantial for wide, oversized clients could not fit into</li>
            <li> This did not happen during shipping and is apparent due to where the holes are.</li>
            <li> One of the first times I put the chair completely down and then tried to turn it one direction or the other it then cracked the already broken cheap plastic base from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li> So I ended up with an extra chair that I don&#x27;t want plus the chairs doesn&#x27;t work well moving up and down when you put the chair back for people to lay down</li>
            <li> This is my first disappointment, since I&#x27;ve been buying stuff from Amazon for the past year, consistently.</li>
            <li> I am writing this in my review because the assembly instructions are very simple and on a little piece of paper.</li>
            <li> The chair is a little crooked.</li>
            <li> Still a little tall for short stylists like me who are 5&#x27;0\\&quot; but we always adjust.</li>
            <li> Not very practical.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install though instructions very simplistic in putting chair on the stand.  </li>
            <li> I guess mine was jammed due to shipping and when I reclined it the attachment broke, which caused the handles to wobble.  </li>
            <li> My reason for purchasing this particular one is i needed something for both my hair clients and for when i&#x27;m applying false eye lashes, shampooing with my portable hair dryer or doing my waxing.</li>
            <li> it slowly moves further and further down!</li>
            <li> Not good for professional use...</li>
            <li> I did in form the wholesale supplier they spend me another reclining pump that was not right for the model I brought.</li>
            <li> When your at rest in the chair the hydraulic cylinder that allows reclining doesn&#x27;t work properly and slowly reclines as your sitting.</li>
            <li> If there was a rating less than one star</li>
            <li> Got the Items ,without a Manual Book and Ripped Round Ring.</li>
            <li> Waste of Money ,also no Reply from them after trying to e-mail them twice.</li>
            <li> The chair came and the base of the chair, made of cheap plastic mind</li>
            <li> and it is not comfortable seating or headreast and arms while looking alright.  </li>
            <li> Bought this chair less than a year ago and you can feel the hydraulic pole while sitting in it!</li>
            <li> i am ready return.this product, i was bad luck</li>
            <li> however I recommend that before you recline it to spray something like WD40 underneath because there is a small piece that attaches the handles.  </li>
            <li> So you can only emagine the difficulty with a man.&lt;br /&gt;An expensive lesson learned.</li>
            <li> all the part are shaking its not safe for customers.</li>
            <li> its small so it fits in small work areas you work in.</li>
            <li> The rubber around the base was torn, the head rest had a deep dent in it and the control handle that makes the back rest stop in positions slips.</li>
            <li> Its hard to turn too.</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> Base isn&#x27;t heavy enough to hold a person in the recline position and will tip over.</li>
            <li> The arm rests are shaky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good because of stain.</li>
            <li> we contact customer service to resolve the problem they were very rude.</li>
            <li> you, was already broken.  </li>
            <li> I like the look of the chair, but I&#x27;m not happy with the company that I bought this chair from.</li>
            <li> Installation : little tricky at attaching base to chair..</li>
            <li> Ill be selling these chairs on eBay</li>
            <li> It looks weird.</li>
            <li> and you never know if something will go wrong in those 5 years and if the problem will be covered.</li>
            <li> This chair is a very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered in bad condition.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the service from the providers of the chair, and still have a broke all purpose stylist chair.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like this chair :(</li>
            <li> I am sick over this!</li>
            <li> Very bad business and customer service!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the worst purchase that I ever made.</li>

            <li> When the chairs arrived and I opened up the box there were holes in the leather. This did not happen during shipping and is apparent due to where the holes are. When you call the phone number all it does is ring. And you will recieve no response back on email sent. I am sick over this! Very bad business and customer service!!! DON&#x27;T DO IT! Just pay a little more and go with a reputable company:(</li>
            <li> Got the Items ,without a Manual Book and Ripped Round Ring. Waste of Money ,also no Reply from them after trying to e-mail them twice. Sucks.</li>
            <li> I ordered the chair on the 20&#x27;th and it arrived on the 27&#x27;th by FedEx. The product picture was accurate. I would like to comment on the required assembly. Firstly, there is a chunky block of wood on the pump shaft that you have to remove. A hammer did the job for me. Secondly, a pin is supplied that has to be inserted into a slot. This will likely require some force (hammer). Lastly, you will need to have someone sit on the chair so you can really tighten the bolts for the foot rest. I am writing this in my review because the assembly instructions are very simple and on a little piece of paper. I have no complaints about the chair itself or the quality. I felt I got a great deal. The chair was brand new with absolutely no marks or scuffs or tears etc. and when I am ready to order more chairs it will be from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I brought this chair for my wife.  Installation : little tricky at attaching base to chair.. remaining everyting good.  Quality : i can rate 3 out of 5 as hand rest got some cracks just after 2 months.  but the design is very good.</li>
            <li> Great chair perfect size fit well in the small room i needed it.. comfortable for any size of person.. I would highly recomend this chair but best of all its the cheapest hydraulic recline chair i&#x60;ve seen.Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a great chair, for the size of it it performs what a huge barber chair would... this is the second one ive ordered wish i would have ordered them all like this one.</li>
            <li> No problems at all the chair was delivered on time everything was simple to put together comfortable seat for my clients. Overall good chair.</li>
            <li> This chair is a good chair however I recommend that before you recline it to spray something like WD40 underneath because there is a small piece that attaches the handles.  I guess mine was jammed due to shipping and when I reclined it the attachment broke, which caused the handles to wobble.  The chair was still able to recline.  I fixed it by stabilizing the bar underneath with pipe clamps.  Works perfect now.  Very good chair for the price.</li>
            <li> This chair in our beauty salon is so comfortable. We appreciate the quality of your products. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> First of all the chair Came in a box that was ripped and falling apart at best.  There were two cables barely holding the ripped cardboard together.  The chair came and the base of the chair, made of cheap plastic mind you, was already broken.  Do you keep it or send it back?  I paid $70.00 for shipping so therefore I kept it because I couldn&#x27;t afford to pay for shipping twice. In order to put the back of the chair into the reclining position you basically have to man handle it to get it to recline back.  The lever that does recline the chair is on the left side of the chair if you are sitting in the chair so that you must walk around the chair to man handle it into the reclined position.  You must also walk around the chair yet again to manhandle the lever to put the chair back onto the up position.  One of the first times I put the chair completely down and then tried to turn it one direction or the other it then cracked the already broken cheap plastic base from top to bottom.  Needless to say I am so far from impressed with my purchase that I knew I needed to share my review with any other prospective buyer.  I would NOT recommend this product.  If there was a rating less than one star that is what I would pick!</li>
            <li> This chair does everything it is suppose to do. The movements are smooth and it pumps well.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Yes you get what you pay for . I wasnt expecting the high quality that a more expensive chair woud cost. Needed to save some money until I can afford a higher end chair.&lt;br /&gt; I didnt check the hight of the chair on the product before purchasing. I didnt know they could be different hights.&lt;br /&gt;I am 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and the seat in its lowest position is at  21 1/2 in. I am on my toes for a 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; women. So you can only emagine the difficulty with a man.&lt;br /&gt;An expensive lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I was soo happy to recieve my chair it was nicer than i thought.  It came a few days late but all in all its a nice comfortable chair!</li>
            <li> Brought the chair for my fiancée as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift it was assembled with ease but the recline did not work it would do like others commented about recline on its own as the person sat still in the chair. I did in form the wholesale supplier they spend me another reclining pump that was not right for the model I brought. I told them my dilemma so they told me to email photos of the two different reclining pumps which I did but still got the run-around now they want the &amp;#34;id #&amp;#34; for what they sent me which was already established. Now I am looking for a pump elsewhere I am disappointed with the service from the providers of the chair, and still have a broke all purpose stylist chair.</li>
            <li> plz dont buy this chair ppl. we used it for 3 month and its start breaking ..all the part are shaking its not safe for customers. i wast 156.00 on this junk. i ask for money back but the refuse to do that.</li>
            <li> The chair is a little crooked. Its hard to turn too. But for the price it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Does what its meant to.  Quality good, and looks nice.</li>
            <li> The biggest of junk I purchased from the internet. The first thing this item did was brake on a weld. With the high price to ship it I could do nothing but fix it the best way I could.  avoid at all cost.</li>
            <li> Got it in today. Fast delivery. Everything was in the box, and it wasn&#x27;t damaged. Went together fairly easily. Will put to the rest test tomorrow in the barbershop..&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is what it is. It&#x27;s not for big people, and you will be limited to who can fit in it.</li>
            <li> It was delivered in bad condition. The rubber around the base was torn, the head rest had a deep dent in it and the control handle that makes the back rest stop in positions slips. If you want a good chair I would say spend more money and buy a chair that is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> First of all they did not make it clear it&#x27;s two chairs and not one! So I ended up with an extra chair that I don&#x27;t want plus the chairs doesn&#x27;t work well moving up and down when you put the chair back for people to lay down it slowly moves further and further down! Not safe for my clients safe to say I am not pleased with this product for how much I paid. On top of all that I can&#x27;t return them without it costing me 70 bucks!! Ill be selling these chairs on eBay</li>
            <li> The chair was very unstable. Also, the pump does not work to lift the seat up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we contact customer service to resolve the problem they were very rude. They were unwilling to help resolve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst purchase that I ever made.</li>
            <li> Could be a little more sturdy,  but the style and shape is fabulous,  and gives you an upscale look, to a very modern salon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good because of stain. It looks weird. I still have some pictures, but can&#x27;t send to you on this massage. I don&#x27;t like it. It looks too old, maybe it was leaved in ware house too long time</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for!! When your at rest in the chair the hydraulic cylinder that allows reclining doesn&#x27;t work properly and slowly reclines as your sitting. Base isn&#x27;t heavy enough to hold a person in the recline position and will tip over. Chair looks nice but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife to cut my hair, and families hair. This chair is great! No problems. Looks great. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> setting it up was easy. its small so it fits in small work areas you work in. overall, good for the price.</li>
            <li> My wife just love the new styling chair, even though it didn&#x27;t make it for christmas.  It made a perfect addition to her/our in-home salon.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like this chair :(</li>
            <li> This is a excellent chair, only prob is it wouldn&#x27;t spin by turning alone I have to press on the pump to spin it. But think it&#x27;s a default with mine,</li>
            <li> Love it  It works good and also looks very go. Be nice to it and it will be nice to you</li>
            <li> The chair arrived quickly by UPS.  Lite weight box.  Easy to move or take to destination.  Easy to install though instructions very simplistic in putting chair on the stand.  It is good to have a ratchet socket wrench.  The tool provided was sub par at best!.  There is no contact or number or company to call if a question or problem included!  Looks nice.  Does as intended yet my friend I bought it for did not like as a little too cheap and not substantial for wide, oversized clients could not fit into and it is not comfortable seating or headreast and arms while looking alright.  You get what you pay for.  Not for shop or kiosk setting unless comfort not an issue for clients.</li>
            <li> this chair looks nice but is not secure for use with costumers is danger. i am ready return.this product, i was bad luck</li>
            <li> I tried to bypass my warning and purchase but the warnings are true. This chair is a very poor quality.  The chair does not go up when a person in the chair. The arm rests are shaky. it does not even hold a good size woman comfortably. The number they had on ebay for customer service is out of order.  It is best horrible chair.</li>
            <li> Only used it for a week and it broke</li>
            <li> I Ordered the Product and it arrived before the estimated date. Arrived in one box and was easy to assemble; looked just like the picture. Good price point for the new Barber in the Family.</li>
            <li> These went in a nursing home beauty shop and the residents really liked having this nice chair. The arms don&#x27;t have the material to get torn up after many years of use</li>
            <li> I like the look of the chair, but I&#x27;m not happy with the company that I bought this chair from. When I received it there was damage to the head rest and one of the holes where the foot rest goes into didn&#x27;t have a part for the screw to go into. I took pictures and emailed the company, but I didn&#x27;t get any response from them. I ended up filing a claim and the company said I could send the whole chair back and they would reimburse me, when I just wanted to get a new head rest (which is a small piece) and tool to put in the chair to let the foot rest have all three screws in. This is my first disappointment, since I&#x27;ve been buying stuff from Amazon for the past year, consistently.</li>
            <li> Not very practical.  Coming apart.</li>
            <li> The All Purpose Hydraulic Recline chair doesn&#x27;t pump up when a person is sitting in it.. The hydraulic pump that allows the chair to recline stop working the second week of having the chair</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price. Deleivered in time. Works great and looks high end. Could not have asked for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leather great. Stainless steel polished</li>
            <li> This chair was ordered on the 23rd of August... i received it in short delivery time. I am pleased with everything.. it&#x27;s exactly what i expected and the quality is awesome. I would recommend anyone opening a professional salon and need an all purpose salon chair to get this. My reason for purchasing this particular one is i needed something for both my hair clients and for when i&#x27;m applying false eye lashes, shampooing with my portable hair dryer or doing my waxing. It&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
            <li> Good product have recommended it to others</li>
            <li> Came in the mail very fast. Works exactly how I need it too. Still a little tall for short stylists like me who are 5&#x27;0\\&quot; but we always adjust. Comfy chair and very beautiful. Don&#x27;t like that there&#x27;s no warranty but if I wanted a chair with a warranty I&#x27;d have to pay $500+ and you never know if something will go wrong in those 5 years and if the problem will be covered. Love this chair!</li>
            <li> Bought this chair less than a year ago and you can feel the hydraulic pole while sitting in it! Not good for professional use... May be good for minimal use.</li>
