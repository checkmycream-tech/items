            <li>I have used Moisture Therapy Hand Cream for year&#x27;s and just love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>You could probably use it for more than just your hands.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many products for my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>

            <li>and they just feel and look better too.</li>
            <li>Use it right after you get out of the shower to really get the best use.</li>

            <li>This one is great for day wear, under makeup, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This cream is perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizer for my really dry skin</li>
            <li>Excellent for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Glad to see it available here</li>
            <li>my skin easily absords the cream and feels moisturised.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the most amazing cream.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the very first night!</li>
            <li>First off it is not greasy and it does not sit on top of the skin like some that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I work in not skin friendly environment.</li>
            <li>It would be great for any patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li>my hands have a kind of very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It certainly does make my hands feel moisturized. :)</li>
            <li>I have been using different brand with not that good affect on my skin.</li>
            <li>i think this is ok for normal weather but not recommended for winter</li>
            <li>and it did a good job in helping my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this moisturizer has my face feeling, ever so soft!</li>
            <li>One of the best products for dry skin I&#x27;ve used, will continue to order in the future.</li>
            <li>The cream inside is the best I have found for extra dry skin.</li>
            <li>Just isn&#x27;t effective enough for night time.  </li>
            <li>I apply it liberally after shower and then put my socks right on.</li>
            <li>The oils and extracts in this product are nutrient rich, and are like super food for the skin, plus it is all natural and does not contain petroleum, alcohol or parabens.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>Planning to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Actually I WILL say more.</li>
            <li>Even though it is lighter is seems to stay on pretty well</li>
            <li>It absorbed quick and my skin felt velvet soft, and hydrated for hours.  </li>
            <li>It is not better, and actually maybe not quite as good, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>Works great on rough dry and cracked skin on feet, knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced though.</li>
            <li>I only added this on to get to the $25 needed for free shipping</li>
            <li>I absolutely can&#x27;t do fragranced lotions if my hands are at all sore.</li>
            <li>my mother in-law originally bought the product for me for Christmas and picked a second jar up for herself.</li>
            <li>Also use it on arms and legs and although it is a bit sticky at first, that goes away fast and all you have is satiny soft skin.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase this product in smaller tubes, glad to see it comes in a larger packaging.  </li>
            <li>This lotion was mild enough that it hasn&#x27;t caused any flare-ups whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I actually found it right here on Amazon</li>
            <li>I live in the mountains at over 7,000 feet.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better than what I usually use.</li>
            <li>It is unscented, smooth, disappears into the skin without greasiness and relieves winter \\&quot;dry skin itch\\&quot; instantly.  </li>
            <li>She told me she found a product called \\&quot;Purely Northwest Winter\\&quot; at a boutique and has been using it for the last month.  </li>
            <li>OK, so the package looks a little generic and uninspiring.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing at softening your skin and moisturizing after a hard days work outside!</li>
            <li>and I was really suffering with open cracked hands.</li>
            <li>Wow this is prefection in a container.</li>
            <li>my old go to cream had.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and no breakouts from this product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this also helps very much with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, but it does get pretty dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned that it was heavy and greasy and would sit on my face, but it disappeared fast as my skin drank it up.</li>
            <li>I was actually looking for the Avon intensive cream that normally comes in a tube.</li>
            <li>my (over 60) face and hands really get dried out fast.</li>
            <li>Oh well, didn&#x27;t loose too much of the product.</li>
            <li>The next morning when I woke up my husband commented on how soft my skin felt.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old hand cream</li>
            <li>I usually used that super greasy, lard-like stuff.</li>
            <li>I am 66 and live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>Purely Nothwest Dry Skin Cream for Dry Winter Skin, 8 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>We moved this past weekend and cardboard boxes suck the moisture right out of my hands.</li>
            <li>No one wears much makeup up here in the winter, but I did try it as a smooth makeup base and it really made my foundation glide on.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Avon puts in their moisturizers, but the lotions seem to REALLY hydrate dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is a blessing for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I know that has issues with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Much better and less expensive than other creams and lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Okay, nothing will make my skin look like a 20 year old again, but at least it didn&#x27;t look like a chicken.</li>
            <li> Only take a little bit, so lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other creams for dry skin (and/or harsh winter conditions) but this one is the only one that works for me.  </li>
            <li> and I like how it sinks in.</li>
            <li> Every other cream that I tried will result in little red patches if I use them often.</li>
            <li> With this one, he at least tolerates it long enough to have me apply around his knees, elbows and hands.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so the jar lasts for some time.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are listed here on Amazon; check them out compared to other products.  </li>
            <li> this is a such wasted money!</li>
            <li> There is a lotion version, but I find it less</li>
            <li> After trying every other product avaiable  I usually resorted to using  petroleum jelly and covering with moisture gloves at bedtime.</li>
            <li> The problem is it&#x27;s very hard to find one that actually works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and it does seem to keep the moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> Not as thick and hard to absorb as  their Extreme Moisture cream and lotion.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this avon cream since I have used their products in the past.</li>
            <li> so well that I usually purchase 12 jars at a time and keep it in the refrig so that I will never be without.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t working like it usually does(and</li>
            <li> Plus they don&#x27;t have that greasy, slick feeling</li>
            <li> i.e. it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> I was left with an itchy rash on my hands and patches of dry skin and they itched horribly.</li>
            <li> I got it for the winter because my Olay everyday just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> Working as a nurse required frequent handwashing and my hands suffered especially in cold weather months.</li>
            <li> My mother in-law suffers from cracked hands and is the one who turned me on to this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ski or stay out in the snow, but between the cold and then overheated stores,</li>
            <li> I hate when a lotion does not rub in but stays there all gooky and looking at you.</li>

            <li> I suppose I am like every woman, I like face cream.  The problem is it&#x27;s very hard to find one that actually works.  I have to say this one does a great job.  First off it is not greasy and it does not sit on top of the skin like some that I have tried. I hate when a lotion does not rub in but stays there all gooky and looking at you. Yuck!  Anyway, this also helps very much with dry skin. I actually saw a difference in about a week. Okay, nothing will make my skin look like a 20 year old again, but at least it didn&#x27;t look like a chicken. I like this product, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love the way this moisturizer has my face feeling, ever so soft!</li>
            <li> This cream has a nice consistency and is odor-free.  But it doesn&#x27;t moisturize well enough for me to use as my night cream.  I am 66 and live in a dry climate.  But I will try it as a daytime cream, as I like the way it goes on.  Just isn&#x27;t effective enough for night time.  Reasonably priced though.</li>
            <li> I have used Moisture Therapy Hand Cream for year&#x27;s and just love it. It is wonderful for the hand&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t found a product that&#x27;s any better. Will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this product. It is a blessing for my dry skin. my skin easily absords the cream and feels moisturised.</li>
            <li> Working as a nurse required frequent handwashing and my hands suffered especially in cold weather months. After trying every other product avaiable  I usually resorted to using  petroleum jelly and covering with moisture gloves at bedtime. Well that quit working and I was really suffering with open cracked hands. I decided to try this avon cream since I have used their products in the past. This is absolutely the most amazing cream. I noticed a difference the very first night! You dont have to spend a fortune on hand creams to have one that works.</li>
            <li> Excellent for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this product in smaller tubes, glad to see it comes in a larger packaging.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisture therapy for years.  I have not found another that works as well as this does.  I have a lot of skin allergies and this works great for me.</li>
            <li> provides good moisture when you applied but it doesnt stay. i think this is ok for normal weather but not recommended for winter</li>
            <li> I only added this on to get to the $25 needed for free shipping but I&#x27;m glad I did. This is a really good hand cream.  You could probably use it for more than just your hands.  It would be great for any patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products for my son&#x27;s eczema.  Often he just screams and cries that the products sting! With this one, he at least tolerates it long enough to have me apply around his knees, elbows and hands.  I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other creams for dry skin (and/or harsh winter conditions) but this one is the only one that works for me.  It has &amp;#34;Nivea&amp;#34; cream consistency, i.e. it&#x27;s thick so I mostly apply it at night and by the morning my chapped/red/irritated skin is all better!  I use it for my hands, as well as face.  There is a lotion version, but I find it less effective.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this cream to anybody I know that has issues with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good Avon product.  Not as thick and hard to absorb as  their Extreme Moisture cream and lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I use this product on me and my husband as we have a farm and are always out in the weather. This product is amazing at softening your skin and moisturizing after a hard days work outside! Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> I get dry skin in the winter especially on my face and legs.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months and it did a good job in helping my dry skin.  What I did not like is the ingredients which contain petroleum, alcohol, parabens etc...  My mother in-law suffers from cracked hands and is the one who turned me on to this product.  When I showed up to her house for Christmas her hands were absolutely beautiful!  By far the best I have seen them since I have known her.  She told me she found a product called \\&quot;Purely Northwest Winter\\&quot; at a boutique and has been using it for the last month.  She let me try some and OMG!!! It was amazing!!!  It absorbed quick and my skin felt velvet soft, and hydrated for hours.  The next morning when I woke up my husband commented on how soft my skin felt.  I searched on the internet and to my luck I actually found it right here on Amazon [[ASIN:B00AR1FU20 Purely Nothwest Dry Skin Cream for Dry Winter Skin, 8 Fluid Ounce]] The oils and extracts in this product are nutrient rich, and are like super food for the skin, plus it is all natural and does not contain petroleum, alcohol or parabens.  The ingredients are listed here on Amazon; check them out compared to other products.  Anyway I was happy when I opened a package Christmas morning and got my own Jar.  Funny my mother in-law originally bought the product for me for Christmas and picked a second jar up for herself.</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect for dry skin. It is unscented, smooth, disappears into the skin without greasiness and relieves winter \\&quot;dry skin itch\\&quot; instantly.  It can be used anywhere on the body, I&#x27;ve found, and applied before bedtime it keeps moisturizing all night - and no stains on linens.  A little bit goes a long way, so the jar lasts for some time.  Much better and less expensive than other creams and lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Always will trust Avon moisture Cream.Just had to have it, for the winter months. When I saw the size and the price. Life will be a breeze this winter. Thank-You.</li>
            <li> Great product, could have been packaged better. You&#x27;d think to sit a jar of lotion upright as to not spill... not that packing person. Oh well, didn&#x27;t loose too much of the product.</li>
            <li> Wow this is prefection in a container.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff! I got it for the winter because my Olay everyday just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I have combination skin, but it does get pretty dry in the winter. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and it does seem to keep the moisture in my skin. Use it right after you get out of the shower to really get the best use. I&#x27;d say try it if you need a heavier cream!</li>
            <li> great stuff and pretty cheap. Been using it exclusively as a foot cream for years. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy. I apply it liberally after shower and then put my socks right on. Works great on rough dry and cracked skin on feet, knees and elbows. Give it a couple of weeks to see the results.</li>
            <li> OMG! this is a such wasted money!</li>
            <li> Great product and affordable. Planning to buy more in the future. I would recommend others to purchase this product. I personally loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Avon puts in their moisturizers, but the lotions seem to REALLY hydrate dry skin. This one is great for day wear, under makeup, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> One of the best products for dry skin I&#x27;ve used, will continue to order in the future. Glad to see it available here</li>
            <li> This is a great product as I have been using it now for 15 plus years. I like it so well that I usually purchase 12 jars at a time and keep it in the refrig so that I will never be without. I use it for entire body including my face which I apply twice daily as I hydrate my skin. It works.</li>
            <li> OK, so the package looks a little generic and uninspiring. (Perception is everything; they should hire an artist to redesign it). The cream inside is the best I have found for extra dry skin. I live in the mountains at over 7,000 feet. Need I say more? Actually I WILL say more. I don&#x27;t ski or stay out in the snow, but between the cold and then overheated stores, my (over 60) face and hands really get dried out fast. I use this at night and in the day too. No one wears much makeup up here in the winter, but I did try it as a smooth makeup base and it really made my foundation glide on.  At first I was concerned that it was heavy and greasy and would sit on my face, but it disappeared fast as my skin drank it up. Also use it on arms and legs and although it is a bit sticky at first, that goes away fast and all you have is satiny soft skin. I keep a tube of the hand cream in several rooms of the house too!</li>
            <li> Best product for healing chapped hands!</li>
            <li> I work in not skin friendly environment. I have been using different brand with not that good affect on my skin. Great product within two days my skin hand is again nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried lots of hand creams. Most sting and burn and I have to end up washing them off. I absolutely can&#x27;t do fragranced lotions if my hands are at all sore. This doesn&#x27;t have fragrance which is a sign of a good, healing hand cream. We moved this past weekend and cardboard boxes suck the moisture right out of my hands. I was left with an itchy rash on my hands and patches of dry skin and they itched horribly. I went back to my old hand cream but it wasn&#x27;t working like it usually does(and it is good stuff too). I read reviews on this and after trying it I have to say it seems to be working. It doesn&#x27;t burn when put on and I like how it sinks in. It is lighter than I&#x27;m used to...I usually used that super greasy, lard-like stuff. Even though it is lighter is seems to stay on pretty well although I did reapply all day. Today is day two and I can definitely see an improvement in my rashy hands and they just feel and look better too. Plus they don&#x27;t have that greasy, slick feeling my old go to cream had. It&#x27;s a steal at this price for something that works. I&#x27;m going to recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> my hands have a kind of very sensitive skin. Every other cream that I tried will result in little red patches if I use them often. But not this one. It is not oily at all, and I apply it several times a day</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, no fragrance added, works well. I have sensitive skin, and no breakouts from this product. Only take a little bit, so lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This lotion was mild enough that it hasn&#x27;t caused any flare-ups whatsoever.  It is a no-nonsense lotion.  My only concern is the list of ingredients. Parabens and preservatives, etc.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer for my really dry skin</li>
            <li> I was actually looking for the Avon intensive cream that normally comes in a tube. I ended up deciding to try this because of the rave reviews. I thought it would be better than what I usually use. It is not better, and actually maybe not quite as good, but it&#x27;s good enough. I wish it was thicker, but it works. It certainly does make my hands feel moisturized. :)</li>
