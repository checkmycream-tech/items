            <li>Very nice, easy to wear.</li>
            <li>and I thought a headpiece would be nice.  </li>
            <li>But definitely a gorgeous piece :)</li>
            <li>Super happy with my choice.</li>
            <li>It is very nice and looked perfect with her other pearl accessories.  </li>
            <li>i love this product it goes with a pair of jeans or a nice dress.</li>
            <li>but this was very comfortable</li>
            <li>VERY cheap metal</li>
            <li>My daughter has worn it many times and it has held up well.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s simpler design and headband shape more than the fancier tiaras.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I really love these hair pieces.</li>
            <li>The pearls are a great touch too, it&#x27;s not over the top and very classy.  </li>
            <li>I wore this for my wedding and it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>The metal headband conforms easily to fit your head just right, which is awesome because some metal headbands poke or pinch and are a real headache.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it cheap, and in fact perfect for something simple accent for a wedding (and as a bride, I prefer this)</li>
            <li>I was able to adjust the headband to fit my head better.</li>
            <li>This was the best price for a single strand tiara with stones and pearls.</li>
            <li>I love how they are adjustable to fit the shape of your head.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it, looked great, and has found a way to use this piece in less formal ways as well.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the other option of paying $100+ for a headpiece, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>beautiful - very classy wore to a wedding got many compliments heirloom quality , dainty not too flashy fits nicely</li>
            <li>However, this is the first bridal headband that I have held, so maybe they are all very easily bendable.  </li>
            <li>It is quite flexible so it can fit any head size.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really cheap</li>
            <li>other than that it was just great  :)</li>
            <li>I got this headband in yesterday for my wedding and was so excited.  </li>
            <li>fit well and also matched my headband :) very sparkly and fit.</li>
            <li>Was lookin for a simple yet classy tiara, and this fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it, Flimsy and broke right away!</li>
            <li>The actual detail parts (the leaves &amp; pearls)are much sturdier and are really beautiful and not gaudy or tacky.  </li>
            <li>It looks better than the pictures really show.</li>
            <li>It did take a bit of fiddling to get it to fit my head right, so I would suggest trying out your hair style in advance.</li>
            <li>It is simple and elegant with just enough bling and pearls to make it look beautiful.</li>
            <li>The metal is a bit soft but the design to the top is sturdy and does not look cheap.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the look and quality of this headband.</li>
            <li>very pretty was beatiful for m wedding</li>
            <li>It is so pretty!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very elegant and pretty, however most of the little pearls fell off</li>
            <li>The headband itself is of good quality and heavier than what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It was worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>It is a very simple and elegant design and can be &#x27;bended&#x27; to fit the shape of your head.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something simple and classic and it looked good in the pictures.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable in comparison to what I found in bridal shops.  </li>
            <li>And you definitely can&#x27;t beat it for the price, it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all!</li>
            <li>This goes with so much!  </li>
            <li>It is so pretty</li>
            <li>Produce exactly as listed.</li>
            <li>It was really pretty.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This piece is simple, yet elegant, with a just right amount of sparkle without being too flashy and all at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Only giving 4 stars because it seems like it could easily break.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty substantial piece, well made and decently put together.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for something more simple than a tiara, yet just as elegant, and I can&#x27;t believe I found what I have been searching for on Amazon for such a ridiculously low price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Very happpy with this purchase and can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li>I got these for my bridesmaids and a necklace that matches this really well.</li>
            <li>This piece was packaged very well with regard given to</li>
            <li>However, the metal is very soft and shapes easily to fit and doesn&#x27;t press at all like traditional plastic hairbands.  </li>
            <li>Also, the pearl beads are true white, not cream or ivory.   </li>
            <li>It is very pretty and doesn&#x27;t look like I only paid $12 for it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail yesterday and it is a little cheap -- but what do you expect for eight bucks!?  </li>
            <li>so I tried to bend it a little, it was able to bend with no problem.  </li>
            <li>The crystal sparklies are clear and the silver really shines well.</li>
            <li>It is pliable enough to mold to my head so it fits just right</li>
            <li>The headband part is very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married next year</li>
            <li>It is pretty, but it does not want to stay in the middle of your neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually looks more expensive than it cost, I love it.</li>
            <li>I think if you are looking for something simple and pretty</li>
            <li>Obviously if you adjust them too much they feel like they would break.</li>
            <li>This is going to be just right for my low key wedding.</li>
            <li>A little super glue fixed it</li>
            <li>be super careful when you open package.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to buy it at first, but then I thought, \\&quot;If</li>
            <li>It was a little fragile, be careful when you bend it to fit your head.</li>
            <li>The band is pretty, however, not strong enough to keep the hair on place.</li>

            <li> Two of the pearls were loose in the bag upon delivery though, so I will have to glue those back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very dramtic or fancy and it&#x27;s not very big.</li>
            <li> and I wore it all night long.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I did have a single missing pearl on one end, but I have extras from another project</li>
            <li> Just be careful with it.  </li>
            <li> even though i was using EXTREME CAUTION when opening, one of the pearls fell off.</li>
            <li> I inspected it when it arrived as some other reviews said the pearls fell off in shipping</li>
            <li> The headpiece was a little wide</li>
            <li> It does seem very fragile and delicate.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; long in headbands</li>
            <li> It was not too big to compete with the bridal tiara, but not too small that it did not show a bit of bling in the pics!  </li>
            <li> stay in place and my granddaughter was so excited about it, until she tried to wear it and then was sooooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will be wearing this headband at my wedding (in less than a month!).  </li>
            <li> on- a seemingly common occurrence based on the few reviews I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
            <li> this came to me with half the pearls broken off, and no way to glue them on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s delicate nature.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll do a trial run and if it&#x27;s not good, I won&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> A pearl was missing and the headband itself was misshapen to the point that it was uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so delicate!</li>
            <li> I cant find the pearl (sigh) which means ill have to pull one off another piece of costume jewelry or something and glue it on.</li>
            <li> Although I do feel like a princess in my wedding dress, I did not want a grandiose, over-the-top tiara.</li>
            <li> so I had to re-stick them with crazy glue.</li>
            <li> And, it gave me a horrible rash.</li>

            <li> I wore this for my wedding and it worked pretty good. I was looking for something simple and classic and it looked good in the pictures.

The headband itself is of good quality and heavier than what I expected.  It is pliable enough to mold to my head so it fits just right and the ends will be tucked into my hair.  Two of the pearls were loose in the bag upon delivery though, so I will have to glue those back on- a seemingly common occurrence based on the few reviews I&#x27;ve read.  Overall, I am very pleased with the look and quality of this headband.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty substantial piece, well made and decently put together.  My daughter has worn it many times and it has held up well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on wearing this for my wedding and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect! I love it&#x27;s simpler design and headband shape more than the fancier tiaras. The crystal sparklies are clear and the silver really shines well. It looks better than the pictures really show. And you definitely can&#x27;t beat it for the price, it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all! The pearls are a great touch too, it&#x27;s not over the top and very classy.  The metal headband conforms easily to fit your head just right, which is awesome because some metal headbands poke or pinch and are a real headache. So you can wear it as a headband or angled like a tiara. My only concern is that it may break if taken on and off repeatedly. But that&#x27;s not a big deal for me since I only plan on wearing it one day  Also, the pearl beads are true white, not cream or ivory.   It looks amazing on! I can&#x27;t wait to wear it!</li>
            <li> very cute- very dainty will be perfect for my daughters spring formal dance. be super careful when you open package. even though i was using EXTREME CAUTION when opening, one of the pearls fell off. hey- it happens. I cant find the pearl (sigh) which means ill have to pull one off another piece of costume jewelry or something and glue it on.</li>
            <li> very pretty was beatiful for m wedding, only downside was the ends dug into my head all evening. other than that it was just great  :)</li>
            <li> My daughter use this headband for my weeding ceremony. The band is pretty, however, not strong enough to keep the hair on place. It&#x27;s very thing. I would rather buy another one.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my Wife to wear at the Plumbers Ball , yes I said Plumbers Ball , she looked beautiful with it in her hair and she and I loved it , very nice for the price.</li>
            <li> This goes with so much!  I wear it like a head band to work or out with friends. It is so pretty!</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear for my wedding. It is so pretty and I love it. Only giving 4 stars because it seems like it could easily break. The headband part is very soft.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with another piece for a 1920s themed engagement party, it looked awsome.  It did take a bit of fiddling to get it to fit my head right, so I would suggest trying out your hair style in advance.</li>
            <li> This headband is beautiful and well made. I inspected it when it arrived as some other reviews said the pearls fell off in shipping, I didn&#x27;t have this problem, it arrived perfect. I ordered it for my wedding but I didn&#x27;t end up using it because of my veil choice. My mom was going to make my veil so I got this headband thinking she could attach the veil to it but I ended up buying one with a comb attachment. Now I hope I can find an event to wear it to because it&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li> This was the best price for a single strand tiara with stones and pearls. I don&#x27;t find it cheap, and in fact perfect for something simple accent for a wedding (and as a bride, I prefer this)</li>
            <li> Headband is beautiful.  Thanks for fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Although I do feel like a princess in my wedding dress, I did not want a grandiose, over-the-top tiara. This one is perfect. It is simple and elegant with just enough bling and pearls to make it look beautiful. It is quite flexible so it can fit any head size. The only downside is that I did have a single missing pearl on one end, but I have extras from another project so I will glue one back in. If that doesn&#x27;t work I will cover it with hair since its on the end. Either way it&#x27;ll look good and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married next year and I thought a headpiece would be nice.  I went to google and did a search, this popped up!  I was a little hesitant to buy it at first, but then I thought, \\&quot;If I buy it and it&#x27;s really cheap, I&#x27;ll return it!\\&quot;  It came in the mail yesterday and it is a little cheap -- but what do you expect for eight bucks!?  The headpiece was a little wide so I tried to bend it a little, it was able to bend with no problem.  Just be careful with it.  It&#x27;s not the most sturdiest of headpieces, but again, what do you expect for eight bucks?!   I recommend it though for some low key event.  I&#x27;m still undecided on how I feel about wearing it for my wedding.  We&#x27;ll do a trial run and if it&#x27;s not good, I won&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> It is pretty, but it does not want to stay in the middle of your neck. And, it gave me a horrible rash.</li>
            <li> beautiful - very classy wore to a wedding got many compliments heirloom quality , dainty not too flashy fits nicely</li>
            <li> i love this product it goes with a pair of jeans or a nice dress. its great also because it fits to your head so its not squishing your head and causing pain.</li>
            <li> Was lookin for a simple yet classy tiara, and this fits perfectly. The metal is a bit soft but the design to the top is sturdy and does not look cheap. It&#x27;s actually looks more expensive than it cost, I love it. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it next month. Delivery was excellent and packaging was fine. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Wore it for my wedding. Beautiful but broke when I took it out of my hair. It was worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I just received this for my upcoming wedding.  It is very pretty and doesn&#x27;t look like I only paid $12 for it.  It does seem very fragile and delicate.  However, this is the first bridal headband that I have held, so maybe they are all very easily bendable.  Compared to the other option of paying $100+ for a headpiece, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous but didnt go with my dress as i had no pearls or accesories with pearls to accompany this. But definitely a gorgeous piece :)</li>
            <li> I got this headband in yesterday for my wedding and was so excited.  It is a very simple and elegant design and can be &#x27;bended&#x27; to fit the shape of your head.  So happy that I tried this out instead of paying $100 at a bridal store for one.  Very happpy with this purchase and can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li> Produce exactly as listed. It was really pretty. I was able to adjust the headband to fit my head better. I got several compliments on it.</li>
            <li> this was perfect , for my dress,veil and shoes , to wear on my wedding, day&lt;br /&gt;I loved it , I will tell others about it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, Flimsy and broke right away! Wouldn&#x27;t ever buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stay in place and my granddaughter was so excited about it, until she tried to wear it and then was sooooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought one for each of my bridesmaids and it was the perfect touch.  It was not too big to compete with the bridal tiara, but not too small that it did not show a bit of bling in the pics!  Super happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this headband with some trepidation because hairbands inevitably give me headaches.  However, the metal is very soft and shapes easily to fit and doesn&#x27;t press at all like traditional plastic hairbands.  The actual detail parts (the leaves &amp; pearls)are much sturdier and are really beautiful and not gaudy or tacky.  This is going to be just right for my low key wedding.</li>
            <li> I really love these hair pieces. I love how they are adjustable to fit the shape of your head. Obviously if you adjust them too much they feel like they would break. I got these for my bridesmaids and a necklace that matches this really well. I think if you are looking for something simple and pretty this is a really great item. It&#x27;s not very dramtic or fancy and it&#x27;s not very big. But it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Was perfect for my flower girl! fit well and also matched my headband :) very sparkly and fit. Was perfect for my fun country wedding.</li>
            <li> this came to me with half the pearls broken off, and no way to glue them on. I returned it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very elegant and pretty, however most of the little pearls fell off so I had to re-stick them with crazy glue.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Very nice, easy to wear. I don&#x27;t usually &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; long in headbands but this was very comfortable and I wore it all night long. It was a little fragile, be careful when you bend it to fit your head.</li>
            <li> A pearl was missing and the headband itself was misshapen to the point that it was uncomfortable to wear. I&#x27;m returning it ASAP!</li>
            <li> VERY cheap metal, my daughter bent it out of shape in the 1st 10 minutes of wearing it.</li>
            <li> This piece was packaged very well with regard given to it&#x27;s delicate nature.  I bought this for my daughter to wear in a wedding for which she was a flower girl.  It is very nice and looked perfect with her other pearl accessories.  The price is very reasonable in comparison to what I found in bridal shops.  The bridal shops had a lot of gaudy looking stuff that was way overpriced.  This piece is simple, yet elegant, with a just right amount of sparkle without being too flashy and all at a great price.  My daughter loved it, looked great, and has found a way to use this piece in less formal ways as well.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
