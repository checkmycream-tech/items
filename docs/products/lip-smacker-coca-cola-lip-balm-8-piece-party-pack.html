            <li>Great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter loved guessing the flavors.</li>
            <li>She loved the gift.</li>
            <li>I loved these as a kid</li>
            <li>i like it, excellent products, cost very low, very good quality, i used it all the time in every where</li>
            <li>Love Lip Smackers!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a good buy, they are a nice variety of flavors, and they are a good way to put a smile on a chastick lovers face.</li>
            <li>Good product and the price was right!  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Even better than eos....</li>
            <li>My grand son love these</li>
            <li>love them.</li>
            <li>She also likes having these at her job, because people think she is cute for having them at her</li>
            <li>Love the itrem.</li>
            <li>These lip glosses are good because you get the taste of your favorite soft drinks.</li>
            <li>They smell, feel and taste like cheap grade vaseline!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>So I would purchase these more for fun than for practical use.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Awesome!&amp;#34; Admittedly i tried them too and flashes of childhood were worth the money!</li>
            <li>the taste is as same as the drinks and feels so good on the lips.</li>
            <li>All smell good and go on without the gritty feel.</li>
            <li>the balms all smell very good,and get your lips nice and soft.</li>
            <li>According to her (which she is a chapstick professional) these are just as good as regular chapsticks.</li>
            <li>The root beer taste funny and the coke is wierd as a lip gloss.</li>
            <li>they look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>So is the real deal worth it?</li>
            <li>Depends on how much you wanna pay for nostalgia.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other lip products.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for a young lady who spends much of her time sailing on the Chesapeake Bay.  </li>
            <li>This set is good although not great.</li>
            <li>But okay, the goal are the balm tubes - the composition is not as in the picture, and having used it i have a very strong impression these are fake - nothing like the lip smacker balms i had before!</li>
            <li>To be honest, the package despite having a label &#x27;new&#x27; looked like it came from a second hand store after being on display for a few months.</li>
            <li>Every year i try to get her something fun and kind of silly for christmas to put in her stocking.</li>
            <li>This is a cute idea, but let&#x27;s NOT encourage the world to drink Coca-cola since we KNOW it&#x27;s not a healthy drink.  </li>
            <li>Is soft on lips as well.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this is a novel idea---as long as it&#x27;s not filled with sugar which creates even more diabetes in our country.</li>
            <li>Small item, big fun!!</li>
            <li>I liked the different flavors but this item was a bit expensive for it being chapstick.</li>
            <li>I really wanted these for the kid&#x27;s stocking stuffers, but in hindsight the kids couldn&#x27;t have cared less</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great for kids stocking</li>
            <li> To be honest, the package despite having a label &#x27;new&#x27; looked like it came from a second hand store after being on display for a few months. But okay, the goal are the balm tubes - the composition is not as in the picture, and having used it i have a very strong impression these are fake - nothing like the lip smacker balms i had before! They smell, feel and taste like cheap grade vaseline!&lt;br /&gt;If you can avoid these!!!!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved guessing the flavors. Small item, big fun!!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have the flavour I thought they would have. They smell like the proudct but no flavour and feel greasey to me too.</li>
            <li> This set is good although not great. The root beer taste funny and the coke is wierd as a lip gloss. LOl the one i like is dr. Pepper it was a very good idea though!!</li>
            <li> this is best thing i have ever used its awesome, really good and amazing. i love it. i would recommend it too people all over the world</li>
            <li> Excellent lip mosturizer...the taste is as same as the drinks and feels so good on the lips. Even better than eos....oops!!!!</li>
            <li> Love Lip Smackers! Shipped on time and correctly!</li>
            <li> My grand son love these</li>
            <li> same as in the picture!</li>
            <li> Smells just like the soda.  Is soft on lips as well.  Need to get Dr. Pepper if they have it.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a young lady who spends much of her time sailing on the Chesapeake Bay.  She loved the gift.</li>
            <li> I liked the different flavors but this item was a bit expensive for it being chapstick. However I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> the balms all smell very good,and get your lips nice and soft. love them. they look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. There are a number of different pop/soda flavored chap-sticks. They smell and taste great. One thing I would say is that they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as regular lip balms, e.g. Burt&#x27;s Bees. So I would purchase these more for fun than for practical use.</li>
            <li> Kids loved it! &amp;#34;Awesome!&amp;#34; Admittedly i tried them too and flashes of childhood were worth the money!</li>
            <li> Good product and the price was right!  I have tried many other lip products.  I stopped trying and stick with my &amp;#34;old faithful!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lip balm.  Perfect amount so your child can spread them out around the house and school.  They can also go to school and share with their friends.</li>
            <li> These lip glosses are good because you get the taste of your favorite soft drinks.My daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I loved these as a kid but I didn&#x27;t expect them to be $25!  I really wanted these for the kid&#x27;s stocking stuffers, but in hindsight the kids couldn&#x27;t have cared less how close these smell and taste like their respective soda flavors. So is the real deal worth it? Depends on how much you wanna pay for nostalgia.</li>
            <li> I like all the different flavors of lip baum.  It keeps things from getting boring and makes it nice to press my lips together.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is certified chapstick addict. Every year i try to get her something fun and kind of silly for christmas to put in her stocking. These always do the trick. Even though we are in our 30&#x27;s its kind of teenagersish, but who cares!!! According to her (which she is a chapstick professional) these are just as good as regular chapsticks. She also likes having these at her job, because people think she is cute for having them at her desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a good buy, they are a nice variety of flavors, and they are a good way to put a smile on a chastick lovers face.</li>
            <li> Love these! All smell good and go on without the gritty feel. Lip Smackers are the best!</li>
            <li> This is a cute idea, but let&#x27;s NOT encourage the world to drink Coca-cola since we KNOW it&#x27;s not a healthy drink.  Nevertheless, this is a novel idea---as long as it&#x27;s not filled with sugar which creates even more diabetes in our country.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips taste all flavor-y</li>
            <li> i like it, excellent products, cost very low, very good quality, i used it all the time in every where</li>
            <li> If you want a tasty experience on your lips ,this is for you!</li>
            <li> kissing guys or women is always sweeter with taste</li>
            <li> Love the itrem. Yummy flavors.</li>
