            <li>Best Pure Melissa Oil.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product but not as strong as one</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also purchased from Mountain Rose the lemon balm (another name for Melissa) herb for teas and am enjoying it, as well.</li>
            <li>This smells great and has very nice pleasant uplifting effects apparent right off.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil and the BoiSource Products.  </li>
            <li>(Makes me wonder if scrubbing my floors more often would help my mood?</li>
            <li>is my diffuser almost every afternoon for a lovely pick me up.  </li>
            <li>and I love the bottle..no drips.</li>
            <li>I use mostly for mood lifting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, customer service was excellent and issued an immediate and total refund.</li>
            <li>It is strong, but I am enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with and impressed with the quality, affordable value, and effectiveness of this Melissa pure essential oil.</li>
            <li>this is a real bliss oils would be good for depression sorrow and calming anxiety or just because it makes you feel so serene and peaceful.</li>
            <li>I would highly encourage people to use this product and save some money, it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>also known as lemon balm, it has a pleasant, gentle scent that is good for anxiety and a number of other things.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure this company dilutes its oils...</li>
            <li>significantly...</li>
            <li>but no cold sore appeared even after the tingle and itchy feelings came and went.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I love the rich, calming aroma of this essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered many of the different essential oils and am very pleased and will continue to order.</li>
            <li>Try it ans see for yourself just how incredibly helpful this small investment really is.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and the product was packaged carefully and I was very pleased with my oil ❤️</li>
            <li>This smells very much like my lemongrass from DoTerra.  </li>
            <li>I saw on Dr. Oz that using this when you feel the first sign of a fever blister/cold sore coming on would stop it in it&#x27;s tracks.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be a tart citrus smell, but it smells exactly like lemon pine-sol.</li>
            <li>I bought some at my local health store and I like it much better.</li>
            <li>The lemony smell is quite strong, a bit overpowering for a short time, but it subsides.</li>
            <li>Very high quality</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Hope to use more biosource essential oils in the future.  </li>
            <li>I like using fractionated coconut oil (MCT oil)  as my main carrier oil instead of the almond oil recommended on the label.</li>
            <li>I guess old time remedies really do work.  </li>
            <li>Not hard to do.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I have tried 3 different brands and this one is the only one that came true to aroma and flavor of Melissa.  </li>
            <li>I loved this oil and this company until I had 2 batches of lotion bars fail with these oils (tried and true recipe using other oils)...</li>
            <li>And due to the quality of this oil, I will most likely purchase other oils from this company.</li>
            <li>I think the more expensive one that I buy from my local herbalist is stronger, but not by that much, maybe 20%, however it does give faster results in battling skin infection.</li>
            <li>Plans for making a lip balm or salve are in the near future.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Plans for making a lip balm or salve are in the near future.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to try anything since I have been plagued with them since I was a small child.</li>
            <li> Other people have said to take L-lysine (spelling?), but I prefer to go topical, rather than internal, on issues that I perceive to be topical.</li>
            <li> I understand that the two have similar aromas, but the contents smell uncannily of lemongrass, which leads me to believe it may contain other essential oils, but that&#x27;s obviously not as concerning as synthetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this EO for awhile, but held off due to price.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for cold sores to see if it is true that it will help them go away and/or reduce breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased different brand in the past from Australia.</li>
            <li> This product, or the bottle I received at least, left bubbles and an oily residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Thought it odd that the label doesn&#x27;t have any reference to lemon-balm, not in name or description. ?</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any calming effect yet, but I&#x27;ll give it a little longer.</li>
            <li> This definitely worked to stop the progress of my cold sore.</li>
            <li> but when you lick your lips not good.</li>
            <li> I have had one sore that was farther up in my nose that I was afraid to put the oil on and it did develop into a cold sore.  </li>
            <li> I use this on cold sores.</li>
            <li> This is something I put on my lips to help heal cold sores and  I didn&#x27;t like the smell or taste.</li>
            <li> and it does work for cold sores .</li>

            <li> also known as lemon balm, it has a pleasant, gentle scent that is good for anxiety and a number of other things.</li>
            <li> I saw on Dr. Oz that using this when you feel the first sign of a fever blister/cold sore coming on would stop it in it&#x27;s tracks.  I was ready to try anything since I have been plagued with them since I was a small child. I tried it and I could not believe it but no cold sore appeared even after the tingle and itchy feelings came and went.  This has happened several times and I have applied the oil to the lip or affected area and no blisters ever broke out.  I have had one sore that was farther up in my nose that I was afraid to put the oil on and it did develop into a cold sore.  I guess old time remedies really do work.  Kay Donley</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it on my face (jaw line) for my hormonal acne and it really works. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love this oil and the BoiSource Products.  I have ordered many of the different essential oils and am very pleased and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted that this product works very effectively. I think the more expensive one that I buy from my local herbalist is stronger, but not by that much, maybe 20%, however it does give faster results in battling skin infection. The lemony smell is quite strong, a bit overpowering for a short time, but it subsides. I like to use perfume or another essential oil to mask it. Not hard to do. I would highly encourage people to use this product and save some money, it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a tart citrus smell, but it smells exactly like lemon pine-sol. (Makes me wonder if scrubbing my floors more often would help my mood? A thought...) Haven&#x27;t noticed any calming effect yet, but I&#x27;ll give it a little longer. Thought it odd that the label doesn&#x27;t have any reference to lemon-balm, not in name or description. ?</li>
            <li> great love it thanks---pt</li>
            <li> this is a real bliss oils would be good for depression sorrow and calming anxiety or just because it makes you feel so serene and peaceful.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I&#x27;ve been wanting this EO for awhile, but held off due to price.  This Bio Source Naturals brand was a good price, so I snagged one.  Plans for making a lip balm or salve are in the near future.  The smell of this EO blew me away.  Its the best lemony smell I&#x27;ve ever experienced, even over Lemongrass and lemon EOs.  I&#x27;ve also purchased from Mountain Rose the lemon balm (another name for Melissa) herb for teas and am enjoying it, as well.</li>

            <li> I bought this for cold sores to see if it is true that it will help them go away and/or reduce breakouts.  Since I bought it, I haven&#x27;t had one!</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 different brands and this one is the only one that came true to aroma and flavor of Melissa.  I dilute it 1 part Essential oil to 4 parts grain alcohol and put it in a dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> This definitely worked to stop the progress of my cold sore. I saw this on Dr. Oz and it definitely worked.</li>
            <li> This smells very much like my lemongrass from DoTerra.  It is strong, but I am enjoying it.  I use mostly for mood lifting.</li>
            <li> I use this on cold sores. I think it stops them in their tracks! Other people have said to take L-lysine (spelling?), but I prefer to go topical, rather than internal, on issues that I perceive to be topical. Try it!</li>
            <li> This product, or the bottle I received at least, left bubbles and an oily residue on my skin.  It also did not evaporate from paper so I suspect it contains fillers.  I understand that the two have similar aromas, but the contents smell uncannily of lemongrass, which leads me to believe it may contain other essential oils, but that&#x27;s obviously not as concerning as synthetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, customer service was excellent and issued an immediate and total refund.</li>
            <li> Love it! This, applied topically, is great for stress and zoster relief. Smells wonderful. What do you have to lose? Try it ans see for yourself just how incredibly helpful this small investment really is.</li>
            <li> Great product and size for the price.  Hope to use more biosource essential oils in the future.  Life is good.</li>
            <li> I love the rich, calming aroma of this essential oil.  I will definitely purchase again when the bottle is used up.  And due to the quality of this oil, I will most likely purchase other oils from this company.</li>
            <li> This is something I put on my lips to help heal cold sores and  I didn&#x27;t like the smell or taste. I no not to eat or drink it but when you lick your lips not good. I bought some at my local health store and I like it much better. and it does work for cold sores .</li>
            <li> Very nice product but not as strong as one I had purchased different brand in the past from Australia. Thank you</li>
            <li> I loved this oil and this company until I had 2 batches of lotion bars fail with these oils (tried and true recipe using other oils)... I am pretty sure this company dilutes its oils... significantly...</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it does not feel like fake essential oil. Arrived on time and the product was packaged carefully and I was very pleased with my oil ❤️</li>
            <li> This smells great and has very nice pleasant uplifting effects apparent right off.  It muscle tests very good of course.  I dilute it as the label says - 1:4 with a carrier oil.  I like using fractionated coconut oil (MCT oil)  as my main carrier oil instead of the almond oil recommended on the label.</li>
            <li> Best Pure Melissa Oil.  If you want a good one, this is the one that you can trust.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with and impressed with the quality, affordable value, and effectiveness of this Melissa pure essential oil.</li>
