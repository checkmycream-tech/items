            <li>I have been using Nivea For Men aftershave lotion for quite a while with great results.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my head nice and shiny!</li>
            <li>But feels good on the head.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and a great purchase on Amazon with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I used to cut my head bald, and no one said a word, but when started use head lube my wife liked it and the rest is history.  </li>
            <li>Honestly since deciding to go bald.</li>
            <li>Nice shine, no smell, not greasy and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Very good potion for all who love a very close shave and a waxed-like finish.</li>
            <li>He ran out of this a while ago and didn&#x27;t ask me to buy more till now, so when he used it again for the first time he waxed poetic about how awesome it feels.  </li>
            <li>I assume it will do as it says.the recipient will let me know I am sure.</li>
            <li>Yes, I love it</li>
            <li>&quot;  :)</li>
            <li>Seems to provide better lubrication than most which makes the job quicker.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Headlube shave cream for years and love it, so I decided to give this moisture lotion a try.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was also very quick.</li>
            <li>Not to be taken lightly.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s caused great itching following a shave.</li>
            <li>Have used a few and this one seems to be best with my Panasonic electric.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It provides the right amount of moisture and gloss to keep ur scalp healthy and shining</li>
            <li>Found a bottle of this once in a local Amazon liquidator and loved it.  </li>
            <li>This Headlube product does a better job of moisturizing, but leaves my head greasy for the whole day.</li>
            <li>I shave my head semi-daily and this stuff gives me clear, smooth feeling skin with a polished look that many comment on.  </li>
            <li>My favorite product by far!</li>
            <li>This is soothing to a freshly shaved head and moisturizes to prevent flaking of the scalp.</li>
            <li>Also if you want to shine like a freshly waxed car this will do it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been rare to find it in a store.</li>
            <li>Very Glossy!</li>
            <li>He owned both the matte and glossy at first, and I&#x27;ve heard him describe the glossy as the one he uses when he wants to \\&quot;feel fancy.\\</li>
            <li>fast shipper, will purchase from again.  </li>
            <li>Really works well.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would make my head really shine</li>
            <li>My very fussy husband loves this for his bald head.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who shaves their head to the skin daily like me you need a high quality lotion to keep your scalp protected and this product gives you a nice shiny look and not so much as you will blind someone, just a healthy look.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but a great product.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a deal!</li>
            <li>but after HeadLube my scalp is soft and has a shine to it</li>
            <li>Oh, and one of these bottles lasts him at least six months, probably more.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but that being said, this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>When I viewed the item before ordering, the &#x27;picture&#x27; showed the exact same &#x27;8 once&#x27; bottle as I previously ordered and could not find in the description the amount (ounces), so I assumed I was ordering &#x27;8 ounces&#x27;, but when the 3 bottles ordered were received, they were only &#x27;5&#x27; ounces.  </li>

            <li> Would recommend this to anyone bald man, my dad lost his hair due to chemo and it definately made his head shiny!</li>
            <li> Not this waste of $10 bucks.</li>
            <li> My husband is obsessed with HeadBlade products, especially the lubes and the shave cream.  </li>

            <li> This is soothing to a freshly shaved head and moisturizes to prevent flaking of the scalp. Also if you want to shine like a freshly waxed car this will do it. Very Glossy!</li>
            <li> Love it! fast shipper, will purchase from again.  Would recommend this to anyone bald man, my dad lost his hair due to chemo and it definately made his head shiny!</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the hopes of getting that perfect chrome dome. This product did not do it for me. If you want my recommendation on getting that \\&quot;glossy\\&quot; chrome dome.[[ASIN:B004DBUAGG Vaseline Body Lotion, Cocoa Butter, 32Ounce]] is what you want. Not this waste of $10 bucks.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for those who shave their head.  It gives the head an excellent shine and takes care of bumps and dryness.  It also is great for the hands.</li>
            <li> My scalp is dry when I have hair, started shaving after getting a horseshoe flattop.  &lt;br /&gt;Before finding HeadLube I could feel my scalp but after HeadLube my scalp is soft and has a shine to it</li>
            <li> This is what u need if u are bald&lt;br /&gt;It provides the right amount of moisture and gloss to keep ur scalp healthy and shining</li>
            <li> Keeps my head glossy! Which is the look I want.</li>
            <li> Really works well.  I could suggest using this product to any one that needs it. Not to be taken lightly.</li>

I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone as it exceeds regular lotion meant for other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift. I assume it will do as it says.the recipient will let me know I am sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years now.  It keeps my head moisturized and glossy.  Great product  for a bald dude</li>
            <li> Yes, I love it I use it every time I shave. Also I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Good product and all that, the only downside is that I can&#x27;t use right after shaving, made my poor head itch like crazy.  Granted I have sensitive skin, but that being said, this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s caused great itching following a shave.</li>
            <li> Keeps my head nice and shiny!</li>
            <li> My husband is obsessed with HeadBlade products, especially the lubes and the shave cream.  He ran out of this a while ago and didn&#x27;t ask me to buy more till now, so when he used it again for the first time he waxed poetic about how awesome it feels.  He owned both the matte and glossy at first, and I&#x27;ve heard him describe the glossy as the one he uses when he wants to \\&quot;feel fancy.\\&quot;  :) Oh, and one of these bottles lasts him at least six months, probably more.  It&#x27;s an amazing product and a great purchase on Amazon with free shipping.  The HeadBlade website says they sell it in Walgreens and Rite Aids but it&#x27;s been rare to find it in a store.</li>
            <li> Actually I bouth the matt moisturizer...and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> This is the Absolute must have lotion to add that little look at me shine! My favorite product by far!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years but never thought of looking it up on Amazon.... Wow, what a deal! Delivery was also very quick. If you shave your head, this is the stuff....</li>
            <li> The local Walgreens stopped carrying this and I will never know why. I&#x27;ve been shaving my head to the skin since 2003 and I can not live with out this lotion for my after shave skin care.</li>
            <li> Have used a few and this one seems to be best with my Panasonic electric.  Seems to provide better lubrication than most which makes the job quicker.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome product my bald head is shining bright shave cream is awesome too Ilove the shaver too</li>
            <li> Have ordered this item several times over the years but maybe only once before through Amazon.  When I viewed the item before ordering, the &#x27;picture&#x27; showed the exact same &#x27;8 once&#x27; bottle as I previously ordered and could not find in the description the amount (ounces), so I assumed I was ordering &#x27;8 ounces&#x27;, but when the 3 bottles ordered were received, they were only &#x27;5&#x27; ounces.  This is why I gave this purchase 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Found a bottle of this once in a local Amazon liquidator and loved it.  I shave my head semi-daily and this stuff gives me clear, smooth feeling skin with a polished look that many comment on.  Very good potion for all who love a very close shave and a waxed-like finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting to like being bald.  I used to cut my head bald, and no one said a word, but when started use head lube my wife liked it and the rest is history.  I&#x27;ll recommend to anyone thinking of going bald. Thank you again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Not only is my head shiny, but it feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the nozzle design which wants to squirt the last drop out - usually on my clen shirt.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make my head really shine but it did not. But feels good on the head.  Not really shining like baby oil.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of moisturizing, but leaves my head feeling greasy.  I have been using the Headlube shave cream for years and love it, so I decided to give this moisture lotion a try.  I have been using Nivea For Men aftershave lotion for quite a while with great results.  This Headlube product does a better job of moisturizing, but leaves my head greasy for the whole day. I can rub my hand over my head and it comes away with a sheen on it.  Guess I&#x27;m forgoing the glossy look and going back to the Nivea products.</li>
            <li> Honestly since deciding to go bald. I knew I needed a post shave lotion. So after reading the reviews I gave it a try. As I said in my headline &amp;#34; It&#x27;s lotion for your bald head OKAY! !!</li>
            <li> Its shiny but it smells really strange. I&#x27;ve gone back to using my regular lotion instead and saving this for only when i wanna be seen or whatever that means. ha</li>
            <li> My very fussy husband loves this for his bald head.  Nice shine, no smell, not greasy and lasts all day.  Expensive, but a great product.</li>
            <li> Works just like they say. Shiny head.</li>
