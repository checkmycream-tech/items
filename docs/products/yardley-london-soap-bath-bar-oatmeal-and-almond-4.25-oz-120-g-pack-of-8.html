            <li>This has a very pleasant smell and is a great combination of a gentle exfoliant and moisturizer.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great moisturizing and the fragrance is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Dove is amazing, but it hurts your pockets after a while.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to find I could order it.  </li>
            <li>It makes your bathroom smell nice just sitting on the counter.</li>

            <li>clean, smells great.</li>
            <li>Love the exfoliating texture and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>Yardley Oatmeal and Almond is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>best soap for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It smells really good and will even clean the dirtiest person.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li>My favorite soap on earth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of many bar soaps because the soap tends to stick to my skin, but this doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I may start buying this more than the Dove soap.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the soap.</li>
            <li>looking forward to purchasing more....</li>
            <li>Love this soap and the price was outstanding.</li>
            <li>Good, mostly natural soap, light scent and a great price.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of almond.</li>
            <li>my husband&#x27;s favorite soap.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells lovely--sweet and scrumptious--but also a very clean smell</li>
            <li>The lather &amp; longevity of the bar is pretty good.</li>
            <li>but it does look pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this fine soap1</li>
            <li>it is all natural and I feel great after showering with it -</li>
            <li>This soap is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My face looks magnificent - well, not really</li>
            <li>The soap is great for sensitive skin, has a lovely smell, and is lightly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>After trying it out for the first time, I fell in love!  </li>
            <li>the scent is a bit strong</li>
            <li>I have used oatmeal soap before and found it was very good for my skin, even mild enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells fantastic too.</li>
            <li>I follow up with the Neutrogena light sesame oil body lotion.</li>
            <li>I think it is the only soap with the great almond smell.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this a try due to the wonderful reviews, hoping a bar would last a bit longer than the goats milk soap and yet still be good with my skin.</li>
            <li>It slides so smoothly like a glycerin soap, but gets you really clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oatmeal and almond combination does not dry or irritate my skin and is a good economical alternative to more expense oatmeal soaps.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and has a very nice auroma, not too strong.</li>
            <li>The only wish I had from Yardley, would be to have many more scents!</li>
            <li>A favorite of mine, so pleased it was available here, I used to buying at a much higher price and that I really appreciate it....</li>
            <li>great product for dry skin and eczema....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about what I use on my face since I am allergic to a lot of the perfumes and harsher chemicals in most soaps.</li>
            <li>For a more natural soap bar it has a soft but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I always feel super clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Already left a review for the Lemon Verbena, but this one is just as good.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap and it does not melt away fast in the shower.  </li>
            <li>thanks for the quick and prompt service and packaging was outstanding....</li>
            <li>Shipping is quick.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin or those into natural products.</li>
            <li>i would reccomend to anyone who wants a natural good soap.. affordable too.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much and recommend it if you want a light scrubbing</li>
            <li>Love this soap, lasts longer than liquid soap, has a fresh scent and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Mild enough to use on my sensitive skin, and leaves me feeling very refreshing after each use!</li>
            <li>fresh.</li>
            <li>This is soothing and smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that turns into a rash very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great for entire family for daily use.</li>
            <li>Simply the best-smelling soap out there, and the gentle exfoliation is a nice sensation.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of soap so it was only right that I ordered for the price it was listed for.</li>
            <li>First, we switched his toothpaste to an SLS free one, and his frequent canker sores went away, and have stayed away!</li>
            <li>The natural progression at this point was to find a bar soap that was SLS free, and that we both would like.</li>
            <li>stuff is available at a bunch of places near me</li>
            <li>but i love it nonetheless - will definitely keep buying this..</li>
            <li>Oatmeal and Almond is gentle and just right for use on your face.</li>
            <li>My thirty-something asian supermodel gorgeous dermatologist looked me over, stepped back, and said \\&quot;Yup.  </li>
            <li>and I really do like it...</li>
            <li>The price is fairly reasonable too.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me break out and is gently on my skin.</li>
            <li>Next, we changed his dandruff shampoo to an SLS free one, and guess what?</li>
            <li>The price is very competitive as well.</li>
            <li>thanks..</li>
            <li>I have bought so much of this soap, I really don&#x27;t want to buy any others.</li>
            <li>The smell is very soothing and the price extremely reasonable for the quantity.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This soap really does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>The vanilla smells good, the oatmeal is pleasantly rough, the soap is hard and so lasts a long time, the price is good.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely subtle almond scent and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream and this soap have made the problem more or less go away.  </li>
            <li>Mildly scented, leaves no residue and it foams up enough to be used for shaving if the beard is not too rough.&lt;br /&gt;DP</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this soap since it is being advertised as being made with oatmeal and almonds</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soap.  </li>
            <li>As always, your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;d highly recommend you give this a try if dealing with eczema.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As noted by a few other users, this product is great if you have eczema.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap, although it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; a little faster than the others.</li>
            <li>I would much rather use natural soaps made from plant-derived ingredients so I will not be purchasing Yardley again.</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates and I feel old blemishes on my body clearing up</li>
            <li>Thinking maybe it was a coincidence, I decided to just use my normal face wash and use the soap on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this soap for at least 10 years and love that I can buy it in bulk from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not cause any breakouts for my six year old.</li>
            <li>Then come to find out that the main ingredient is actually Sodium Tallowate, which is basically animal fat.</li>
            <li>And by the way, most of the big brand name soaps are made from animal fats as the main ingredient, it&#x27;s usually listed as Sodium Tallowate in the ingredients or sometimes simply as just glycerine.</li>
            <li>Stumbled over this soap in my local dollar tree, not a fan of bar soap and is very sensitive to bar soap but for a dollar I decided what the heck!</li>
            <li>Yardley soaps work very well for dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>After I put my clothes back on, and picked up my deflated ego (huh, old Irish guy indeed), I tried all her recommendations with limited success, and so I kept shopping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it is gentle on my skin which is very dry.  </li>
            <li>We recently discovered my husband is sensitive to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS).</li>
            <li>Old Irish guys get it</li>
            <li>I bought 3 of these yardly London oatmeal and almond bar of soap at Walgreens a few months ago and when I first used this soap after showers it leave your skin soft</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this again and highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I have really dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin nearly as much as some other soaps do</li>

            <li> My thirty-something asian supermodel gorgeous dermatologist looked me over, stepped back, and said \\&quot;Yup.  </li>
            <li> and I really do like it...</li>
            <li> The price is fairly reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out and is gently on my skin.</li>
            <li> Next, we changed his dandruff shampoo to an SLS free one, and guess what?</li>
            <li> The price is very competitive as well.</li>
            <li> thanks..</li>
            <li> I have bought so much of this soap, I really don&#x27;t want to buy any others.</li>
            <li> The smell is very soothing and the price extremely reasonable for the quantity.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This soap really does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> The vanilla smells good, the oatmeal is pleasantly rough, the soap is hard and so lasts a long time, the price is good.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely subtle almond scent and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream and this soap have made the problem more or less go away.  </li>
            <li> Mildly scented, leaves no residue and it foams up enough to be used for shaving if the beard is not too rough.&lt;br /&gt;DP</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this soap since it is being advertised as being made with oatmeal and almonds</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this soap.  </li>
            <li> As always, your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;d highly recommend you give this a try if dealing with eczema.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As noted by a few other users, this product is great if you have eczema.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap, although it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; a little faster than the others.</li>
            <li> I would much rather use natural soaps made from plant-derived ingredients so I will not be purchasing Yardley again.</li>
            <li> It gently exfoliates and I feel old blemishes on my body clearing up</li>
            <li> Thinking maybe it was a coincidence, I decided to just use my normal face wash and use the soap on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for at least 10 years and love that I can buy it in bulk from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not cause any breakouts for my six year old.</li>
            <li> Then come to find out that the main ingredient is actually Sodium Tallowate, which is basically animal fat.</li>
            <li> And by the way, most of the big brand name soaps are made from animal fats as the main ingredient, it&#x27;s usually listed as Sodium Tallowate in the ingredients or sometimes simply as just glycerine.</li>
            <li> Stumbled over this soap in my local dollar tree, not a fan of bar soap and is very sensitive to bar soap but for a dollar I decided what the heck!</li>
            <li> Yardley soaps work very well for dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After I put my clothes back on, and picked up my deflated ego (huh, old Irish guy indeed), I tried all her recommendations with limited success, and so I kept shopping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it is gentle on my skin which is very dry.  </li>
            <li> We recently discovered my husband is sensitive to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS).</li>
            <li> Old Irish guys get it</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these yardly London oatmeal and almond bar of soap at Walgreens a few months ago and when I first used this soap after showers it leave your skin soft</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again and highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin nearly as much as some other soaps do</li>
            <li> It scrubs just the right amount without taking my hide off - if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have previously used goats milk products.</li>
            <li> My go to for years, especially with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get bar soap with oatmeal at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> You could buy at this price, or you could go to a dollar store (I found this and several other Yardley soaps, including lavender, at Dollar Tree) for guess what price.....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but won&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin either.  </li>
            <li> With all due respect, paying more than $1 per bar is crazy.</li>
            <li> recently had another bout of this rash and thought I would try another brand of soap made with less chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Going back to Dove, it&#x27;s about half the cost.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin or cause itching or any other issues for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Frustrated, I thought I would try a new brand of soap that had less chemicals and was frankly, much cheaper!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every other soap imaginable.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that it seems to go liquefy faster than other bars of soap.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the box that the soap comes in is a little crushed but that may be from the shipping.</li>
            <li> No melting down like some cleansing bars.</li>
            <li> The bar lasts a little bit longer than your average bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey here though.</li>
            <li> Treat yourself to a little pampering and buy it.</li>
            <li> The bacteria comes and goes, but rears its disgusting head about every year leaving my face with red, bacteria filled bumps.  </li>
            <li> harsh on your skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely gets you clean.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> and that is year round for me since I&#x27;m always in the woods.</li>
            <li> Literally, after 4 days of use my face was unbelievably clearer and almost void of my embarrassing rash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more itchy scalp, no more dandruff.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the soap you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> An added bonus for me at least is that I use this soap to help relieve itch when I get poison ivy</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about it!</li>
            <li> My neck is broken out, and I have a rash on my leg.</li>
            <li> I think Im obsessed with products that contain almond.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t end up with weird oily skin that you can get using the lotion soap bars.</li>
            <li> Came packaged and nothing broken will buy again!</li>
            <li> So distraught I was going to have this awful look on my face for my wedding, I sought help from a dermatologist.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful soap - have been using for years.  Pleasant fragrance that is not overpowering.  Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I had used this soap before and I really do like it...couldn&#x60;t find it locally so had to order online..</li>
            <li> Its the only soap I use.</li>
            <li> The good news is that Yardley products are paraben-free, SLS-free, and not tested on animals. I had high hopes for this soap since it is being advertised as being made with oatmeal and almonds I assumed that it would be a plant-based soap. Then come to find out that the main ingredient is actually Sodium Tallowate, which is basically animal fat. And by the way, most of the big brand name soaps are made from animal fats as the main ingredient, it&#x27;s usually listed as Sodium Tallowate in the ingredients or sometimes simply as just glycerine. I would much rather use natural soaps made from plant-derived ingredients so I will not be purchasing Yardley again. Kirk&#x27;s Castille and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s are good plant-based soaps if you want to try.</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Good product but started buying at Walmart for 97 cents</li>
            <li> I remember Yardley soap from when I was a kid and this did not disappoint. Has a great lather and nice smell.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome. It&#x27;s great moisturizing and the fragrance is fantastic. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that turns into a rash very quickly.  I have had some soaps that irritate my skin so severely that it creates problems.  Yardley soaps work very well for dry sensitive skin.  It helps rejuvenate skin, re-hydrates skin and helps control the sever cracks and bleeds winter brings.  If your not allergic to nuts I would highly recommend this soap.  The price is fairly reasonable too.</li>
            <li> The best soap money can buy!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out and is gently on my skin.</li>
            <li> For some reason, none of my local stores carry this anymore. I&#x27;m very particular about what I use on my face since I am allergic to a lot of the perfumes and harsher chemicals in most soaps. I can&#x27;t even use olive oil or shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oatmeal and almond combination does not dry or irritate my skin and is a good economical alternative to more expense oatmeal soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for at least 10 years and love that I can buy it in bulk from Amazon.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but won&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin either.  Great fragrance.</li>
            <li> Product as described.&lt;br /&gt;I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this fine soap1</li>
            <li> Love the exfoliating texture and the smell is amazing. I always feel super clean after using it. Shipping is quick. Sometimes the box that the soap comes in is a little crushed but that may be from the shipping.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My favorite soap on earth.  A little pricey here though.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of soap so it was only right that I ordered for the price it was listed for. I paid about 15 bucks for 8 bars. I think Im obsessed with products that contain almond.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have had a continuous and embarrassing bacteria on my face for over 5 years now.  The bacteria comes and goes, but rears its disgusting head about every year leaving my face with red, bacteria filled bumps.  As a matter of fact, I had this 2 weeks before my wedding!  So distraught I was going to have this awful look on my face for my wedding, I sought help from a dermatologist.  After taking samples, even he couldn&#x27;t prescribe topical medications to rid my infection!  Frustrated, I thought I would try a new brand of soap that had less chemicals and was frankly, much cheaper!  Literally, after 4 days of use my face was unbelievably clearer and almost void of my embarrassing rash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had another bout of this rash and thought I would try another brand of soap made with less chemicals.  Even this soap, that was comparable to Yardley, didn&#x27;t treat my issue!  Now, I am STUCK with Yardley soaps and will recommend them to ALL my friends and family!  The only wish I had from Yardley, would be to have many more scents!</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not harsh on your skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely gets you clean.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it seems to go liquefy faster than other bars of soap.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have previously used goats milk products. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try due to the wonderful reviews, hoping a bar would last a bit longer than the goats milk soap and yet still be good with my skin. This has a very pleasant smell and is a great combination of a gentle exfoliant and moisturizer. I will definitely buy this again and highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> I must be the only person who has had an allergic reaction to this soap. I have used oatmeal soap before and found it was very good for my skin, even mild enough to use on my face. I tried to use it on my face and had severe itching of my eyes for the rest of the day. Thinking maybe it was a coincidence, I decided to just use my normal face wash and use the soap on the rest of my body. My neck is broken out, and I have a rash on my leg. I am itching in various places on my body. I can&#x27;t figure out what i am allergic to, The oatmeal in this soap is probably the only &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredient. Going back to Dove, it&#x27;s about half the cost.</li>
            <li> We recently discovered my husband is sensitive to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). First, we switched his toothpaste to an SLS free one, and his frequent canker sores went away, and have stayed away! Next, we changed his dandruff shampoo to an SLS free one, and guess what? No more itchy scalp, no more dandruff. The natural progression at this point was to find a bar soap that was SLS free, and that we both would like. That&#x27;s how I came across Yardley London Oatmeal &amp; Almond. It has a lovely subtle almond scent and clean feeling. I have nothing negative to say about it! Treat yourself to a little pampering and buy it.</li>
            <li> Hard to get bar soap with oatmeal at a reasonable price.  This is one.</li>
            <li> You could buy at this price, or you could go to a dollar store (I found this and several other Yardley soaps, including lavender, at Dollar Tree) for guess what price.....</li>
            <li> Already left a review for the Lemon Verbena, but this one is just as good.  Great for sensitive skin or those into natural products.</li>
            <li> As noted by a few other users, this product is great if you have eczema. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin nearly as much as some other soaps do and you won&#x27;t end up with weird oily skin that you can get using the lotion soap bars. I&#x27;m not a fan of many bar soaps because the soap tends to stick to my skin, but this doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is available at a bunch of places near me so I use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic too.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores so I was thrilled to find I could order it.  The soap is great for sensitive skin, has a lovely smell, and is lightly moisturizing.  The price is very competitive as well.</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time and the product, which I have used for years is great.  Mildly scented, leaves no residue and it foams up enough to be used for shaving if the beard is not too rough.&lt;br /&gt;DP</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap and it does not melt away fast in the shower.  It&#x27;s a household staple.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels &amp; smells !!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Lathers fully and dries solidly when on the shelf in the shower. No melting down like some cleansing bars.</li>
            <li> After being diagnosed with an auto-immune disease, my doctor recommended I switch to Dove. Dove is amazing, but it hurts your pockets after a while. One day I was shopping in CVS and decided to purchase the Oatmeal &amp; Almond soap. The price grabbed my attention and so did the ingredients. After trying it out for the first time, I fell in love!  I may start buying this more than the Dove soap. It gently exfoliates and I feel old blemishes on my body clearing up and I love the smell.My skin is looking better and healthier! I follow up with the Neutrogena light sesame oil body lotion. This will be great for winter :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying it. Great soap.</li>
            <li> I love any kind of skin care product with almond; this is another great find.</li>
            <li> With all due respect, paying more than $1 per bar is crazy. I love the soap. it is all natural and I feel great after showering with it - but it can be purchased at Wal Mart for $1 per bar.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. Great value.</li>
            <li> great product and service</li>
            <li> great product for dry skin and eczema.... the scent is a bit strong but i love it nonetheless - will definitely keep buying this..i wish the lotion version was as great, though</li>
            <li> A favorite of mine, so pleased it was available here, I used to buying at a much higher price and that I really appreciate it.... thanks for the quick and prompt service and packaging was outstanding.... looking forward to purchasing more....thanks..</li>
            <li> Meets all my criteria. The vanilla smells good, the oatmeal is pleasantly rough, the soap is hard and so lasts a long time, the price is good.</li>
            <li> clean, smells great. fresh. no slimy residue.  a great organic product. i would reccomend to anyone who wants a natural good soap.. affordable too.</li>
            <li> Used this soap before and it definitely works. I have eczema and it works wonders on my skin. Came packaged and nothing broken will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this! Been using it for decades. Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and the price was outstanding. Couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and has a very nice auroma, not too strong. Great for entire family for daily use.</li>
            <li> I have bought so much of this soap, I really don&#x27;t want to buy any others. It makes your bathroom smell nice just sitting on the counter. Good buy.</li>
            <li> My go to for years, especially with dry skin.  An added bonus for me at least is that I use this soap to help relieve itch when I get poison ivy and that is year round for me since I&#x27;m always in the woods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I like this soap. It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent. The roughness of the coconut feels exfoliating. The lather &amp; longevity of the bar is pretty good. I had always bought Irish Spring prior to switching. This is my brand now.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap, although it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; a little faster than the others.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is the best soap that I&#x27;ve ever used. It slides so smoothly like a glycerin soap, but gets you really clean. Plus, it smells lovely--sweet and scrumptious--but also a very clean smell</li>
            <li> Good, mostly natural soap, light scent and a great price. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin or cause itching or any other issues for me.</li>
            <li> I only got 7 of the 8 bars I ordered.</li>
            <li> Because it is gentle on my skin which is very dry.  For a more natural soap bar it has a soft but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Yardley London soap is the same now as compared to what I remember as a teen.  Oatmeal and Almond is gentle and just right for use on your face.</li>
            <li> Simply the best-smelling soap out there, and the gentle exfoliation is a nice sensation. The bulk pack was too good to pass up.</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent quality and reasonably priced .  I think it is the only soap with the great almond smell.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for sensitive skin. It does not cause any breakouts for my six year old. The smell is very soothing and the price extremely reasonable for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Stumbled over this soap in my local dollar tree, not a fan of bar soap and is very sensitive to bar soap but for a dollar I decided what the heck! I&#x27;m glad I did because this soap is amazing! Mild enough to use on my sensitive skin, and leaves me feeling very refreshing after each use! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This soap really does the trick for me. It scrubs just the right amount without taking my hide off - if you know what I mean. The almond smell is the clincher for me. I love the smell of almond. My face looks magnificent - well, not really but it does look pretty good. I like this product very much and recommend it if you want a light scrubbing</li>
            <li> I have really dry sensitive skin. This is soothing and smells fresh. I&#x27;m sold and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> My thirty-something asian supermodel gorgeous dermatologist looked me over, stepped back, and said \\&quot;Yup.  Eczema.  Old Irish guys get it all the time.\\&quot;  After I put my clothes back on, and picked up my deflated ego (huh, old Irish guy indeed), I tried all her recommendations with limited success, and so I kept shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream and this soap have made the problem more or less go away.  Once or twice a year I get a localized flare-up that I hit with prescription stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every other soap imaginable.  Aveeno bar soap feels like sandpaper and actually hurts.  Yardley Oatmeal and Almond is the best by far.  As always, your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;d highly recommend you give this a try if dealing with eczema.</li>
            <li> Solid bars that do not melt away in the shower. Good pricing for the quality &amp; quantity.  The smell is nice but not over-powering!</li>
            <li> Tried this soap because my daughter and husband were having skin issues.  Love this soap, lasts longer than liquid soap, has a fresh scent and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s favorite soap.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these yardly London oatmeal and almond bar of soap at Walgreens a few months ago and when I first used this soap after showers it leave your skin soft I highly recommend the soap you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> best soap for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Yardley London Bath Soap is one of the best soaps I have ever used.  The bar lasts a little bit longer than your average bar of soap.  It smells really good and will even clean the dirtiest person.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Good for your skin.</li>
