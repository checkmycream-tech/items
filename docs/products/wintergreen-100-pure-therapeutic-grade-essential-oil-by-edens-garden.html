            <li>Excited to try this one !!!!  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>But the oil itself was not that great of quality/scent.</li>
            <li>The price was great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>Smells like it should and seems like a very nice oil.</li>
            <li>BUT, it is a great oil, it does wonders for my headaches, and it smells like sweet delicious mouth watering candy.</li>
            <li>If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you!</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>People are always commenting on how good I smell</li>
            <li>I still have to learn mor uses of it, but is good</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This oil has done an amazing job of reducing the swelling in my foot and ankle.</li>
            <li>Amazing brand.</li>
            <li>Love this oil, it is so good for pain.  </li>
            <li>However I liked it.</li>
            <li>This wintergreen oil that I got didn&#x27;t smell like any kind of mint that I&#x27;ve ever smelled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came (on the bottle) with more details (CT, expiry, origin, etc.).</li>
            <li>Like I say I liked it but mostly for the good clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, but wears off quickly which seems to be about the time it quits working.</li>
            <li>A must try for some easy and nicely scented aide for those aches and pains.</li>
            <li>Strong smell and nice wrapping</li>
            <li>I absoultley love these EO.</li>
            <li>Am enjoying this oil.</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with EG oils.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best essential oils.  </li>
            <li>so pleased I found Edens Garden.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no 80 dollar bottle of cologne for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I would love to visit thier store someday.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as DoTerra, but way more affordable.</li>
            <li>They said it&#x27;s supposed to be strong and said they have lots of control over quality</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and refreshing at every turn.</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>Love the sent and love that it helps with aches and pains which I have plenty of as I get older.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this and am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I was excited with anticipation for the arrival of this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with all my Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils so far.</li>
            <li>I have a full body massage once a month</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>If you have mild symptoms or only need it rarely, it might be okay.</li>
            <li>The Wintergreen has a lovely tingly feeling, similar to popping a cool mint after eating something coated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to put a little on my heels after a good pediacure.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s funny.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it came with more details on the label, however you can find all that info if you snoop around enough.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that this is the first wintergreen oil I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>High quality, potent essential oil.</li>
            <li>Eden&#x27;s Garden provides cute little packaging and fun ideas for thier products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend !</li>
            <li>They did let me return it, so thanks for that.</li>
            <li>It really opens your sinuses.</li>
            <li>will not require much at all just a drop or two and depending on the purpose and intent.</li>
            <li>I also love using it my coffee, teas, and other beverages.</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>Wintergreen is one of those classic scents.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, I use it as one of several essential oils to rub on back to boost immune system.</li>
            <li>It never gets old.</li>
            <li>The thing that is really good about this brand is that it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li>and it totally did not dissappoint me; the potency I can smell without unscrewing the cap and for me a pure essential oil should grab your nose, this product does with the lid unscrewed.</li>
            <li>I order this from another company and it was twice and much for half the amount.  </li>

            <li> Not only did it moisterize by dry spots, it actually evened out my oily areas.</li>
            <li> I hate to write a negative review, and gave an extra star for customer service, which was great!</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> and I found it lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> The wintergreen oil has soothed and healed the dry patches on my knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> I bought the wintergreen to help with the dry patches but was concerned it would be too oily.</li>
            <li> I went back to the previous product I used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying its bad and if you&#x27;ve used over the counter brands of muscle relief stuff, wintergreen works as well as any of them and smells much better.  </li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> I will be careful in the manner</li>
            <li> rough skin.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used another pretty expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like any wintergreen gum/mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever smelled or anything like any of the other 5 star reviewers said.  </li>
            <li> Smells Horrible and works ok</li>
            <li> Have to reapply several times over a few hours, which is a little annoying, and doesn&#x27;t make it terribly cost effective.</li>
            <li> This pepermint oil brings relief to my sore knees at the end of a hard work day.</li>
            <li> I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with it at all.  </li>
            <li> It stinks so bad</li>
            <li> Having said that, my bottle smelled bad.  </li>
            <li> I emailed and asked seller if it was supposed to smell that way or if it&#x27;s a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> so it can&#x27;t be bad and suggested I buy peppermint oil for a lighter smell.  </li>
            <li> Basically what I got was a base oil with resin in it.  </li>
            <li> I have sever joint pain, I hate taking pills, I rub this on and in a while the pain is gone.  </li>
            <li> CRAZY!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This oil has done an amazing job of reducing the swelling in my foot and ankle. I don&#x27;t understand why but I do know it works!</li>
            <li> Smells Horrible and works ok</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Product as expected.</li>
            <li> Neighbor still uses it.</li>
            <li> Amazing brand. Great product. I absoultley love these EO.</li>
            <li> Actually, I didn&#x27;t buy the Wintergreen. I bought the Frankincense and Myrrh. Basically what I got was a base oil with resin in it.  It ruined my oil bottle I use in my prayer corner.  I was not happy with it at all.  I went back to the previous product I used before.</li>
            <li> In line with expectations</li>
            <li> Am enjoying this oil. Good price.</li>
            <li> Excited to try this one !!!!  I am totally in love with EG oils.  I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I hate to write a negative review, and gave an extra star for customer service, which was great! But the oil itself was not that great of quality/scent. Made me nervous about using in my oil combinations. They did let me return it, so thanks for that.</li>
            <li> This pepermint oil brings relief to my sore knees at the end of a hard work day. I also love using it my coffee, teas, and other beverages. Helps with upset stomach too.</li>
            <li> this oil is one I would not be without.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, it is so good for pain.  I have sever joint pain, I hate taking pills, I rub this on and in a while the pain is gone.  This is one of the best essential oils.  I and so pleased I found Edens Garden.  I ordered it and had it two days, later.  The price was great. I order this from another company and it was twice and much for half the amount.  I will order from them again.</li>
            <li> First of all, I like the smell but as for all the supposed other uses I found this wintergreen like any other brand and I&#x27;ve used another pretty expensive brand.  I&#x27;m not saying its bad and if you&#x27;ve used over the counter brands of muscle relief stuff, wintergreen works as well as any of them and smells much better.  I just wouldn&#x27;t expect, if I were you, some miracle cure for pain.  The thing that is really good about this brand is that it&#x27;s expensive and I found it lasted a long time.  Like I say I liked it but mostly for the good clean smell.  People are always commenting on how good I smell and that&#x27;s funny.  It&#x27;s no 80 dollar bottle of cologne for sure.  trin</li>
            <li> I love the scent. I use it in my face steamer and my bath water. It really opens your sinuses.</li>
            <li> I have a full body massage once a month and my therapist uses wintergreen to help with muscle aches.  I purchased this and am not disappointed.  Love the sent and love that it helps with aches and pains which I have plenty of as I get older.  A must try for some easy and nicely scented aide for those aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I was excited with anticipation for the arrival of this product and it totally did not dissappoint me; the potency I can smell without unscrewing the cap and for me a pure essential oil should grab your nose, this product does with the lid unscrewed. I will be careful in the manner I use this product and I know that it&#x27;s potency will not require much at all just a drop or two and depending on the purpose and intent.</li>
            <li> Moderate therapeutic value. Works for a short period of time. Pleasant scent, but wears off quickly which seems to be about the time it quits working. Have to reapply several times over a few hours, which is a little annoying, and doesn&#x27;t make it terribly cost effective. If you have mild symptoms or only need it rarely, it might be okay.</li>
            <li> Wintergreen is one of those classic scents. It never gets old. It&#x27;s mild and refreshing at every turn. The wintergreen oil has soothed and healed the dry patches on my knees and elbows. I like to put a little on my heels after a good pediacure. I cannot stand cracked, rough skin. The Wintergreen has a lovely tingly feeling, similar to popping a cool mint after eating something coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from combination skin. I bought the wintergreen to help with the dry patches but was concerned it would be too oily. I was dead wrong. Not only did it moisterize by dry spots, it actually evened out my oily areas. CRAZY!! Eden&#x27;s Garden provides cute little packaging and fun ideas for thier products. I would love to visit thier store someday. I have heard it smells like a floral haven.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!! I have been very happy with all of the oils I&#x27;ve bought from Edens Garden. They work just as well as DoTerra, but way more affordable.</li>
            <li> EDENS GARDEN IS THE BEST. NO NEED TO SHOP ANY PLACE ELSE</li>
            <li> I do wish it came with more details on the label, however you can find all that info if you snoop around enough. BUT, it is a great oil, it does wonders for my headaches, and it smells like sweet delicious mouth watering candy. I love it!</li>
            <li> Strong smell and nice wrapping</li>
            <li> Smells like it should and seems like a very nice oil. I&#x27;ve been very happy with all my Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils so far.</li>
            <li> High quality, potent essential oil. The aroma is heavenly and the price excellent.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came (on the bottle) with more details (CT, expiry, origin, etc.). However I liked it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I use it as one of several essential oils to rub on back to boost immune system.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that this is the first wintergreen oil I&#x27;ve ever bought so I have nothing to compare it to.  Having said that, my bottle smelled bad.  It stinks so bad, I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it, not even one drop.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like any wintergreen gum/mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever smelled or anything like any of the other 5 star reviewers said.  I emailed and asked seller if it was supposed to smell that way or if it&#x27;s a bad batch.  They said it&#x27;s supposed to be strong and said they have lots of control over quality so it can&#x27;t be bad and suggested I buy peppermint oil for a lighter smell.  I have peppermint oil already from Now Foods and it smells like it should.  Like peppermint candy.  This wintergreen oil that I got didn&#x27;t smell like any kind of mint that I&#x27;ve ever smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I bought the oil for it&#x27;s therapeutic properties, not the smell, so I will continue to use it.  I mix it with lemon oil and peppermint oil to mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep the bottle and use it until it&#x27;s gone but will order from another source in the future so I have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I still have to learn mor uses of it, but is good</li>
            <li> Worked as expected. Good price.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Fast shipping!</li>
