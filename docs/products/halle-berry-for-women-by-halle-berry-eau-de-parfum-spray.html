            <li>It is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>I ran out and had to get more.</li>
            <li>You get a lot more cheaper than at dept stores.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet but not too sweet, sexy, alluring and exotic!!</li>
            <li>My own unique scent that is sophisticated and feminine.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect combination of spice and floral which give it a lot of warmth, but it&#x27;s light enough for summer.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and its soft and not over powering and lasts!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice soft sexy fragrance.</li>
            <li>As for the smell, at first it did seem very overwhelming to me.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent and the comments i get for wearing it...</li>
            <li>It has just the right combination of scents: sweet without being cloying, a soft hint of exotic spice, and a wonderfully woody finish.  </li>
            <li>I even spray more on right before bed because the scent is lovely and calming as I head off to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I havent been very impressed with other celebrity perfumes, but this one is a keeper!</li>
            <li>Warm and gentle</li>
            <li>The scent is light and in no way overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my buy and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a sensual fragrance and makes me feel great.</li>
            <li>I just wish the 3 piece set was available now.</li>
            <li>My wife should enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li>Great light smell-jasmine-woodsy-stays with me a long time.</li>
            <li>It has a very fresh clean scent that isn&#x27;t to overpowering.</li>
            <li>Perfect for all year round!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a sniff and a purchase!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a JLo copy, it&#x27;s more of a Fall scent, and it&#x27;s a mature sister to With Love by</li>
            <li>my opinion, the pear &amp; fig make this special yet comforting, adding a touch of sweetness without the sugar.</li>
            <li>Halle&#x27;s EDP sits right along beside them and is used quite often!</li>
            <li>Though most of the time I wear it for no other reason than to enjoy it myself!</li>
            <li>Sweet</li>
            <li>perfumes smell different to every person, I think, but to me, this is a spicy oriental with a surprising hint of citrus...</li>
            <li>The perfume has a soft, warm, relaxed feel.</li>
            <li>it was strong at first</li>
            <li>Personally, i dont care for heavy flowery scents, but this is the perfect balance of all of the scents i love.  </li>
            <li>It lasts pretty much all day its not to light nor is the smell too strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overly sweet, but there is just the right balance of vanilla and sandlewood.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get enough of this sexy Fragrance!</li>
            <li>but well worth it for the price</li>
            <li>like it, but not enough to own it or wear it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a girly sweet perfume, and this is exactly that.</li>
            <li>THis particular seller was inexpensive and fast and safe with shipping.</li>
            <li>This fragrance caught me right away when I spritzed some on my wrist at the store.  </li>
            <li>It smells like an old woman&#x27;s musk, or a strong, manly cologne.</li>
            <li>old twin daughters, one in Ohio and the other in Arizona both love it too!!</li>
            <li>Most women&#x27;s perfumes leave me with a headache, if not totally nauseous.  </li>
            <li>It literally broke my concentration at work where I first encountered it.</li>
            <li>but I think if I buy the lotion and add the cologne on top of it that it will last longer.</li>
            <li>I winced at getting perfume as a gift the first time I got it</li>
            <li>I would love to have some cream with the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Halle</li>
            <li>but when I came across this perfume, I knew I was as close as I was was going to get (and it is pretty darn close).</li>
            <li>I would definitely make this one of my top fragrances.</li>
            <li>It has only grown on me more since I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>I bought this fragrance without first having a whiff, basing my purchase on the number of comments I&#x27;d heard about how it wasn&#x27;t a \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; sweet-smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend gave me this perfume for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and it has now replaced every other fragrance I own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a golden beachy vibe to it, like late summer when the temperature is cool, the sun is warm, and everyone is sporting a tan.</li>
            <li>As most fragrances now seem to do this one does not stay with me as long as I would like.</li>
            <li>She had purchased a small vile at a drug store and loved it, so I decided to surprise her when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is not necessarily objectionable,  but it is very potent and concentrated; as such, wearers of this perfume won&#x27;t have to worry about it fading away because it&#x27;s got plenty of punch and long-lasting staying power.</li>
            <li>Not for younger females..too strong with a rubbing alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>Beautiful sensual scent that last a few hours.</li>
            <li>Many other perfumes are way too strong to my nose even in small doses and women just love to bathe with perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Very versitile scent.  </li>
            <li>It is also one of the first reasonably priced fragrances that I&#x27;ve encountered that is the same caliber of a true designer fragrance.      </li>
            <li>The scent of this perfume is absolutely horrid.</li>
            <li>but that is somehow also light enough for summer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really  like it.</li>
            <li>thanks for the reasonable priced product....</li>
            <li>While I agree that it is not at all girlie, it is a very muscular perfume: \\&quot;a</li>
            <li>This is a nice, spicy everyday fragrance and not pricey so slather it on.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents and don&#x27;t normally wear perfume by celebrities, but after smelling Halle byHalle Berry I&#x27;m hooked!  </li>
            <li>She loves the scent; which is delicate and kind of floral.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to any woman (or man) looking for a mature, woodsy, sexy feminine scent that is not overpowering, cloying or mundane.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a little more than surprised that I&#x27;m writing about a fragrance.</li>
            <li>The first note in this perfume is sheer alkehal.</li>
            <li>it comes in a pretty close second for about a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a certain something to it that is natural, seductive, pheremone-y, exotic, and just plain addictive!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Halle is a warm, spicy, peppery, somewhat musky parfume with lemony, slightly licorice undertones.</li>
            <li>Im a die hard fan of Halle Berry but her perfume is better...</li>
            <li>Generally, I care very little for perfumes; most make me choke.</li>
            <li>old but my 24 yr.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by Halle.</li>
            <li>BUT WOW...</li>
            <li>Smells like and old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>The cost is far below the value you get with this scent.</li>
            <li>&quot; enough to want to invest in her other products and enjoy a longer lasting fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Halle is less expensive and soo much more unique.  </li>
            <li>This product smells great on my lady and it doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in my mouth when I kiss her neck.</li>
            <li>This has a soft scent with a lasting smell.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Cacharel&#x27;s Lou Lou Blue (which is now discontinued) when I was 16 and have had a very hard time finding a perfume that even comes close to mimicking it.</li>
            <li>It is feminine and sweet without being too delicate and \\&quot;girly\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I gave almost twice as much for  about half the perfume at walgreens.</li>
            <li>as a cold weather or winter fragrance, as it would be far too heavy as a light, fresh summer fragrance, in my opinion.</li>

            <li> Great light smell-jasmine-woodsy-stays with me a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a very fresh clean scent that isn&#x27;t to overpowering.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all year round!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth a sniff and a purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a JLo copy, it&#x27;s more of a Fall scent, and it&#x27;s a mature sister to With Love by</li>
            <li> my opinion, the pear &amp; fig make this special yet comforting, adding a touch of sweetness without the sugar.</li>
            <li> Halle&#x27;s EDP sits right along beside them and is used quite often!</li>
            <li> Though most of the time I wear it for no other reason than to enjoy it myself!</li>
            <li> Sweet</li>
            <li> perfumes smell different to every person, I think, but to me, this is a spicy oriental with a surprising hint of citrus...</li>
            <li> The perfume has a soft, warm, relaxed feel.</li>
            <li> it was strong at first</li>
            <li> Personally, i dont care for heavy flowery scents, but this is the perfect balance of all of the scents i love.  </li>
            <li> It lasts pretty much all day its not to light nor is the smell too strong.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overly sweet, but there is just the right balance of vanilla and sandlewood.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this sexy Fragrance!</li>
            <li> but well worth it for the price</li>
            <li> like it, but not enough to own it or wear it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a girly sweet perfume, and this is exactly that.</li>
            <li> THis particular seller was inexpensive and fast and safe with shipping.</li>
            <li> This fragrance caught me right away when I spritzed some on my wrist at the store.  </li>
            <li> It smells like an old woman&#x27;s musk, or a strong, manly cologne.</li>
            <li> old twin daughters, one in Ohio and the other in Arizona both love it too!!</li>
            <li> Most women&#x27;s perfumes leave me with a headache, if not totally nauseous.  </li>
            <li> It literally broke my concentration at work where I first encountered it.</li>
            <li> but I think if I buy the lotion and add the cologne on top of it that it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I winced at getting perfume as a gift the first time I got it</li>
            <li> I would love to have some cream with the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Halle</li>
            <li> but when I came across this perfume, I knew I was as close as I was was going to get (and it is pretty darn close).</li>
            <li> I would definitely make this one of my top fragrances.</li>
            <li> It has only grown on me more since I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance without first having a whiff, basing my purchase on the number of comments I&#x27;d heard about how it wasn&#x27;t a \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; sweet-smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend gave me this perfume for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and it has now replaced every other fragrance I own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a golden beachy vibe to it, like late summer when the temperature is cool, the sun is warm, and everyone is sporting a tan.</li>
            <li> As most fragrances now seem to do this one does not stay with me as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> She had purchased a small vile at a drug store and loved it, so I decided to surprise her when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is not necessarily objectionable,  but it is very potent and concentrated; as such, wearers of this perfume won&#x27;t have to worry about it fading away because it&#x27;s got plenty of punch and long-lasting staying power.</li>
            <li> Not for younger females..too strong with a rubbing alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> Beautiful sensual scent that last a few hours.</li>
            <li> Many other perfumes are way too strong to my nose even in small doses and women just love to bathe with perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Very versitile scent.  </li>
            <li> It is also one of the first reasonably priced fragrances that I&#x27;ve encountered that is the same caliber of a true designer fragrance.      </li>
            <li> The scent of this perfume is absolutely horrid.</li>
            <li> but that is somehow also light enough for summer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really  like it.</li>
            <li> thanks for the reasonable priced product....</li>
            <li> While I agree that it is not at all girlie, it is a very muscular perfume: \\&quot;a</li>
            <li> This is a nice, spicy everyday fragrance and not pricey so slather it on.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents and don&#x27;t normally wear perfume by celebrities, but after smelling Halle byHalle Berry I&#x27;m hooked!  </li>
            <li> She loves the scent; which is delicate and kind of floral.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to any woman (or man) looking for a mature, woodsy, sexy feminine scent that is not overpowering, cloying or mundane.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a little more than surprised that I&#x27;m writing about a fragrance.</li>
            <li> The first note in this perfume is sheer alkehal.</li>
            <li> it comes in a pretty close second for about a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a certain something to it that is natural, seductive, pheremone-y, exotic, and just plain addictive!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Halle is a warm, spicy, peppery, somewhat musky parfume with lemony, slightly licorice undertones.</li>
            <li> Im a die hard fan of Halle Berry but her perfume is better...</li>
            <li> Generally, I care very little for perfumes; most make me choke.</li>
            <li> old but my 24 yr.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by Halle.</li>
            <li> BUT WOW...</li>
            <li> Smells like and old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> The cost is far below the value you get with this scent.</li>
            <li> &quot; enough to want to invest in her other products and enjoy a longer lasting fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Halle is less expensive and soo much more unique.  </li>
            <li> This product smells great on my lady and it doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in my mouth when I kiss her neck.</li>
            <li> This has a soft scent with a lasting smell.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Cacharel&#x27;s Lou Lou Blue (which is now discontinued) when I was 16 and have had a very hard time finding a perfume that even comes close to mimicking it.</li>
            <li> It is feminine and sweet without being too delicate and \\&quot;girly\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I gave almost twice as much for  about half the perfume at walgreens.</li>
            <li> as a cold weather or winter fragrance, as it would be far too heavy as a light, fresh summer fragrance, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last too long though  </li>
            <li> Also, the scent does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t last that long but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> smell it last very long time  </li>
            <li> Came way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this at Meijer, sad to say it cost me about 33.</li>
            <li> I hope Halle keeps producing this perfume for a long time - I for one am a devotee!</li>
            <li> You only need a few sprays, so this should last me quite a while.  </li>
            <li> A little pricy is the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I ran empty on that bottle</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper here than any other I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO tired of celebrities selling new scents just to make money.</li>
            <li> It will last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using it sparingly, which should mean that a small bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little upset that I didn&#x27;t give it try.</li>
            <li> little dab&#x27;ll do ya,\\&quot; as the saying goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean that the fading scent is bad or unusual - it&#x27;s something that I deal with with any cologne that isn&#x27;t mega heavy scented, but</li>
            <li> At first I smelled a sugary citrus scent and then i smelled a hint of vanilla which i normally hate</li>
            <li> I have yet to smell it on anyone else and will keep my little secret from all my friends.  </li>
            <li> My world becomes drenched in the molten glow of an Indian summer&#x27;s late afternoon.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s nothing i can think of to say that would be negative about this product.</li>
            <li> I used to use J&#x27;adore and Envy Me by Gucci, Bvlgari and Anais Anais, Chanel #19 and other very expensive perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tough critic when it comes to fragrances.</li>
            <li> no really it makes me sick</li>
            <li> Want to score points with the wife for whatever you did wrong yesterday?</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it at all .</li>
            <li> That feeling you get from being comfy on a cold winter day in front of the tv or fireplace.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the Halle fragrance!  I get compliments all the time when I wear it!  This was also such a great value! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice soft sexy fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t last too long though  but well worth it for the price</li>
            <li> Most women&#x27;s perfumes leave me with a headache, if not totally nauseous.  This  lovely come-hither scent from Halle Berry was a very pleasant surprise!  It has just the right combination of scents: sweet without being cloying, a soft hint of exotic spice, and a wonderfully woody finish.  Warm and gentle, it&#x27;s now the only scent I use, and my husband just loves it too.  Perfect for all year round!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy&#x27;s guy. My thing is sports, electronics, movies, being outdoors, etc. Home improvement for me is graduating from a 37\\&quot; LCD TV to a 65\\&quot; Plasma. So I&#x27;m a little more than surprised that I&#x27;m writing about a fragrance. Generally, I care very little for perfumes; most make me choke. This fragrance by Halle Berry is one of the most beautiful I&#x27;ve ever come across. It literally broke my concentration at work where I first encountered it. I found it hypnotic and I still do. I bought it for my wife to take along to NY for our daughter&#x27;s college graduation. She loves it! Attention husbands! Want to score points with the wife for whatever you did wrong yesterday? Buy her this fragrance. She&#x27;ll forget you sprayed her cat with the garden hose, I promise.</li>
            <li> My woman loves this parfume! I have no idea what it smell&#x27;s like because she is out of the country working and I don&#x27;t want to smell it until I smell it while she ism wearing it!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling perfume. I bought it for my girlfriend, i would recomend it for anyone. It has a very fresh clean scent that isn&#x27;t to overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read \\&quot;Halle\\&quot; described as a floral/woody scent. While I would agree with that, and I&#x27;m no expert, but I also detect a musk undertone. The scent is light and in no way overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t last for hours and hours but I think if I buy the lotion and add the cologne on top of it that it will last longer. I don&#x27;t mean that the fading scent is bad or unusual - it&#x27;s something that I deal with with any cologne that isn&#x27;t mega heavy scented, but I like \\&quot;Halle\\&quot; enough to want to invest in her other products and enjoy a longer lasting fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a sniff and a purchase! I&#x27;m happy with my buy and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Musky yet floral.  Sweet yet you don&#x27;t smell like a teenager.  Sophisticated.  Good for the day and night.  Very versitile scent.  I used to use J&#x27;adore and Envy Me by Gucci, Bvlgari and Anais Anais, Chanel #19 and other very expensive perfumes.  Halle is less expensive and soo much more unique.  I have yet to smell it on anyone else and will keep my little secret from all my friends.  My own unique scent that is sophisticated and feminine.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this at Meijer, sad to say it cost me about 33., bucks..its cheaper on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you like Angel, by Terry Mulger...you&#x27;ll LOVE this. I have angel, I ran empty on that bottle had it refiled many moons ago, it cost me under 40 bucks. I can&#x27;t remember what it cost then because it was a gift, but I know its pricey. This has a soft scent with a lasting smell. Not overpowering at all. I love it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Halle\\&quot; is one elegant sexy Eau de Parfum!  It is also one of the first reasonably priced fragrances that I&#x27;ve encountered that is the same caliber of a true designer fragrance.      When I experience \\&quot;Halle\\&quot; I am engulfed in warm honeyed amber sunshine.  My world becomes drenched in the molten glow of an Indian summer&#x27;s late afternoon.  But please!  Don&#x27;t let my description mislead you to think this is a daytime fragrance.  Oh no!  \\&quot;Halle\\&quot; has a smoldering, &#x27;come hither\\&quot; seduction to it.  When I go out with my guy and I want his attention I wear \\&quot;Halle.\\&quot;  Though most of the time I wear it for no other reason than to enjoy it myself!</li>
            <li> The scent of this perfume is absolutely horrid. It smells like an old woman&#x27;s musk, or a strong, manly cologne. I still can&#x27;t decide which. I purchased this for myself and have only used it once. Also, the scent does not last long at all. About 15 minutes after spraying it on, you can not smell it. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This smells like boo boo and flowers!!! no really it makes me sick I wouldn&#x27;t even use as a bathroom spray</li>
            <li> perfumes smell different to every person, I think, but to me, this is a spicy oriental with a surprising hint of citrus... for comparison, I also like Avon Imari, Estee Lauder Sensuous, Organza Indesance (discontinued).</li>
            <li> My boyfriend gave me this perfume for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and it has now replaced every other fragrance I own. It&#x27;s got a certain something to it that is natural, seductive, pheremone-y, exotic, and just plain addictive! I get nothing but compliments and I haven&#x27;t smelled this scent on anyone else yet. I even put some on when I&#x27;m not going anywhere because smelling it makes me happy - I&#x27;m not kidding!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I winced at getting perfume as a gift the first time I got it but as soon as I opened the bottle I was a convert. It&#x27;s warm and musky and beautiful. I get so many compliments on wearing it. This is my 2nd or 3rd bottle as it&#x27;s my daily scent. THis particular seller was inexpensive and fast and safe with shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this parfume!! It&#x27;s sweet but not too sweet, sexy, alluring and exotic!! I own lots of perfumes Flowerbomb, SJP, Viva La Juicy, Vera Wang, Donna Karan, Chanel Chance etc. Halle&#x27;s EDP sits right along beside them and is used quite often! I&#x27;m 54 yrs. old but my 24 yr. old twin daughters, one in Ohio and the other in Arizona both love it too!! Please Halle don&#x27;t stop making it and Amazon don&#x27;t stop selling it! And I WON&#x27;T stop buying it!!</li>
            <li> Oh this perfume is fabolous. It smells so exotic and like it is a blend of so many things. At first I smelled a sugary citrus scent and then i smelled a hint of vanilla which i normally hate but it blended well some how in this fragrance. Then i smelled the sandlewood scent. It just smells wonderful and like sooo many things all at once. Its a very sophisticated sexy fragrance but that is somehow also light enough for summer. My husband loved it on me which is the most important test.</li>
            <li> I just bought this perfume today and am in love with the scent.  Believe me, i have tons of bottles of perfume and this one is the best yet.  Personally, i dont care for heavy flowery scents, but this is the perfect balance of all of the scents i love.  The scent is not overly sweet, but there is just the right balance of vanilla and sandlewood.  You only need a few sprays, so this should last me quite a while.  I havent been very impressed with other celebrity perfumes, but this one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume because I liked the scent.  However, my husband could not smell the fragrance on me.  I guess I will have to stick with scents that have a \\&quot;stronger punch.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by Halle. It&#x27;s different from the run-of-the-mill oriental woody or celeb-of-day fume. It&#x27;s got a golden beachy vibe to it, like late summer when the temperature is cool, the sun is warm, and everyone is sporting a tan. That was my impression _before_ seeing the print ads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the pear &amp; fig make this special yet comforting, adding a touch of sweetness without the sugar. Pear &amp; fig are among my favorite notes, so I like Halle and want to test it again. However, I don&#x27;t like Halle enough to invest in a bottle yet, even if at a deep discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how many people would like this. It&#x27;s not a JLo copy, it&#x27;s more of a Fall scent, and it&#x27;s a mature sister to With Love by HD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but not enough to own it or wear it.</li>
            <li> The first note in this perfume is sheer alkehal. The next is a whirlwind of everything that would possibly rot your teeth. After 20 minutes, it fades and it smells like powder deoderant mixed with BO.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it. It has a very nice smell to it and I will recommend this product for any husband wishing to surprise his wife…</li>
            <li> Great scent, it doesn&#x27;t last that long but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> Great light smell-jasmine-woodsy-stays with me a long time. I would love to have some cream with the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Halle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tough critic when it comes to fragrances. I&#x27;m SO tired of celebrities selling new scents just to make money. BUT WOW...HALLE KNOWS WHAT SHE&#x27;S DOING! This is soooooo beautiful. It&#x27;s warm and exotic. It&#x27;s definitely a sensual fragrance and makes me feel great. I just wish the 3 piece set was available now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume. I&#x27;ve never smelled one that smelled so addicting! My boyfriend loves it, too, which is very important. It&#x27;s a great price, too, for the size bottle you get. It will last me at least 6 months. BUY IT! You&#x27;ll love it! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This product smells great on my lady and it doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in my mouth when I kiss her neck.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Cacharel&#x27;s Lou Lou Blue (which is now discontinued) when I was 16 and have had a very hard time finding a perfume that even comes close to mimicking it. I have been searching for years but when I came across this perfume, I knew I was as close as I was was going to get (and it is pretty darn close). Although not identical to Lou Lou Blue it comes in a pretty close second for about a quarter of the price. My only problem with buying this fragrance was having to open the box in Walmart to test it out...stores need to have testers.  I love this and hope THIS one doesn&#x27;t get discontinued or I&#x27;m going to be on the hunt again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for some people, but I dont care for it much. I dont detect any \\&quot;woody oriental\\&quot;, just sweet...sugary.</li>
            <li> smell real good on pretty bottle  strong  smell it last very long time  love it well buy again sex smell</li>
            <li> I received this perfume as a gift. The bottle itself is quite nice. I really liked it. As for the smell, at first it did seem very overwhelming to me. I did not spray it onto my skin but into the air and just smelled the spray pump. I didn&#x27;t really  like it. One evening  I went through my perfumes and thought of smelling it again. I sprayed it on my wrist it was strong at first but after it settled into my skin I honestly loved how exotic and sexy it smelled. I was a little upset that I didn&#x27;t give it try. Now it&#x27;s one of my perfumes that I wear going out at night with friends.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this fragrance after reading all the great reviews. I don&#x27;t like a girly sweet perfume, and this is exactly that. To me, it smells like something my grandmother would have worn. I&#x27;m sure it works well on others, just not my taste. I don&#x27;t even think I will use it as a bathroom spray.</li>
            <li> As most fragrances now seem to do this one does not stay with me as long as I would like. But I will buy it again, I love it !</li>
            <li> Smells like and old lady perfume. I&#x27;m 20. Not for younger females..too strong with a rubbing alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite budget scent. The cost is far below the value you get with this scent. It lasts all day and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife for Christmas.  She loves the scent; which is delicate and kind of floral.  I think it smells rather nice on her.</li>
            <li> Beautiful sensual scent that last a few hours. My husband was glad I purchased it because he enjoys how sexy it smells on me.</li>
            <li> todo tal como lo esperaba, la entrega fue rapida y el producto llego en excelentes condiciones, la compra fue un exito</li>
            <li> I just love the scent. It is not overpowering and not fruity or flowery-which are the types of perfume i do not like. To me it smells alluring. Love it!</li>
            <li> The perfume has a soft, warm, relaxed feel. That feeling you get from being comfy on a cold winter day in front of the tv or fireplace. Very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents and don&#x27;t normally wear perfume by celebrities, but after smelling Halle byHalle Berry I&#x27;m hooked!  I love the vanilla and amber tones.</li>
            <li> My wife alternates between wearing this perfume and Clinique Happy.  I like them both and so does she.  Many other perfumes are way too strong to my nose even in small doses and women just love to bathe with perfumes.  So, when my wife bathes with this one, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all; it&#x27;s quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> El olor a vainilla con una convinacion de especiaes  desprender buen olor,  si me gusto y lo volveria a comprar,,, a mi esposo le agrado asi que bueno me doy por bien ganada y complacida con esta compra</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling fragrance that lasts.  Not overpowering.  I really love the hint of musk.  I would definitely make this one of my top fragrances.</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I both luv Halle.  More so her perfume than her.  If you&#x27;ve ever had the opportunity to witness it and your spouse luves un wearing it than you have found the place to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper here than any other I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Im a die hard fan of Halle Berry but her perfume is better...I love the light scent and the comments i get for wearing it...thanks for the reasonable priced product....</li>
            <li> This fragrance caught me right away when I spritzed some on my wrist at the store.  It is feminine and sweet without being too delicate and \\&quot;girly\\&quot;.  It is a perfect combination of spice and floral which give it a lot of warmth, but it&#x27;s light enough for summer.  The scent stays on pretty well without being overpowering; I usually do re-apply 2-3 times daily.  It has only grown on me more since I purchased it.  I even spray more on right before bed because the scent is lovely and calming as I head off to sleep.  I recommend this to any woman (or man) looking for a mature, woodsy, sexy feminine scent that is not overpowering, cloying or mundane.  I hope Halle keeps producing this perfume for a long time - I for one am a devotee!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this sexy Fragrance! Smells great and its soft and not over powering and lasts! My girlfriend and I  really enjoy it!</li>
            <li> A little pricy is the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells sooo good. It lasts pretty much all day its not to light nor is the smell too strong. It is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, spicy everyday fragrance and not pricey so slather it on.  I don&#x27;t get as many compliments about it as others I wear but altogether, it&#x27;s a good one.  Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance without first having a whiff, basing my purchase on the number of comments I&#x27;d heard about how it wasn&#x27;t a \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; sweet-smelling fragrance. While I agree that it is not at all girlie, it is a very muscular perfume: \\&quot;a little dab&#x27;ll do ya,\\&quot; as the saying goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halle is a warm, spicy, peppery, somewhat musky parfume with lemony, slightly licorice undertones. The fragrance is not necessarily objectionable,  but it is very potent and concentrated; as such, wearers of this perfume won&#x27;t have to worry about it fading away because it&#x27;s got plenty of punch and long-lasting staying power. I would suggest using it sparingly, which should mean that a small bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best as a cold weather or winter fragrance, as it would be far too heavy as a light, fresh summer fragrance, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Came way earlier than expected. Nothing wrong with it at all . Smells great  there&#x27;s nothing i can think of to say that would be negative about this product.</li>
            <li> The Halle Berry Eau-de-Parfume Spray was received in a timley manner and was just what my wife wanted. She had purchased a small vile at a drug store and loved it, so I decided to surprise her when I found it on Amazon.  The vendor was great.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. I ran out and had to get more. You get a lot more cheaper than at dept stores. I gave almost twice as much for  about half the perfume at walgreens.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift.  Won&#x27;t know if the wife likes it until tomorrow.  I love it.  My wife should enjoy wearing it.</li>
