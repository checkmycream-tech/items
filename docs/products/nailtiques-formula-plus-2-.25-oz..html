Thank you Nailtiques!! Way to go!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Clear, hardens quickly, doesn&#x27;t yellow, stays on for a good week.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product and has purchased it perhaps a dozen times in the past but this bottle is half the size I&#x27;ve purchased previously and the price here is almost double I&#x27;ve found it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My nails had been breaking for several years, especially if I used nail polish on them. They would remain breaking and peeling until the nail regrew completely after polish use. I tried Nail Envy--the same thing happened. I resigned myself to the fact that I couldn&#x27;t use anything on my nails...then I did an internet search that directed me to Nailtiques. Thanks to Amazon and it&#x27;s wonderful reviews I decided to give Nailtiques a test...I couldn&#x27;t be happier...it has been a couple of months now that I&#x27;ve been using it an I can honestly say that since I began not one nail has broken---I have just ordered my second bottle! Nailtiques is a winner!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing that has happened to my nails!!!!</li>
            <li> Since going back to natural nails, I use this all the time, and my nails are stronger and growing very nicely..... Still looks like I have artificial nails, but they are my own now !!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have been using it for years and years with great success.  With regular use this product keeps my nails healthy.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF WORKS!  After using this product for over three months, I can truthfully say that my nails are harder, thicker, peel less/crack less.  I&#x27;m so excited!  My nails have grown faster than expected.  But you MUST follow the instruction to achieve its benefits.</li>
            <li> I give a 3 stars not because of the product is because for me is too early to see improvement, my nails start to get a little bit better, I hope in few months will see better results</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something like this product for probably 40 years.  My nails chip anytime they get any length at all and this  Nailtiques formula +2 has done a wonderful job on most of them . I actually have a thumbnail that is extending beyond my thumb flesh!  You really need to follow the instructions well. Mine are still growing out and I have yet to see whether the new nail from the nailbed is going to stop splitting, but I have great hopes!  Just an additional thought, the product has a great shine so that my nails look great even without color.</li>
            <li> My nails love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I needed this product.  Has help strengthen my weak nails.</li>
            <li> Works great.. I&#x27;ll definately buy again!!</li>
            <li> This stuff was totally amazing. And I NEVER give 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever is in it absolutely corrected my awfully splitting nails. In about a week. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My raggedy nails have been helped tremendously with this product.  I cut them all off and began applying a coat of Nailtiques each night.  Even if I had polish on, I continued the nightly application.  After a month, my nails were no longer peeling, no longer brittle and had grown to a healthy length.  I totally recommend this product.</li>
