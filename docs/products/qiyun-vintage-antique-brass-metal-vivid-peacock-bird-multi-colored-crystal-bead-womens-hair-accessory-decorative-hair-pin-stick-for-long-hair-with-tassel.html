            <li>I love my new hair pin.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with a different way to style my hair because I have a colorful personality</li>
            <li>This is very pretty, but the metal is so soft that the peacock broke off it before I was ever able to wear it.  </li>
            <li>Piece is good length for large bun and stick curves hold well in long hair</li>
            <li>Stunning, high quality and would highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>It is the right length and pretty.</li>

            <li>Really prettt hair pin.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a friend and she absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li>She would put it straight up-and-down in a bun and it would end up leaning.</li>
            <li>Very timely delivery.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it, it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Its long enough for different styles and hair lengths too, beautiful colors and design too.</li>
            <li>It is heavy and made of a pot-metal type composite with a brass finish and a nice metal glaze.</li>

            <li>the material seems durable and no gem has fallen so far.</li>
            <li>I find it useful for pinning up my hair when it is wet --</li>
            <li>I bought this hair stick, so I could pull the top part of my hair back and into a small bun, instead of using a clip.  </li>
            <li>It is really pretty, but the edges were ragged and sharp and tore my hair you could not slide it in or out of your hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could be improved is that the back is &amp;#34;blank&amp;#34; and thus clearly the back side.  </li>

            <li> The main issue we have found with it, though, was how heavy the &amp;#34;peacock&amp;#34; side was.</li>
            <li> I try to wear that side as close to my head as possible and I wear it with the back side facing my head so that the pretty side can be seen fully from behind me.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> It stays put and holds my long hair in place.</li>
            <li> Overall for the wait there were other items I ordered I</li>
            <li> Wish this also came in black and also in brushed nickel/silver.</li>
            <li> I ordered this pin only to receive it with one of the gems missing.</li>
            <li> Had some rough spots that I smoothed out with a metal file.  </li>
            <li> But on this stick there are two rough spots and they keep pulling my hair whenever I try to slide it through my hair.</li>
            <li> You want be disappointed if you get it, I think you will be well pleased.</li>
            <li> I had to sand it down on my knife sharpner.</li>
            <li> Iy arrived on time and is not too heavy in my hair.</li>
            <li> it is too heavy and falls out of my hair.</li>
            <li> At least this one won&#x27;t break, nor is it particularly heavy.  </li>
            <li> But the problem is I use one day, only one day, and it is broken, bad quality!!!!</li>
            <li> Sad..</li>
            <li> if there happens to be anything wrong with your order or any comments you have, they are on it!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>

            <li> I was a little skeptical because I couldn&#x27;t touch and see this, I was pleasantly surprised how beautiful it was with detail and weight ! I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this hair pin and the sturdiness is great ...I&#x27;ll be able to use it a long time !</li>
            <li> This pin is as beautiful it looks better in person than the picture.  Once you get it you are going to want to wear it as soon as you see it.  I bought this pin for my daughter-in-law and she loves it.  She had been looking for a pin like this one and I am glad that I was able to find it for her.  It&#x27;s really beautiful she ware it in her hair to a cook out and alot of women wanted the pin. You want be disappointed if you get it, I think you will be well pleased.</li>
            <li> Satisfied but because of the low price for this product I didn&#x27;t expect anything exceptional.  This is ok.  Had some rough spots that I smoothed out with a metal file.  Piece is good length for large bun and stick curves hold well in long hair</li>
            <li> flimsy and broke after my wife used it 1 time</li>
            <li> Lovely hair pin! I was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful vintage finish and sturdy construction.  Holds my long hair well in updos - classy functional and beautifully decorative!</li>
            <li> This is a darker bronze colour than it appears in the photos, but otherwise is just as illustrated.  I find it useful for pinning up my hair when it is wet -- something I am leary about using a wooden stick for.  It is sturdier than the china hair stick I bought, too.  At least this one won&#x27;t break, nor is it particularly heavy.  It stays put and holds my long hair in place.</li>
            <li> Ordered this hair pin &amp; it&#x27;s even better in person! I was happily surprised by the free gift included &amp; had to fight my teenage daughter off of both items! Thank you for the great customer service &amp; the beautiful items! Will be purchasing more!!</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would arrive by Christmas. I knew it might not so I contacted the vendor. They said it would. I would have been fine had they said it would not make it (two other vendors did and got better reviews from me) but It did not. The item is larger than pictured (not a problem) and it is not as gaudy as the picture might otherwise indicate. It is heavy and made of a pot-metal type composite with a brass finish and a nice metal glaze. Overall for the wait there were other items I ordered I though were much nicer than this stick, but if you love the look of it and don&#x27;t mind waiting for post from China it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> Took 18 days to receive this hairpin, but overall I received it and I use it everyday :)</li>
            <li> Far better quality and prettier than I ever expected for this price.  Very cute.  These would make great inexpensive gifts at the holidays for your luncheon friends.  I wear it often and get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> It broke the first week. Really prettt hair pin.</li>
            <li> I love my new hair pin.  I ordered several styles from this site.  The pins are even attractive sitting on my vintage makeup table.&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
            <li> This works well and is very pretty.  The only thing that could be improved is that the back is &amp;#34;blank&amp;#34; and thus clearly the back side.  I try to wear that side as close to my head as possible and I wear it with the back side facing my head so that the pretty side can be seen fully from behind me.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and I use these as shawl  pins. .They are cheaper than most shawl pins and work just as well .&lt;br /&gt;they ae prettier too.</li>
            <li> It is really pretty, but the edges were ragged and sharp and tore my hair you could not slide it in or out of your hair. It would catch and on my hair. I had to sand it down on my knife sharpner. Better quality control would be nice.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair stick but broke while I was putting it in my hair. Can&#x27;t tell what it&#x27;s made of but definitely not metal.</li>
            <li> cute, strong enough to hold my bun of hair and it has a neat cool look</li>
            <li> my wife ordered them and she likes them fine. ok by me.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair pin.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful decorative hair ornament.  Stunning, high quality and would highly recommend!  Wish this also came in black and also in brushed nickel/silver.</li>
            <li> it is too heavy and falls out of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the third hair stick I have received from Yazilind. All have been well made with smooth edges. I wear my hair up most of the time and these pins make a lovely addition to my hair styles and get a lot compliments. This pin seems to work best when worn between a 60 to 90 degree angle, the head being a bit heavy for a lower angle.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend and she absolutely adores it. The main issue we have found with it, though, was how heavy the &amp;#34;peacock&amp;#34; side was. She would put it straight up-and-down in a bun and it would end up leaning. It was necessary to add another stick or a bun wrap to help keep it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars primarily because I do see her using it a lot and while it doesn&#x27;t work well on it&#x27;s own, it does work and looks lovely.</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my sister and she loved it. It is not heavy and it works really well in her hair.</li>
            <li> It is the right length and pretty. But on this stick there are two rough spots and they keep pulling my hair whenever I try to slide it through my hair. It hurts!</li>
            <li> Stunning and worth every penny, buy this!!</li>
            <li> Delivered within time frame, well made.</li>
            <li> Perfect hair accessory. Very timely delivery. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> beautiful, perfect gift, THX</li>
            <li> Beautifully made.  Very sturdy.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I wear this almost every day​ and have gotten compliments as well.</li>
