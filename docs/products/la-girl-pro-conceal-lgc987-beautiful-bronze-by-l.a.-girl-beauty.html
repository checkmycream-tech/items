            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; right now for contouring. I set with powder and it&#x27;s good to go. Nice consistency to it and pigmentation to it.</li>
            <li> Great color! Shipping was fast! Product was very watery but looks amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark. I was recommended by this color from my cousin who is 3 shades darker than me.... But it&#x27;s perfect for contour</li>
            <li> LA Girl Pro Conceal is a great concealer I like the color texture of this product. Will tell others about it.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use this as a cream bronzer but it&#x27;s a bit too dark. Also I feel it doesn&#x27;t spread very well once applied on your face. It&#x27;s better to put it on your hand, mix well then apply to your face. It works though.</li>
            <li> This concealer is just okay, it is good for medium  coverage but not for full coverage, the best is dermablend.</li>
            <li> This product either was damaged or sucks overall first time trying it I think it&#x27;s because it came from amazon anyways when I open it to try it it was so watery water  came out instead of product I was so disappointed not only did it ruin my makeup with the water that squirted out but eveytime I used it it did the same I have to squeeze it really hard to make the product come out and when I do first water comes out then the product so confused not sure if it&#x27;s defective or that&#x27;s how it is bummer !</li>
            <li> Perfect for contouring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this. It has a little lip gloss applicator which makes contouring so easy.</li>
            <li> Buy the article pro conceal beautiful bronze girl and I received the following article 2-1 / 4 double shut-off Faucet with on / off switch... What should I do?</li>
            <li> The shipping was so fast I really love this item!! Perfect for contouring</li>
            <li> Dries quickly so rub it in soon as you get it on because you will look ashy..</li>
            <li> I use this to contour and works great like macs pro concealer definitely more affordable than Mac and is the same quality</li>

Waist of my money...I&#x27;m sorry</li>
