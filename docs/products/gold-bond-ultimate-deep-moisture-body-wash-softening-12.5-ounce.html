            <li> This is the best moisture body wash I have found. The only problem is you can buy it in the store. When searching for a store to purchase it Walmart &amp; Walgrens were listed. I have check 4-5 Walmarts &amp; 2-3 Walgrens. They all say Gold Bond makes lotion not body wash. I don&#x27;t mind shopping on the internet, but it is handy to pick up when shopping.</li>
            <li> Excellent,!!!! try it and you&#x27;ll love it. I&#x27;ve used all of the body washes and found them all rewarding.  Your skin fells soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend who is bed ridden and she likes to take showers with Gold Bond all the time</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 years. Nothing compares. It leaves your skin soft. AZ weather dry&#x27;s everything out but the Gold Bond Products are the best.</li>
            <li> When I used a sample of this product, it lathered up SO nice &amp; I was so amazed at how soft it made my skin, which was very noticeable for the rest of the day. I haven&#x27;t purchased any other body wash since I used that sample one year ago! I love it!</li>
            <li> was not as good as i remember when purchased in the store. could not tell the gold bond difference!!!! when purchased in the store u could feel the ultimate softness i dont know what happened</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Body Wash is a very good product it softens the skin while providing moisture. It is hard to find a product that compares to&lt;br /&gt;this product, I can&#x27;t find it in stores so I have to order it from amazon.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of the last tube of Gold Bond Ultimate Deep Moisture softening  Body Wash I could not find a store that  carried them anymore.  I went to Amazon as a last resort to find them and and was so happy to see I could buy them here.  I have extremely dry itchy skin especially my back and this is the only thing that would help with the dryness.  Thank you Amazon for helping me find this.</li>
            <li> Unable to purchase this product in stores... Trust me I&#x27;ve looked!  I love this body wash!  Leaves my skin smooth! Must buy!</li>
            <li> Loved it, but was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I love all Gold Bond lotions and body wash. This stuff is super moisturizing and smells great. Good for guys and gals. I never need body lotion for dry skin after using this stuff!</li>
            <li> I contacted the company that makes this and they wrote me back and said they no longer make this!!! What a shame! This body wash is the Best we have ever used. We use the lotion too. I was ecstatic when I found it on Amazon. thank you for making it available. Just ordered again.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a very good moisture filled shower gel!!! I love it. The stores seem to always run out of it.</li>
            <li> I started using Gold Bond body wash with Shea Butter a couple months ago. I&#x27;d had bad luck with every body wash I tried. Everything left my skin dry after washing. Since using the Gold Bond body wash, I haven&#x27;t had that problem. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Best body wash...Period!!! Using this for 3 years and it keeps skin from drying. Softening &amp; Exfoliating are the best.</li>
            <li> We have used Gold Bod products for many years and decided to try their body wash. Husband has very dry skin that is irritated by the fragrances in many body washes. Gold Bond softens and calms his skin, and has a refreshing scent that has not caused irritation while providing odor control. Great product!</li>
            <li> I was having all sorts of issues with dry skin and rashes, and then I tried this. It&#x27;s a lovely product that creates a creamy foam. It helped to solve the problem. I bought three more so I need never have to go through the winter without it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I use this product regularly in conjunction with shea butter. My skin feels terrific! I reccomend it highly.</li>
            <li> I love the Gold Bond Bath wash, with the Shea butter. I would recommend it to everyone. I love it.</li>
