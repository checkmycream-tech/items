            <li>good seller, happy with purchase and would do business again!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>, she falls in love with this product!</li>
            <li>It is just amazing.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I&#x27;m happy with the results, considering I didn&#x27;t have to pay the FULL PRICE for it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than a month,just as directed and as of yet have not seen any change whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars in case my results improve with more time, but I&#x27;m not feeling optimistic.</li>
            <li>good product and fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>And the price is much cheaper than before!!!</li>
            <li>I used the old formula of the Jan Marini eyelash conditioner--had fantastic results--eyelashes up into my eyebrows!!  </li>
            <li>IF YOU DONT YOU WILL NOT SEE AS GREAT RESULTS.LONG, DARK, CURLY LASHES...............</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had amazing results within a month with Lilash, and I was hoping for the same experience.     </li>
            <li>I have had the product for a couple of weeks now, but do fee like it is kind of getting low...would anticipate it lasting for a bit longer.</li>
            <li>But after used Jan Marini eye-lash about two weeks, I clearly to see my lashes becoming longer and thicker than before.  </li>
            <li>I am about 3 months in now and my lashes are MUCH fuller and back to their original color.</li>
            <li>But my lashes are definitely nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the letter, and finally I could curl the lashes on my left eye for a bit more definition.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>There must be a reason they have changed the ingredients for older version to make the new one softer.</li>
            <li>My lashes have grown in to look about like normal, so maybe the Marini lash helped them to do that.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy more.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m growing any more lashes than usual, and they aren&#x27;t any thicker or longer, either.    </li>
            <li>I never tried the old formula, so cannot compare</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past (and liked it) and those wands were very wet when pulled out and the product lasted the amount of time specified.  </li>
            <li>lashes had become super short and pale, giving me a ghostly look.&lt;br</li>

            <li> The newer version of the Jan Marini eyelash conditioner works just fine on me, it probably does not work as crazy as older one</li>
            <li> It doesn burn a tad bit when applied but not for long.</li>
            <li> The tubes are almost empty.  </li>
            <li> and it is practically empty.</li>
            <li> So far, I am not very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> There are still spots where I&#x27;m missing some lashes, and my lashes aren&#x27;t long.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to try using the product until there is no more product left.</li>
            <li> Just finished a tube of the new formula (5 months of daily application) and I am sad to say my old eyelashes are back, the thickness and length are gone :(   </li>
            <li> but my eyelashes grow little by little</li>
            <li> So, this was a waste of alot of money, product is not cheap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it does nothing to your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I tried Marini lash instead of Lilash because there was no warning against using it while breastfeeding (at least not that I could find).      </li>
            <li> I purchased a years&#x27; supply of eyelash conditioner and received a product that expires in one month, therefore rendering the product useless and a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> The newer version of the Jan Marini eyelash conditioner works just fine on me, it probably does not work as crazy as older one but my eyelashes grow little by little, you can still tell the difference within a month. There must be a reason they have changed the ingredients for older version to make the new one softer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a month,just as directed and as of yet have not seen any change whatsoever.  I will give it a chance and continue to use for a longer period of time to see if this changes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about eyelashes conditioner, but I bought this as my gf&#x27;s birthday gift, she falls in love with this product! Now we are going to get more!!! And the price is much cheaper than before!!! Dont hesitate ! Get one and try!</li>
            <li> I like to think that my lashes have, in fact, gotten longer, but I probably should have taken before and after pictures to confirm. At any rate, I&#x27;m happy with the results, considering I didn&#x27;t have to pay the FULL PRICE for it.</li>
            <li> The tubes are almost empty.  There is almost no serum on the wand when it is pulled out of the tube.  I have used this product in the past (and liked it) and those wands were very wet when pulled out and the product lasted the amount of time specified.  I&#x27;ve only used these two weeks and it is practically empty.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend. It worked for me and I had people asking if I had fake eyelashes on :)</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS AND IT DOES WORK! YOU MUST USE EVERY NIGHT THOUGH-IF YOU DONT YOU WILL NOT SEE AS GREAT RESULTS.LONG, DARK, CURLY LASHES...............WOW!</li>
            <li> I used this product EVERY DAY for 15 weeks and saw SOME improvement. I followed the directions to the letter, and finally I could curl the lashes on my left eye for a bit more definition.  I also had to use a lash-building mascara to get these results.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy more.  Maybe.</li>
            <li> I used the old formula of the Jan Marini eyelash conditioner--had fantastic results--eyelashes up into my eyebrows!!  Everyone noticed.  Just finished a tube of the new formula (5 months of daily application) and I am sad to say my old eyelashes are back, the thickness and length are gone :(   I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I had short, damaged lashes after removing my eyelash extensions.  I tried Marini lash instead of Lilash because there was no warning against using it while breastfeeding (at least not that I could find).      A friend of mine had amazing results within a month with Lilash, and I was hoping for the same experience.     My lashes have grown in to look about like normal, so maybe the Marini lash helped them to do that.  I&#x27;m not sure.  But my lashes are definitely nothing special.  There are still spots where I&#x27;m missing some lashes, and my lashes aren&#x27;t long.  It doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m growing any more lashes than usual, and they aren&#x27;t any thicker or longer, either.    I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars in case my results improve with more time, but I&#x27;m not feeling optimistic.</li>
            <li> It is just amazing. I used to applied mascara. But after used Jan Marini eye-lash about two weeks, I clearly to see my lashes becoming longer and thicker than before.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Well I have used this product for almost a month and I have not noticed any changed in the length of my lashes. I will continue to try using the product until there is no more product left. So far, I am not very happy with the product. So, this was a waste of alot of money, product is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I see no difference I have been using it day and night religiously Am and Pm don&#x27;t think I will ever order it again.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. It doesn burn a tad bit when applied but not for long. I see not difference at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased a years&#x27; supply of eyelash conditioner and received a product that expires in one month, therefore rendering the product useless and a waste of money.  I didn&#x27;t notice the expiration date until after I had opened it and the company refused to take it back...</li>
            <li> good product and fast shipping!  good seller, happy with purchase and would do business again!  I have had the product for a couple of weeks now, but do fee like it is kind of getting low...would anticipate it lasting for a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I never tried the old formula, so cannot compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes had become super short and pale, giving me a ghostly look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 3-4 weeks for the results to kick in. I am about 3 months in now and my lashes are MUCH fuller and back to their original color. I went to put falsh eyelashes on for my Halloween costume and found I didn&#x27;t need them after I applied mascara to the ones I now have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the sort of thing that works for some and not for others.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it does nothing to your eyelashes. I have been using jan marini products for years but this is a big dissappointment. Save your money!</li>
