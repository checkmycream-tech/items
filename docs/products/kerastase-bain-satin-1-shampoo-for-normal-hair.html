            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>This product has been a staple with us but the ease of finding this one without having to pay salon prices was wonderful!</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a great deal of volume!  </li>
            <li>This might just have not been the best choice for my hair.</li>
            <li>I find Kerastase is the best shampoo for me.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Great, light scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair feeling very clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a great product that&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something more moisturizing, so I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li>It might be ok for someone that already has hair</li>
            <li>love how my hair looks and feels now.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is my favorite of anything I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Seems like alot for a shampoo thats just ok</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a product if it works, this did not work for me or my daughters.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>There might be better product out thre, but I have not found it.</li>
            <li>Your hair will love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This shampoo scent is very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and got body and texture I didn&#x27;t know existed</li>
            <li>We have fine hair and colored treated.  </li>
            <li>It cleans the hair and leaves it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Really love this product, my hair looks and feels so fresh and shiny.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to repair, restore, or smooth my hair like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>At just about $30 plus shipping, I don&#x27;t really find much difference between Kerastase and Pantene ingredients wise.</li>
            <li>I get good lather from it, immediately my hair feels soft which for me is unusual with shampoos.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>Kerastase has a nice selection for different types of hair.</li>
            <li>I have always had shiney hair, and was always healthy, but it just seems that this pricey shampoo (I use the same brand of conditioner) that has worked  for almost two decades is off!</li>
            <li>I love Kerastase and will pay the extra money for it.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to most fragrances in general but this has a very fresh gentle fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure these chemicals are good for your hair...</li>
            <li>Maybe the company should consider to make a large bottle.</li>
            <li>I have also started washing every other day and it works great, doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>My hair feels much healthier.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about five years now and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>But it was so much cheaper on line</li>
            <li>But as a salon brand, I really don&#x27;t understand the price for what is in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The shampoo along with the masque really make a difference to my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t say this very often</li>
            <li>I order the whole Kerastase set by l&#x27;oreal</li>
            <li>Highly recommend product!</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo for someone with thin hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal</li>
            <li>When I first started taking care of my hair, I searched high and low for a good moisture shampoo with no success until this.  </li>
            <li>Same as full price version at salon.</li>
            <li>A small quantity of the shampoo is all that is necessary for each use, so it has been more economical for me to use as well.</li>
            <li>yes, on the expensive side, but if you want to banish split ends and enjoy soft healthy hair, this is what you need.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to read the ingredients on the bottle when I received this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching to all natural.</li>
            <li>This Bain 1 leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Only shampoo that only requires a tiny bit to attain a rich lather.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll drop $25 on the tiny bottle and it won&#x27;t have the genuine smell, won&#x27;t produce tons of suds with a small amount, won&#x27;t leave your hair unbelievably smooth, and won&#x27;t be composed of the same ingredients which L&#x27;oreal spent millions of dollars researching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Straight, by all accounts &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; not greasy or dry.  </li>
            <li>Its true about its not the same you buy on the beauty salon, changr color and smell, but its working, i feel my hair same way as i used the other one</li>
            <li>Worth the price, as you use so little</li>
            <li>A little more expensive but totally worth the extra dollars.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves Kerastase, had me buy this particular bottle and one other through Amazon, and it just was not the same shampoo she gets at the salon.</li>
            <li>Apparently it smells different, lathers different, and now her hair looks different (not that I can tell, but I&#x27;m a guy).</li>
            <li>Ive got straight dark long hair.</li>

            <li> The color of the plastic bottle is a little different, the smell of it is not the same, it lathers different, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine these chemicals helping your hair in the long run...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> My hair has become dry as I age.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often unless my hair is very dry.  </li>
            <li> Just use a little bit and make it last.</li>
            <li> And, since you need only a small amount, this size lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Be careful, people.</li>
            <li> Not the silk i expected.</li>
            <li> So a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Im half black and half white.</li>
            <li> Be very careful buying this product online.</li>
            <li> I have bleach blonde hair that isn&#x27;t hard but damaged.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not build on your scalp or weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> Was shocked at the difference so quickly.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little oily.</li>
            <li> I have very delicate, dry, brittle hair</li>
            <li> She just got back from the salon and the stylist immediately recognized she&#x27;d been using fake and/or crappy shampoo.</li>
            <li> You also need very little shampoo because of how thick it is.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to find something that is moisturizing without making my hair feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t build up so your hair will never get dull</li>
            <li> After I used this product, it made my hair stiff and very hard.</li>
            <li> Be realistic with your expectations and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Seriously just spend the money!  </li>
            <li> Fake!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great! Still looking for various functional products sold on Amazon</li>
            <li> Seriously just spend the money!  All these products are WONDERFUL. Be realistic with your expectations and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Fake! It&#x27;s all fake!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t cut corners and shop on Amazon for kerastasse. You&#x27;ll drop $25 on the tiny bottle and it won&#x27;t have the genuine smell, won&#x27;t produce tons of suds with a small amount, won&#x27;t leave your hair unbelievably smooth, and won&#x27;t be composed of the same ingredients which L&#x27;oreal spent millions of dollars researching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached: What it should look like</li>
            <li> Love how great this makes my hair feel. Worth the money. Im half black and half white.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo.  My hair feels much healthier. I use this shampoo with kerastese conditioner. The best prices are found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Its true about its not the same you buy on the beauty salon, changr color and smell, but its working, i feel my hair same way as i used the other one</li>
            <li> I was expecting something more moisturizing, so I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  It might be ok for someone that already has hair that&#x27;s a little oily.</li>
            <li> yes, on the expensive side, but if you want to banish split ends and enjoy soft healthy hair, this is what you need. And, since you need only a small amount, this size lasts a long time. I have been using this product for about five years now and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years but have always gone to local salon to buy (authorized dealer).  But it was so much cheaper on line I had to give it a try.  There is just something off with this bottle.  The color of the plastic bottle is a little different, the smell of it is not the same, it lathers different, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  I did have a problem with my hairdresser with the last color, but that was months ago.  I have always had shiney hair, and was always healthy, but it just seems that this pricey shampoo (I use the same brand of conditioner) that has worked  for almost two decades is off!</li>
            <li> Be very careful buying this product online. My wife loves Kerastase, had me buy this particular bottle and one other through Amazon, and it just was not the same shampoo she gets at the salon. It looks like it, but it&#x27;s not it. Apparently it smells different, lathers different, and now her hair looks different (not that I can tell, but I&#x27;m a guy). She just got back from the salon and the stylist immediately recognized she&#x27;d been using fake and/or crappy shampoo. The stylist had to wash her hair three times to get all of the weirdness out. So now I&#x27;m on here spreading the word. Be careful, people.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! I am sensitive to most fragrances in general but this has a very fresh gentle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair feeling very clean!</li>
            <li> Was shocked at the difference so quickly. I have fine hair and got body and texture I didn&#x27;t know existed</li>
            <li> I started using this in March....love how my hair looks and feels now.  I have also started washing every other day and it works great, doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to read the ingredients on the bottle when I received this product.  At just about $30 plus shipping, I don&#x27;t really find much difference between Kerastase and Pantene ingredients wise. Does the shampoo work? Yes! It cleans the hair and leaves it silky smooth.

            <li> I love Kerastase and will pay the extra money for it. The shampoo along with the masque really make a difference to my hair</li>
            <li> Great, light scent.  This shampoo does not build on your scalp or weigh your hair down.  Try it!  You&#x27;ll end up trying products within the Kerastase line.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is my favorite of anything I have ever tried.  I have very delicate, dry, brittle hair and it is hard to find something that is moisturizing without making my hair feel greasy.  I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Really love this product, my hair looks and feels so fresh and shiny. Totally recommend this product. Worth the price</li>
            <li> Seems like alot for a shampoo thats just ok</li>
            <li> excellent product on time and excellent quality of the product the ratting is positive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin 1 Shampoo I recommend this product an the seller</li>
            <li> I have bra-strap length relaxed hair. When I first started taking care of my hair, I searched high and low for a good moisture shampoo with no success until this.  I don&#x27;t use it often unless my hair is very dry.  I get good lather from it, immediately my hair feels soft which for me is unusual with shampoos. It is me trusted shampoo after henna treatments. I don&#x27;t say this very often but I will try to never be without this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I loooove this product!</li>
            <li> I order the whole Kerastase set by l&#x27;oreal they work wonderfull on my hair..my hair is looking grat and feeling beautifull.I do recommend these product 100%!!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever. Worth the price, as you use so little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different high-end shampoos in my life, but never ever have I had as noticeable of a difference in my hair as I did after I used this product. Immediately after drying my hair it felt stronger. It is pricey, so I&#x27;ll usually alternate between this and another drug store shampoo to make it last longer. The price is the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 and not 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these for me and my daughters...We have fine hair and colored treated.  Didn&#x27;t notice any change.&lt;br /&gt;Went back to Wen...I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a product if it works, this did not work for me or my daughters.....would not buy again..</li>
            <li> This was delivered as promised.  I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo, however i believe the size of it is too small.  Maybe the company should consider to make a large bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 10 years. I have thin hair but a lot of it. Straight, by all accounts &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; not greasy or dry.  This Bain 1 leaves my hair soft and shiny.  It&#x27;s expensive but worth it! it doesn&#x27;t build up so your hair will never get dull and there&#x27;s nothing in it to harm any color you may have added. Just use a little bit and make it last. It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> My hair has become dry as I age.  This product hels alleviate the dryness.  There might be better product out thre, but I have not found it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Same as full price version at salon. Only shampoo that only requires a tiny bit to attain a rich lather. Highly recommend product!</li>
            <li> A little more expensive but totally worth the extra dollars.  Your hair will love it.</li>
            <li> This product has been a staple with us but the ease of finding this one without having to pay salon prices was wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for someone with thin hair.  It gives your hair a great deal of volume!  You also need very little shampoo because of how thick it is. So a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This shampoo scent is very clean and smooth.  A tiny amount is all it takes to lather your mid length hair.  It&#x27;s definitely a great product that&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ive used kerastase before and loved it. This might just have not been the best choice for my hair. Ive got straight dark long hair. This product leaves it very shiny but a little dry. Not the silk i expected.</li>
            <li> I find Kerastase is the best shampoo for me.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair looking and feeling healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I always recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Kerastase products are used in the best salons in my city, because they improve the quality and management characteristics of hair. A small quantity of the shampoo is all that is necessary for each use, so it has been more economical for me to use as well.</li>
            <li> Good produkt used by proffesional hirestylists...!</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the ingredient list before I bought this shampoo. The second ingredient is sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is light and has a wonderful fragrance that is enjoyable for shampooing hair.  This shampoo is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I have bleach blonde hair that isn&#x27;t hard but damaged. After I used this product, it made my hair stiff and very hard. It didn&#x27;t seem to repair, restore, or smooth my hair like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal</li>
            <li> Excellent Product .. I love it</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair stylist and perfect for my hair. Kerastase has a nice selection for different types of hair.</li>
