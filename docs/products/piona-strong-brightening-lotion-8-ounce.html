    <ol>
            <li>It is still the best product out there!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely impressed by its results.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great!  </li>
            <li>Everyone thinks I have make up on,it looks that awesome!</li>
            <li>Just a lotion no bleaching the cream is wonderful</li>
            <li>That just tells you how good these products are.</li>
            <li>Good product but slower results than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>but God is good</li>
            <li>However, i bet this is just as good as the bleaching cream.</li>
            <li>Its good bleaching cream for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>its ok, didn&#x27;t gave great results</li>
            <li>All of piona&#x27;s products are amazing.</li>
            <li>Does not work as good as the cream, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I must be honest, I have using the lotion with Kojie San soap and the combination works wonders.</li>
            <li>not as fast as I&#x27;d like, lol,</li>
            <li>It needs to offer auto-ship,just a suggestion:)</li>
            <li>I had a lot of blemishes that occurs every cycle time and since using Piona Strong bleaching cream and lotion, My spots are fading away and my skin looks even.</li>
            <li>In the add it is listed as Strong Bleaching lotion</li>
            <li>The lotion is not as strong as the cream</li>
            <li>Its works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>but thankfully Im light brown</li>
            <li>it might be because you didnt look at the head of the bottle where it says &#x27;twist to open&#x27; lol</li>
            <li>Probably why it is significantly cheaper than the cream.  </li>
            <li>, I think that the price increase is not customer friendly.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims to do, not only does it tones your skin, it gives your skin a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>Am getting ready to order some more.</li>
            <li>It does not work, it doesn&#x27;t smell good and it leaves skin dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>I have used the crème and have seen significant change but it made my skin tender to the touch and very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I wanted that at first but didnt have the money for it</li>
            <li>I usually only buy the piona strong bleaching cream in the jar which goes for about 38.00.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks much lighter but after a while it causes me acne around my chest and under my armpit.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to everyone who wants to have even tone skin.</li>
            <li>It really works without looking too bleached out.</li>
            <li>so noone said to much.</li>
            <li>milk chocolate) girl and the product clears skin amazingly fast in a period of two weeks.</li>
            <li>My problem area was my neck, which was much darker than my face.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>the cream is very strong and may lighten skin a few shades lighter than desired if the user is overzealous with treatment.</li>
            <li>However, if they keep going up in price because of high demand I will stop buying and will recommend others to stop buying because that&#x27;s why people buy their product.</li>
            <li>In the ad and in the picture it says &amp;#34;Piona strong bleaching lotion&amp;#34; that I ordered/purchased of which I need to bleach my dark blemishes on my skin</li>
            <li>When I used the cream consistently for over two weeks, the colour of my neck lightened and is now the same shade as the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike the cream and soap the lotion is complete garbage and drying to the skin.  </li>
            <li>No change so far.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It works exactly as it should for my sister and other people that I know.</li>
            <li>the lotion dries out the skin and is not effective, even after two bottles I still have not seen any significant changes.</li>
            <li>they made a mistake and sent me what i really wanted for half the price.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> This particular location works slow but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Nothing changed waste of use not recommend</li>
            <li> This lotion is very disappointing.  Unlike the cream and soap the lotion is complete garbage and drying to the skin.  Probably why it is significantly cheaper than the cream.  If you like the cream and looking for the same effect that the cream gives my suggestion is spend the money and buy the cream instead and buy often.</li>
            <li> This particular product is a darn mess.  I only brought is because it is the lotion for the entire body.  I usually only buy the piona strong bleaching cream in the jar which goes for about 38.00.  This lotion was too expensive first of all and does not work.  I use this one my face, feet, legs and back and havent seen not one improvement since I started using it.  The pump doesn&#x27;t work so I had to open and pour it our.  Don&#x27;t buy this mess.  I will stick to what I know works which is the one in the jar 4oz size.</li>
            <li> its ok, didn&#x27;t gave great results</li>
            <li> In the ad and in the picture it says &amp;#34;Piona strong bleaching lotion&amp;#34; that I ordered/purchased of which I need to bleach my dark blemishes on my skin but unfortunately I received &amp;#34;Piona brightening body lotion&amp;#34;...what&#x27;s up with that?</li>
            <li> No change so far. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Stick with the cream only</li>
            <li> the lotion dries out the skin and is not effective, even after two bottles I still have not seen any significant changes. I have used the crème and have seen significant change but it made my skin tender to the touch and very sensitive. I would not recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I like it...&lt;br /&gt; My skin looks much lighter but after a while it causes me acne around my chest and under my armpit.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone who wants to have even tone skin. I had a lot of blemishes that occurs every cycle time and since using Piona Strong bleaching cream and lotion, My spots are fading away and my skin looks even. It really works without looking too bleached out. And the soap. Am getting ready to order some more. That just tells you how good these products are.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Smells like the dentist office\\&quot;  - That&#x27;s what my husband told me after I put on the lotion.  It does not work, it doesn&#x27;t smell good and it leaves skin dry and itchy.  I don&#x27;t even see any changes on my skin tone.  My color only got lighter because of less exposure to sunlight due to cold weather.  Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion but it is expensive. It works on blemishes and dark spots but for the size it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for three (3) weeks now and I am seeing the marks on my legs fading gradually.....not as fast as I&#x27;d like, lol, but it works once you have the patience. Don&#x27;t expect a miracle overnight.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as it should for my sister and other people that I know. It however didn&#x27;t work as well for me. Different skin type I guess. It is still the best product out there!!!</li>
            <li> just follow the instructions and it will work wonders for you. i use it to spot treat blackheads and other discoloration and so far i have no complaints</li>
            <li> Good product but slower results than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion since 2013 and I&#x27;m extremely impressed by its results. My skin looks great!  It has corrected my once uneven skin tone. Everyone thinks I have make up on,it looks that awesome! I use it all over my body now. It needs to offer auto-ship,just a suggestion:)</li>
            <li> No it did nothing for my hands!</li>
            <li> Smells bad and it does not work.</li>
            <li> It works, but will make your skin extremely dry; double up on moisturiser.</li>
            <li> Its works just fine for me. I shower with likas papaya soap and then put this on. My dark spots lightened too. As long as you are patient and use it everyday. I use it all over my face and body because I have dark spots EVERYWHERE small but annoying. It lightened my skin up but thankfully Im light brown so noone said to much. Its small but not THAT little of a bottle. If you have a hard time opening it...it might be because you didnt look at the head of the bottle where it says &#x27;twist to open&#x27; lol</li>
            <li> In the add it is listed as Strong Bleaching lotion but when I received my bottle it just said Piona Bleaching Lotion. What&#x27;s up with that</li>
            <li> Does not work as good as the cream, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> The product is works but remember we have different skin types so what works for me may not work for you.  I will give it 5 because this product works well for me however, I think that the price increase is not customer friendly.</li>
            <li> Just a lotion no bleaching the cream is wonderful</li>
            <li> This product works in an short period of time.  I am a dark skin (milk chocolate) girl and the product clears skin amazingly fast in a period of two weeks. My problem area was my neck, which was much darker than my face. When I used the cream consistently for over two weeks, the colour of my neck lightened and is now the same shade as the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, warning... the cream is very strong and may lighten skin a few shades lighter than desired if the user is overzealous with treatment. One thing I have noticed is, it thins out skin and leaves you susceptible to sun damage.  A must when using Piona is sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not worth it...doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> works but at some point, the sides of your face will start to go dark</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims to do, not only does it tones your skin, it gives your skin a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> the reason I am giving this 5 star is because i didnt get the lotion they sent me the wrong thing with was the 4oz piona strong bleaching cream. I wanted that at first but didnt have the money for it so I got this but God is good they made a mistake and sent me what i really wanted for half the price. However, i bet this is just as good as the bleaching cream. All of piona&#x27;s products are amazing. However, if they keep going up in price because of high demand I will stop buying and will recommend others to stop buying because that&#x27;s why people buy their product. Its good bleaching cream for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Did not revive item/ product</li>
            <li> The lotion is not as strong as the cream</li>
            <li> This lotion is a waste of money do not buy this it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> No..just made my skin smell different</li>
            <li> It really works. Must use a few weeks before you start to notice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for two months. I wanted to lighten my arms which were darker than the rest of my body. My arms have lightened two shades lighter. I must be honest, I have using the lotion with Kojie San soap and the combination works wonders. Now, I don&#x27;t feel like a freak for having 3 different skin tones on the same body.</li>
            <li> takes a long time for evidence.</li>
