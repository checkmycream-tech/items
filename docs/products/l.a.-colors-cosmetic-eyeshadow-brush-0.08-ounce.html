            <li>I Love</li>
            <li>Love Love</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re great for just having in your kit and knowing the application of your product won&#x27;t skip and have the cheap choppy look</li>
            <li>But since thier smaller it works way better for applying..love them..!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I needed a new shadow brush as really quick for cheap since I have had my exotools shadow brush for years now</li>
            <li>These are too large for my eyelids!  </li>
            <li>Blends very well allowing you to have a smokey or more natural eye shadow</li>
            <li>I will give an update after some use and the first time I wash them.</li>
            <li>I think they both are a perfect size, and I have small deep set eyes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft &amp; tapered nicely, just too big for what I needed them for.</li>
            <li>The blending brush doesn&#x27;t blend very well, the bristles are falling out BEFORE I washed it, and when I washed it, the metal piece holding the bristles to the handle came off the handle.</li>
            <li>These brushes have kept their shape really well.</li>
            <li>The blender really does the blending well.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are great; thick enough to cover your eyelid quickly and so so soft.</li>
            <li>Nice fluffy bristles &amp; very soft.</li>
            <li>they are both very soft and work very well.</li>
            <li>Considering how expensive getting make up brushes can be, I was really happy with the price and quality of this product.</li>
            <li>the pic looked like they were normal length.</li>
            <li>I gave four stars because wish it was longer, but the brushes are nice and fluffy have not washed them yet but makes applying shadow much easier than just my flat brushes..</li>
            <li>Also the top of one brush was loose from the handle, had to shove it back on.</li>
            <li>The shader brush does apply shadow well for the lid because it&#x27;s such a large brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and out spreads the color so evenly.</li>
            <li>( I know how to wash my brushes and use a good cleaner so if there is something wrong after washing them</li>
            <li>Price is much higher at the stores and other websites.</li>
            <li>I have a set for each major color combo</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, shorter on one brush, longer on the other and, so far, I have not noticed any falling out.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> good brushes , great deal.</li>
            <li> These work great but the stick is really short. I put these in my glass bowl with the rest of my brushes and these two get lost because there so short. I don&#x27;t know why you would make them this way and the pic looked like they were normal length. Oh well these do work fine and if you want something on the shorter side to put in a small makeup bag then these are perfect but I like mine long or at least normal length for my glass brush holder...</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok. The shader brush does apply shadow well for the lid because it&#x27;s such a large brush. The blending brush doesn&#x27;t blend very well, the bristles are falling out BEFORE I washed it, and when I washed it, the metal piece holding the bristles to the handle came off the handle. I&#x27;m having to glue it back on somehow. Not happy with that, but the shader brush kept me from giving this a 1 star.</li>
            <li> L.A. Colors cosmetics are the best next to Elf cosmetics. Inexpensive and gets the job done as well. I&#x27;m loving these two brushes and they are in my kit to bring eyes to life! I love them!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great; thick enough to cover your eyelid quickly and so so soft. I only needed one, though. Would be nice not to have to buy them both together.</li>
            <li> I thought these brushes were going to be longer. But since thier smaller it works way better for applying..love them..!</li>
            <li> I got those brushes before and they are still the same , but I got those from this seller because of the blue handles turns out I got  the black handles , I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shadow brush as really quick for cheap since I have had my exotools shadow brush for years now and it has finally started to be a bit spread out. And I found these at my local family dollar and got them ( I got them for $2 at my store ) and the handles feel good in my hand. They look very nice and the blending brush bristles aren&#x27;t too long do it is impossible to blend it where you need. I will give an update after some use and the first time I wash them. ( I know how to wash my brushes and use a good cleaner so if there is something wrong after washing them it is the brush and not how I washed them. Lol )</li>
            <li> These brushes have totally exceeded my expectations! I absolutely love them!! Definitely worth the price. Nice fluffy bristles &amp; very soft.</li>
            <li> I use the wider brush every single time I apply eye shadow. It&#x27;s a must! Blends very well allowing you to have a smokey or more natural eye shadow</li>
            <li> Best product at Best Price. Price is much higher at the stores and other websites. Love the brushes and sure it will do the job for a while.</li>
            <li> I have always just used the little spongy applicators that came with eye shadow, but I wanted to try the brushes. I just live these, my eye shadow goes on so much smoother and very easy!! They are not to big or small, the one that is a little bigger, it&#x27;s suppose to be that way so you can blend, blend and blend!! Yes it would be to big to put on for your crease of your eye lid, but it&#x27;s not for that. I think they both are a perfect size, and I have small deep set eyes.</li>
            <li> Pretty well made, I&#x27;ve had a small amount of shedding from one brush but nothing to be concerned about. These brushes have kept their shape really well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are reasonable priced and work great. The blender really does the blending well.  I hairs stay in place, I have not experienced any fall out</li>
            <li> I use them for sparkle nail art . Works great !</li>
            <li> I was expecting much smaller brushes.  These are too large for my eyelids!  Also the top of one brush was loose from the handle, had to shove it back on. The bristles are soft &amp; tapered nicely, just too big for what I needed them for.</li>
            <li> VERY CHEAP DO NOT BUY IT!!! The brushes are not good quality and one brush just came off. THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap but perfectly made. It&#x27;s the best brush for the crease. It&#x27;s a good dupe for the Sigma e40 and Mac 217. My holy grail.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that these brushes have a shorter handle. I tend to sit close to my makeup mirror, and a long-handled brush gets in the way. I use them to blend out the edges of my shadow, and they do the job excellently. The bristles are very soft, shorter on one brush, longer on the other and, so far, I have not noticed any falling out. If in the future they begin to shed, I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes! they are both very soft and work very well. I also like the length of the brushes because i tend to hold the mirror close to my face. Over all good price and quality.</li>
            <li> I have to confess, I bought these for a friend and kept them for myself.  When I took them out the packaging they were calling to me saying, &#x27;open me&#x27; lol....so I did.  They&#x27;re great for just having in your kit and knowing the application of your product won&#x27;t skip and have the cheap choppy look simply because the price was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the handles are short, so these are definitely made for a travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I gave four stars because wish it was longer, but the brushes are nice and fluffy have not washed them yet but makes applying shadow much easier than just my flat brushes..</li>
            <li> I love the blender brush! The bristles are so soft and out spreads the color so evenly. The shader brush was a bonus. Great value!</li>
            <li> These two brushes are perfect. With all the eye shadow colors one collects with makeup nowadays, I find having many little brushes like this a great convenience. I have a set for each major color combo I use (for a total of three color sets). The LONGER brush is perfect for applying eye shadow to the lid, while the SHORTER, stubbier brush is perfect for applying the crease line color along the ridge. The brushes are well made and I find the length of the handles just perfect for graceful use. I have other brushes with longer handles but these L.A. brushes are actually my favorites.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy these brushes from amazon but I did buy them from a local Family Dollar store. They&#x27;re a good price and they work perfect for me. I Love Love Love These 2 brushes I can use them to do my eyeshadow look daily, the brushes are soft and the bristles do come loose but not as often as other brushes. I would recommend these if you do your eye makeup daily.</li>
            <li> Considering how expensive getting make up brushes can be, I was really happy with the price and quality of this product. I&#x27;m really happy I found this product and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> the blending brush shed a bit. the brush are bigger than i thought, but it worked</li>
