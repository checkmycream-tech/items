            <li> i like the frafrance. i have using it for years.</li>
            <li> Too bad this wonderful line of products is not widely available anymore. Fragrances today are based to much on Madison Ave. Good for mr though, I have enjoyed this scent for many years and I continue to enjoy it as \\&quot;my scent\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The deodorant from Paul Sebastian was changed to a stronger, more poignant scent. It literally is a different product. It&#x27;s not the scent that combines citrus and florals with the warmth of musk and woods. I hope they return to the original formula. So buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Great scent and a reaonable price. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find simply a deodorant in a designer fragrance that smells great, this is it. Compared to the few that are still left, this ones price is unbeatable.  Smell better my friends.</li>
            <li> Be very careful.  This is not the original product.  It was reformulated and the scent was changed.  It is not alcohol-based anymore.  I spoke with the manufacturer (Elizabeth Arden) and they \\&quot;are looking into it.\\&quot;  So, buyer beware - this is not what you were expecting.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance on my husband. The Deodarant works well. I wish I could find the body talc to go with it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new stick deodorant  so I ordered it and tried it but wasn&#x27;t impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my Dad each year and he loves it.  It&#x27;s the only deodorant that will work well for him since he is outside working all day and it keeps him fresh.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and reminds me of my grandfather.</li>
            <li> Have had a hard time finding PS products for my husband.  One of his favorites and was delivered right on time.</li>
            <li> All the girls gather round when I wear  deodorant &amp; aftershave</li>
            <li> My husband has used Paul Sebastian cologne for years.  It is his and my favorite scent.  The deodorant is a nice addition to the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this deodorant. I never bought the original one that other reviewers are complaining about. So if you&#x27;ve never tried THIS deodorant, it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same scent I had as a gift several years ago. It&#x27;s O.K., just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The company took what was in my opinion the best deodorant made and turned it into a product that does not even work.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this deodorant since it first came out.  He has always liked it and I love the fragrance.  Now they have ruined it.  Bought 11 and when they arrived, thought it was bad stock.  Sent back and received 11 more, same issue.  Researched and found the formula was changed.  Will return the last batch and now have to find a deodorant we both like.  Gee Elizabeth Arden, thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> pretty good product.  wouldnt buy it again though.</li>
            <li> extremely too hard to roll on</li>
