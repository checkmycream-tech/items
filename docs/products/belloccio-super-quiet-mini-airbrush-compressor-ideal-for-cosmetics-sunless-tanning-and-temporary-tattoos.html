    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When, after a year, my Luminess airbrush compressor slowed and stopped working, I bought this little beauty! Waaay better than the Luminess, has more power and I love that it has different speeds. I knocked off 1 star, simply because it is not quiet. It doesn&#x27;t sound like an airplane landing, but it certainly isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34;. I would most definitely recommend this airbrush compressor!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even work at all when I received it. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> There were no hoses in the package so the tool is useless.  I am searching for hoses.  Why were the hoses not included like in the picture?</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I thought it&#x27;d be a universal compressor. It&#x27;s not. It take a little hose only and won&#x27;t work with a real airbrush. It doesn&#x27;t come with said brush though so for me it&#x27;s useless</li>
            <li> Ordered with the makeup airbrush  Both items came with no instructions what so ever.</li>
            <li> The best! I love how it has different settings. It is so quite too ! I bought mine in 2013 and it is still going strong.  I am referring it to a friend as well.</li>
            <li> SO FAR THIS IS GREAT. I LIKE THE DIFFERENT SPEEDS AND IT HAS A WARRANTY STATED ON THE ADD WHEN YOU BUY IT. I WILL ADD MORE AFTER I USE IT AWHILE LONGER. I HAVE ONLY HAD IT A FEW DAYS, BUT I WAS LOST WITHOUT IT. I HAD T USE BOTTLED MAKE UP AND IT IS SO HEAVY ON YOUR FACE AND DOESN&#x27;T LAST.</li>
            <li> I bought this air brush thinking it was complete. I had to buy a compressor after that.  I tried to use it and I still haven&#x27;t been able to do it without making a mess.  The first time I used it nothing happened. Then after reading and rereading the instructions I still had to ask my husband how to use it, he uses one for the car models he makes.  The next morning I tried it again and I turned on the compressor and before I had a chance to do anything the top blew off the cup that holds the liquid makeup and it shot it everywhere but on me.  OK so much for that, I still need to have my husband show me now to use the air brush so it doesn&#x27;t explode again.  I know I will get it down pat it just takes some patience  and someone who has used an airbrush before.  I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong with the air brush, but I have found that a lot of items that I buy do not come with any detailed instructions to explain what and what not to do.  I still am not giving up.  I really love the effects of the airbrush and no matter what I will master it.</li>
            <li> It is not super quiet...quite the contrary louder than other brands my coworkers use...disappointed!I had hoped to appear more professional...not!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes will not start up, intermittent issue.</li>
            <li> I like it lot  it work good</li>
            <li> can I use this product with any Airbrush compresor?</li>
            <li> I researched a long time before purchasing the Belloccio and I am glad I did.  This one looks sleek and sexy with the chrome finish and looks great on my dressing table.  It is really easy to use and to switch between high/medium/low and is fairly quiet.  It works well and is powerful for it&#x27;s size.  I paired this with an inexpensive airbrush gun (instead of the Belloccio) that is also on Amazon for about $10 and it is compatible and works well with it.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my dinair compressor that stopped working.  I wasn&#x27;t sure because of very few reviews.  I am glad I bought it, it works much better!  Just hooked it to my current spray gun and hose.  I seemed to have lots of trouble with my old lineup.  I was always having to take apart the Dinair gun and thoroughly clean it.  (like almost daily)  This compressor has much more force behind it so it rarely clogs.  I can just do my daily clean and a good deep clean every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t put this to real good use yet but it looks promising. If it is not good in 6 months I will update my review</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get a refund for a return since Nov. and it is the end of Jan. They are stating they didnt get the return but the USPS tracking # that I have states otherwise. Their customer service sux, if you want a product sold by them find it elsewhere because if you need to return or have questions they are not very attentive....these are not the people to buy from.</li>
            <li> the motor is a little loud but its ok... your voice at normal speaking lever 60 decibels will be louder than the motor...</li>
            <li> This compressor was bought to rival the Luminess system for much lower cost.  It worked like a charm.  The plug and air hose are lengthy to provide enough room to move around.  Very nice addition to my beauty counter.  It is very easy to use.  Just remember that this is just the compressor.  Order the airbrush separately.</li>
            <li> Belloccio Super Quiet Mini Airbrush Compressor, is  what they say it is. Shiny chrome, light weight, and quiet and compact. Have not use it all that much, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> This Product is a Joke. I got the Airbrush Make up Compressor and after 1 use the Air Compressor isn&#x27;t working already. People You are better off buying a quality Product that will last You instead of trying all inexpensive Compressors. Waste of Money, will try to get my money back.</li>
            <li> !This is a superby airbrush for applying makeup. I highly recommend to all that use airbrush makeup. This should be your first choice!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. 3 different speed. I use it on the highest for bigger areas like declote or neck and on lower speed for my face.</li>
            <li> I just received my compressor today and i haven&#x27;t used it yet its actually a Christmas gift for my husband but at first glance the machine appears to be in good shape its really shiny cute and compact i hope nothing but good comes from it :)</li>
            <li> I thought the marketing materials could have been better. Because I had never seen or used one of these machines before, I made the mistake of assuming it came with the airbrush, so I had to order after I received the machine. It is pricey , so I hope to get the value out of it, over time. For now, I am really hooked on applying my makeup with an airbrush machine. It definetly gives the appearance of a professional makeup job.</li>
            <li> Have only used once.  The makeup I chose was to light.  Ordering a darker shade to mix with the lighter one so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.  Otherwise, I like the product</li>
            <li> compressor is small which is nice. I havent been able to use product yet,will give review about how it works after used. looks like a small flack.giving product 5 stars for receiving.</li>
