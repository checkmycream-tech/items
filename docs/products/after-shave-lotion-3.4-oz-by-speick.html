    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Pair it with the Speick shaving cream for best results</li>
            <li>Leaves me face feeling awesome.</li>
            <li>This aftershave is the best I&#x27;ve used for relieving razor burn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is very pleasant, although I can&#x27;t quite put a finger on what it reminds me of.</li>
            <li>This is my goto when I&#x27;ve not had the best of shaves or my skin is not having a good day.</li>
            <li>great stuff</li>
            <li>Thank&#x27;s for a great product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Great value at 15 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It conditions very nicely, and \\&quot;wakes up\\&quot; the skin for the day ahead.</li>
            <li>and that is a good thing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>I think that it is a unisex smell, but whatever the case, it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>The perfect amount of sting after a BBS shave with a double edge safety razor (the BEST shave EVER).</li>
            <li>Love the scent, pairs great with the cologne, and works wonders on the skin.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and the touch of witch hazel adds to the pleasure of using this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff has a very nice and not to over the top smell.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing, feels good on my skin and a unique scent.</li>
            <li>Despite having so many good and healthy ingredients in it, Speick aftershave is an alcohol based aftershave, so it will burn quite fiercely if you nicked yourself while shaving.</li>
            <li>You just have to read the very fine print.</li>
            <li>Great smell, really calms the skin and helps healing.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>The result was my neck being much more irritated by using this aftershave than not using it, with visible irritations and razor bumps.</li>
            <li>This stuff is liquid magic.  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t&#x27; believe how &amp;#34;oneness&amp;#34; it felt on top of my head...  </li>
            <li>Really am enjoying using this product.</li>
            <li>Sort of an old-school barbershop smell with a hint (or more) of woodiness/herbal smell.</li>
            <li>I have the soap and aftershave which I love.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and, like others here, wish it lasted a bit longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Speick aftershave splash for years and was glad to be able to buy it from Amazon now.  </li>
            <li>We both like the Proraso smell better, but I think I&#x27;ll keep this around as it seems to heal the neck a bit better.</li>
            <li>It seems to be pretty good for the healing side of things, but not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li>So to sum up, Speick smells great, fades within a half hour, and is filled with ingredients that are great for your face.</li>
            <li>Love the refreshing feeling and the clean smell.</li>
            <li>Great classic refreshing scent that doesn&#x27;t linger long, and it feels great on the face.</li>
            <li>Great scent, although I would prefer a more \\&quot;robust\\&quot; version of the same scent.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The very earthy/vegetal scent is unbalanced with a sweet background note that is not at all pleasant.</li>
            <li>feels very good.. slighty &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; but not much.</li>
            <li>Very clean and pleasant scent for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I would describe the smell as fairly light and &amp;#34;botanical&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The Speick line of products has a distinct scent that I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is clean and fresh though, and perhaps most importantly for me, it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so far!</li>
            <li>Last a good while.</li>
            <li>does a great job of tightening back up and thus making yoru aftermath skin feel that much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I see this as a positive because I do not want a strong aftershave that would conflict with my cologne.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased</li>
            <li>First, IT BURNS!</li>
            <li>It gives a strong burn when you apply it, and I found it actually made me bleed more.</li>
            <li>Crisp clean scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Morning after a thorough and good shave session finishing with Speick... i go to relmoisturize my head/face/neck and &#x27;lo and behold my head is SOOOOOOO tight and smooth</li>
            <li>Good little burn when you splash it on, but it fades into cool smoothness rather quickly without any lingering stickiness.</li>
            <li>This is a very bracing, fresh and unique scent.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Old Spice or Brut but this one is very good.</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like wet wood.</li>
            <li>This was part of a larger trial and error order of many shaving products.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m actually excited for my skin to completely clear up on this stuff hopefully soon....</li>
            <li>I purchased this aftershave as it was recommended while I was looking for a natural aftershave, free of common things that aren&#x27;t good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a perfect shave with not a single scratch, this aftershave became usable but not great.</li>
            <li>It will make the after shaving process feel very soothing.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lotion, the name is very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it  though .</li>
            <li>I really used to like Speick, but they changed the formula, and removed the Alum.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend isn&#x27;t really a fan of it either.</li>
            <li>A good subtle smell that is every soothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not bad, but different.</li>
            <li>I lightly pat it dry</li>
            <li>I was excited to see an aftershave with alum, as I sometimes get minor scratches and scrapes while shaving (I use a double-edge razor).</li>
            <li>A good basic after shave, not great not bad.</li>
            <li>and then do a few more grooming tasks while my face dries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fun to say the name properly.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice as well, though unlike some other reviewers I found it to linger too long for my taste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first serious after-shave so I can&#x27;t compare or say how good it is relative to others - i can only givfe you my impressions as a new user compared to using nothing.</li>
            <li>Unlike many aftershaves which are simply alcohol, water, and a handful of other ingredients, Speick aftershave contains witch hazel and alum</li>
            <li>That is a cool little detail that adds something to the \\&quot;quality\\&quot; of the products packaging, although most people could care less about that detail.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves the smell of it and so far it still smells after about 3 hours</li>
            <li>Maybe this just isn&#x27;t for an early 30&#x27;s guy.</li>
            <li>especially like the twist off cap, that gives a little \\&quot;pop\\&quot;, before it twirls off easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a face and neck moisturizer for the Winter after my Speick dries, and it does dry wicked fast.</li>
            <li>This does have a bit of an alcoholic burn when you put on, but it passes quickly and leaves behind a clean fresh scent, tight pores, and a face soothed of any razor irritation.</li>
            <li>But as I already said, at least unlike with other aftershaves, this one will help heal those wounds, so it&#x27;s still a highly worthwhile product.</li>
            <li>I shave at night since it takes me far too long and can&#x27;t afford the time i need in the morning (shave face and head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(among other things I&#x27;m less familiar with), which not only restore the pH balance of the skin, but also help tone and heal the face from any cuts or nicks it may have acquired during shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as &#x27;special&#x27; as the public ratings - at least to me...</li>
            <li>I put a dab of the lemon verbena on both wrists followed by pouring a little of the after shave on the wrists and rubbing together, gently.</li>

            <li> A few minutes later, and WOW!</li>
            <li> related red slight puffs over my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For two, it has alcohol in it, which is harmful for your skin and helps dry it out.  </li>
            <li> The subtle notes are what attract me to this particular brand.</li>
            <li> After a few short days i can see the difference</li>
            <li> Whether as a everyday splash-on, or just something to add to your arsenal, I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming; will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other alcohol-based aftershaves before that never did</li>
            <li> Maybe the mixture of other ingredient&#x27;s that cause that smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now equivalent to the average splash aftershave, and I don&#x27;t feel it warrants the price.</li>
            <li> Mark this one down as an error.</li>
            <li> Does have odd smell.</li>
            <li> I seem to be the odd one out here, but I was not a fan of this aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typical of today&#x27;s companies, there wasnt any notice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, this aftershave is quite harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a few aftershaves  I always keep in stock</li>
            <li> Not strong or over powering.</li>
            <li> There are a few kinds of alcohol which do not do this, unfortunately this is not one of those.</li>
            <li> After a wet shave, I splash cold water on my face and rub an alum bar on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> have weird skin and non-acne</li>
            <li> The scent is faint and short-lived, but the skin care can&#x27;t be matched.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad, like with pernaud, or proraso.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does have odd smell. It kind of smells like wet wood. Not bad, but different. Pair it with the Speick shaving cream for best results</li>
            <li> Great smell, really calms the skin and helps healing. I shave with a safety razor and Proraso shave cream and then use this and I&#x27;m loving it so far!</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this after shave solely based on favorable reviews. Glad I did. Very clean and pleasant scent for the entire day. Not overwhelming; will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I seem to be the odd one out here, but I was not a fan of this aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, one of the reasons I bought this aftershave was because it contains alum, which man use in its solid form to stop bleeding after shaving. I was excited to see an aftershave with alum, as I sometimes get minor scratches and scrapes while shaving (I use a double-edge razor). This product no longer contains alum, yet the Amazon page advertises it as containing alum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this aftershave is quite harsh. It gives a strong burn when you apply it, and I found it actually made me bleed more. If I had a tiny scrape from a shave that wasn&#x27;t bleeding, after applying this aftershave it would definitely be bleeding. The result was my neck being much more irritated by using this aftershave than not using it, with visible irritations and razor bumps. This is the opposite of what an aftershave is supposed to do! I&#x27;ve used other alcohol-based aftershaves before that never did this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a perfect shave with not a single scratch, this aftershave became usable but not great. The smell is nice as well, though unlike some other reviewers I found it to linger too long for my taste. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d order it by the 55 gallon drum if I could.  This stuff is liquid magic.  Love the scent, pairs great with the cologne, and works wonders on the skin.</li>
            <li> Been using Speick for years.. great stuff</li>
            <li> Not as &#x27;special&#x27; as the public ratings - at least to me...</li>
            <li> Disappointed. First, IT BURNS! That&#x27;s not my idea of soothing. The point is not to inflame skin after the insult of a razor. Second, the scent is cloying. The very earthy/vegetal scent is unbalanced with a sweet background note that is not at all pleasant. This was part of a larger trial and error order of many shaving products. Mark this one down as an error.</li>
            <li> feels very good.. slighty &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; but not much. does a great job of tightening back up and thus making yoru aftermath skin feel that much smoother.  I shave at night since it takes me far too long and can&#x27;t afford the time i need in the morning (shave face and head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning after a thorough and good shave session finishing with Speick... i go to relmoisturize my head/face/neck and &#x27;lo and behold my head is SOOOOOOO tight and smooth it feels like it never felt before. couldn&#x27;t&#x27; believe how &amp;#34;oneness&amp;#34; it felt on top of my head...  so tightened up it ws like glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have weird skin and non-acne related red slight puffs over my face.  After a few short days i can see the difference and I&#x27;m actually excited for my skin to completely clear up on this stuff hopefully soon....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first serious after-shave so I can&#x27;t compare or say how good it is relative to others - i can only givfe you my impressions as a new user compared to using nothing.</li>
            <li> A must have for any man who shaves. This stuff has a very nice and not to over the top smell. It will make the after shaving process feel very soothing.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing, feels good on my skin and a unique scent. Really am enjoying using this product. Last a good while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this aftershave as it was recommended while I was looking for a natural aftershave, free of common things that aren&#x27;t good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, it&#x27;s liquid, not lotion.  I was looking for a lotion, the name is very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two, it has alcohol in it, which is harmful for your skin and helps dry it out.  There are a few kinds of alcohol which do not do this, unfortunately this is not one of those.</li>
            <li> Got it today and tried it out already. My wife loves the smell of it and so far it still smells after about 3 hours and that is a good thing. I usually use Old Spice or Brut but this one is very good. It has a smell like Sandalwood but I noticed on the ingredients that there is none in it . Maybe the mixture of other ingredient&#x27;s that cause that smell. I really like it  though . Thank&#x27;s for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for the skin.  I would describe the smell as fairly light and &amp;#34;botanical&amp;#34;.  This is my goto when I&#x27;ve not had the best of shaves or my skin is not having a good day. I&#x27;ve got a few aftershaves  I always keep in stock and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> Great scent, although I would prefer a more \\&quot;robust\\&quot; version of the same scent. The perfect amount of sting after a BBS shave with a double edge safety razor (the BEST shave EVER). It doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad, like with pernaud, or proraso. It conditions very nicely, and \\&quot;wakes up\\&quot; the skin for the day ahead. Plus, the wife loves it!  Great value at 15 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the twist off cap, that gives a little \\&quot;pop\\&quot;, before it twirls off easily.  That is a cool little detail that adds something to the \\&quot;quality\\&quot; of the products packaging, although most people could care less about that detail.  I&#x27;m done. Speick is IT for me for aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;It also does NOT clash whatsoever with ANY EDT I use.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> After a wet shave, I splash cold water on my face and rub an alum bar on my face and neck. I lightly pat it dry and then do a few more grooming tasks while my face dries. I then hit it with Speick. Love the refreshing feeling and the clean smell. I like how it dissipates and does not interfere with my cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a face and neck moisturizer for the Winter after my Speick dries, and it does dry wicked fast. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> This is a very bracing, fresh and unique scent.  The Speick line of products has a distinct scent that I absolutely love.  It&#x27;s somewhat herbal/medicinal.  This does have a bit of an alcoholic burn when you put on, but it passes quickly and leaves behind a clean fresh scent, tight pores, and a face soothed of any razor irritation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is about as good as it gets. After reading numerous reviews on Amazon and in various forums, I decided to give a shot. The scent is fantastic. Sort of an old-school barbershop smell with a hint (or more) of woodiness/herbal smell. Leaves me face feeling awesome. Good little burn when you splash it on, but it fades into cool smoothness rather quickly without any lingering stickiness. Whether as a everyday splash-on, or just something to add to your arsenal, I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough.</li>
            <li> A good basic after shave, not great not bad. Not strong or over powering. Crisp clean scent. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Unlike many aftershaves which are simply alcohol, water, and a handful of other ingredients, Speick aftershave contains witch hazel and alum (among other things I&#x27;m less familiar with), which not only restore the pH balance of the skin, but also help tone and heal the face from any cuts or nicks it may have acquired during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant, although I can&#x27;t quite put a finger on what it reminds me of. It is clean and fresh though, and perhaps most importantly for me, it fades quickly. I see this as a positive because I do not want a strong aftershave that would conflict with my cologne. So to sum up, Speick smells great, fades within a half hour, and is filled with ingredients that are great for your face. I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and just to clarify... Despite having so many good and healthy ingredients in it, Speick aftershave is an alcohol based aftershave, so it will burn quite fiercely if you nicked yourself while shaving. But as I already said, at least unlike with other aftershaves, this one will help heal those wounds, so it&#x27;s still a highly worthwhile product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the cologne/edt. but will definitely purchase, someday. I have the soap and aftershave which I love. The subtle notes are what attract me to this particular brand. I recently discovered a layering technique which enhances and works together with the aftershave: Lemon Verbena solid fragrance by the Paper Factory. I put a dab of the lemon verbena on both wrists followed by pouring a little of the after shave on the wrists and rubbing together, gently. A few minutes later, and WOW! I think that it is a unisex smell, but whatever the case, it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> I really used to like Speick, but they changed the formula, and removed the Alum. Typical of today&#x27;s companies, there wasnt any notice. You just have to read the very fine print. It&#x27;s now equivalent to the average splash aftershave, and I don&#x27;t feel it warrants the price.</li>
            <li> Having upped my shaving regiment (safety razor, shaving brush, etc.), I decided to get after shave too.  I love the smell and, like others here, wish it lasted a bit longer.  Overall very pleased, in fact, I bought the bath soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Speick aftershave splash for years and was glad to be able to buy it from Amazon now.  Great classic refreshing scent that doesn&#x27;t linger long, and it feels great on the face.</li>
            <li> The scent is not load or over bearing. A good subtle smell that is every soothing.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting the shaving cream also!</li>
            <li> Nothing like it! Very refreshing and the touch of witch hazel adds to the pleasure of using this product. It&#x27;s also fun to say the name properly.</li>
            <li> The scent is faint and short-lived, but the skin care can&#x27;t be matched.  This aftershave is the best I&#x27;ve used for relieving razor burn.</li>
            <li> Maybe this just isn&#x27;t for an early 30&#x27;s guy. It seems to be pretty good for the healing side of things, but not a fan of the smell. Girlfriend isn&#x27;t really a fan of it either. We both like the Proraso smell better, but I think I&#x27;ll keep this around as it seems to heal the neck a bit better.</li>
