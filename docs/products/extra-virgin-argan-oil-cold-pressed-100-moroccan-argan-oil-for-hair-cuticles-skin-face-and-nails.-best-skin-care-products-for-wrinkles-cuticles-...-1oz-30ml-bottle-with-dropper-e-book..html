            <li>they&#x27;ve emailed twice to make sure I was happy with the product and service and also with information and tips on how to use the oil.</li>
            <li>-I love it!</li>
            <li>This is how I was introduced to this amazing Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a discounted price and was asked for my honest review.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>received a discount code for this product but the reviews here are my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li>However, my opinion is still all my own.</li>
            <li>so thrilled I was given this one.</li>
            <li>I did receive this at a reduced price for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>My hair is so happy right now!</li>
            <li>Love it, love it!  </li>
            <li>I also use it on the &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34; after washing to give wonderful shine and texture in the back which has the most curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for a couple of years now and love the results I&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li>now also use it on my face for which I love.</li>
            <li>My skin is agreeing to this oil, even while using another serum, I&#x27;m really enjoying this on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have received this item at a great price for my complete and honest review.</li>
            <li>Impressed by excellent service and quality of product.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing greasy about this one ,it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave that oily film that some leave behind.</li>
            <li>It’s reduced the bags under my eyes, did away with the crow’s feet, and it makes me look as good as my very fine and young looking wife.</li>
            <li>curly hair and mine is thinning and fine with a wave rather than curl.</li>
            <li>I have tried every doctor prescribed cream and pill available but nothing has helped.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons to pick this brand over a lot of others is because it actually come from Morocco which is the original country of origin for Argan oil and to get the best quality oil you can get it is important to have it grown from where it naturally occurs in nature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it is pure magic if it helped my tangled</li>
            <li>Sometimes I leave it in overnight, but it really only takes an hour at most to do its magic.</li>
            <li>I truly never expected such an incredible turnaround.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>fast shipping - smooth textrue</li>
            <li>To see real world results with this fabulous argan oil, please take a minute to view my video.</li>
            <li>There are so many choices available on Amazon for argan oil, and judging by the style of their product descriptions they all seem to originate from the same company.</li>
            <li>It has an a pretty neutral, mildly earthy smell that doesn&#x27;t seem to come across when I have it in my hair.</li>
            <li>The oil isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;-it soaks right into my skin</li>
            <li>I sent some to my son and daughter-in- law in Seattle since Michelle turned me on to Argon oil in the first place.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that I finally got to try this.  </li>
            <li>will definitely be buying more of this oil when I run out.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure I&#x27;ll be coming back to this</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Argan oil</li>
            <li>Other than that, I chose this brand because of the pretty label and beautiful blue bottle.</li>
            <li>I apply a dime sized amount of Virgin Argan Oil to freshly washed, damp hair - starting at the tips - and it leaves my hair feeling silky smooth and soooo shiny.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty enough to sit on the bathroom counter for easy use.  </li>
            <li>My skin is reacting positively......</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, so I am always looking for the magic moisturizers &amp; cleansers that will not over-dry my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the small dropper bottle, it&#x27;s very travel friendly &amp; I&#x27;ve been tossing it in my gym kit for when I shower after working out.</li>
            <li>They are equally pleased; both have thick (fine but dense)</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this oil.</li>
            <li>But since using this oil, much of that has been reduced, so the anti-ageing properties really do appear to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that it will be gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>really does what it says.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much because it will make you feel and look oily.</li>
            <li>Other reviews have mentioned a funky smell with Argan oil in general and it does have an organic earthy kind of odor, but it isn&#x27;t strong and isn&#x27;t noticeable since it&#x27;s used in tiny quantities.</li>
            <li>use this oil on my body to just get the moisture back or to clean off the skin.</li>
            <li>I use the oil primarily on my hair as a hot oil treatment and the ends of wet hair before using a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only takes a few drops on the area and you are good to go for either healing or moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li>I live in a household full of women and often feel like the last man on the planet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I purchased Lagoon Essential&#x27;s Organic Marrakesh Argan oil a few weeks ago and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>And I have super dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to make my hair limp, perhaps because it is so fine and there is less of it.</li>
            <li>It clear now and moisturized</li>
            <li>After using on my nails, I have noticed over the weeks that I can just wear clear polish &amp;</li>
            <li>Argan Oil has a naturally scent I would describe as &amp;#34;lightly toasty&amp;#34;, and it smells divine when I mix in one drop of cinnamon/clove oil before applying.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft and does not leave it oily</li>
            <li>I have a combination skin type which can be quite sensitive and the argan oil not only reduces the dryness, but also has a calming effect on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells divine, and I appreciate this brand is 100% argan oil and contains only natural ingredients, so</li>
            <li>I think because it is 100 percent natural and organic, there is nothing in it to irritate the condition so it is actually healing the redness and inflammation.</li>
            <li>I finally went to a professional hair salon and begged them to fix it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually making my skin look soft.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks’ worth of use,  I can see it is smoothing away the scars</li>
            <li>This is a very lightweight oil, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or leave it looking greasy.</li>
            <li>It was important to me that the product be pure, raw, cold pressed, organic, fresh and without added scented ingredients.  </li>

            <li> My final comment about hair is that since my hair is ear tip length and grey this product is the difference between glorious curls and the &amp;#34;brillo-pad&amp;#34; look!</li>
            <li> so it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try Argan oil for my hair for long time.  </li>
            <li> I have to thank the multitude of ladies in my house for sharing the secrets of the ancients and not minding that I use their oil on my rockingly long 1980’s</li>
            <li> It was dry, brittle, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to go natural for my daily skin care because store bought items are a little too harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> After that she washed and dried my hair without any further product.</li>
            <li> I use approximately 2-3 drops and it covers my whole face and neck area.</li>
            <li> A little of the oil goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> The result is my skin doesn’t get that tight dry</li>
            <li> like the fact that it is 100% Argan oil, so there is no surprise reactions to other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> that is 100 percent natural and cold pressed, which I’ve recently read is necessary for the healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d</li>
            <li> I don’t use any other moisture creams.</li>
            <li> I have a sharp sense of smell and don&#x27;t find using this oil objectionable.  </li>
            <li> There is no smell to this oil, which I prefer because I&#x27;m already using a serum that has a slight scent to it, don&#x27;t want these items clashing with each other.</li>
            <li> It works well for retexturing and smoothing down my wavy, dark hair.  </li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re making my skin look too dry and dull looking).  </li>
            <li> My hair has been ery dry and brittle lately and after using this product for a few days it has already started to look and feel</li>
            <li> /&gt;Years ago, I started to get a few lines around my eyes that nothing to seemed to eradicate.</li>
            <li> I received the product a few days ago and my hair is already shinier and looks healthier.  </li>
            <li> Once people understand the benefits of Argan Oil it is hard not to hear everyone talking about the oil.</li>
            <li> Not amazing for treating frizz.  </li>
            <li> This isn’t always bad because these ladies will often introduce us thuggish sorts to the finer things in life, like this secret of theirs: argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was awful and embarrassed me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I absolutely adore this oil. I have a combination skin type which can be quite sensitive and the argan oil not only reduces the dryness, but also has a calming effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, I started to get a few lines around my eyes that nothing to seemed to eradicate. But since using this oil, much of that has been reduced, so the anti-ageing properties really do appear to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells divine, and I appreciate this brand is 100% argan oil and contains only natural ingredients, so I know that it will be gentle on my skin. A little of the oil goes a long way so it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Used it on my son&#x27;s eczema and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so I am always looking for the magic moisturizers &amp; cleansers that will not over-dry my skin. People say my skin looks younger than my age - and I hope to keep it that way!  Argan oil has now taken a place in my skin care regime.  I have used it for cleansing – to loosen the dirt / sunscreen /makeup from my face.  I rinse my face, then moisturize with the Argan oil  - it only takes a tiny amount.  The result is my skin doesn’t get that tight dry feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it is 100% Argan oil, so there is no surprise reactions to other ingredients.  The bottle is pretty enough to sit on the bathroom counter for easy use.  I purchased this product at a discounted price and was asked for my honest review.  It has been a delight to try it!</li>
            <li> fast shipping - smooth textrue</li>
            <li> I sent some to my son and daughter-in- law in Seattle since Michelle turned me on to Argon oil in the first place.They are equally pleased; both have thick (fine but dense) curly hair and mine is thinning and fine with a wave rather than curl. Argon oil works so well for all three of us. I am already noticing my nails are stronger and my hair is lustrous &amp; holds it&#x27;s curl for longer. I also use it on the &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34; after washing to give wonderful shine and texture in the back which has the most curl. A little does go a long way. It is easy to make my hair limp, perhaps because it is so fine and there is less of it. My final comment about hair is that since my hair is ear tip length and grey this product is the difference between glorious curls and the &amp;#34;brillo-pad&amp;#34; look! My facial skin also loves the product! Your tips for using Argon oil are great; can&#x27;t wait to try it on my body after the shower.</li>
            <li> It works well for retexturing and smoothing down my wavy, dark hair.  Not amazing for treating frizz.  It has an a pretty neutral, mildly earthy smell that doesn&#x27;t seem to come across when I have it in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try Argan oil for my hair for long time.  I received a discount code to try this product and I am VERY pleased with the results already.  I received the product a few days ago and my hair is already shinier and looks healthier.  I have read a lot of information about Argan Oil and I am pleased that I finally got to try this.  My hair has been ery dry and brittle lately and after using this product for a few days it has already started to look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more of this oil when I run out. I am thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount code for this product but the reviews here are my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Once people understand the benefits of Argan Oil it is hard not to hear everyone talking about the oil. Restoration is the only thing I can say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is just glowing wherever I apply this to area of my body; it is helping with my skin problems. At night before I go to sleep I place a drop on each fingernail and rub in to that nail I am noticing that my cuticles are not as dry and no dry skin forming as well.&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil on my body to just get the moisture back or to clean off the skin. As of today I am using it on my pet for a scar she has from surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a few drops on the area and you are good to go for either healing or moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a household full of women and often feel like the last man on the planet. This isn’t always bad because these ladies will often introduce us thuggish sorts to the finer things in life, like this secret of theirs: argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t think we men have no desire to maintain our youthful good looks and Bon Jovi hair. We care, we just can’t show it and maintain your respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have to thank the multitude of ladies in my house for sharing the secrets of the ancients and not minding that I use their oil on my rockingly long 1980’s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And being from the 80’s, I need all its anti-aging miracles as well.  It’s reduced the bags under my eyes, did away with the crow’s feet, and it makes me look as good as my very fine and young looking wife.</li>
            <li> I use this oil and so does my son. It&#x27;s not too greasy and I use it on my hair and my body and I would recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> Works great on hair!  I&#x27;ve received this product in exchange for a review</li>
            <li> One of the reasons to pick this brand over a lot of others is because it actually come from Morocco which is the original country of origin for Argan oil and to get the best quality oil you can get it is important to have it grown from where it naturally occurs in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: I was given a discount on this product for my opinion and review.  However, my opinion is still all my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for a couple of years now and love the results I&#x27;ve been having. This Brand is my favourite yet. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so happy right now! I apply a dime sized amount of Virgin Argan Oil to freshly washed, damp hair - starting at the tips - and it leaves my hair feeling silky smooth and soooo shiny. This is a very lightweight oil, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or leave it looking greasy. Argan Oil has a naturally scent I would describe as &amp;#34;lightly toasty&amp;#34;, and it smells divine when I mix in one drop of cinnamon/clove oil before applying. I love the small dropper bottle, it&#x27;s very travel friendly &amp; I&#x27;ve been tossing it in my gym kit for when I shower after working out. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from rosacea for years. I have tried every doctor prescribed cream and pill available but nothing has helped. I saw the great reviews about this product and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. I truly never expected such an incredible turnaround. I think because it is 100 percent natural and organic, there is nothing in it to irritate the condition so it is actually healing the redness and inflammation. Steroid and antibiotic creams never touched it, but this oil is on course to totally eliminate the condition. After a few weeks’ worth of use,  I can see it is smoothing away the scars too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to encourage you and anyone you know with rosacea to try it. This is the only brand I’ve seen that is 100 percent natural and cold pressed, which I’ve recently read is necessary for the healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d have to suggest that anyone with a skin condition try it. It has been the best thing that has happened to me.</li>
            <li> I’m so thrilled I was given this one. My hair was awful and embarrassed me. It was dry, brittle, and frizzy. I finally went to a professional hair salon and begged them to fix it. This is how I was introduced to this amazing Moroccan oil. The stylist ran this oil through my hair and set me under the dryer hood for 20 minutes on low. After that she washed and dried my hair without any further product. I tell you my jaw dropped. My hair looked instantly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use it at home without the dryer hood, which was only used to speed up the process. Sometimes I leave it in overnight, but it really only takes an hour at most to do its magic. And it is pure magic if it helped my tangled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now also use it on my face for which I love. I don’t use any other moisture creams.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Impressed by excellent service and quality of product.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing greasy about this one ,it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave that oily film that some leave behind.Pretty sure I&#x27;ll be coming back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;It really does what it says.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my face! It clear now and moisturized</li>
            <li> This is a great Argan oil. I&#x27;m using this Argan oil as a night time moisturizer. I use approximately 2-3 drops and it covers my whole face and neck area. There is no smell to this oil, which I prefer because I&#x27;m already using a serum that has a slight scent to it, don&#x27;t want these items clashing with each other. I&#x27;ve decided to go natural for my daily skin care because store bought items are a little too harsh for my skin (they&#x27;re making my skin look too dry and dull looking).  My skin is agreeing to this oil, even while using another serum, I&#x27;m really enjoying this on my skin. It&#x27;s actually making my skin look soft. I&#x27;m only using this as a night time moisturizer. Don&#x27;t put too much because it will make you feel and look oily. I&#x27;m very happy how this oil moisturizes my face. I have received this item at a great price for my complete and honest review.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Argan oil so I can&#x27;t compare it to others. I purchased Lagoon Essential&#x27;s Organic Marrakesh Argan oil a few weeks ago and am very pleased with it. It was important to me that the product be pure, raw, cold pressed, organic, fresh and without added scented ingredients.  I use the oil primarily on my hair as a hot oil treatment and the ends of wet hair before using a hair dryer. Between using this oil and switching to a Tourmaline Titanium type hair dryer, I have noticed a definite difference in hair smoothness &amp; shine.  Other reviews have mentioned a funky smell with Argan oil in general and it does have an organic earthy kind of odor, but it isn&#x27;t strong and isn&#x27;t noticeable since it&#x27;s used in tiny quantities. I have a sharp sense of smell and don&#x27;t find using this oil objectionable.  My experience with the seller was excellent- they&#x27;ve emailed twice to make sure I was happy with the product and service and also with information and tips on how to use the oil. Will purchase again- five stars!</li>
            <li> I have used Argan Oil before but didn&#x27;t realize it had anti-bacterial properties.  An extra benefit! I use this Lagoon Essentials Oil on the ends of my hair &amp; also on my cuticles.  After using on my nails, I have noticed over the weeks that I can just wear clear polish &amp; my nails look great!  I don&#x27;t have any rashes after using but that is just me.  The oil isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;-it soaks right into my skin-I love it! I did receive this at a reduced price for an honest opinion. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft and does not leave it oily</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f71d964dd661c12ad1a5826a7b7d81c6]] To see real world results with this fabulous argan oil, please take a minute to view my video.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it!  My skin is reacting positively......And I have super dry skin.  So happy I found this great oil.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it without a second of hesitation!</li>
            <li> There are so many choices available on Amazon for argan oil, and judging by the style of their product descriptions they all seem to originate from the same company. I look for pure, organic, cold-pressed oil, and hope that my purchase benefits small, local, women-owned businesses. Other than that, I chose this brand because of the pretty label and beautiful blue bottle.</li>
