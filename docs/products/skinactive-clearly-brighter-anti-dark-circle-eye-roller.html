    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Rather than trying to choose the perfect shade, since this is \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; it blends with your skin.</li>
            <li>(I find the L&#x27;Oreal mineral line is excellent for rosacea coverage, and I use that when I have a flare-up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not going to say it&#x27;s perfect, but it works.</li>
            <li>great stuff!!</li>
            <li>Granted, this may not make a \\&quot;permanent,corrective\\&quot; difference, but as a concealer it is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>This works great!</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Best under eye concealer that I have ever used.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;It may not correct the issues, I just don&#x27;t know yet, but it is a perfect concealer and illuminator.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING!!!!</li>

            <li>you prefer a \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; makeup, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s mineral line has a \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; powder  that is also very good.</li>

            <li>I use every day, good product</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still really really good though</li>
            <li>I will continue to use and recommend if someone is looking for good coverage.</li>
            <li>The coverage is light and blends in perfectly.  </li>
            <li>No amount of sleep, exercise or good diet does anything for mine.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best match I&#x27;ve found that blends well with my skin tone, but it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very Glad that we found something! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and cool, the color blends perfectly with my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>

            <li>They too are very pleased with the results.</li>

            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>This roller applies a light weight brightener to the under eye that doesn&#x27;t crease and covers the veins I have under my eyes beautifully.  </li>
            <li>&quot; and I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I look so much better than without!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t what the reviews say, this product is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>I love and swear by this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love how this eye roller feels when you put it on!</li>
            <li>comes out as a roller and the coloration is amazing for the under eye area.</li>
            <li>looks amazing</li>
            <li>For what this costs, it is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can get makeup like this any where.</li>
            <li>If you are the kind of person who does not like to wear makeup then go ahead and purchase it.</li>
            <li>I rolls on nicely</li>
            <li>It has a nice cooling feel with the roller ball</li>
            <li>It covers up quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Garnier is one of my favorite all -around products, well priced &amp; good results over all.</li>
            <li>I liked the cooling sensation of the metal ball.</li>
            <li>But honestly I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
            <li>Good product, just wished it was more of a concealer or a brightener</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using all kind of night creams for eyes</li>
            <li>Does a nice job concealing circles.</li>
            <li>product feels really nice when you roll it on, like a cooling sensation on my eye.  </li>
            <li>The color blends well, and it just feels really nice when you put it on.</li>
            <li>It did blend nicely, so that was a plus.  </li>
            <li>This is really a nice undereye concealer</li>
            <li>It has a really nice cooling feeling as you apply it under your eyes.</li>
            <li>This product does not work as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I have never found an eye cream I could apply with my concealer on top, so it could have been a good idea.  </li>
            <li>This goes on very nice, sure I&#x27;m gonna get more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Amazing and totally worth the price!!!</li>
            <li>Wonderful concealer and very good at helping to keep the dark circles from coming through during the day</li>
            <li>Cheap and amazing product!</li>
            <li>and/or when I wear a full face of makeup, but its great for fooling my husband in the morning--</li>
            <li>The roll on application is great because the metal roller ball stays cool and helps decrease puffiness.</li>
            <li>am a 62 year old woman and have tried every eye cream and concealer on the market.&lt;br /&gt;For eye creams, I liked the one Kiehl&#x27;s discontinued the best.</li>
            <li>Good color match and easy to blend</li>
            <li>Cool roller ball feels very nice.</li>
            <li>I have a very strong family history of under eye circles.</li>
            <li>very easy to use</li>
            <li>Love, love this!</li>
            <li>Love this, will order more!</li>
            <li>and I feel a lot more confident when I use it!</li>
            <li>Easy, nice, good. :-)</li>
            <li>I liked the results much better.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve noticed better results with this product over department store brands.</li>
            <li>It a product you can wear on your own or under/ over a concealer if you need more coverage around the eye area.</li>
            <li>I do not hate this product - I think the coverage is quite good, but I just figured out</li>
            <li>Good light coverage.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best under eye circle product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love love love this eye roller!</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>I  would recommend this as a very light concealer to use if you want to go to the gym,food shopping.. ect.</li>
            <li>Once it is there it provides very light coverage.</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation is nice &amp; it blends really easily.</li>
            <li>This is super easy to apply and blends very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Works just ok.</li>
            <li>I bought the kind without tint in it, and I saw a huge improvement in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I found this to be the better rated of under eye cover.</li>
            <li>Over that time I&#x27;ve come to terms with the fact that there is no \\&quot;solution\\&quot; to my problem, but some products do work better than others.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I think this is a good product and worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;mb</li>
            <li>I roll it on, making sure that the product comes in contact with the roller.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of a roller application</li>
            <li>Even after using this product, I have purchased others just hoping that they might cover better, but I always return to this stand-by.  </li>
            <li>Sure it rolls on</li>
            <li>and  my eyes look so much better.</li>
            <li>I love love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I still use a MAC concealer on top of this</li>
            <li>A concealer works way better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it</li>
            <li>Point being, Garnier states nothing that would come even CLOSE to stating more than that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is always ok to read up on a product before making a purchase.</li>
            <li>a one was because it is a OKAY concealer.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I look more rested.    </li>
            <li>Love this concealer.  </li>
            <li>I love this cover up stick.  </li>
            <li>Gently rolls on and blends great.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal concealer bought at Walmart does a better job for me.</li>
            <li>but is more of an all over treatment.</li>
            <li>so coverage is better as well.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>But I do love it to touch up under eyes anytime anyplace.</li>
            <li>It is tinted, but I just rubbed in a touch with my finger and put foundation on top.</li>
            <li>Works well :)</li>
            <li>But it helps which is what I wanted. :)</li>
            <li>most of the time which doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>we are amazed at how normal/ healthy my eyes look.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan because I wanted it to be more coverage, and I wanted it to be lighter.</li>
            <li>Love the roller ball.</li>
            <li>Most products cake up after an hour of wearing them.</li>
            <li>My favorite under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>plan to stock up in case it goes of the market the way everything that I love seems to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Under eye circles most affordable enemy.</li>
            <li>Works okay.</li>
            <li>Better than the concealer I used to use.</li>
            <li>Many people like this</li>
            <li>i love this thing..</li>
            <li>I could say is okay</li>
            <li>I LOVE this roller.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this, as I love Garnier products.</li>
            <li>you can buy one for your purse and one for your house and still have money for a lip gloss :-)</li>
            <li>I am most pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Garnier should make this product for more skin tones.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Makes the area under my eyes look fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite beauty item.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this-</li>
            <li>we both love it</li>
            <li>It gives my eyes a more awakened look.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use and see if it gets better</li>
            <li>Applying a pink/salmon concealer, Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste on top.</li>
            <li>Applying Garnier skin renew roller on top.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, wish somebody had told me about it sooner!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>So I went on a hunt for something better.</li>
            <li>I fell in love.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the correct tint.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with this and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>It is better than any concealer on the market.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I have used so many products (DOZENS) over the years</li>
            <li>They are hereditary for the most part and nothing will fix them, not even plastic surgery.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>and I have really enjoyed this one.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better out there</li>
            <li>it acts more like a concealer</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist, I am an absolute makeup/skincare junkie!!!I read great reviews about this product &amp; thought for the price</li>
            <li>Soooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff &amp; if Garnier ever retires this product I will cry myself an ocean.</li>
            <li>because most eye products cause irritation and this did not or most products don&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li>Then, I gently retouch the concealer and I&#x27;ll tell you, it is amazing!</li>
            <li>, store bought concealers do a pretty fair job.</li>
            <li>Even without foundation, my eyes have taken on their beautiful old almond shape.</li>
            <li>Pretty good coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It rolls on lightly and has great coverage and feel absolutely weightless on my face.</li>
            <li>Best is the fact it does not \\&quot;cake\\&quot; or dry.  </li>
            <li>I love the applicator, and how easy it is to blend.</li>
            <li>it blends into your skin easily and does look instantly better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the color is awesome, it will adjust to your skin, I am a medium light, with yellow undertones and this shade looks awesome on my skin, brightens but not too pink.</li>
            <li>I use a fine powder over top to set.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and brands and this is the best.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good facial and neck cream to use.  </li>
            <li>Good product for high lighting need a lil bit more to conceal however</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference in helping me look bright eyed and awake.</li>
            <li>I am 52 years old and have great skin for a woman my age.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many products for dark circles -- this is the best -</li>
            <li>For those of us with circles, maybe we should realize that the way we look isn&#x27;t the most important thing after all. .</li>
            <li>I used to use clinique 32 breeze...but that shade was a bit too light for me, this one is a better shade</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s not marketed toward young adults with great skin.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and I think it does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>I also love that it has a light concealer that is very easily blend-able for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>The consistency is not oily and is instead a very nice, natural looking matte texture and finish.</li>
            <li>I also like that the rollerball makes it easy for me to apply the product all the way up to my eyelashes without getting it in my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is a lightweight, easily applied product that stays where I put it.</li>
            <li>so moving it around the coverage area is easy, no pulling or tugging or sticking.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>it works really well, its feels light, it rolls really good around the eyes, makes the eyes look brighter.</li>
            <li>Smooths on easily and is invisible.  </li>
            <li>lightweight and easy to roll on.</li>
            <li>However in my opinion just got use as an easy cover up</li>
            <li>it easy to use even for a beginner?</li>
            <li>It blends SO easily, compared to Erase Paste and Maybelline&#x27;s roller.</li>
            <li>This is good cream for older skin.  </li>
            <li>This product works perfectly for dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li>As a cover up for dark circles it works great!  </li>
            <li>Best under eye dark spot thing i found</li>
            <li>Have used Garnier Anti-dark circle Eye Roller for awhile now and it is the best product I have tried to help hide my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Best anti dark circle ever used.</li>
            <li>The application is too easy, and it blends like a fine, light cream should.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and easy to apply</li>
            <li>and I have had no issues with it settling into fine lines or causing dryness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light, and it&#x27;s really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it works fine .</li>
            <li>the pot stuff was greasy and settle into fine lines...</li>
            <li>This rolled on easily and was a light color, but it didn&#x27;t make the bags disappear.  </li>
            <li>but it turned out fine.</li>
            <li>There is very little more that can be done to make an already incredible product any better.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for people who do not like to cover their face in makeup in order to cover every little imperfection.  </li>
            <li>The metal ball is very cooling and distributes nice light coverage to the undereye area.</li>
            <li>It blends easily by dabbing a clean finger on the area, but the color might be too light for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference when I apply this under my eyes.</li>
            <li>&quot; I have always applied a light cream under my eyes so the product would \\&quot;flow.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It is lightly tinted and after i roll it under my eyes, I dab it in with my finger until blended</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, it doesn&#x27;t cake on - isn&#x27;t noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I like the way this rolls on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t require that I rub it in.  </li>
            <li>The color is light (but still covers amazingly well) which works very well for me but may be too light for darker skinned gals.</li>
            <li>This product is mostly just concealer in a different package, but the concealer was thinner than most others I&#x27;ve tried and distributed itself nicely instead of getting sticky and clumpy.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this a couple of days, but I think it is great.</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin undertones and just turned 30.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because it highlights instantly.</li>
            <li>Unfortuately the concealer is too light for my skintone (or maybe it is just me)</li>
            <li>When I finish this bottle, I wont be re-ordering, but I do recommend to those who have a light complexion, for those of us whose skintone is a darker honey/olive we have to look elsewhere...</li>
            <li>I liked the result so much that I haven&#x27;t gone a day since then without applying this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but helps cover my undereye bags/darkness.</li>
            <li>Then I put cover up on, and lightly dab the cover up sponge over my eyes.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and lasting power!</li>
            <li>realize not every product works the same for every person, but for me this product works great</li>
            <li>It really brightens my eye area and can touch up nicely through out the day.</li>
            <li>It rolls on so smoothly, and brightens around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tiny bit greasy but still a lot better/lighter than foundation and still gives really great coverage.</li>
            <li>It rolls on creamy and too light for me, for anybody almost.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, blends well and covers for hours.</li>
            <li>medium to light.</li>
            <li>too light for my skin tone</li>
            <li>love the cool feeling of the metal ball and caffeine too under my eyes and on my skin too, it&#x27;s nice and refreshing and does a nice job of COVERING UP my dark circles in the morning and throughout the day.</li>
            <li>the color applied (conceler) is a good natural color</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and helps incredibly with dark circles.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, feels cool and helps in minimizing wrinkles and circles.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d think good sun protection would make it easier for the product to work quickly, since it doesn&#x27;t have to fight new damage as well.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s moisturizing while being super easy to blend.</li>
            <li>This product is more like a concealer for people with dark circles like myself, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply and blends well.  </li>
            <li>but after gently blending it with my finger, I thought it looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizing effect is good, but it isn&#x27;t too effective at stopping dark circles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m (very) fair skinned, and the tint of this product is too dark for me.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it&#x27;s super easy and clean when applying.</li>
            <li>general reference, I have fair, combination skin</li>
            <li>I was excited about the idea of a product that offered both a lotion and concealer in one</li>
            <li>worth the money!</li>
            <li>What makes this product unique is that it has caffeine in it.</li>
            <li>Sheer and light texture with good coverage.</li>
            <li>Rolls on super easy and quick.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, feels weightless, and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>So loose and win.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and blends right into the skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing special</li>
            <li>Turns out she was right!</li>
            <li>The concealer stay on the surface of my skin but the &amp;#34;eye stuff&amp;#34; goes right into it and lift my eyes (get rid of my puffy eyes!).</li>
            <li>I had a lot of trouble blending in this color on my very fair red/blue undertone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, fits easily in my purse, easy to blend and works great.</li>
            <li>The concealer is a great medium-coverage item that can easily be thrown into a makeup bag as it needs no special brushes.</li>
            <li>It gives that full coverage look, it highlights, primes, conceals.</li>
            <li>I can wear makeup under my eyes and my whole face looks more finished because of it.  </li>
            <li>(the metal roller feels cool on my skin, which I like).  </li>
            <li>It makes me look like I got a full night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I have purchased some for others to try.</li>
            <li>Thanks to lovely lor</li>
            <li>The ball reduces inflammation as it is cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know a lot about make up, but I did buy another product and it works better.  </li>
            <li>love the applicator for applying all over my face without getting too much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rewind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, Asian skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the feel of the cool metal ball.</li>
            <li>Love this concealer so much that I subscribed on Amazon.</li>
            <li>tube is okay), Amazing Makeup Concealer (good coverage but kind of dry thick texture after awhile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could not attest to the \\&quot;skin benefits\\&quot; as I have not seen much of an improvement in my skin itself, however for the lovely dark purple bags under my eyes that I am genetically predisposed to it works great.  </li>
            <li>Great product - hides dark circles under eyes very well and helps under eyes look much much better..  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many creams for dark circles as well as undereye concealers with results from okay to this stuff</li>
            <li>However, it is the best under eye concealer I&#x27;ve used, and I have used many expensive brands, including Bobbi Brown, Trish McEvoy, Lancome, Clinique, MAC, etc.  </li>
            <li>It covers, but it also corrects the problem, and quite quickly for me, too.  </li>
            <li>I just glide the stick under my eye and dab it on quickly.</li>
            <li>I use one roll per eye, and tap QUICKLY, as it sets almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also add I have pretty light skin, when I buy foundation</li>
            <li>I have pretty light skin and it blended well with my skin  color.  </li>
            <li>Normal, inexpensive foundation did a better job.</li>
            <li>When I am ready to apply my makeup it is absorbed into my under eye area and looks like my skin only greatly improved.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty light</li>
            <li>However, the product is so light you will barely feel it, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>Unlike the Maybelline New York Fit Me!</li>
            <li>The concealer doesn&#x27;t give raccoon eyes like so many others do, it doesn&#x27;t cake up, its very smooth to put on (needs to be patted dry and worked in a bit).</li>
            <li>But, this goes on really easy and blends without much effort.  </li>
            <li>I really like the glide on tube, makes application easy.  </li>
            <li>This one is dark near perfect.</li>
            <li>, obviously not because I love the coverage, but because I was interested to see if there were more long-term results, and there have been none whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product yesterday and love it so far!  </li>
            <li>so another person might like the covering qualities of this product--however, the roller ball on mine delivers way too much concealer for rolling across one&#x27;s eye area!!</li>
            <li>However, I do not see the signs of aging disappear or do much about the fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size so you can put it in your purse for a little touch up while you are out on a date or with friends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it does an excellent job of covering these veins without making my under eye crepey or emphasizing the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>and she usually uses high end products and takes VERY good care of herself!</li>
            <li>You really have to use your fingers to lightly tap it in or it just blends away.</li>
            <li>Amazing it&#x27;s the only makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and spreads really well.</li>
            <li>so I love that this product looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be awesome when I saw the commercial for it, but when I got it in the mail it left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>Still, for me the benefits are well worth it</li>
            <li>However, I did feel the rush of the caffeine-- which is absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li>I went to the store and got my own tube the next day.  </li>
            <li>it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>it was worth checking out.</li>
            <li>I can say that this is light and doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable fragrance whereas the other product I bought does kind of smell.</li>
            <li>It is just as good as any other cooling roller eye treatment out there.</li>
            <li>This item was leaking right out the box.</li>
            <li>If you are in a hurry and did not put any make-up on the Garnier Skin Renew blends right into your skin</li>
            <li>i did find if i use right after my morning skin care regimine....</li>
            <li>I put this on right after I moisturize and then continue on with the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin and have to be very careful to avoid the caked-on look with concealing products, but I have never had a moments worry with this product.  </li>
            <li>the reason i don&#x27;t exclusively use BB is because i don&#x27;t always want that full coverage as i really prefer the feel of freshly cleaned, untreated skin.</li>
            <li>This works great as a concealer, not so much as a fix to my dark circle problem.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for puffy eyes and the light particles mask any dark shades.</li>
            <li>color matches very easily and simple to apply.</li>
            <li>I REALLY thought and hoped this was something special.</li>
            <li>This works great as a concealer, but no more than that.</li>
            <li>Good for dark circles.</li>
            <li>This stuff works good as a concealer on my dark purple circles and crowsfeet.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that does not cake up or settle into fine lines, at all!</li>
            <li>I also am putting a little on my eyelid as well and find this lightens up the area as well as is a good primer for eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m still on the first tube), and while it does do a fairly good job concealing my dark circles, it certainly has not lightened them over time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male and absolutely love this product because of how effective it covers my dark circles, meanwhile seeming very natural and easy to blend into my skin.</li>
            <li>I think a regular concealer would have been better.</li>
            <li>Nothing cumulative resulted from using the whole roller to the end of its useful life.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I&#x27;m a GUY.</li>
            <li>This product is honestly my ultimate favorite beauty product I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think anything was coming out of the roller at first.</li>
            <li>Really wakes up my eyes!  </li>
            <li>At first it worked</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Garnier Anti-Dark circle eye roller does exactly what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve pretty much accepted that I am stuck with my circles!</li>
            <li>Not with this product, no irritation and keeps the skin soft and excema free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that first thing in the morning</li>
            <li>An ice-pak would have more lasting effect.</li>
            <li>it actually works better &amp; lasts until I remove it.</li>
            <li>but i like BB creme better as it does the same thing</li>
            <li>I kind of expected to use it and be...</li>
            <li>Love the sheer coverage.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I felt just one coat made a difference.</li>
            <li>but you can see a noticable, lighter patch under my eyes, so I only use it for emergencies.  :-)    </li>
            <li>I love this concealer, I use it daily under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male esthetician and have tried many eye products from department stores ranging from $40 and up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite products at the moment</li>
            <li>Too much comes out of the applicator to make the roller ball useful.</li>
            <li>It is light and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>First, this product lasts forever.</li>
            <li>and it is pretty matte once it dries.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>I reach for this over higher end</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing results after a few months but it is a good concealer.</li>
            <li>I think I would look better in pictures with this combo, but in person, it doesn&#x27;t look good, especially since I don&#x27;t like to wear my foundation super thick.  </li>
            <li>I really wish they would come out with new colors, both lighter and darker than what is available now.  </li>
            <li>wow!!!!</li>
            <li>Not at all surprised coming from Garnier, I have always loved the results that I get with every single product of theirs.</li>
            <li>Most people would probably be more than happy with the way this product conceals dark circles, as long as there is no expectation that it will actually make the dark circles go away over time, and as long as you&#x27;re comfortable with shelling out a nice chunk of change for it.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging and the hype, not so much for the actual product.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should try this or not because there were so many negative comments.  </li>
            <li>I can add as many coats as I want without the product creasing into the tiny fine lines starting to show under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This pretty much guarantees an A+ in any class.</li>
            <li>You can pretty much never believe the transformations cosmetics companies promise because they all Photoshop every image on their product.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s pretty much all this is.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had good results with this for small areas</li>
            <li>My skin tone is of a fair olive tone complexion and not many cosmetics have a tone to match my complexion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for a cover up if you don&#x27;t want to look like you have on makeup, but just don&#x27;t expect it to give you any reduction in those dark circles.</li>
            <li>That said, the color of the concealer is a nice cover for dark circles.</li>
            <li>It blends really well with light finger tapping, so I often wear it even when I wear no other makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and use it everyday even if I&#x27;m not wearing any other makeup because it feels good.</li>
            <li>It does a great job concealing the dark circles I&#x27;ve had under my eyes since I was a teen.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight, goes on amazingly smooth and diminishes dark circles without the heaviness of the others.  </li>
            <li>This product does a great job of covering the dark area at my inner eye.</li>
            <li>And, when it does become set, its coverage is not as good as a regular concealer by a long shot.</li>
            <li>I like the product a lot though I feel the roller ball is too large for the targeted under eye area</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinklesaround my eyes due to my addiction to sunglasses but there are still some very fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little cakey for my taste but to each his own.</li>
            <li>On the up side I found the application had a slight cooling feel, which felt very nice especially at 8am when I was getting off work, or at midnight when I was coming in.  </li>
            <li>It essentially rolls patchy makeup over your skin, which you then spread to evenly cover the circles, but it seems as if it&#x27;s only effective for people with a certain skin tone.</li>
            <li>As all the womens&#x27; magazine beauty gurus say, pulling on the \\&quot;delicate skin\\&quot; below the eyes is not something that&#x27;s very good to do, especially on an on-going basis.  </li>
            <li>I gave the same product to my mom, and she also saw a huge improvement, so it will work on all ages.</li>
            <li>The amazing thing about this is that it also has a moisturizer which has definitely helped my under-eye area overall.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t lighten up much of anything.</li>
            <li>I need something that works; this really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t cover the circles</li>
            <li>The make-up is really liquidy, therefore it has to set under the eye before being blended.</li>
            <li>very much!&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the price is so inexpensive that I really think that increases the value of this product to 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>I had really given up on finding anything that works.  </li>
            <li>You would prob get the same results with a cheap tinted moisturizer I would think.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>It is very \\&quot;slick/slippery\\&quot;</li>
            <li>(although Emu oil really helps with wrinkles....) are people hoping for miracles?</li>
            <li>I run thru it about every 2 months, but I do use it several times/day when the light concealer wears off--don&#x27;t mind though.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>The product works as advertised but was considerably more liquid than I expected.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it much, but it works.</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just a cover-up, not a treatment.</li>
            <li>It really looks sooo natural!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(i like aveeno)..then apply this but not the roller so much as the product.</li>
            <li>but this is a bit much.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This product has increased the health of my eyes and really works.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed</li>
            <li>very easlily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to try to cover them but it always looks like a bruise being covered but still very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Also, this product is so shear but covers very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t crease up and really brightens the area.</li>
            <li>, this really makes my eyes look brighter and conceals the lines and wrinkles under them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to take the kids to school and run errands.</li>
            <li>My thoughts are really what is the point.</li>
            <li>This also is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I could never use concealer because it was always very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>its very watery and does no convering</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>BUT, I have found it works very well in covering up any redness(acne and irritation).</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really conceal anything.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really cover anything up though.  </li>
            <li>Really perks up your under eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>If you roll under eye, way to much comes out.</li>
            <li>Very.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I roll it on and blow my hairdryer gently on my face--it dries in about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I use it as a concealer and it works, hiddens the eye blemish very well.</li>
            <li>I use it for years, and hidrate very well too</li>
            <li>Covers better than expected.</li>
            <li>I apply with caution as Erase Paste is REALLY</li>
            <li>Applyng Maybelline age rewinder in medium, which is harder to blend but gives a bit more coverage</li>
            <li>I like putthing this on in the mornings as I get ready for my day.</li>
            <li>i really like the product.</li>
            <li>This product also works very well with foundation, because it doesn&#x27;t have a real color or texture that will clash with your foundation</li>
            <li>but I really would not recommend this</li>
            <li>At first I thought that I had simply not closed the cap tightly, only to have more fabric soiled by it.</li>
            <li>absolutely works.............</li>
            <li>I have been through all the expensive concealers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>A good neutral tint too, for those with pink or yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>If you have severe dark circles you will probably need a higher coverage concealer, this is more on the lighter side.</li>
            <li>It does however, cover quite naturally when paired with a light powder and hides a natural amount of under eye darkness without making you look like its caked on.</li>
            <li>I love how milky the concealer is - it simple rolls on and its a very sheer liquid layer that rubs right into your skin</li>
            <li>I can tell you from many years of experience and many hundreds of wasted dollars in products that this product is soooo much better than Clarins, Clinique, NARS, MAC, Lancome and all of the other countless brands I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s not going to totally eliminate every dark shadow under your eye and make you look like the models on their commercials, but it does a nice job overall.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works better than any other cover up I have ever had to use.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like this worked any better than any other under-eye concealer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually too tinted to use in significant amounts as I like to \\&quot;overuse\\&quot; creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually sensitive to things, don&#x27;t have allergies or anything, I&#x27;m tough LOL!</li>
            <li>It helped make circles somewhat less prominent on my face, but it certainly didn&#x27;t cover them up much.</li>
            <li>I do like to reapply it a couple times throughout the day as it seems to kind of wear off, but I have had the same experience with pretty much every other product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Looking to cover-up pregnancy-induced dark circles, and this product is the best I&#x27;ve found (in my price range, at least).</li>
            <li>I have no idea whether the caffeine does anything for my dark circles, but honestly what ingredient really makes any kind of lasting impression on dark circles??  </li>
            <li>In addition, the liquid is not thick enough to provide good coverage for dark under eye circles, which is the whole reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>This product looks natural, is easy to apply (you have to blend with your fingers) and it last all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, while the roller ball feels nice and cool, it makes for sloppy application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know there are several products that cost twice as much with only the caffeine benefit and not the cover up benefit, this seems to have both for a better price.  </li>
            <li>Tried it for a full month, NOTHING different!</li>
            <li>It covered up my dark circles better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>You roll it on and pat it into your skin and like magic the dark circles are covered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle treatment, and it&#x27;s not like you cant see the puffys at all, but it does brighten your eyes for a more awake look and it covers lighter dark circles.</li>
            <li>but I had dark circles AND a good dark vein that runs under my right eye.</li>
            <li>Perhaps others may have a better experience, but I can&#x27;t help but think the reviews are slightly skewed.</li>
            <li>Anything more severe than slight, and forget about this helping.</li>
            <li>but for the price it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>The rollerball applies smoothly most of the time, but occasionally I will have to roll it across a tissue if it&#x27;s not coming out enough.</li>
            <li>Covers decently.</li>
            <li>Better than more expensive brand</li>
            <li>It has 10 oils in it, and my face actually looked better the next morning.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to last all day without creasing or drying out and the coverage is good without looking heavy.  </li>
            <li>The roller application reduces puffiness quickly, too, so eyes look younger and</li>
            <li>Works as well as or better than more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>You could see the blue of my eyes more than the blue under them.</li>
            <li>when you try it on, it looks like you&#x27;re applying some sort of powder under your eyes even if you trying to blur that area out, it dries so quick that come out a different color that do not match with your tone skin  anymore when you try it on.</li>
            <li>you cant notice that he had something covering, it looks very natural!</li>
            <li>On a basic color spectrum (light, medium, dark), it would be light.</li>
            <li>I love it because it goes no light and smoothly and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I bought this magic little wand because law school was causing me to look like a basset hound.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why everyone is tearing this little roller to shreds, I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love that this reduces and helps camouflage dark circles!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a little more sheer/</li>
            <li>am not a huge makeup gal, just want something to make me look more decent.</li>
            <li>I like this because it is not thick and does not get caked into the lines around your eyes.</li>
            <li>It disappears into your skin fast and doesn&#x27;t lay in the wrinkles of my old eyes.</li>
            <li>Very discreet and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I normally use cover girl stick concealer.  </li>
            <li>And I tried it more than a few times.</li>
            <li>After rolling under both eyes, I dab it lightly as not to smear it away, AND with my finger I dab on my top lids too.</li>
            <li>It is pretty small but it would be nice if they made an even smaller purse or travel version of this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the eye pens by Garnier in the green tube for years and love them</li>
            <li>The heavy duty stuff is so much better</li>
            <li>It is a fine concealer but not particularly fantastic and did not reduce the dark circles under my eyes any more than normal concealer.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue buying this and the price is just right.</li>
            <li>it would not matter much about the shade, but it made my under eye circles look an unnatural shade of grey rather than covering and actually highlighted fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned since using this that the dark circles under my eyes are too strong to fade from the application of a liquid concealer.</li>
            <li>The metal roller is nice, but wish it was smaller to get into tight areas.</li>
            <li>there are so many far more expensive ones on the market, but I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love this roller, but the only downfall is that it&#x27;s yellow-colored and not pink, which makes it less effective for dark</li>
            <li>It covers extremely well for something so extremely light.</li>
            <li>Other concealers feel cakey, but this one goes smoothly and it takes about 30 seconds to be done with it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this anymore.</li>
            <li>that is the cause of my new eye twitch.</li>
            <li>I think it does a fine job of covering dark circles</li>
            <li>Move along if you&#x27;re even slightly more yellow than pink in tone.</li>
            <li>all settle in the creases and make my 27 yr old face look older.</li>
            <li>Love the nice cold roller ball to freshen up my eyes in he morning.will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has ever worked for me, and I have tried many many of them , some waaaay too expensive.</li>
            <li>It diminishes their appearance substantially and naturally!</li>
            <li>I like it so far!</li>
            <li>Light coverage of dark circles with revitalizing effects over time with use.</li>
            <li>When I first apply it the color immediately helps cover and conceal the bags but after wearing for a short while the caffeine in this product shrinks the puffiness</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li>this will be my second purchase, my first one is almost finished and don&#x27;t want to run out of this eye roller.</li>
            <li>Previously I have used Mary Kay concealer (pretty good), MAC concealers (both the thick pot stuff as well as the tube...</li>
            <li>It has reduced my dark circles a little and feels good too.</li>
            <li>I naturally have dark circles under my eyes, and this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually gets rid of dark eye circles since I just started using it, but I&#x27;m extremely pleased with how it covers them up.  </li>
            <li>but instead I found a product that makes a huge mess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do love how sheer it goes on and now use it for going to the gym, just for some slight cover.</li>
            <li>I thought it was funny reading the bad reviews calling it a gimmick, because it sure worked for me!!</li>
            <li>Definitely set with light dusting of powder or else this will wet into creases</li>
            <li>It looks like it&#x27;s been updated, the cap is clear as apposed to the one I had before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 50s and darkish tone under the eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy person</li>
            <li>product doesn&#x27;t cover completely (but what does?  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how well</li>
            <li>Plus, this product irritates my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I like that she could wear this around the eyes and blends with her natural skin.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, it settled into some lines I never knew existed and left my under eye skin looking very crepe-y whenever I</li>
            <li>I think it looks natural, hope it does.</li>
            <li>and i have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Coverage looks natural and I look awake.</li>
            <li>It looks really natural on too.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised to see that this was basically a liquid concealer -</li>
            <li>I had been somewhat self conscious of my eye circles for awhile.</li>
            <li>I tried it on myself (different skin type and color) and even though I didn&#x27;t have much to cover</li>
            <li>Since it is liquid, it goes on without pressure - making sure to not damage that delicate skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want something that completely covers my natural skin</li>
            <li>Reduces puffiness under the eye and blends seamlessly</li>
            <li>so it looks natural-</li>
            <li>So far I like the concept.</li>
            <li>So far from the one day I used it</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a miracle product to completely hide your under eye circles than this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would help hide the redness that I naturally have under my eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised to see so many negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>and when I use regular foundation in that area, it just gets dried and cakey and makes my wrinkles more obvious.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The roller part is cool, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the appearance of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Love it, it takes a few second to roll and go!</li>
            <li>I used my old, lighter-colored concealer on top, but then the skin under my eyes looked like it had thick, caked-on make up over it.  </li>
            <li>It seemed kind of thin</li>
            <li>And I have only used it 3 times so far!!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised and a little excited that it blended in so well.</li>
            <li>I used to get this at a pharmacy for half the price but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for a long time, so I ordered it.</li>
            <li>(Keep in mind that you can&#x27;t tell exactly how it will look until it&#x27;s dry.)</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my eyes look less tired and reduces the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The next day, after using my usual daily eye cream I used only the Garnier Roller and was worried that coverage would not be enough, but to my surprise, it actually looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that the caffeine is really decreasing blood vessel appearance as much as the makeup aspect is covering up the dark circles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but definitely changes the appearance of my dark, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot more money for products that do not lighten dark circles.</li>
            <li>After my foundation if I still need under eye coverage I lightly dab a regular concealer on the dark areas.</li>
            <li>The tint is not strong enough to cover the dark circles but it&#x27;s a good and convenient product that you can use during day time.</li>
            <li>I like that this works well with my eye moisturizer (in that it does not clump up as other products do), and it works somewhat well on covering dark circles if I use a very light application of concealer underneath and a translucent powder to set.</li>
            <li>As a fair/medium 30yr old, I LOVE it for my dark purple circles when I&#x27;m not wearing any other makeup.</li>
            <li>it is similiar to my high end tinted moisturizer I was buying at Sephora for double the amount of money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if caffeine and roller ball works the magic they claim, but my dark circles seem more hidden with this than other products I&#x27;ve tried, so I really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li>so I can barely see it!!</li>
            <li>i roll it on &amp; smooth out with a small make up</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t want to go back to normal and hurts like hell.</li>
            <li>It also dried quickly and doesnt smudge.  </li>
            <li>so you do need a few layers to adequately conceal.</li>
            <li>I can apply it alone with no other make up or mascara.  </li>
            <li>No other makeup needed just around the eye darkness eliminator.</li>
            <li>I thought it actually resolves the dark circle issues but it has a concealer in it so its not really helping, more like its a fancy cover up that looks powdery when you apply it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it for casual days when the sheer concealer is enough to make me look less raccoon and more natural beauty.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only reason I gave this 3 stars other than that this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Apparently it does work for some people, though, so it may be a genetic thing.</li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, especially people with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>(I use Bare Minerals) and it doesn&#x27;t glob up.</li>
            <li>I find that you do have to be careful because you can apply to much.</li>
            <li>, now i barely have any at all.</li>
            <li>I use it under my bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>Barely have to roll on then pat in.</li>
            <li>I read recently that you should place concealer on AFTER you use foundation, and that helped, but it didn&#x27;t completely obliterate the bags.  </li>
            <li>Soft neutral fair/ medium color doesn&#x27;t make you look like you have white bandaids under your eye!</li>
            <li>The color was lighter than expected, but I ended using it as a brightener;) around the upper cheek, lip, and brow.</li>
            <li>I apply it, I use a Q-tip to blend the edges and smooth out any areas where I might have put it on too thick.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is probably a 4 star product, since it&#x27;s not perfect.  </li>
            <li>but if you feel desperate for a good cover up its your decision.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s in a roller tube too because it&#x27;s less messy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other products that do this, but as I said, I don&#x27;t usually wear concealer</li>
            <li>The only thing to cover completely is PhotoShop!), but this product has made a definite difference.  </li>
            <li>The roller thing is a little more convenient than a little jar, but you still have to  smudge it in with a tissue.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and does not bulk up the dark circles as other cover ups during the day.  </li>
            <li>When it dries it accentuates fine lines and wrinkles, making you look old and tired anyway.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical because I have really dark under eye circles, but this stuff really covers them up amazingly well</li>
            <li>I totally Recommend it, i bought for my husband 1 week ago, and it totally works, I saw improvement since the 3rd use...and he sees that as well..he had super dark circles under his eyes..</li>
            <li>It offers the same cooling/moisturizing effect, but with a sheer tint.  </li>
            <li>I even have a few crows feet when I smile very big.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty even toned, though the skin on my eyes is a little darker.</li>
            <li>Although, it is easy to use, it has proved to be no more than a dry white concealer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice formula, but very thin, and I doubt it&#x27;s actually therapeutic.</li>
            <li>Added bonus is the roller feels almost cold and is very refreshing around the eye.    </li>
            <li>This absolutely hides those dark marks and the professors assume you are well rested and eager to learn, unlike everyone else.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really does diminish the dark circles</li>
            <li>This product really did not work for me, and if you have dark circles, I don&#x27;t think it will work for you either.</li>
            <li>It covers dark circles really well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been fighting dark circles my whole life.  </li>
            <li>I have always had dark circles my whole life.</li>
            <li>it really helps with dark circles</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the appearance of the dark circles though.</li>
            <li>This product really helps with dark circles and I use it when needed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would cover dark circles very well.</li>
            <li>It covers dark circles very well and blends well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>My friend who is a makeup artist has told me that the only way to really fix it is to use color correction something or other to balance out the colors.</li>
            <li>I immediately bought this and was willing to continue to try it a few weeks</li>
            <li>Sometimes I let it dry and put it on again to help cover the dark circles a little more.  </li>
            <li>tint\\&quot; description had me a little worried that the coverage wouldn&#x27;t be enough, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Nothing wrong with a little help now and then, and this eye roller is quick, easy and does the trick.</li>
            <li>or else you&#x27;ll just have a white cakey mess under your eyes and it will actually accentuate your dark circles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use a concealer because I don&#x27;t like standing around the store trying to pick the right shade, and I don&#x27;t use foundation on my face.</li>
            <li>No results, really, I can point to save for a slight \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li>I put this on after washing my face in the morning and wait about 15 minutes (for it to dry completely)</li>
            <li>away dark under circles + instant gentle blendable coverage in a easy-to-apply roller applicator.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really DID not help to dimish my dark circles, it only concealed them.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that conceals my bags with only one or two layers that is not greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li>Frustrating because I paid so much and this really didn&#x27;t help!</li>
            <li>Application is easy but coverage was not great.</li>
            <li>My daughters are competitive dancers, so I bought this hoping it would cover up dark undereye circles on their very fair, thin, delicate skin.</li>
            <li>This product is great for just everyday tired eyes and slightly dark circles and puffy eye.</li>
            <li>I love the applicator and it usually lasts 3 months and I use a few times daily!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t, however, spend the money to buy a second one of these since I can get the same results with products that costs half as much (even though I&#x27;ll miss the applicator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose it hides dark circles, and yes it&#x27;s fun to roll on, but like the other reviewer said, you still have to use your fingers to blend it in.</li>
            <li>its a little much.</li>
            <li>The ball is a little smaller than I would have thought and the product comes out fast.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Rather than trying to choose the perfect shade, since this is \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; it blends with your skin.</li>
            <li> (I find the L&#x27;Oreal mineral line is excellent for rosacea coverage, and I use that when I have a flare-up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not going to say it&#x27;s perfect, but it works.</li>
            <li> great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Granted, this may not make a \\&quot;permanent,corrective\\&quot; difference, but as a concealer it is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> This works great!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li> you prefer a \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; makeup, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s mineral line has a \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; powder  that is also very good.</li>
            <li> If you have very fair skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying at this point.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and this blends well.</li>

            <li> For the money it is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li> good for used .I</li>
            <li> I use every day, good product</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still really really good though</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and recommend if someone is looking for good coverage.</li>
            <li> The coverage is light and blends in perfectly.  </li>
            <li> No amount of sleep, exercise or good diet does anything for mine.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the best match I&#x27;ve found that blends well with my skin tone, but it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very Glad that we found something! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and cool, the color blends perfectly with my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I would NEVER pay more than retail for this.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am happy with it</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this makeup product.  </li>
            <li> They too are very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works better on a more medium-toned complexion; I&#x27;m very fair</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> This roller applies a light weight brightener to the under eye that doesn&#x27;t crease and covers the veins I have under my eyes beautifully.  </li>
            <li> &quot; and I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and I look so much better than without!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t what the reviews say, this product is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I love and swear by this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love how this eye roller feels when you put it on!</li>
            <li> comes out as a roller and the coloration is amazing for the under eye area.</li>
            <li> looks amazing</li>
            <li> For what this costs, it is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can get makeup like this any where.</li>
            <li> If you are the kind of person who does not like to wear makeup then go ahead and purchase it.</li>
            <li> I rolls on nicely</li>
            <li> It has a nice cooling feel with the roller ball</li>
            <li> It covers up quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Garnier is one of my favorite all -around products, well priced &amp; good results over all.</li>
            <li> I liked the cooling sensation of the metal ball.</li>
            <li> But honestly I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
            <li> Good product, just wished it was more of a concealer or a brightener</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using all kind of night creams for eyes</li>
            <li> Does a nice job concealing circles.</li>
            <li> product feels really nice when you roll it on, like a cooling sensation on my eye.  </li>
            <li> The color blends well, and it just feels really nice when you put it on.</li>
            <li> It did blend nicely, so that was a plus.  </li>
            <li> This is really a nice undereye concealer</li>
            <li> It has a really nice cooling feeling as you apply it under your eyes.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I have never found an eye cream I could apply with my concealer on top, so it could have been a good idea.  </li>
            <li> This goes on very nice, sure I&#x27;m gonna get more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Amazing and totally worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful concealer and very good at helping to keep the dark circles from coming through during the day</li>
            <li> Cheap and amazing product!</li>
            <li> and/or when I wear a full face of makeup, but its great for fooling my husband in the morning--</li>
            <li> The roll on application is great because the metal roller ball stays cool and helps decrease puffiness.</li>
            <li> am a 62 year old woman and have tried every eye cream and concealer on the market.&lt;br /&gt;For eye creams, I liked the one Kiehl&#x27;s discontinued the best.</li>
            <li> Good color match and easy to blend</li>
            <li> Cool roller ball feels very nice.</li>
            <li> I have a very strong family history of under eye circles.</li>
            <li> very easy to use</li>
            <li> Love, love this!</li>
            <li> Love this, will order more!</li>
            <li> and I feel a lot more confident when I use it!</li>
            <li> Easy, nice, good. :-)</li>
            <li> I liked the results much better.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve noticed better results with this product over department store brands.</li>
            <li> It a product you can wear on your own or under/ over a concealer if you need more coverage around the eye area.</li>
            <li> I do not hate this product - I think the coverage is quite good, but I just figured out</li>
            <li> Good light coverage.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best under eye circle product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love love love this eye roller!</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> I  would recommend this as a very light concealer to use if you want to go to the gym,food shopping.. ect.</li>
            <li> Once it is there it provides very light coverage.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation is nice &amp; it blends really easily.</li>
            <li> This is super easy to apply and blends very nicely.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Works just ok.</li>
            <li> I bought the kind without tint in it, and I saw a huge improvement in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I found this to be the better rated of under eye cover.</li>
            <li> Over that time I&#x27;ve come to terms with the fact that there is no \\&quot;solution\\&quot; to my problem, but some products do work better than others.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I think this is a good product and worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;mb</li>
            <li> I roll it on, making sure that the product comes in contact with the roller.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a roller application</li>
            <li> Even after using this product, I have purchased others just hoping that they might cover better, but I always return to this stand-by.  </li>
            <li> Sure it rolls on</li>
            <li> and  my eyes look so much better.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I still use a MAC concealer on top of this</li>
            <li> A concealer works way better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it</li>
            <li> Point being, Garnier states nothing that would come even CLOSE to stating more than that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is always ok to read up on a product before making a purchase.</li>
            <li> a one was because it is a OKAY concealer.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I look more rested.    </li>
            <li> Love this concealer.  </li>
            <li> I love this cover up stick.  </li>
            <li> Gently rolls on and blends great.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal concealer bought at Walmart does a better job for me.</li>
            <li> but is more of an all over treatment.</li>
            <li> so coverage is better as well.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> But I do love it to touch up under eyes anytime anyplace.</li>
            <li> It is tinted, but I just rubbed in a touch with my finger and put foundation on top.</li>
            <li> Works well :)</li>
            <li> But it helps which is what I wanted. :)</li>
            <li> most of the time which doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> we are amazed at how normal/ healthy my eyes look.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan because I wanted it to be more coverage, and I wanted it to be lighter.</li>
            <li> Love the roller ball.</li>
            <li> Most products cake up after an hour of wearing them.</li>
            <li> My favorite under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> plan to stock up in case it goes of the market the way everything that I love seems to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Under eye circles most affordable enemy.</li>
            <li> Works okay.</li>
            <li> Better than the concealer I used to use.</li>
            <li> Many people like this</li>
            <li> i love this thing..</li>
            <li> I could say is okay</li>
            <li> I LOVE this roller.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this, as I love Garnier products.</li>
            <li> you can buy one for your purse and one for your house and still have money for a lip gloss :-)</li>
            <li> I am most pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Garnier should make this product for more skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes the area under my eyes look fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite beauty item.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this-</li>
            <li> we both love it</li>
            <li> It gives my eyes a more awakened look.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and see if it gets better</li>
            <li> Applying a pink/salmon concealer, Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste on top.</li>
            <li> Applying Garnier skin renew roller on top.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, wish somebody had told me about it sooner!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> So I went on a hunt for something better.</li>
            <li> I fell in love.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the correct tint.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> It is better than any concealer on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I have used so many products (DOZENS) over the years</li>
            <li> They are hereditary for the most part and nothing will fix them, not even plastic surgery.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> and I have really enjoyed this one.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s better out there</li>
            <li> it acts more like a concealer</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, I am an absolute makeup/skincare junkie!!!I read great reviews about this product &amp; thought for the price</li>
            <li> Soooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff &amp; if Garnier ever retires this product I will cry myself an ocean.</li>
            <li> because most eye products cause irritation and this did not or most products don&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> Then, I gently retouch the concealer and I&#x27;ll tell you, it is amazing!</li>
            <li> , store bought concealers do a pretty fair job.</li>
            <li> Even without foundation, my eyes have taken on their beautiful old almond shape.</li>
            <li> Pretty good coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It rolls on lightly and has great coverage and feel absolutely weightless on my face.</li>
            <li> Best is the fact it does not \\&quot;cake\\&quot; or dry.  </li>
            <li> I love the applicator, and how easy it is to blend.</li>
            <li> it blends into your skin easily and does look instantly better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the color is awesome, it will adjust to your skin, I am a medium light, with yellow undertones and this shade looks awesome on my skin, brightens but not too pink.</li>
            <li> I use a fine powder over top to set.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products and brands and this is the best.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good facial and neck cream to use.  </li>
            <li> Good product for high lighting need a lil bit more to conceal however</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference in helping me look bright eyed and awake.</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and have great skin for a woman my age.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many products for dark circles -- this is the best -</li>
            <li> For those of us with circles, maybe we should realize that the way we look isn&#x27;t the most important thing after all. .</li>
            <li> I used to use clinique 32 breeze...but that shade was a bit too light for me, this one is a better shade</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s not marketed toward young adults with great skin.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and I think it does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li> I also love that it has a light concealer that is very easily blend-able for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not oily and is instead a very nice, natural looking matte texture and finish.</li>
            <li> I also like that the rollerball makes it easy for me to apply the product all the way up to my eyelashes without getting it in my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight, easily applied product that stays where I put it.</li>
            <li> so moving it around the coverage area is easy, no pulling or tugging or sticking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> it works really well, its feels light, it rolls really good around the eyes, makes the eyes look brighter.</li>
            <li> Smooths on easily and is invisible.  </li>
            <li> lightweight and easy to roll on.</li>
            <li> However in my opinion just got use as an easy cover up</li>
            <li> it easy to use even for a beginner?</li>
            <li> It blends SO easily, compared to Erase Paste and Maybelline&#x27;s roller.</li>
            <li> This is good cream for older skin.  </li>
            <li> This product works perfectly for dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li> As a cover up for dark circles it works great!  </li>
            <li> Best under eye dark spot thing i found</li>
            <li> Have used Garnier Anti-dark circle Eye Roller for awhile now and it is the best product I have tried to help hide my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Best anti dark circle ever used.</li>
            <li> The application is too easy, and it blends like a fine, light cream should.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and easy to apply</li>
            <li> and I have had no issues with it settling into fine lines or causing dryness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light, and it&#x27;s really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> it works fine .</li>
            <li> the pot stuff was greasy and settle into fine lines...</li>
            <li> This rolled on easily and was a light color, but it didn&#x27;t make the bags disappear.  </li>
            <li> but it turned out fine.</li>
            <li> There is very little more that can be done to make an already incredible product any better.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for people who do not like to cover their face in makeup in order to cover every little imperfection.  </li>
            <li> The metal ball is very cooling and distributes nice light coverage to the undereye area.</li>
            <li> It blends easily by dabbing a clean finger on the area, but the color might be too light for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference when I apply this under my eyes.</li>
            <li> &quot; I have always applied a light cream under my eyes so the product would \\&quot;flow.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> It is lightly tinted and after i roll it under my eyes, I dab it in with my finger until blended</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light, it doesn&#x27;t cake on - isn&#x27;t noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I like the way this rolls on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t require that I rub it in.  </li>
            <li> The color is light (but still covers amazingly well) which works very well for me but may be too light for darker skinned gals.</li>
            <li> This product is mostly just concealer in a different package, but the concealer was thinner than most others I&#x27;ve tried and distributed itself nicely instead of getting sticky and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of days, but I think it is great.</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin undertones and just turned 30.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because it highlights instantly.</li>
            <li> Unfortuately the concealer is too light for my skintone (or maybe it is just me)</li>
            <li> When I finish this bottle, I wont be re-ordering, but I do recommend to those who have a light complexion, for those of us whose skintone is a darker honey/olive we have to look elsewhere...</li>
            <li> I liked the result so much that I haven&#x27;t gone a day since then without applying this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but helps cover my undereye bags/darkness.</li>
            <li> Then I put cover up on, and lightly dab the cover up sponge over my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and lasting power!</li>
            <li> realize not every product works the same for every person, but for me this product works great</li>
            <li> It really brightens my eye area and can touch up nicely through out the day.</li>
            <li> It rolls on so smoothly, and brightens around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit greasy but still a lot better/lighter than foundation and still gives really great coverage.</li>
            <li> It rolls on creamy and too light for me, for anybody almost.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, blends well and covers for hours.</li>
            <li> medium to light.</li>
            <li> too light for my skin tone</li>
            <li> love the cool feeling of the metal ball and caffeine too under my eyes and on my skin too, it&#x27;s nice and refreshing and does a nice job of COVERING UP my dark circles in the morning and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> the color applied (conceler) is a good natural color</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and helps incredibly with dark circles.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, feels cool and helps in minimizing wrinkles and circles.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d think good sun protection would make it easier for the product to work quickly, since it doesn&#x27;t have to fight new damage as well.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s moisturizing while being super easy to blend.</li>
            <li> This product is more like a concealer for people with dark circles like myself, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply and blends well.  </li>
            <li> but after gently blending it with my finger, I thought it looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizing effect is good, but it isn&#x27;t too effective at stopping dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m (very) fair skinned, and the tint of this product is too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it&#x27;s super easy and clean when applying.</li>
            <li> general reference, I have fair, combination skin</li>
            <li> I was excited about the idea of a product that offered both a lotion and concealer in one</li>
            <li> worth the money!</li>
            <li> What makes this product unique is that it has caffeine in it.</li>
            <li> Sheer and light texture with good coverage.</li>
            <li> Rolls on super easy and quick.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, feels weightless, and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> So loose and win.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and blends right into the skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing special</li>
            <li> Turns out she was right!</li>
            <li> The concealer stay on the surface of my skin but the &amp;#34;eye stuff&amp;#34; goes right into it and lift my eyes (get rid of my puffy eyes!).</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble blending in this color on my very fair red/blue undertone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, fits easily in my purse, easy to blend and works great.</li>
            <li> The concealer is a great medium-coverage item that can easily be thrown into a makeup bag as it needs no special brushes.</li>
            <li> It gives that full coverage look, it highlights, primes, conceals.</li>
            <li> I can wear makeup under my eyes and my whole face looks more finished because of it.  </li>
            <li> (the metal roller feels cool on my skin, which I like).  </li>
            <li> It makes me look like I got a full night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I have purchased some for others to try.</li>
            <li> Thanks to lovely lor</li>
            <li> The ball reduces inflammation as it is cool to the touch.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know a lot about make up, but I did buy another product and it works better.  </li>
            <li> love the applicator for applying all over my face without getting too much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rewind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, Asian skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the cool metal ball.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer so much that I subscribed on Amazon.</li>
            <li> tube is okay), Amazing Makeup Concealer (good coverage but kind of dry thick texture after awhile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could not attest to the \\&quot;skin benefits\\&quot; as I have not seen much of an improvement in my skin itself, however for the lovely dark purple bags under my eyes that I am genetically predisposed to it works great.  </li>
            <li> Great product - hides dark circles under eyes very well and helps under eyes look much much better..  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many creams for dark circles as well as undereye concealers with results from okay to this stuff</li>
            <li> However, it is the best under eye concealer I&#x27;ve used, and I have used many expensive brands, including Bobbi Brown, Trish McEvoy, Lancome, Clinique, MAC, etc.  </li>
            <li> It covers, but it also corrects the problem, and quite quickly for me, too.  </li>
            <li> I just glide the stick under my eye and dab it on quickly.</li>
            <li> I use one roll per eye, and tap QUICKLY, as it sets almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also add I have pretty light skin, when I buy foundation</li>
            <li> I have pretty light skin and it blended well with my skin  color.  </li>
            <li> Normal, inexpensive foundation did a better job.</li>
            <li> When I am ready to apply my makeup it is absorbed into my under eye area and looks like my skin only greatly improved.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty light</li>
            <li> However, the product is so light you will barely feel it, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Maybelline New York Fit Me!</li>
            <li> The concealer doesn&#x27;t give raccoon eyes like so many others do, it doesn&#x27;t cake up, its very smooth to put on (needs to be patted dry and worked in a bit).</li>
            <li> But, this goes on really easy and blends without much effort.  </li>
            <li> I really like the glide on tube, makes application easy.  </li>
            <li> This one is dark near perfect.</li>
            <li> , obviously not because I love the coverage, but because I was interested to see if there were more long-term results, and there have been none whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product yesterday and love it so far!  </li>
            <li> so another person might like the covering qualities of this product--however, the roller ball on mine delivers way too much concealer for rolling across one&#x27;s eye area!!</li>
            <li> However, I do not see the signs of aging disappear or do much about the fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size so you can put it in your purse for a little touch up while you are out on a date or with friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it does an excellent job of covering these veins without making my under eye crepey or emphasizing the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> and she usually uses high end products and takes VERY good care of herself!</li>
            <li> You really have to use your fingers to lightly tap it in or it just blends away.</li>
            <li> Amazing it&#x27;s the only makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and spreads really well.</li>
            <li> so I love that this product looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be awesome when I saw the commercial for it, but when I got it in the mail it left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> Still, for me the benefits are well worth it</li>
            <li> However, I did feel the rush of the caffeine-- which is absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> I went to the store and got my own tube the next day.  </li>
            <li> it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> it was worth checking out.</li>
            <li> I can say that this is light and doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable fragrance whereas the other product I bought does kind of smell.</li>
            <li> It is just as good as any other cooling roller eye treatment out there.</li>
            <li> This item was leaking right out the box.</li>
            <li> If you are in a hurry and did not put any make-up on the Garnier Skin Renew blends right into your skin</li>
            <li> i did find if i use right after my morning skin care regimine....</li>
            <li> I put this on right after I moisturize and then continue on with the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin and have to be very careful to avoid the caked-on look with concealing products, but I have never had a moments worry with this product.  </li>
            <li> the reason i don&#x27;t exclusively use BB is because i don&#x27;t always want that full coverage as i really prefer the feel of freshly cleaned, untreated skin.</li>
            <li> This works great as a concealer, not so much as a fix to my dark circle problem.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for puffy eyes and the light particles mask any dark shades.</li>
            <li> color matches very easily and simple to apply.</li>
            <li> I REALLY thought and hoped this was something special.</li>
            <li> This works great as a concealer, but no more than that.</li>
            <li> Good for dark circles.</li>
            <li> This stuff works good as a concealer on my dark purple circles and crowsfeet.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that does not cake up or settle into fine lines, at all!</li>
            <li> I also am putting a little on my eyelid as well and find this lightens up the area as well as is a good primer for eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m still on the first tube), and while it does do a fairly good job concealing my dark circles, it certainly has not lightened them over time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and absolutely love this product because of how effective it covers my dark circles, meanwhile seeming very natural and easy to blend into my skin.</li>
            <li> I think a regular concealer would have been better.</li>
            <li> Nothing cumulative resulted from using the whole roller to the end of its useful life.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I&#x27;m a GUY.</li>
            <li> This product is honestly my ultimate favorite beauty product I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything was coming out of the roller at first.</li>
            <li> Really wakes up my eyes!  </li>
            <li> At first it worked</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Garnier Anti-Dark circle eye roller does exactly what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve pretty much accepted that I am stuck with my circles!</li>
            <li> Not with this product, no irritation and keeps the skin soft and excema free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that first thing in the morning</li>
            <li> An ice-pak would have more lasting effect.</li>
            <li> it actually works better &amp; lasts until I remove it.</li>
            <li> but i like BB creme better as it does the same thing</li>
            <li> I kind of expected to use it and be...</li>
            <li> Love the sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I felt just one coat made a difference.</li>
            <li> but you can see a noticable, lighter patch under my eyes, so I only use it for emergencies.  :-)    </li>
            <li> I love this concealer, I use it daily under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male esthetician and have tried many eye products from department stores ranging from $40 and up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite products at the moment</li>
            <li> Too much comes out of the applicator to make the roller ball useful.</li>
            <li> It is light and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> First, this product lasts forever.</li>
            <li> and it is pretty matte once it dries.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I reach for this over higher end</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing results after a few months but it is a good concealer.</li>
            <li> I think I would look better in pictures with this combo, but in person, it doesn&#x27;t look good, especially since I don&#x27;t like to wear my foundation super thick.  </li>
            <li> I really wish they would come out with new colors, both lighter and darker than what is available now.  </li>
            <li> wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Not at all surprised coming from Garnier, I have always loved the results that I get with every single product of theirs.</li>
            <li> Most people would probably be more than happy with the way this product conceals dark circles, as long as there is no expectation that it will actually make the dark circles go away over time, and as long as you&#x27;re comfortable with shelling out a nice chunk of change for it.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging and the hype, not so much for the actual product.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should try this or not because there were so many negative comments.  </li>
            <li> I can add as many coats as I want without the product creasing into the tiny fine lines starting to show under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This pretty much guarantees an A+ in any class.</li>
            <li> You can pretty much never believe the transformations cosmetics companies promise because they all Photoshop every image on their product.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s pretty much all this is.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had good results with this for small areas</li>
            <li> My skin tone is of a fair olive tone complexion and not many cosmetics have a tone to match my complexion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for a cover up if you don&#x27;t want to look like you have on makeup, but just don&#x27;t expect it to give you any reduction in those dark circles.</li>
            <li> That said, the color of the concealer is a nice cover for dark circles.</li>
            <li> It blends really well with light finger tapping, so I often wear it even when I wear no other makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use it everyday even if I&#x27;m not wearing any other makeup because it feels good.</li>
            <li> It does a great job concealing the dark circles I&#x27;ve had under my eyes since I was a teen.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight, goes on amazingly smooth and diminishes dark circles without the heaviness of the others.  </li>
            <li> This product does a great job of covering the dark area at my inner eye.</li>
            <li> And, when it does become set, its coverage is not as good as a regular concealer by a long shot.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot though I feel the roller ball is too large for the targeted under eye area</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinklesaround my eyes due to my addiction to sunglasses but there are still some very fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cakey for my taste but to each his own.</li>
            <li> On the up side I found the application had a slight cooling feel, which felt very nice especially at 8am when I was getting off work, or at midnight when I was coming in.  </li>
            <li> It essentially rolls patchy makeup over your skin, which you then spread to evenly cover the circles, but it seems as if it&#x27;s only effective for people with a certain skin tone.</li>
            <li> As all the womens&#x27; magazine beauty gurus say, pulling on the \\&quot;delicate skin\\&quot; below the eyes is not something that&#x27;s very good to do, especially on an on-going basis.  </li>
            <li> I gave the same product to my mom, and she also saw a huge improvement, so it will work on all ages.</li>
            <li> The amazing thing about this is that it also has a moisturizer which has definitely helped my under-eye area overall.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t lighten up much of anything.</li>
            <li> I need something that works; this really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t cover the circles</li>
            <li> The make-up is really liquidy, therefore it has to set under the eye before being blended.</li>
            <li> very much!&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the price is so inexpensive that I really think that increases the value of this product to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> I had really given up on finding anything that works.  </li>
            <li> You would prob get the same results with a cheap tinted moisturizer I would think.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> It is very \\&quot;slick/slippery\\&quot;</li>
            <li> (although Emu oil really helps with wrinkles....) are people hoping for miracles?</li>
            <li> I run thru it about every 2 months, but I do use it several times/day when the light concealer wears off--don&#x27;t mind though.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised but was considerably more liquid than I expected.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it much, but it works.</li>
            <li> but it really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just a cover-up, not a treatment.</li>
            <li> It really looks sooo natural!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (i like aveeno)..then apply this but not the roller so much as the product.</li>
            <li> but this is a bit much.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product has increased the health of my eyes and really works.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed</li>
            <li> very easlily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to try to cover them but it always looks like a bruise being covered but still very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Also, this product is so shear but covers very well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t crease up and really brightens the area.</li>
            <li> , this really makes my eyes look brighter and conceals the lines and wrinkles under them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to take the kids to school and run errands.</li>
            <li> My thoughts are really what is the point.</li>
            <li> This also is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I could never use concealer because it was always very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> its very watery and does no convering</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> BUT, I have found it works very well in covering up any redness(acne and irritation).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really conceal anything.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really cover anything up though.  </li>
            <li> Really perks up your under eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> If you roll under eye, way to much comes out.</li>
            <li> Very.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I roll it on and blow my hairdryer gently on my face--it dries in about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I use it as a concealer and it works, hiddens the eye blemish very well.</li>
            <li> I use it for years, and hidrate very well too</li>
            <li> Covers better than expected.</li>
            <li> I apply with caution as Erase Paste is REALLY</li>
            <li> Applyng Maybelline age rewinder in medium, which is harder to blend but gives a bit more coverage</li>
            <li> I like putthing this on in the mornings as I get ready for my day.</li>
            <li> i really like the product.</li>
            <li> This product also works very well with foundation, because it doesn&#x27;t have a real color or texture that will clash with your foundation</li>
            <li> but I really would not recommend this</li>
            <li> At first I thought that I had simply not closed the cap tightly, only to have more fabric soiled by it.</li>
            <li> absolutely works.............</li>
            <li> I have been through all the expensive concealers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> A good neutral tint too, for those with pink or yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> If you have severe dark circles you will probably need a higher coverage concealer, this is more on the lighter side.</li>
            <li> It does however, cover quite naturally when paired with a light powder and hides a natural amount of under eye darkness without making you look like its caked on.</li>
            <li> I love how milky the concealer is - it simple rolls on and its a very sheer liquid layer that rubs right into your skin</li>
            <li> I can tell you from many years of experience and many hundreds of wasted dollars in products that this product is soooo much better than Clarins, Clinique, NARS, MAC, Lancome and all of the other countless brands I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s not going to totally eliminate every dark shadow under your eye and make you look like the models on their commercials, but it does a nice job overall.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any other cover up I have ever had to use.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this worked any better than any other under-eye concealer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually too tinted to use in significant amounts as I like to \\&quot;overuse\\&quot; creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually sensitive to things, don&#x27;t have allergies or anything, I&#x27;m tough LOL!</li>
            <li> It helped make circles somewhat less prominent on my face, but it certainly didn&#x27;t cover them up much.</li>
            <li> I do like to reapply it a couple times throughout the day as it seems to kind of wear off, but I have had the same experience with pretty much every other product I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Looking to cover-up pregnancy-induced dark circles, and this product is the best I&#x27;ve found (in my price range, at least).</li>
            <li> I have no idea whether the caffeine does anything for my dark circles, but honestly what ingredient really makes any kind of lasting impression on dark circles??  </li>
            <li> In addition, the liquid is not thick enough to provide good coverage for dark under eye circles, which is the whole reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> This product looks natural, is easy to apply (you have to blend with your fingers) and it last all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, while the roller ball feels nice and cool, it makes for sloppy application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know there are several products that cost twice as much with only the caffeine benefit and not the cover up benefit, this seems to have both for a better price.  </li>
            <li> Tried it for a full month, NOTHING different!</li>
            <li> It covered up my dark circles better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> You roll it on and pat it into your skin and like magic the dark circles are covered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle treatment, and it&#x27;s not like you cant see the puffys at all, but it does brighten your eyes for a more awake look and it covers lighter dark circles.</li>
            <li> but I had dark circles AND a good dark vein that runs under my right eye.</li>
            <li> Perhaps others may have a better experience, but I can&#x27;t help but think the reviews are slightly skewed.</li>
            <li> Anything more severe than slight, and forget about this helping.</li>
            <li> but for the price it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> The rollerball applies smoothly most of the time, but occasionally I will have to roll it across a tissue if it&#x27;s not coming out enough.</li>
            <li> Covers decently.</li>
            <li> Better than more expensive brand</li>
            <li> It has 10 oils in it, and my face actually looked better the next morning.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to last all day without creasing or drying out and the coverage is good without looking heavy.  </li>
            <li> The roller application reduces puffiness quickly, too, so eyes look younger and</li>
            <li> Works as well as or better than more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> You could see the blue of my eyes more than the blue under them.</li>
            <li> when you try it on, it looks like you&#x27;re applying some sort of powder under your eyes even if you trying to blur that area out, it dries so quick that come out a different color that do not match with your tone skin  anymore when you try it on.</li>
            <li> you cant notice that he had something covering, it looks very natural!</li>
            <li> On a basic color spectrum (light, medium, dark), it would be light.</li>
            <li> I love it because it goes no light and smoothly and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this magic little wand because law school was causing me to look like a basset hound.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone is tearing this little roller to shreds, I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love that this reduces and helps camouflage dark circles!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little more sheer/</li>
            <li> am not a huge makeup gal, just want something to make me look more decent.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is not thick and does not get caked into the lines around your eyes.</li>
            <li> It disappears into your skin fast and doesn&#x27;t lay in the wrinkles of my old eyes.</li>
            <li> Very discreet and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I normally use cover girl stick concealer.  </li>
            <li> And I tried it more than a few times.</li>
            <li> After rolling under both eyes, I dab it lightly as not to smear it away, AND with my finger I dab on my top lids too.</li>
            <li> It is pretty small but it would be nice if they made an even smaller purse or travel version of this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the eye pens by Garnier in the green tube for years and love them</li>
            <li> The heavy duty stuff is so much better</li>
            <li> It is a fine concealer but not particularly fantastic and did not reduce the dark circles under my eyes any more than normal concealer.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue buying this and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> it would not matter much about the shade, but it made my under eye circles look an unnatural shade of grey rather than covering and actually highlighted fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned since using this that the dark circles under my eyes are too strong to fade from the application of a liquid concealer.</li>
            <li> The metal roller is nice, but wish it was smaller to get into tight areas.</li>
            <li> there are so many far more expensive ones on the market, but I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I love this roller, but the only downfall is that it&#x27;s yellow-colored and not pink, which makes it less effective for dark</li>
            <li> It covers extremely well for something so extremely light.</li>
            <li> Other concealers feel cakey, but this one goes smoothly and it takes about 30 seconds to be done with it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this anymore.</li>
            <li> that is the cause of my new eye twitch.</li>
            <li> I think it does a fine job of covering dark circles</li>
            <li> Move along if you&#x27;re even slightly more yellow than pink in tone.</li>
            <li> all settle in the creases and make my 27 yr old face look older.</li>
            <li> Love the nice cold roller ball to freshen up my eyes in he morning.will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has ever worked for me, and I have tried many many of them , some waaaay too expensive.</li>
            <li> It diminishes their appearance substantially and naturally!</li>
            <li> I like it so far!</li>
            <li> Light coverage of dark circles with revitalizing effects over time with use.</li>
            <li> When I first apply it the color immediately helps cover and conceal the bags but after wearing for a short while the caffeine in this product shrinks the puffiness</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> this will be my second purchase, my first one is almost finished and don&#x27;t want to run out of this eye roller.</li>
            <li> Previously I have used Mary Kay concealer (pretty good), MAC concealers (both the thick pot stuff as well as the tube...</li>
            <li> It has reduced my dark circles a little and feels good too.</li>
            <li> I naturally have dark circles under my eyes, and this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually gets rid of dark eye circles since I just started using it, but I&#x27;m extremely pleased with how it covers them up.  </li>
            <li> but instead I found a product that makes a huge mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I do love how sheer it goes on and now use it for going to the gym, just for some slight cover.</li>
            <li> I thought it was funny reading the bad reviews calling it a gimmick, because it sure worked for me!!</li>
            <li> Definitely set with light dusting of powder or else this will wet into creases</li>
            <li> It looks like it&#x27;s been updated, the cap is clear as apposed to the one I had before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50s and darkish tone under the eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy person</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t cover completely (but what does?  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well</li>
            <li> Plus, this product irritates my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> I like that she could wear this around the eyes and blends with her natural skin.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, it settled into some lines I never knew existed and left my under eye skin looking very crepe-y whenever I</li>
            <li> I think it looks natural, hope it does.</li>
            <li> and i have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Coverage looks natural and I look awake.</li>
            <li> It looks really natural on too.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised to see that this was basically a liquid concealer -</li>
            <li> I had been somewhat self conscious of my eye circles for awhile.</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself (different skin type and color) and even though I didn&#x27;t have much to cover</li>
            <li> Since it is liquid, it goes on without pressure - making sure to not damage that delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want something that completely covers my natural skin</li>
            <li> Reduces puffiness under the eye and blends seamlessly</li>
            <li> so it looks natural-</li>
            <li> So far I like the concept.</li>
            <li> So far from the one day I used it</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a miracle product to completely hide your under eye circles than this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help hide the redness that I naturally have under my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see so many negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> and when I use regular foundation in that area, it just gets dried and cakey and makes my wrinkles more obvious.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The roller part is cool, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the appearance of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Love it, it takes a few second to roll and go!</li>
            <li> I used my old, lighter-colored concealer on top, but then the skin under my eyes looked like it had thick, caked-on make up over it.  </li>
            <li> It seemed kind of thin</li>
            <li> And I have only used it 3 times so far!!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised and a little excited that it blended in so well.</li>
            <li> I used to get this at a pharmacy for half the price but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for a long time, so I ordered it.</li>
            <li> (Keep in mind that you can&#x27;t tell exactly how it will look until it&#x27;s dry.)</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my eyes look less tired and reduces the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The next day, after using my usual daily eye cream I used only the Garnier Roller and was worried that coverage would not be enough, but to my surprise, it actually looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that the caffeine is really decreasing blood vessel appearance as much as the makeup aspect is covering up the dark circles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but definitely changes the appearance of my dark, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot more money for products that do not lighten dark circles.</li>
            <li> After my foundation if I still need under eye coverage I lightly dab a regular concealer on the dark areas.</li>
            <li> The tint is not strong enough to cover the dark circles but it&#x27;s a good and convenient product that you can use during day time.</li>
            <li> I like that this works well with my eye moisturizer (in that it does not clump up as other products do), and it works somewhat well on covering dark circles if I use a very light application of concealer underneath and a translucent powder to set.</li>
            <li> As a fair/medium 30yr old, I LOVE it for my dark purple circles when I&#x27;m not wearing any other makeup.</li>
            <li> it is similiar to my high end tinted moisturizer I was buying at Sephora for double the amount of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if caffeine and roller ball works the magic they claim, but my dark circles seem more hidden with this than other products I&#x27;ve tried, so I really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> so I can barely see it!!</li>
            <li> i roll it on &amp; smooth out with a small make up</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t want to go back to normal and hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> It also dried quickly and doesnt smudge.  </li>
            <li> so you do need a few layers to adequately conceal.</li>
            <li> I can apply it alone with no other make up or mascara.  </li>
            <li> No other makeup needed just around the eye darkness eliminator.</li>
            <li> I thought it actually resolves the dark circle issues but it has a concealer in it so its not really helping, more like its a fancy cover up that looks powdery when you apply it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it for casual days when the sheer concealer is enough to make me look less raccoon and more natural beauty.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only reason I gave this 3 stars other than that this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Apparently it does work for some people, though, so it may be a genetic thing.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, especially people with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> (I use Bare Minerals) and it doesn&#x27;t glob up.</li>
            <li> I find that you do have to be careful because you can apply to much.</li>
            <li> , now i barely have any at all.</li>
            <li> I use it under my bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> Barely have to roll on then pat in.</li>
            <li> I read recently that you should place concealer on AFTER you use foundation, and that helped, but it didn&#x27;t completely obliterate the bags.  </li>
            <li> Soft neutral fair/ medium color doesn&#x27;t make you look like you have white bandaids under your eye!</li>
            <li> The color was lighter than expected, but I ended using it as a brightener;) around the upper cheek, lip, and brow.</li>
            <li> I apply it, I use a Q-tip to blend the edges and smooth out any areas where I might have put it on too thick.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is probably a 4 star product, since it&#x27;s not perfect.  </li>
            <li> but if you feel desperate for a good cover up its your decision.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s in a roller tube too because it&#x27;s less messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other products that do this, but as I said, I don&#x27;t usually wear concealer</li>
            <li> The only thing to cover completely is PhotoShop!), but this product has made a definite difference.  </li>
            <li> The roller thing is a little more convenient than a little jar, but you still have to  smudge it in with a tissue.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight and does not bulk up the dark circles as other cover ups during the day.  </li>
            <li> When it dries it accentuates fine lines and wrinkles, making you look old and tired anyway.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have really dark under eye circles, but this stuff really covers them up amazingly well</li>
            <li> I totally Recommend it, i bought for my husband 1 week ago, and it totally works, I saw improvement since the 3rd use...and he sees that as well..he had super dark circles under his eyes..</li>
            <li> It offers the same cooling/moisturizing effect, but with a sheer tint.  </li>
            <li> I even have a few crows feet when I smile very big.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty even toned, though the skin on my eyes is a little darker.</li>
            <li> Although, it is easy to use, it has proved to be no more than a dry white concealer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice formula, but very thin, and I doubt it&#x27;s actually therapeutic.</li>
            <li> Added bonus is the roller feels almost cold and is very refreshing around the eye.    </li>
            <li> This absolutely hides those dark marks and the professors assume you are well rested and eager to learn, unlike everyone else.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really does diminish the dark circles</li>
            <li> This product really did not work for me, and if you have dark circles, I don&#x27;t think it will work for you either.</li>
            <li> It covers dark circles really well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting dark circles my whole life.  </li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles my whole life.</li>
            <li> it really helps with dark circles</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the appearance of the dark circles though.</li>
            <li> This product really helps with dark circles and I use it when needed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would cover dark circles very well.</li>
            <li> It covers dark circles very well and blends well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> My friend who is a makeup artist has told me that the only way to really fix it is to use color correction something or other to balance out the colors.</li>
            <li> I immediately bought this and was willing to continue to try it a few weeks</li>
            <li> Sometimes I let it dry and put it on again to help cover the dark circles a little more.  </li>
            <li> tint\\&quot; description had me a little worried that the coverage wouldn&#x27;t be enough, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with a little help now and then, and this eye roller is quick, easy and does the trick.</li>
            <li> or else you&#x27;ll just have a white cakey mess under your eyes and it will actually accentuate your dark circles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use a concealer because I don&#x27;t like standing around the store trying to pick the right shade, and I don&#x27;t use foundation on my face.</li>
            <li> No results, really, I can point to save for a slight \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li> I put this on after washing my face in the morning and wait about 15 minutes (for it to dry completely)</li>
            <li> away dark under circles + instant gentle blendable coverage in a easy-to-apply roller applicator.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really DID not help to dimish my dark circles, it only concealed them.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that conceals my bags with only one or two layers that is not greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Frustrating because I paid so much and this really didn&#x27;t help!</li>
            <li> Application is easy but coverage was not great.</li>
            <li> My daughters are competitive dancers, so I bought this hoping it would cover up dark undereye circles on their very fair, thin, delicate skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great for just everyday tired eyes and slightly dark circles and puffy eye.</li>
            <li> I love the applicator and it usually lasts 3 months and I use a few times daily!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t, however, spend the money to buy a second one of these since I can get the same results with products that costs half as much (even though I&#x27;ll miss the applicator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose it hides dark circles, and yes it&#x27;s fun to roll on, but like the other reviewer said, you still have to use your fingers to blend it in.</li>
            <li> its a little much.</li>
            <li> The ball is a little smaller than I would have thought and the product comes out fast.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m getting a little bit older my eye area has gotten darker ( sleep deprivation is also part of the problem, but that&#x27;s another story that I will spare you )</li>
            <li> If you want a miracle product that will instantly make your dark circles go away you might want to talk to a dermatologist, but this does exactly what it says it will on the box - it conceals dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that the puffiness under my eyes actually got worse after using this product and dark circles did not go away.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it actually hides my dark circles, but it is much easier to apply and blend in than my other concealers which is reason enough for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li> As often as I&#x27;ve used it, the dispenser has lasted a reasonably long time: it doesn&#x27;t seem to be near empty yet.</li>
            <li> Especially during finals after those long study nights, people have commented the next day how well rested</li>
            <li> I have struggled with really dark undereye circles for the past few years, and have tried out many products such as Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste and Maybelline&#x27;s Age</li>
            <li> though as far as lightening dark circles, I don&#x27;t see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it completely cover dark circles?</li>
            <li> Long lasting eye coverage for me</li>
            <li> This product goes on pretty thick</li>
            <li> Also, I dont know how this tiny tube lasts so long!</li>
            <li> It is too white and too dry.</li>
            <li> Overall: complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it would drastically reduce severe dark eyes, but works fine for the average person.</li>
            <li> A few friends asked me if I was feeling okay and that I looked tired and that my eyes had circles under them.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every concealing cream/stick product on the market for less than $25, and until now, I had not found one that really worked for the dark circles I&#x27;ve had since I was a teenager, (and that&#x27;s been QUITE a while).  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for either gender, especially for other men looking for an unnoticeable fix.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s, medium tone caucasian skin, and have always had dark circles under my eyes, largely due to genetics and the fact that I have deep set eyes which causes my brow bone to create additional shadowing under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> She had the secret to covering the dark circles without highlighting the fine lines.</li>
            <li> I really hope this product is never discontinued, because I would hate to have to go back on a search for a product that both covers and doesn&#x27;t emphasize the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I am 16 years old and have very dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I only use my expensive Giorgio Armani concealer for emergencies or special occasions.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I noticed any renewing of my skin, but at least I found something that covers it very well without caking.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it barely covered up my dark circles.</li>
            <li> and since I just use it around my eyes, it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> but for covering dark circles it is okay not perfect though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the pale side and thought it would be too dark, but it blends very well.</li>
            <li> dark circle eye roller should be enough if you only have light dark circles under your eye, but if you have pretty bad dark circles like I do, this concealer will not come close to covering your dark circles completely.</li>
            <li> It is not perfect and doesn&#x27;t completely hide my dark circles, but it&#x27;s better than what I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I woke up with my eyes extremely swollen and red</li>
            <li> After letting this corrector dry, I put on Aveeno lotion with SPF 15 or BB cream with SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had undereye circles all my life along with dry skin under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Then I let it dry while doing my hair, so it stays put when I put on my tinted sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Put Burt&#x27;s Bees repair serum under my undereyes, otherwise they get dry</li>
            <li> This product is my go-to concealer that I use every single day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because it claims to soothe and treat the dark circles, and I&#x27;ve seen no evidence at all that it does this.</li>
            <li> Also realize, this is just a CONCEALER, not a miracle worker, it will only CONCEAL dark circles, not make them go away..</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it does in no way shape or form treat or prevent further dark circles.</li>
            <li> It did cover the dark circles under my eyes, but it left a tan, orangey color.  </li>
            <li> TIRED\\&quot;-TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;\\&quot;INSTANTLY CORRECT THE APPEARENCE OF DARK CIRCLES &amp; BRIGHTEN THE SKIN AROUND YOUR EYES.\\&quot;&#x3D;THIS STATEMENT</li>
            <li> It can only REDUCE the image of dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would help with puffiness and especially the dark circles.</li>
            <li> If you find that it isn&#x27;t quite dark enough they make it in a medium/dark tone also.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even go into detail about the fact that it doesn&#x27;t cover up dark circles, I will just simply say that it causes twitching underneath the eye!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would cure my dark circles, only to use it and feel like it was a concealor, thus feeling ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have had dark circles under and above my eyes all my life, this product delivers what is promises!</li>
            <li> Where haa this product been the last 10yrs that I have been trying to cover up my dark circles under my eyes? &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this product to actually resolve the issue of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really dark circles, so coverage is enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dark circles even if I get 8 hours of sleep and this is the only product that I have used that hides them.</li>
            <li> Grantite I do not have deep dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I have recommended to several friends (who have dark circles).  </li>
            <li> It gives me enough color so that I don&#x27;t have to apply any other make up in that area which makes me look and feel a little younger.</li>
            <li> My one major complaint is that it stings my eyes a little as I have sensitive eyes, if it weren&#x27;t for that fact I would give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The key to using the roller (or any concealer for that matter) is blending and only use a small amount</li>
            <li> and I have previously tried the regular puffy eye roller, and it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I even use it to cover other minor flaws on my face.  </li>
            <li> and I hated that it slightly pulled at my skin but did a great job covering up.</li>
            <li> I have very bad dark circles under my eyes and have to add several swipes for good coverage.</li>
            <li> it was so thin and so super pale.</li>
            <li> In fact, there&#x27;s a little piece of plastic that sticks up next the roller ball that scratches my skin</li>
            <li> I have found other concealers that work as well as this for much much less money, but I do like the roller ball applicator, so I felt that overall this product deserved 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> The only dark circle remover that works!!!!!!The dark circles are gradually lightening,and until their gone,the mineralsin the ;</li>
            <li> I am olive complected, with average dark circles(wear concealor daily).</li>
            <li> They also run in my family, so there is not much hope of escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that will give you long term dark circle improvement, then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> The only reason I took off one star is that I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually doing anything to reduce my dark under eye circles</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful when I do roll it).</li>
            <li> it does what it&#x27;s supposed to...covers dark circles &amp; minor imperfections.</li>
            <li> and everything ends up way too pink for me.</li>
            <li> soo theres not much hope of them going away.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dark circles and this product, while it does help did not completely do away with them.  </li>
            <li> Not really anything to &#x27;write&#x27; home about...</li>
            <li> , my skin looks smoother for the next few days after using it.</li>
            <li> If you add makeup while it is still wet, it may &#x27;disappear&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it roughly 5 times a week for over two years.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no cakiness.</li>
            <li> really great..non irritating.</li>
            <li> I give it a check minus for concealing under-eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The liquid comes out all uneven, fast then slow.</li>
            <li> course, the \\&quot;anti-puffy\\&quot; claim is ridiculous (also Olay&#x27;s roller-ball product, which was a complete bust &amp; didn&#x27;t deliver on any of its claims!).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale white guy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just plain concealer/liquid makeup in a different package, ladies.</li>
            <li> I have bad dark circles and most concealers cake, crease, or just don&#x27;t cover.</li>
            <li> (I have bad allergies) and made my dark circles more noticeable.</li>
            <li> but nothing has much helped my dark circles without making wrinkles look worse.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Because it has blendability and coverage that no other products do and it doesn&#x27;t burn the delicate skin under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My eyes look brighter and healthier when I&#x27;ve used this product, unlike other concealers.    </li>
            <li> And YES, you do have to blend it in with your finger, just like every other undereye concealer.  </li>
            <li> Some days I use it alone, other days under powder.</li>
            <li> i wash, then use a facial exfoliating brush then a small amount of sunscreen/moisturizer</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a lot over the past several years.  </li>
            <li> It will take some getting used to as I usually slather on the eye gel with several swipes of the roller ball in order to &amp;#34;deflate&amp;#34; my under eye bags.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this color would be too light/sheer for me based on some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> a little on the rest of my face giving it a chance to dry.</li>
            <li> Really does work to help me from looking exhausted when I&#x27;ve had too little sleep.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is wishful thinking or that the other ingredients are actually helping diminish my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I ended up ditching it for my $0.99 stick that you can buy anywhere simply because it got so frustrating having to reapply six or seven times to get the same result.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t get a heavy or dry feeling around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark bags for years due to allergies.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thinner than conventional concealer</li>
            <li> This still takes less time than some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product just covers the dark circles, not something to see improve your dark circles over the time.</li>
            <li> But hasn&#x27;t reduced the dark circles at all</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> This roller does cover up my dark circles well</li>
            <li> , it should not claim to prevent or treat furter dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it got rid of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I think it just covered it well with the dark tint.  </li>
            <li> and it hid my really dark circles</li>
            <li> I feel like a total sucker for marketing.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d rather have dark circles than look wrinkly and bloodshot.</li>

            <li> Covers dark circles and blends well into lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li> I have had dark  circles, as a result of severe allergies, all my life...</li>
            <li> Take care of the dark marks under my eyes.</li>
            <li> What I do to cover about 89% of my dark circles is I:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is cooling and helps to cover dark circles.</li>
            <li> I would rather rock my dark circles under my eyes than this</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it to cover the dark circles I have under my eyes (hereditary).</li>
            <li> 60% of the dark circles, Which I think is A LOT.</li>
            <li> The area doesn&#x27;t look nearly as dark and bruised as before.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles since I was 18 and now I&#x27;m 36.  </li>
            <li> There is NOT ONE ingredient that permanently fixes dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It reduces the looks of dark spots under the eyes</li>
            <li> is if you have a brown to dark complexion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line- not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> they have nothing to do with the amount of rest we may or may not get, they are an inhereted trait passed down through my mother&#x27;s side of the family).  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t tell that it is on, except that the under eye dark circles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars though because the tint to the product does slightly disguise dark circles.</li>
            <li> I feel like its slightly mislabeled.</li>
            <li> I typically have to go for the lightest shade they offer</li>
            <li> There was a slight change.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month and a half now.  </li>
            <li> gives less coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think it slightly depuffs the area.  </li>
            <li> when I wake up, the dark circles do seem to have gotten a little lighter since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s a little under a week of use and my dark rings have radically lightened up.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, and it is much less expensive than purchasing from the beauty department of any store.</li>
            <li> I have  dry combo skin and very pale skin , I am use this product with a BB cream from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> I dont have bad dark circles, I mainly just have issues with puffiness, especially during allergy season, and this stuff helps.</li>
            <li> The product does the job, and it does it in a far less expensive  way than some of the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> It will conceal your dark circles ( for a few hrs)  </li>
            <li> This product is liquid and when you roll it on it puts little globs of the liquid on your skin.</li>
            <li> I just roll it on and pat it a little bit with my finger and it blends well.</li>
            <li> but then I took it off and my eyes felt a little sore.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 2 months and have not seen any reduction in my dark circles at all!  </li>
            <li> I think it is helpful in concealing them a little, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I used a little bit of my girlfriend&#x27;s when she wasn&#x27;t looking.</li>
            <li> Just a little under the eyes</li>
            <li> It is a concealer with a little pick-me-up.  </li>
            <li> Then I use my liquid make up over it and the dark circles are GONE!</li>
            <li> My dark circles vanished, and are noticeably brighter even without this on now!</li>
            <li> I tried applying the product and letting it dry, but I thought the result was a little thick and pasty, so I started patting it before it dried ad</li>
            <li> Product covers and seems to lighten the eye area to look younger and less tired.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you have very slight crows feet and very slight dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark undereye circles (one of my sisters has them, too...</li>
            <li> I have VERY dark circles and have had them all my life.  </li>
            <li> so if you have a very dark toned skin, I don&#x27;t think this would work for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After rolling on a small amount, use a small, fluffy brush to blend it carefully.  </li>
            <li> THIS is a waste of money - don&#x27;t spend the $12 on it.</li>
            <li> I eliminated all the products for a few days until my eyes cleared up, then I tried them one at a time.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this one.i</li>
            <li> The roller works like similar eye roller products that I have tried but leaves behind pools of concealer.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it does anything to improve dark circles, but that is not why I bought the product</li>
            <li> but  a few age spots &amp; it covers at about 80%.</li>
            <li> The produce does not rub off without some effort, ensuring a lasting effect for the entire day (however, makes it difficult and slow to blend in).</li>
            <li> Recently, I feel like they have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing.</li>
            <li> like I said, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Thin and sheer, doesn&#x27;t cake in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I wait a few moments before&lt;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really dark circles or excessive puffiness.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> people often asked how I got a black eye!</li>
            <li> I just need a few pats here and there to cover at least 60% of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> No more dark bags!</li>
            <li> Can buy at the local drugstore, but is less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought this product b/c I have dark circles under my eyes a lot lately</li>
            <li> I am 41 and started developing dark circles under my eyes in my late 30s.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how this product works, but I have been using it for a few months  now</li>
            <li> Before this, I was using one of those expensive under-eye concealer pens, and I bought Garnier&#x27;s when I was tired of paying that much money.</li>
            <li> This little gem doesn&#x27;t do any of that!</li>
            <li> The rolling ball delivery method is not useful as you still have to blend with a finger or brush and must be wasting huge amounts of product as well, which I hate to do!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear a lot of make up</li>
            <li> Really a waste!</li>
            <li> I use it under the eyes and for covering some small rosacea like blemishes.  </li>
            <li> even tried mixing Bobby Brown&#x27;s concealer with a slick eye cream</li>
            <li> This works out so well, it&#x27;s unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> So, not good for dark under eye circles.. but doubles as a spot treatment concealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 months, and I am not seeing any result.</li>
            <li> There is no perfect product out there, but I keep going back to this one.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!</li>
            <li> then I put on my usual foundation and the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li> Not sure of any long-term under-eye help</li>
            <li> You cannot do that with this one because it oozes out concealer, so it&#x27;s a one-swipe shot!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it on small blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> Bought the product in April, used it occasionally and started noticing an occasional and annoying eye twitch.</li>
            <li> However, lately I&#x27;ve noticed the dark circles under my eyes getting worse.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with brown hair, hazel eyes, with slightly olive-ey skin (people very occasionally think I&#x27;m Italian) and it was dreadful color-wise.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to find in my geographical area.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to apply concealer without severe creasing and dryness.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have if you often look tired or suffer from dark circles!</li>
            <li> I am a FT working mom of 2 kids under the age of 3, am tired all the time and have very dark undereyes.     </li>
            <li> I like this product (and will continue to use at least until it runs out,</li>
            <li> I think some of the negative reviews came from people who were under the impression they could just roll this on with the roller and that is not so.  </li>
            <li> If you are using a face cream/lotion product, wait at least 30 min.</li>
            <li> Ive spent a lot of money trying different products for the circles under my eyes- which I just hate because I feel it ages me.</li>
            <li> It is cold and definitely helps to wake you up in the morning.</li>
            <li> but it comes out thin, flimsy, and uneven.</li>
            <li> Other concealers are either too thick (which inevitably gather in the creases under my eyes), are too thin (which provides no coverage) or are the wrong color which makes me look weird.  </li>
            <li> Blends and covers immediately with a very small amount of product, and stays in place all day.  </li>
            <li> its not bad, but not a miracle or even a game changer!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product at least didn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes, which is a big plus (I&#x27;m used to having bad reactions to anything</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to look 50 years old, it doesn&#x27;t mean I hate my age.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this for a few days, it does seem that maybe the dark circles are not so bad even when I don&#x27;t have makeup on.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why the other bad reviews?  </li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s very hard to match</li>
            <li> I have horrible genetic dark circles and deep set eyes, so this does work.</li>
            <li> Also, my pores are undergoing a bit at the moment so they have enlarged a little; I use this on my cheeks to cover the pores and since the head is cold, it closes them up while it conceals.</li>
            <li> item is just as described and works well to offer some concealment for tired eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite thin and takes no time at all.  </li>
            <li> I figured because everything said it was a thin concealer</li>
            <li> Also, the makeup is watered-down thin.  </li>
            <li> It is thin and \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Way to thin (waterie)</li>
            <li> Not great,</li>
            <li> It is very noticeable and very annoying.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from my friend that is a makeup artist and this is her secret weapon for photo shoots.</li>
            <li> so no amount of sleep will ever make them disappear, &amp; they get worse with stress and lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> I was fairly skeptical about this product because of a lot of the negative reviews</li>
            <li> This is merely a thin concealer and it seems to crease if used in excess and because its tinted</li>
            <li> I believe that is false and tricks people into buying</li>
            <li> And if you are one of the people who expects any product to be a miracle, well, you will be disappointed with this and EVERY other product out there.  </li>
            <li> I was so skeptical when I saw how thin this product is...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this before I bought it, but let me say I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> And, since then I have tried the Really expensive ones (Chanel, Sisleya, etc) with no results.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical of the coverage</li>
            <li> Roller ball kinda useless.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a mediocre product considering</li>
            <li> I have been buying and trying expensive and inexpensive under eye circle products for years.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are very bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had some dark circles, but they had gotten really awful.</li>
            <li> Now i am blessed with waking up every morning with dark circles under my eyes- its horrible.</li>
            <li> I used to have terrible dark marks under my eyes from staying up and raging my face off every night!</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did nothing for them!</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m generally a very skeptical person when it comes to beauty products.  </li>
            <li> You have to rub it in with your fingers and it is very difficult to rub in.  </li>
            <li> I think this would correct some of the bad experiences that some reviewers have had.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this product for me because I have really bad under eye circles and her friends told her it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> and they burnt really bad.</li>
            <li> circles run in my family and I get bad sleep</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad, it just doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad either.</li>
            <li> ---i was looking for an oil for re-hydrating cells---my bad for not understanding--</li>
            <li> Maybe nothing will... :(</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for coverage,  I think you would be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is stupid.</li>
            <li> (and I normally hate \\&quot;concealers\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> Worthless, don&#x27;t even bother buying this.</li>
            <li> , I hate wearing foundation</li>
            <li> and i hate when they are chalk-like or leave traces of the makeup under your eye-</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is awful!</li>
            <li> I hate concealer hell!!!</li>
            <li> looks horrible on me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any other cover up I have ever had to use.  I will be ordering more. It&#x27;s a great size so you can put it in your purse for a little touch up while you are out on a date or with friends.</li>
            <li> item is just as described and works well to offer some concealment for tired eyes.</li>
            <li> I think a regular concealer would have been better. This product at least didn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes, which is a big plus (I&#x27;m used to having bad reactions to anything lotion-y around the eyes), but it doesn&#x27;t lighten up much of anything. Perhaps it works better on a more medium-toned complexion; I&#x27;m very fair and it was a yellowish color that I had to mineral-powder over, once I smoothed it on and it \\&quot;set\\&quot;. No results, really, I can point to save for a slight \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; effect. Nothing cumulative resulted from using the whole roller to the end of its useful life. I&#x27;m in my early 50s and darkish tone under the eyes seems to have set in. I need something that works; this really doesn&#x27;t. Apparently it does work for some people, though, so it may be a genetic thing. Try it and see what happens for you.</li>
            <li> I used to have terrible dark marks under my eyes from staying up and raging my face off every night! This absolutely hides those dark marks and the professors assume you are well rested and eager to learn, unlike everyone else. This pretty much guarantees an A+ in any class.</li>
            <li> Works just ok. Really doesn&#x27;t cover the circles</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly for dark circles under your eyes. It even helps with puffiness. I was amazed when my eyes started to look brighter within just a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> This product just covers the dark circles, not something to see improve your dark circles over the time. but for covering dark circles it is okay not perfect though but for the price it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> I bought this magic little wand because law school was causing me to look like a basset hound. I&#x27;ve always had some dark circles, but they had gotten really awful. I bought the kind without tint in it, and I saw a huge improvement in 2 weeks. I gave the same product to my mom, and she also saw a huge improvement, so it will work on all ages. I can skip using it for a week or two and still look good, but once I get stressed/lose sleep I have to start using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I saw that it worked, I compared the ingredient list to the off-brand (Equate) and started buying it instead. It works just as well and is quite a bit cheaper. I don&#x27;t think it comes with tint, though, so if you need that to help cover, maybe keep buying Garnier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For general reference, I have fair, combination skin that&#x27;s pretty even toned, though the skin on my eyes is a little darker. After letting this corrector dry, I put on Aveeno lotion with SPF 15 or BB cream with SPF 30. I have no idea if that helps but I&#x27;d think good sun protection would make it easier for the product to work quickly, since it doesn&#x27;t have to fight new damage as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! LOVE!!&lt;br /&gt;Who created it, saves my life every morning lol</li>
            <li> The make-up is really liquidy, therefore it has to set under the eye before being blended. And, when it does become set, its coverage is not as good as a regular concealer by a long shot. I&#x27;ve been using the roller for almost a month now, obviously not because I love the coverage, but because I was interested to see if there were more long-term results, and there have been none whatsoever. Overall: complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like this product (and will continue to use at least until it runs out, haven&#x27;t decided yet if I will buy again) because I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time choosing makeup. I don&#x27;t usually use a concealer because I don&#x27;t like standing around the store trying to pick the right shade, and I don&#x27;t use foundation on my face. Rather than trying to choose the perfect shade, since this is \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; it blends with your skin. I&#x27;m sure there are other products that do this, but as I said, I don&#x27;t usually wear concealer so I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of different brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply it, I use a Q-tip to blend the edges and smooth out any areas where I might have put it on too thick. This still takes less time than some other products I&#x27;ve tried. (Keep in mind that you can&#x27;t tell exactly how it will look until it&#x27;s dry.) The rollerball applies smoothly most of the time, but occasionally I will have to roll it across a tissue if it&#x27;s not coming out enough. I also like that the rollerball makes it easy for me to apply the product all the way up to my eyelashes without getting it in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because it claims to soothe and treat the dark circles, and I&#x27;ve seen no evidence at all that it does this. I wish they would&#x27;ve marketed it as a concealer only because it&#x27;s misleading to say that it treats when it doesn&#x27;t. Occasionally, it does seem to get stuck in creases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see so many negative reviews.  I love this product!  I don&#x27;t usually wear a lot of make up so I love that this product looks so natural. I can apply it alone with no other make up or mascara.  I normally use cover girl stick concealer.  I would apply the concealer, rub it in and then my eyelashes would be covered with concealer so I&#x27;d have to apply mascara.  I think some of the negative reviews came from people who were under the impression they could just roll this on with the roller and that is not so.  Actually I think Garnier could of skipped the roller and just put this in a tube that can be applied with your fingers. This product is liquid and when you roll it on it puts little globs of the liquid on your skin. I make one run around my eyes with the roller, then pat or rub until it is blended with my skin. My eyes look brighter and healthier when I&#x27;ve used this product, unlike other concealers.    This product looks natural, is easy to apply (you have to blend with your fingers) and it last all day.</li>
            <li> Its just a concealer. I feel like its slightly mislabeled. Honestly, you can get makeup like this any where.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I&#x27;m a GUY. I don&#x27;t wear makeup. However, lately I&#x27;ve noticed the dark circles under my eyes getting worse. I&#x27;m a busy person so I haven&#x27;t been getting enough sleep. A few friends asked me if I was feeling okay and that I looked tired and that my eyes had circles under them. I found this to be the better rated of under eye cover. I was skeptical of this before I bought it, but let me say I was proven wrong. Oh, and I&#x27;m not affiliated with the company btw. I just haven&#x27;t written a lot of reviews here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months now (I&#x27;m still on the first tube), and while it does do a fairly good job concealing my dark circles, it certainly has not lightened them over time.  I have found other concealers that work as well as this for much much less money, but I do like the roller ball applicator, so I felt that overall this product deserved 3 stars.  I won&#x27;t, however, spend the money to buy a second one of these since I can get the same results with products that costs half as much (even though I&#x27;ll miss the applicator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have very dark undereye circles (one of my sisters has them, too...they have nothing to do with the amount of rest we may or may not get, they are an inhereted trait passed down through my mother&#x27;s side of the family).  Literally, I look like a racoon when I have no makeup on.  I&#x27;m in my mid-40s, and have been experimenting with undereye concealers for about 30 years.  Over that time I&#x27;ve come to terms with the fact that there is no \\&quot;solution\\&quot; to my problem, but some products do work better than others.  Most people would probably be more than happy with the way this product conceals dark circles, as long as there is no expectation that it will actually make the dark circles go away over time, and as long as you&#x27;re comfortable with shelling out a nice chunk of change for it.</li>
            <li> wow!!!! This is an amzaing product!! I totally Recommend it, i bought for my husband 1 week ago, and it totally works, I saw improvement since the 3rd use...and he sees that as well..he had super dark circles under his eyes..and he likes it a lot..you cant notice that he had something covering, it looks very natural! I am very Glad that we found something! :)</li>
            <li> This product is honestly my ultimate favorite beauty product I&#x27;ve ever owned. It gives that full coverage look, it highlights, primes, conceals. It&#x27;s nice and cool, the color blends perfectly with my skin it lasts me throughout school, I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Covers decently. But hasn&#x27;t reduced the dark circles at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 (and have wrinkles under my eyes).  I have had dark circles under my eyes since I was a teenager.  They also run in my family, so there is not much hope of escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this Garnier product very much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used the Cover Girl cream product (comes in a tube, like lipstick).  Bcs it&#x27;s so \\&quot;firm,\\&quot; I have always applied a light cream under my eyes so the product would \\&quot;flow.\\&quot;  As all the womens&#x27; magazine beauty gurus say, pulling on the \\&quot;delicate skin\\&quot; below the eyes is not something that&#x27;s very good to do, especially on an on-going basis.  Nonetheless, that was the only product on the market (that I could find).  Until this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t cover completely (but what does?  not the Cover Girl tube; not even theatrical makeup!  The only thing to cover completely is PhotoShop!), but this product has made a definite difference.  With all my wrinkles, I haven&#x27;t noticed caking.  Maybe the others are putting it on over foundation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you do have to spread it out.  So what?  It&#x27;s quite thin and takes no time at all.  As opposed to the Cover Girl stuff I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the \\&quot;anti-puffy\\&quot; claim is ridiculous (also Olay&#x27;s roller-ball product, which was a complete bust &amp; didn&#x27;t deliver on any of its claims!).  I bought this Garnier product for coverage.  It&#x27;s great for that.  I will continue buying this product and hope it doesn&#x27;t go out of production!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer a \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; makeup, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s mineral line has a \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; powder  that is also very good. If you are using a face cream/lotion product, wait at least 30 min. before applying this product, or you&#x27;ll have the product in all your wrinkles and creases.  (I find the L&#x27;Oreal mineral line is excellent for rosacea coverage, and I use that when I have a flare-up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I think this is a good product and worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;mb</li>
            <li> Great for under eye, and daytime wear. If you are looking for a heavier concealer this one doesn&#x27;t quite do the trick.</li>
            <li> This product works for me. I roll it on, making sure that the product comes in contact with the roller. I think this would correct some of the bad experiences that some reviewers have had. It&#x27;s just like using a ball point pen. Gravity will dictate whether you are applying product or nothing. I didn&#x27;t think anything was coming out of the roller at first. Also, I don&#x27;t rub it in, I pat it on. I tried applying the product and letting it dry, but I thought the result was a little thick and pasty, so I started patting it before it dried ad I liked the results much better. I think it does a fine job of covering dark circles and I think it helps with puffiness. I am 52 years old and have great skin for a woman my age. I exfoliate regularly and use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be awesome when I saw the commercial for it, but when I got it in the mail it left much to be desired. I love the idea of a roller application but it comes out thin, flimsy, and uneven. I ended up ditching it for my $0.99 stick that you can buy anywhere simply because it got so frustrating having to reapply six or seven times to get the same result.</li>
            <li> I use this as a concealer.  Really wakes up my eyes!  Depuffs and lightens</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone is tearing this little roller to shreds, I love this thing. It&#x27;s small, fits easily in my purse, easy to blend and works great. Not going to say it&#x27;s perfect, but it works. The key to using the roller (or any concealer for that matter) is blending and only use a small amount or else you&#x27;ll just have a white cakey mess under your eyes and it will actually accentuate your dark circles and fine lines.  Also realize, this is just a CONCEALER, not a miracle worker, it will only CONCEAL dark circles, not make them go away..&lt;br /&gt;I love the cool feeling of the metal ball and caffeine too under my eyes and on my skin too, it&#x27;s nice and refreshing and does a nice job of COVERING UP my dark circles in the morning and throughout the day. My one major complaint is that it stings my eyes a little as I have sensitive eyes, if it weren&#x27;t for that fact I would give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This item was leaking right out the box. I still tried it, however, I had to use my fingers the entire time. This was a waste of money, I was really upset.</li>
            <li> I will preface this with I don&#x27;t think this is a treatment.  However, it is the best under eye concealer I&#x27;ve used, and I have used many expensive brands, including Bobbi Brown, Trish McEvoy, Lancome, Clinique, MAC, etc.  None of these brands worked as well for me as this $10 Garnier roller.  This roller applies a light weight brightener to the under eye that doesn&#x27;t crease and covers the veins I have under my eyes beautifully.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it does an excellent job of covering these veins without making my under eye crepey or emphasizing the fine lines.  Even after using this product, I have purchased others just hoping that they might cover better, but I always return to this stand-by.  I really hope this product is never discontinued, because I would hate to have to go back on a search for a product that both covers and doesn&#x27;t emphasize the fine lines.  Honestly, this is probably a 4 star product, since it&#x27;s not perfect.  However, the price is so inexpensive that I really think that increases the value of this product to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This thing does nothing that regular concealer can&#x27;t do! THIS is a waste of money - don&#x27;t spend the $12 on it. I am a FT working mom of 2 kids under the age of 3, am tired all the time and have very dark undereyes.     I REALLY thought and hoped this was something special. I fell into the trap. It&#x27;s just plain concealer/liquid makeup in a different package, ladies. Sure it rolls on but so what - even so you still have to blend it in to your skin.     I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ball leaks everywhere</li>
            <li> This concealer/treatment was recommended in a fashion magazine so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. At the same time I changed my foundation and my eyeliner, so it took me awhile to figure out what was causing my eyes to turn red. I eliminated all the products for a few days until my eyes cleared up, then I tried them one at a time. This stuff was the culpert. I&#x27;m not usually sensitive to things, don&#x27;t have allergies or anything, I&#x27;m tough LOL! And I tried it more than a few times. I really wanted to like it. But I finally got fed up and threw it away. I went back to my Neutrogena concealer and have had no further problems.</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday and I love it!!  I&#x27;m 65 and have tried everything but nothing has much helped my dark circles without making wrinkles look worse.  I had really given up on finding anything that works.  But, this goes on really easy and blends without much effort.  I feel like it really does diminish the dark circles and  my eyes look so much better. I can wear makeup under my eyes and my whole face looks more finished because of it.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This roller does cover up my dark circles well and it&#x27;s the best match I&#x27;ve found that blends well with my skin tone, but it wears off quickly. I don&#x27;t know that the caffeine is really decreasing blood vessel appearance as much as the makeup aspect is covering up the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark bags for years due to allergies. I don&#x27;t like to wear make-up, especially foundation. This is a lightweight, easily applied product that stays where I put it. It covers well, and stays several hours. After seeing it on a TV ad, I looked for it in stores and couldn&#x27;t find it. I&#x27;ll be ordering again! As often as I&#x27;ve used it, the dispenser has lasted a reasonably long time: it doesn&#x27;t seem to be near empty yet. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought this product b/c I have dark circles under my eyes a lot lately and when I use regular foundation in that area, it just gets dried and cakey and makes my wrinkles more obvious.&lt;br /&gt;I DO like this product in the sense it DOES cover some darkness. It is lightly tinted and after i roll it under my eyes, I dab it in with my finger until blended and I immediatly notice a difference.  It basically is a tinted moisturizer. It gives me enough color so that I don&#x27;t have to apply any other make up in that area which makes me look and feel a little younger. HOWEVER, it does in no way shape or form treat or prevent further dark circles. Can anything really??&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind paying the price b/c it is similiar to my high end tinted moisturizer I was buying at Sephora for double the amount of money and since I just use it around my eyes, it lasts a long time.  You would prob get the same results with a cheap tinted moisturizer I would think. I would NEVER pay more than retail for this.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am happy with it I would have given it 4-5 stars however, it should not claim to prevent or treat furter dark circles. I believe that is false and tricks people into buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also add I have pretty light skin, when I buy foundation I typically have to go for the lightest shade they offer (Ivory)...if you are darker then this, it prob won&#x27;t cover as well for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every concealing cream/stick product on the market for less than $25, and until now, I had not found one that really worked for the dark circles I&#x27;ve had since I was a teenager, (and that&#x27;s been QUITE a while).  The amazing thing about this is that it also has a moisturizer which has definitely helped my under-eye area overall.  It covers, but it also corrects the problem, and quite quickly for me, too.  I have extremely fair skin and have to be very careful to avoid the caked-on look with concealing products, but I have never had a moments worry with this product.  The application is too easy, and it blends like a fine, light cream should.  It is now my must-have beauty product.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this stuff. I have a very strong family history of under eye circles. This is the only product that has ever worked for me, and I have tried many many of them , some waaaay too expensive. I am not sure how this product works, but I have been using it for a few months  now and I am amazed by the feedback I am getting from those around me. I have  dry combo skin and very pale skin , I am use this product with a BB cream from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many products for dark circles -- this is the best - it&#x27;s light, it doesn&#x27;t cake on - isn&#x27;t noticeable.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.....great stuff!!</li>
            <li> works great but its makeup</li>
            <li> I have used this for weeks night and day and see no improvement withdark circles or puffiness. Very disappointed. Dont waste your money on this one.i</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with brown hair, hazel eyes, with slightly olive-ey skin (people very occasionally think I&#x27;m Italian) and it was dreadful color-wise.  I figured because everything said it was a thin concealer it would not matter much about the shade, but it made my under eye circles look an unnatural shade of grey rather than covering and actually highlighted fine lines and wrinkles I didn&#x27;t know I had! Love the packaging and the hype, not so much for the actual product.  Move along if you&#x27;re even slightly more yellow than pink in tone.</li>
            <li> Another gimmick.  The roller part is cool, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the appearance of my dark circles.  Also, the makeup is watered-down thin.  I would not reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> es un producto bueno, lo unico es que hay que usarlo en la noche por que es muy dif&amp;iacute;cil disimularlo en el d&amp;iacute;a.</li>
            <li> I really like the glide on tube, makes application easy.  I have very bad dark circles under my eyes and have to add several swipes for good coverage.</li>
            <li> Use with Garnier anti-puff eye roller then apply this and use a sponge to blend. I still use a MAC concealer on top of this but I like it. I keep it and the anti-puff roller in the fridge.</li>
            <li> I have to say I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should try this or not because there were so many negative comments.  But I have to say that I like it.  It is not perfect and doesn&#x27;t completely hide my dark circles, but it&#x27;s better than what I have used in the past.  I have VERY dark circles and have had them all my life.  I like the way this rolls on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t require that I rub it in.  I put it on under my make up.  I just roll it on and pat it a little bit with my finger and it blends well. Sometimes I let it dry and put it on again to help cover the dark circles a little more.  The price is reasonable and I think it does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m (very) fair skinned, and the tint of this product is too dark for me.  It did cover the dark circles under my eyes, but it left a tan, orangey color.  I don&#x27;t think it got rid of my dark circles.  I think it just covered it well with the dark tint.  I used my old, lighter-colored concealer on top, but then the skin under my eyes looked like it had thick, caked-on make up over it.  I think I would look better in pictures with this combo, but in person, it doesn&#x27;t look good, especially since I don&#x27;t like to wear my foundation super thick.  I really wish they would come out with new colors, both lighter and darker than what is available now.  If they did, I would try this product again.  If you have very fair skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying at this point.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this product for me because I have really bad under eye circles and her friends told her it worked like a charm. So i decided to try it on. At first it worked really well I saw the difference and it hid my really dark circles but then I took it off and my eyes felt a little sore. Then I went to sleep and in the morning I woke up with my eyes extremely swollen and red and they burnt really bad. It has lasted over two days now an I&#x27;m starting to worry bc they don&#x27;t want to go back to normal and hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> There was a slight change. My under eye circles aren&#x27;t sever,either. A concealer works way better. If you are looking for a product that will give you long term dark circle improvement, then this is not the product for you. The results do not last so you may as well wear concealer. If you are the kind of person who does not like to wear makeup then go ahead and purchase it. It would work well with a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Granted, this may not make a \\&quot;permanent,corrective\\&quot; difference, but as a concealer it is wonderful!  It is the consistency that makes a difference.  It is thin and \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; so it does not cake or look \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;.  It is very \\&quot;slick/slippery\\&quot; so moving it around the coverage area is easy, no pulling or tugging or sticking.  The color is light (but still covers amazingly well) which works very well for me but may be too light for darker skinned gals. Best is the fact it does not \\&quot;cake\\&quot; or dry.  It just seems to disappear and cover.  I LOVE it (and I normally hate \\&quot;concealers\\&quot;) Added bonus is the roller feels almost cold and is very refreshing around the eye.    I suppose now that I&#x27;ve found my \\&quot;dream concealer\\&quot; they&#x27;ll discontinue it!  Hah!</li>
            <li> I use this daily now &amp; can tell a difference on my under eye circles. The cooling sensation is nice &amp; it blends really easily.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;sheer tint\\&quot; description had me a little worried that the coverage wouldn&#x27;t be enough, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few beauty products I like from Garnier &amp; I really like to stress on the word \\&quot;few\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Better than more expensive brand</li>
            <li> This is good cream for older skin.  It has 10 oils in it, and my face actually looked better the next morning.  This is a very good facial and neck cream to use.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Disappointing. I feel like a total sucker for marketing. I suppose it hides dark circles, and yes it&#x27;s fun to roll on, but like the other reviewer said, you still have to use your fingers to blend it in. When it dries it accentuates fine lines and wrinkles, making you look old and tired anyway. Plus, this product irritates my sensitive eyes.  I think I&#x27;d rather have dark circles than look wrinkly and bloodshot.</li>
            <li> Way to thin (waterie)</li>
            <li> It blends well into the skin and keeps your under eye circles concealed.</li>
            <li> This works great! It&#x27;s easy to apply, and stays on all day. Blends in well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month.  I like it.  It works great.  It covers my dark circles.  I rolls on nicely (the metal roller feels cool on my skin, which I like).  Caffeine helps diminish dark circles according to studies. I know there are several products that cost twice as much with only the caffeine benefit and not the cover up benefit, this seems to have both for a better price.  I use this daily and will DEFINETLY buy it again!  I am a happy customer. I am not sure why the other bad reviews?  Obviously NOTHING you can buy is a \\&quot;facelift in a bottle\\&quot;... (although Emu oil really helps with wrinkles....) are people hoping for miracles? Garnier Anti-Dark circle eye roller does exactly what it is advertised to do.  I&#x27;m a sasisfied customer.</li>
            <li> it works really well, its feels light, it rolls really good around the eyes, makes the eyes look brighter.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product that does what it advertises. It is easy to apply, feels cool and helps in minimizing wrinkles and circles.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this stuff, it is her preferred roller and color</li>
            <li> Come on folks, obviously this product does not replace plastic surgery.  It even states on the outside of the box:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x27;Roll away dark under circles + instant gentle blendable coverage in a easy-to-apply roller applicator.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;THIS STATEMENT IS 100% TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;\\&quot;OVER TIME, LACK OF SLEEP &amp; DAILY FATIGUE MAKES EYES LOOK TIRED\\&quot;-TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;\\&quot;INSTANTLY CORRECT THE APPEARENCE OF DARK CIRCLES &amp; BRIGHTEN THE SKIN AROUND YOUR EYES.\\&quot;&#x3D;THIS STATEMENT IS 100% TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I COULD GO ON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, this does not replace facial surgery, but tell me ONE topical ointment that does!  It can only REDUCE the image of dark circles.  Point being, Garnier states nothing that would come even CLOSE to stating more than that.&lt;br /&gt;  [[ASIN:B003RF82RI Garnier Anti-Dark-Circle Eye Roller]]</li>
            <li> It is always ok to read up on a product before making a purchase. I am a black woman so this product did nothing for me at all.... Yes, I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. And yes, I actually laughed at myself...</li>
            <li> I was excited about the idea of a product that offered both a lotion and concealer in one but instead I found a product that makes a huge mess. The roller works like similar eye roller products that I have tried but leaves behind pools of concealer. I have to add additional lotion in order to blend the concealer under my eye.</li>
            <li> As a fair/medium 30yr old, I LOVE it for my dark purple circles when I&#x27;m not wearing any other makeup. It has a nice cooling feel with the roller ball &amp; it&#x27;s moisturizing while being super easy to blend. I&#x27;ve bought this several times now &amp; I love it for casual days when the sheer concealer is enough to make me look less raccoon and more natural beauty. I run thru it about every 2 months, but I do use it several times/day when the light concealer wears off--don&#x27;t mind though. It is definitely too sheer for work and/or when I wear a full face of makeup, but its great for fooling my husband in the morning--haha ;)</li>
            <li> I am 16 years old and have very dark circles under my eyes. I even have a few crows feet when I smile very big. I bought this product thinking it would help with puffiness and especially the dark circles. It did NOTHING. I didn&#x27;t see ANY improvement. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a one was because it is a OKAY concealer. Not great, but okay. It really DID not help to dimish my dark circles, it only concealed them. This product really did not work for me, and if you have dark circles, I don&#x27;t think it will work for you either.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about trying this product but love it.  Goes on smooth and easy to apply</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m generally a very skeptical person when it comes to beauty products.  You can pretty much never believe the transformations cosmetics companies promise because they all Photoshop every image on their product.  That being said, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.  Sure, it&#x27;s not going to totally eliminate every dark shadow under your eye and make you look like the models on their commercials, but it does a nice job overall.  This product is mostly just concealer in a different package, but the concealer was thinner than most others I&#x27;ve tried and distributed itself nicely instead of getting sticky and clumpy.  I have pretty light skin and it blended well with my skin  color.  I&#x27;m not sure if caffeine and roller ball works the magic they claim, but my dark circles seem more hidden with this than other products I&#x27;ve tried, so I really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Got this for my teen daughter. I like that she could wear this around the eyes and blends with her natural skin. No other makeup needed just around the eye darkness eliminator.</li>
            <li> Good product for high lighting need a lil bit more to conceal however</li>
            <li> Looking to cover-up pregnancy-induced dark circles, and this product is the best I&#x27;ve found (in my price range, at least). Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been through all the expensive concealers and this one is by far the best. It rolls on lightly and has great coverage and feel absolutely weightless on my face. I have been using this for over a year now and won&#x27;t go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of days, but I think it is great. If you are in a hurry and did not put any make-up on the Garnier Skin Renew blends right into your skin and you can&#x27;t tell that it is on, except that the under eye dark circles are less noticeable. You do have to blend it in with your finger, but that takes about a second. Thank you Garnier.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after using the non-concealer roller for several years now.  It offers the same cooling/moisturizing effect, but with a sheer tint.  I like this because it is not thick and does not get caked into the lines around your eyes. And YES, you do have to blend it in with your finger, just like every other undereye concealer.  If you want a miracle product that will instantly make your dark circles go away you might want to talk to a dermatologist, but this does exactly what it says it will on the box - it conceals dark circles.  If you find that it isn&#x27;t quite dark enough they make it in a medium/dark tone also.  This is perfect for people who do not like to cover their face in makeup in order to cover every little imperfection.  It makes me look like I got a full night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> I love that this reduces and helps camouflage dark circles!  I use this during the day and I do not need additional under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised but was considerably more liquid than I expected.  After rolling on a small amount, use a small, fluffy brush to blend it carefully.  It does seem to last all day without creasing or drying out and the coverage is good without looking heavy.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This roller feels very nice when applying and the concealing power is excellent.  It blends well, covers dark circles well, and stays put all day.  The roller application reduces puffiness quickly, too, so eyes look younger and I look more rested.    The only reason I took off one star is that I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually doing anything to reduce my dark under eye circles - I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in that aspect.  Also, sometimes I have to shake it when product stops coming out of the roller at times.  Still, for me the benefits are well worth it and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it much, but it works. color matches very easily and simple to apply. should last years if used occasionally</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical when I saw how thin this product is... but it really works. I have bad dark circles and most concealers cake, crease, or just don&#x27;t cover. This one is dark near perfect. I love the applicator, and how easy it is to blend. You just basically smear it around until it is blended in. That&#x27;s it! It covers dark circles really well and I have had no issues with it settling into fine lines or causing dryness. 0.5 ounces will last FOREVER, too! I am not sure if it does anything to improve dark circles, but that is not why I bought the product and I&#x27;ve pretty much accepted that I am stuck with my circles!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I have light olive skin undertones and just turned 30. My dark circles are very bad. If anything, this product made my eyes swollen (I have bad allergies) and made my dark circles more noticeable. I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer.  Blends and covers immediately with a very small amount of product, and stays in place all day.  Decreases the puffiness and dark circles all day.  Really does work to help me from looking exhausted when I&#x27;ve had too little sleep.  Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I just glide the stick under my eye and dab it on quickly. It covers up quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned since using this that the dark circles under my eyes are too strong to fade from the application of a liquid concealer. My friend who is a makeup artist has told me that the only way to really fix it is to use color correction something or other to balance out the colors.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of concealers (stila,bare minerals, benefit, Clinique, lorac) all settle in the creases and make my 27 yr old face look older. This little gem doesn&#x27;t do any of that! It goes on nicely, feels weightless, and looks very natural. Also I tend to get excema around my eyes when my eye area gets irritated from makeup. Not with this product, no irritation and keeps the skin soft and excema free. Stop reading this and go buy it!</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the roll on feature.  Although, it is easy to use, it has proved to be no more than a dry white concealer.  It is too white and too dry. You have to rub it in with your fingers and it is very difficult to rub in.  You almost will rub a wrinkle under your eye trying to rub the product in. Also, it appears to be only a cover up. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is awful! I won&#x27;t even go into detail about the fact that it doesn&#x27;t cover up dark circles, I will just simply say that it causes twitching underneath the eye! It is very noticeable and very annoying. I have stopped using the product. I called Garnier&#x27;s customer service to receive a refund. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, especially people with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 2 months and have not seen any reduction in my dark circles at all!  I think it is helpful in concealing them a little, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> It works great. It can cover my panda eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use it everyday even if I&#x27;m not wearing any other makeup because it feels good. This goes on with a roller (that&#x27;s not necessary, you still have to rub it in. In fact, there&#x27;s a little piece of plastic that sticks up next the roller ball that scratches my skin so I have to be careful when I do roll it). It disappears into your skin fast and doesn&#x27;t lay in the wrinkles of my old eyes. It&#x27;s light and looks natural. Sometimes I put makeup on over it (I use Bare Minerals) and it doesn&#x27;t glob up. I love it so much, I have purchased some for others to try.</li>
            <li> my skin is ivory white and this product looks yellow on me...</li>
            <li> Love it, it takes a few second to roll and go! It last all day! Some days I use it alone, other days under powder. It makes me look well-rested</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this. Sheer and light texture with good coverage.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my dark circles</li>
            <li> I love this cover up stick.  Gently rolls on and blends great.  I will definitely continue buying this and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> This product will not remove your dark circles, I use it as a concealer not an &amp;#34;eye treatment&amp;#34; it only comes with two colors, and the medium/deep is not even medium. I  would recommend this as a very light concealer to use if you want to go to the gym,food shopping.. ect.It will conceal your dark circles ( for a few hrs)  but like I said, it will not remove them</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month and a half now.  It does a great job concealing the dark circles I&#x27;ve had under my eyes since I was a teen.  I have also noticed that first thing in the morning when I wake up, the dark circles do seem to have gotten a little lighter since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for a basic concealer and someone recommended it.  I love it.  Best under eye concealer that I have ever used.  It is light weight, goes on amazingly smooth and diminishes dark circles without the heaviness of the others.  Truly the best.</li>
            <li> ...and that&#x27;s pretty much all this is. I can&#x27;t tell any difference apart from the cooling effect when it goes on. Perhaps others may have a better experience, but I can&#x27;t help but think the reviews are slightly skewed. It&#x27;s really just a cover-up, not a treatment. An ice-pak would have more lasting effect.</li>
            <li> I could not attest to the \\&quot;skin benefits\\&quot; as I have not seen much of an improvement in my skin itself, however for the lovely dark purple bags under my eyes that I am genetically predisposed to it works great.  Rolls on super easy and quick. I have zero time in the morning to try and not look like the \\&quot;Walking Dead\\&quot; and I love this product!</li>
            <li> not something I can use. L&#x27;Oreal concealer bought at Walmart does a better job for me. For those of us with circles, maybe we should realize that the way we look isn&#x27;t the most important thing after all. . .and, store bought concealers do a pretty fair job.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would cure my dark circles, only to use it and feel like it was a concealor, thus feeling ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do love how sheer it goes on and now use it for going to the gym, just for some slight cover. It really looks sooo natural!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy again? Eh. We&#x27;ll see. I know I&#x27;ll def use the rest though.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t buy this here but was given this product in a gift bag. it does what it&#x27;s supposed to...covers dark circles &amp; minor imperfections. i don&#x27;t have circles but  a few age spots &amp; it covers at about 80%. i did find if i use right after my morning skin care regimine....it actually works better &amp; lasts until I remove it. i wash, then use a facial exfoliating brush then a small amount of sunscreen/moisturizer (i like aveeno)..then apply this but not the roller so much as the product. i roll it on &amp; smooth out with a small make up brush i use just for eyes. i&#x27;ve had good results with this for small areas but i like BB creme better as it does the same thing but is more of an all over treatment. it&#x27;s also a bit heavier so coverage is better as well. the reason i don&#x27;t exclusively use BB is because i don&#x27;t always want that full coverage as i really prefer the feel of freshly cleaned, untreated skin. it&#x27;s just a preference. Garnier is one of my favorite all -around products, well priced &amp; good results over all.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I hate concealer hell!!! Either their too oily, I don&#x27;t like to consistency, or they don&#x27;t give me the wanted results!!! This concealer gives me the results I want with a great consistency!!! Thanks to lovely lor on you tube for recommending this!!!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is of a fair olive tone complexion and not many cosmetics have a tone to match my complexion. I find it&#x27;s very hard to match and everything ends up way too pink for me. So when I saw this was &#x27;tinted&#x27; I was worried that Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Dark Circle Eye Roller would be the same. I was surprised and a little excited that it blended in so well. Now it&#x27;s a little under a week of use and my dark rings have radically lightened up. I&#x27;m so happy with this product and I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to just concealer!</li>
            <li> worth the money! comes out as a roller and the coloration is amazing for the under eye area. it is very sheer and can be reapplied through out the day if you wish. looks amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were several problems with this item. It is a very sheer product. If it&#x27;s intended to cover under eye circles, it needs to be thicker. I have blue/purple under eye circles and this did not conceal them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very yellow. I realize that some manufacturers try to use yellow to cancel out blue but this is a bit much. I had a lot of trouble blending in this color on my very fair red/blue undertone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does settle into lines. As a matter of fact, it settled into some lines I never knew existed and left my under eye skin looking very crepe-y whenever I smiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, while the roller ball feels nice and cool, it makes for sloppy application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Have had dark circles under and above my eyes all my life, this product delivers what is promises! It diminishes their appearance substantially and naturally!</li>
            <li> Great product.Does what it promises.</li>
            <li> I use this underneath a bb cream, and it give a great look. Also, my pores are undergoing a bit at the moment so they have enlarged a little; I use this on my cheeks to cover the pores and since the head is cold, it closes them up while it conceals. I look like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup when I wear this under my bb cream. Mind you I have horrible genetic dark circles and deep set eyes, so this does work.</li>
            <li> Love this. Unlike the Maybelline New York Fit Me! Concealer, 25 Medium,... this one works so perfectly. My dark circles are like a purple/blue color so this does the job in covering them up and its doesnt add to under eye wrinkles that I get when the concealer gets caught in the eye lines... I used to use clinique 32 breeze...but that shade was a bit too light for me, this one is a better shade</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 4 years. It&#x27;s great because it highlights instantly. I find that you do have to be careful because you can apply to much. The only complain is that after a while it seems to crease under the eyes.  But I do love it to touch up under eyes anytime anyplace. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is super easy to apply and blends very nicely.  I like that the color goes with a variety of skin tones.</li>
            <li> Under eye concealer is mandatory for me before I will leave my house because I have genetic dark circles that never go away.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that conceals my bags with only one or two layers that is not greasy and heavy.  I even use it to cover other minor flaws on my face.  I do have to pat it in with my finger to blend, but that is necessary for all concealers.  Great buy if you&#x27;re looking for a great under eye concealer/brightener.</li>
            <li> This goes on very nice, sure I&#x27;m gonna get more when I run out. I think it looks natural, hope it does.</li>
            <li> I naturally have dark circles under my eyes, and this product is fantastic. It blends nicely into my foundation, and makes an incredible difference under my eyes.  I got one for my mom too, and she loves it also!</li>
            <li> This works great as a concealer, not so much as a fix to my dark circle problem. I&#x27;m a pale white guy. I rub this stuff in to conceal the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fix the dark circle problem, I bought Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cream. It has reduced my dark circles a little and feels good too.</li>
            <li> The ball reduces inflammation as it is cool to the touch. The color covers my undereye area well and blends well. I like it so far!</li>
            <li> Worthless, don&#x27;t even bother buying this. Does NOTHING for dark circles. Tried it for a full month, NOTHING different! Really a waste!</li>
            <li> this stuff works, i&#x27;m a mom of a toddler, so i don&#x27;t get a lot of sleep. before i started using this it looked like i got punched in both eyes, now i barely have any at all. you have to roll it on and then rub it in. i use it daily and i have really sensitive skin and this has given me no issues.</li>
            <li> Works instantly! I look great!</li>
            <li> I was unsure about this Anti-Dark Circle Eye Roller, but it does actually work.  It hides my (medium) dark circles well.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I kind of expected to use it and be...meh, about it, but it has truly become a part of my daily routine. It blends really well with light finger tapping, so I often wear it even when I wear no other makeup. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like that this works well with my eye moisturizer (in that it does not clump up as other products do), and it works somewhat well on covering dark circles if I use a very light application of concealer underneath and a translucent powder to set.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it would drastically reduce severe dark eyes, but works fine for the average person. It is tinted, but I just rubbed in a touch with my finger and put foundation on top. I liked the cooling sensation of the metal ball.</li>
            <li> This is a product that will cover up your dark circles but it doesn&#x27;t correct them. I have dark circles that run in my family soo theres not much hope of them going away. But honestly I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again it truly doesn&#x27;t help but if you feel desperate for a good cover up its your decision.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with a little help now and then, and this eye roller is quick, easy and does the trick. I like that it blends into your skin easily and does look instantly better. Also, I don&#x27;t get a heavy or dry feeling around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s light but definitely changes the appearance of my dark, puffy eyes. I can wear this by itself, even without extra concealer and I look so much better than without! This is a product I will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I will always have this as part of my battle of the dark circles under my eyes.  Works well :)</li>
            <li> Light coverage of dark circles with revitalizing effects over time with use. Just what I needed. No complaints. Its not going to erase time for under twenty bucks. But it helps which is what I wanted. :)</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in my geographical area.  I love it because it goes no light and smoothly and lasts a long time.  I use it under the eyes and for covering some small rosacea like blemishes.  Does not seem to block my pores.</li>
            <li> Im a guy bought this my girlfriend because my eyes are so dark it looks like I could be a Tim burton character.&lt;br /&gt;Dark circles run in my family and I get bad sleep most of the time which doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this and it&#x27;s been about a week.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes look awesome we are amazed at how normal/ healthy my eyes look. This product has increased the health of my eyes and really works.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting dark circles my whole life.  At 70, this is the best cover up I have found.  Can&#x27;t say I noticed any renewing of my skin, but at least I found something that covers it very well without caking.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan because I wanted it to be more coverage, and I wanted it to be lighter. So I gave it to my mom...and she looks great with it on. She also loves the cooling metal roller ball. Good product, just wished it was more of a concealer or a brightener</li>
            <li> I have received this item on time and I bought it this for my sis and she loved it, I can recommend this item to anyone</li>
            <li> It works.  Definite makes a difference.  Smooths on easily and is invisible.  I will purchase this product again.  For the money it is a good buy.  Works as well as or better than more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dark circles and this product, while it does help did not completely do away with them.  I would recommend this product because it does help.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that could conceal my dark circles without being noticeable. I&#x27;m a male and absolutely love this product because of how effective it covers my dark circles, meanwhile seeming very natural and easy to blend into my skin. The consistency is not oily and is instead a very nice, natural looking matte texture and finish. The produce does not rub off without some effort, ensuring a lasting effect for the entire day (however, makes it difficult and slow to blend in). There is very little more that can be done to make an already incredible product any better. Definitely recommend for either gender, especially for other men looking for an unnoticeable fix.</li>
            <li> Wonderful concealer and very good at helping to keep the dark circles from coming through during the day</li>
            <li> Love the roller ball. Love the sheer coverage. It is buildable and covers my under eye area enough. I have some darkness but it is not severe. Coverage looks natural and I look awake. Definitely set with light dusting of powder or else this will wet into creases very easlily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day for work and on weekends. I only use my expensive Giorgio Armani concealer for emergencies or special occasions.</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles my whole life. Recently, I feel like they have gotten worse. I have tried everything to try to cover them but it always looks like a bruise being covered but still very noticeable. This is the first product that I felt just one coat made a difference. You could see the blue of my eyes more than the blue under them. I can add as many coats as I want without the product creasing into the tiny fine lines starting to show under my eyes. Most products cake up after an hour of wearing them. I can wear this product, without any primer or powder over it and I will get NO CREASES ALL DAY! Also, this product is so shear but covers very well. It looks really natural on too. Amazing and totally worth the price!!! Never stop making this Garnier!!</li>
            <li> My favorite under eye concealer. I set it with a translucent powder. Doesn&#x27;t crease up and really brightens the area.</li>
            <li> I am 41 and started developing dark circles under my eyes in my late 30s.  I purchased this product yesterday and love it so far!  It covered up my dark circles better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a lot over the past several years.  I don&#x27;t know if it actually gets rid of dark eye circles since I just started using it, but I&#x27;m extremely pleased with how it covers them up.  Also, I didn&#x27;t notice it accentuating lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot more money for products that do not lighten dark circles. This works and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> I think it was the caffeine in the product.    I am sure that the puffiness under my eyes actually got worse after using this product and dark circles did not go away.    However, I did feel the rush of the caffeine-- which is absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with the dark circles I was developing under my eyes.  I have to admit I didnt read the product discription or the reviews properly (probably something to do with shopping at 4am) so I was surprised to see that this was basically a liquid concealer - but figured try it anyway.    On the up side I found the application had a slight cooling feel, which felt very nice especially at 8am when I was getting off work, or at midnight when I was coming in.  It also dried quickly and doesnt smudge.  Unfortuately the concealer is too light for my skintone (or maybe it is just me) but you can see a noticable, lighter patch under my eyes, so I only use it for emergencies.  :-)    When I finish this bottle, I wont be re-ordering, but I do recommend to those who have a light complexion, for those of us whose skintone is a darker honey/olive we have to look elsewhere...</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 62 year old woman and have tried every eye cream and concealer on the market.&lt;br /&gt;For eye creams, I liked the one Kiehl&#x27;s discontinued the best. And, since then I have tried the Really expensive ones (Chanel, Sisleya, etc) with no results.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I tried everything else known to man.&lt;br /&gt;And, at the same time, I have tried every concealer and they all looked cakey and make matters worse.&lt;br /&gt;I even tried mixing Bobby Brown&#x27;s concealer with a slick eye cream but it still make the lines worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this really makes my eyes look brighter and conceals the lines and wrinkles under them.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to stock up in case it goes of the market the way everything that I love seems to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not correct the issues, I just don&#x27;t know yet, but it is a perfect concealer and illuminator.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Under eye circles most affordable enemy. It brightens the eye and takes years off instantly. I use it under my bare minerals foundation. What makes this product unique is that it has caffeine in it.</li>
            <li> Great product - hides dark circles under eyes very well and helps under eyes look much much better..  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> As a man with hereditary dark circles, this product has become a part of my morning routine. I had been somewhat self conscious of my eye circles for awhile. One day, I figured I would try to do something about it. I used a little bit of my girlfriend&#x27;s when she wasn&#x27;t looking. I liked the result so much that I haven&#x27;t gone a day since then without applying this product. I went to the store and got my own tube the next day.  That was a year ago. My gf has no idea I even wear it. Very discreet and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Really works well. I use with my beauty blender</li>
            <li> This works great for me in the mornings... Just a little under the eyes and I&#x27;m ready to take the kids to school and run errands.</li>
            <li> Works okay. Better than the concealer I used to use.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer, I use it daily under my eyes.  It&#x27;s light, but helps cover my undereye bags/darkness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male esthetician and have tried many eye products from department stores ranging from $40 and up. Some I&#x27;ve noticed a difference and others I have not. As I&#x27;m getting a little bit older my eye area has gotten darker ( sleep deprivation is also part of the problem, but that&#x27;s another story that I will spare you ) and I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that helps this problem. This product is $12 and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve noticed better results with this product over department store brands. I also love that it has a light concealer that is very easily blend-able for a quick fix. It a product you can wear on your own or under/ over a concealer if you need more coverage around the eye area. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite products at the moment and I use it religiously.  I recommend this product to my guy and girl friends who have the same problem as I do.</li>
            <li> It is a fine concealer but not particularly fantastic and did not reduce the dark circles under my eyes any more than normal concealer.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me after over 2 months of use.  Also seemed to cake up. I have discontinued use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had undereye circles all my life along with dry skin under the eyes. This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that does not cake up or settle into fine lines, at all! Coverage is medium so you do need a few layers to adequately conceal. However, the product is so light you will barely feel it, which is very important to me. The goal is to conceal and also brighten without looking like you are wearing a ton of makeup, and this product does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is medium/light with olive undertones.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my eyes look less tired and reduces the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Prompt customer service, will order again. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every concealer under the sun for my under eye area, and none have done quite as well as this! I heard about this product from my friend that is a makeup artist and this is her secret weapon for photo shoots. Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is spectacular! I saw immediate results in concealing my dark circles under my eyes. Where haa this product been the last 10yrs that I have been trying to cover up my dark circles under my eyes? &#x3D; Not at all surprised coming from Garnier, I have always loved the results that I get with every single product of theirs.</li>
            <li> Love, love this! I use it over my under eye serum and under concealor it&#x27;s great and doesn&#x27;t cake</li>
            <li> This is so sheer. You really have to use your fingers to lightly tap it in or it just blends away. Once it is there it provides very light coverage. My thoughts are really what is the point. It advertises for dark circles. So I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s not marketed toward young adults with great skin. I think that&#x27;s probably about all it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li> lightweight and easy to roll on. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t what the reviews say, this product is fantastic!! When I first apply it the color immediately helps cover and conceal the bags but after wearing for a short while the caffeine in this product shrinks the puffiness so I can barely see it!! Love this and won&#x27;t go without it!!!!</li>
            <li> Great idea to package and its great for women who wear glasses....easy to apply. Good color match and easy to blend</li>
            <li> This works out so well, it&#x27;s unbelievable.  After &amp;#34;prepping&amp;#34; the face and eye area (de-puffer, toner, moisturizer,) I use one roll per eye, and tap QUICKLY, as it sets almost immediately.  I tap in evenly under, to the ends, and it blends in with any foundation.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad, it just doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do which is cover the dark circles under my eyes. Being a guy I really don&#x27;t know a lot about make up, but I did buy another product and it works better.  I can say that this is light and doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable fragrance whereas the other product I bought does kind of smell. This also is much cheaper. Many people like this so you probably have to see for yourself.  For me, it made no difference.</li>
            <li> Not really anything to &#x27;write&#x27; home about...</li>
            <li> I love love love this eye roller! Before this, I was using one of those expensive under-eye concealer pens, and I bought Garnier&#x27;s when I was tired of paying that much money. I use this roller every day, not only on my under-eye area but on my face too! It&#x27;s so light, and it&#x27;s really easy to apply. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I ran out of korean bb cream, so I used this instead, all over my face, not just on the dark circles. I must say it works great, my skin looks smoother for the next few days after using it. It covers extremely well for something so extremely light. You can apply and reapply several times and it will not feel cakey at all! though as far as lightening dark circles, I don&#x27;t see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the color is awesome, it will adjust to your skin, I am a medium light, with yellow undertones and this shade looks awesome on my skin, brightens but not too pink. I would say a perfect beautiful shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the applicator for applying all over my face without getting too much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier makes a bb cream also, but its too dark on me and doesnt cover as well as this. (I wish this had SPF protection though)</li>
            <li> Too much comes out of the applicator to make the roller ball useful.</li>
            <li> good for used .I already have one and had to get another one for a different</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! I could never use concealer because it was always very noticeable. This takes away the circles under my eyes immediately and you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing it. I love how it&#x27;s in a roller tube too because it&#x27;s less messy. Cheap and amazing product!</li>
            <li> The only dark circle remover that works!!!!!!The dark circles are gradually lightening,and until their gone,the mineralsin the ;cover-up&#x27; work great!!Can&#x27;t tell your&#x27;e using anything!!!</li>
            <li> My daughters are competitive dancers, so I bought this hoping it would cover up dark undereye circles on their very fair, thin, delicate skin. Unfortunately, this did nothing for them! Normal, inexpensive foundation did a better job. I tried it on myself (different skin type and color) and even though I didn&#x27;t have much to cover I didn&#x27;t really see a difference. Frustrating because I paid so much and this really didn&#x27;t help!</li>
            <li> i love this thing.. it really helps with dark circles</li>
            <li> I love and swear by this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this, will order more!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like this product at all.. its very watery and does no convering</li>
            <li> I could say is okay it works fine .</li>
            <li> it covers the darkness but does not reduce it with time as advertised its great when you don&#x27;t want to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this roller. It&#x27;s sheer and lightweight. The color was lighter than expected, but I ended using it as a brightener;) around the upper cheek, lip, and brow. Better than expensive brighteners. Great for spot blemish covering.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 2. One for under eye. One for brightening.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful makeup must-have</li>
            <li> This, paired with Garnier anti puff roller, has been the only product that has ever worked for me. Highly recommended! The concealer doesn&#x27;t give raccoon eyes like so many others do, it doesn&#x27;t cake up, its very smooth to put on (needs to be patted dry and worked in a bit). Excellent products!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this through Amazon, but at Wal-Mart last summer. I have dark under eye circles that are hereditary...so no amount of sleep will ever make them disappear, &amp; they get worse with stress and lack of sleep. I decided to try this, as I love Garnier products. Unfortunately, it barely covered up my dark circles. BUT, I have found it works very well in covering up any redness(acne and irritation). I just roll some of the product onto my finger, and apply where needed as a concealer. So, not good for dark under eye circles.. but doubles as a spot treatment concealer.</li>
            <li> I like this product. The roll on applicator works well. The product does the job, and it does it in a far less expensive  way than some of the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> This product is more like a concealer for people with dark circles like myself, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a great product but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad either.</li>
            <li> It did not match my skin tone, it didn&#x27;t do nothing for the dark circles to disappear around my eyes and when you try it on, it looks like you&#x27;re applying some sort of powder under your eyes even if you trying to blur that area out, it dries so quick that come out a different color that do not match with your tone skin  anymore when you try it on. So don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing.</li>
            <li> Good for dark circles.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product if used correctly. I swipe under my eyes before I brush my teeth and style my hair. When I am ready to apply my makeup it is absorbed into my under eye area and looks like my skin only greatly improved. I dab it with my ring finger to blend and then apply my foundation. After my foundation if I still need under eye coverage I lightly dab a regular concealer on the dark areas. This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> The metal ball is very cooling and distributes nice light coverage to the undereye area. It blends easily by dabbing a clean finger on the area, but the color might be too light for darker skin tones. On a basic color spectrum (light, medium, dark), it would be light.</li>
            <li> My Mom has been telling me for 2 years to buy this dark circle eye-roller. Being my stubborn self, I continued to order pricey department store solutions for covering my dark circles. Had any of that stuff worked I wouldn&#x27;t be reviewing this today. So, after all the money that went to the department store I finally decided to listen to my Mom. Turns out she was right! She had the secret to covering the dark circles without highlighting the fine lines. Who knew a product I can buy at the grocery store would be so amazing?! You roll it on and pat it into your skin and like magic the dark circles are covered. It doesn&#x27;t last all day but it&#x27;s so inexpensive (compared to the department store) you can buy one for your purse and one for your house and still have money for a lip gloss :-)</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 months, and I am not seeing any result. This works great as a concealer, but no more than that.</li>
            <li> It is light and looks natural.  Covers the dark circles under your eye and it feels like your massaging your under eye when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really conceal anything.  The roller thing is a little more convenient than a little jar, but you still have to  smudge it in with a tissue.  Didn&#x27;t really cover anything up though.  Maybe if you have very slight crows feet and very slight dark circles.  Anything more severe than slight, and forget about this helping.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and it works!!</li>
            <li> the caffeine in this product is a big help for circles</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of covering the dark area at my inner eye. Since it is liquid, it goes on without pressure - making sure to not damage that delicate skin. I roll on a bit, then dab it with my fingers to spread it around. Then I let it dry while doing my hair, so it stays put when I put on my tinted sunscreen. If you add makeup while it is still wet, it may &#x27;disappear&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to look 50 years old, it doesn&#x27;t mean I hate my age. I&#x27;ve been using all kind of night creams for eyes and I just realized that...all I needed was this Garnier Anti-Dark Circle Eye Roller! What a great buy! I roll it under my eyes after my day cream in the morning and then wait 2 min. The concealer stay on the surface of my skin but the &amp;#34;eye stuff&amp;#34; goes right into it and lift my eyes (get rid of my puffy eyes!). Then, I gently retouch the concealer and I&#x27;ll tell you, it is amazing! A concealer coverstick is too tick for me now, it aggravates my wrinkles but this eye roller: wonderful! I recommend it for all women of all ages.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job concealing circles. There is no perfect product out there, but I keep going back to this one.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! IT DIDN&#x27;T DO WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD,  I WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM GARNIER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I thought it was funny reading the bad reviews calling it a gimmick, because it sure worked for me!! I dont get puffy eyes but I had dark circles AND a good dark vein that runs under my right eye. people often asked how I got a black eye! after I bought this stuff I swear it has made such a difference for my eyes. Heres what I do, and maybe this will help others from thinking this is a gimmick. After rolling under both eyes, I dab it lightly as not to smear it away, AND with my finger I dab on my top lids too. Then I put cover up on, and lightly dab the cover up sponge over my eyes. Long lasting eye coverage for me, I feel like the caffeine keeps working even after I take it off, nobody has mentioned dark eyes on me since I&#x27;ve used this. Also, I dont know how this tiny tube lasts so long!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this worked any better than any other under-eye concealer.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and lasting power! A good neutral tint too, for those with pink or yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> As a cover up for dark circles it works great!  Super easy to apply and blends well.  Stays on throughout my day.  I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the appearance of the dark circles though. However in my opinion just got use as an easy cover up it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is my go-to concealer that I use every single day. This product is great for just everyday tired eyes and slightly dark circles and puffy eye. First, this product lasts forever. I have been using the same one for several months and like I said, I use it everyday. It is just as good as any other cooling roller eye treatment out there. Really perks up your under eyes. I use it over my foundation. Great price, I just wish this company didn&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s, medium tone caucasian skin, and have always had dark circles under my eyes, largely due to genetics and the fact that I have deep set eyes which causes my brow bone to create additional shadowing under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many creams for dark circles as well as undereye concealers with results from okay to this stuff looks horrible on me.  Previously I have used Mary Kay concealer (pretty good), MAC concealers (both the thick pot stuff as well as the tube...the pot stuff was greasy and settle into fine lines...tube is okay), Amazing Makeup Concealer (good coverage but kind of dry thick texture after awhile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, I picked up the Garnier Roller and brought it home.  I was really happy with it from the start.  I tried putting it on over my daily concealer that was already on.  It seemed kind of thin and I was skeptical of the coverage but after gently blending it with my finger, I thought it looked pretty good.  The next day, after using my usual daily eye cream I used only the Garnier Roller and was worried that coverage would not be enough, but to my surprise, it actually looked pretty good.  On a side note, I think you definitely will still want to apply a moisturizer under your eyes before using this.  I don&#x27;t believe this product contains any and it is pretty matte once it dries.  The color is pretty light so if you have a very dark toned skin, I don&#x27;t think this would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product feels really nice when you roll it on, like a cooling sensation on my eye.  I also am putting a little on my eyelid as well and find this lightens up the area as well as is a good primer for eyeshadow.  I do like to reapply it a couple times throughout the day as it seems to kind of wear off, but I have had the same experience with pretty much every other product I have tried.  I do like that the texture and finish doesn&#x27;t require any additional product or step after blending it in.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinklesaround my eyes due to my addiction to sunglasses but there are still some very fine lines.  This product does not settle into those lines like some others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few days, it does seem that maybe the dark circles are not so bad even when I don&#x27;t have makeup on.  I am not sure if it is wishful thinking or that the other ingredients are actually helping diminish my dark circles.  I did have to go out and buy a second one of these to keep in my purse for touch ups.  It is pretty small but it would be nice if they made an even smaller purse or travel version of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize not every product works the same for every person, but for me this product works great and I would recommend others give it a try.</li>
            <li> not what i expected---covers dark areas because it is like a foundation make-up---not what i wanted---i was looking for an oil for re-hydrating cells---my bad for not understanding--so another person might like the covering qualities of this product--however, the roller ball on mine delivers way too much concealer for rolling across one&#x27;s eye area!! a DAB delivers enough for an entire eye area, and that needs spreading with a finger or whatever!!</li>
            <li> This product really helps with dark circles and I use it when needed.  I am most pleased with the results.  It was shipped quickly and packaged well.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Tinted liquid helps cover circles. Love the nice cold roller ball to freshen up my eyes in he morning.will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I got this product in December of 2011 and I&#x27;m just now replacing it. I&#x27;ve used it roughly 5 times a week for over two years. It&#x27;s so easy to use and blends right into the skin. I put this on right after I moisturize and then continue on with the rest of my makeup. It blends so well into my skin that I can also wear it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooray for affordable skin care!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this product to actually resolve the issue of my dark circles. I give it 3 stars though because the tint to the product does slightly disguise dark circles. It&#x27;s nice for a cover up if you don&#x27;t want to look like you have on makeup, but just don&#x27;t expect it to give you any reduction in those dark circles.</li>
            <li> Is essentially just a concealer.</li>
            <li> Best product ever! Covers dark circles and blends well into lighter skin tones. Garnier should make this product for more skin tones.</li>
            <li> it was so thin and so super pale. It did not give any coverage and I did not see any results.</li>
            <li> Just kinda eh. Nothing special</li>
            <li> I was fairly skeptical about this product because of a lot of the negative reviews and I have previously tried the regular puffy eye roller, and it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. It really brightens my eye area and can touch up nicely through out the day. The color blends well, and it just feels really nice when you put it on. I dont have bad dark circles, I mainly just have issues with puffiness, especially during allergy season, and this stuff helps. It&#x27;s not a miracle treatment, and it&#x27;s not like you cant see the puffys at all, but it does brighten your eyes for a more awake look and it covers lighter dark circles. If you have severe dark circles you will probably need a higher coverage concealer, this is more on the lighter side.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Thin and sheer, doesn&#x27;t cake in wrinkles. Pat on with a sponge after applying for best results. I already had this in light/medium. I ordered this from amazon because it shows, &amp;#34;sheer tint&amp;#34; as color. I wanted the lighter color. But what I received was another light/medium. It works though. Roller ball kinda useless. If you roll under eye, way to much comes out. Barely have to roll on then pat in. I don&#x27;t have really dark circles, so coverage is enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a huge makeup gal, just want something to make me look more decent. I don&#x27;t have time or money to go around experimenting with all kinds of sophistication.&lt;br /&gt;Garnier is cheapo, we all know that. But this roller is sooo convenient. Just roll and rub with your fingertip. Other concealers feel cakey, but this one goes smoothly and it takes about 30 seconds to be done with it. I guess it is the sheer quality of the tint they use; I like that. I don&#x27;t want something that completely covers my natural skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it reduce puffiness? Don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;Does it completely cover dark circles? Nope. Only partially.&lt;br /&gt;Is it easy to use even for a beginner? Absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;Does it make me happy every morning when I put it on? Very. So much that I took the trouble to write a review.</li>
            <li> For what this costs, it is truly amazing. I thought it would be a mediocre product considering there are so many far more expensive ones on the market, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It rolls on so smoothly, and brightens around my eyes. Especially during finals after those long study nights, people have commented the next day how well rested I look (not the way I looked when I got up). I can&#x27;t live without this anymore.</li>
            <li> Makes the area under my eyes look fantastic! No more dark bags! I put this on after washing my face in the morning and wait about 15 minutes (for it to dry completely) then I put on my usual foundation and the rest of my makeup. When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I roll it on and blow my hairdryer gently on my face--it dries in about 30 seconds. It&#x27;s my favorite beauty item. I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> I got this for the bags under my eyes, and haven&#x27;t used a concealer since Merry Kaaa&#x27;s yellow cream in the 1990&#x27;s.  This rolled on easily and was a light color, but it didn&#x27;t make the bags disappear.  It did blend nicely, so that was a plus.  I read recently that you should place concealer on AFTER you use foundation, and that helped, but it didn&#x27;t completely obliterate the bags.  Maybe nothing will... :(</li>
            <li> I use it as a concealer and it works, hiddens the eye blemish very well. I use it for years, and hidrate very well too</li>
            <li> I have had dark  circles, as a result of severe allergies, all my life...this is the best product I have ever used.  I wear it to bed at night&lt;br /&gt;faithfully.It is light weight and does not bulk up the dark circles as other cover ups during the day.  If you wish for a perfect result, this may not for you, but, it has worked for me reducing my swollen eyes  by 75%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, and it is much less expensive than purchasing from the beauty department of any store.</li>
            <li> I do not hate this product - I think the coverage is quite good, but I just figured out that is the cause of my new eye twitch. Never had an eye twitch before. Bought the product in April, used it occasionally and started noticing an occasional and annoying eye twitch. Went on vacation in July and never used it - no eye twitch. Back to work, and back to using this caffeinated concealer. The eye twitch is back. Researched &amp;#34;eye twitch&amp;#34; and discovered that caffeine is a leading cause of eye twitches. Ah well, off to replace my Garnier with something else.</li>
            <li> This stuff works good as a concealer on my dark purple circles and crowsfeet. The metal roller is nice, but wish it was smaller to get into tight areas. It is a bit thinner than conventional concealer but you can layer it up as needed. Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in reduction of circles/puffiness but time will tell.</li>
            <li> I use every day, good product</li>
            <li> Love it.  Reduces puffiness under the eye and blends seamlessly so I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;owl&amp;#34; eyes.</li>
            <li> Like it  - works well as a concealer.  Not sure of any long-term under-eye help but it definitely helps mask circles.  A little goes a long way and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great price and keeps my eyes looking awake all day. Take care of the dark marks under my eyes. I have very fair skin, and this blends well.</li>
            <li> The liquid comes out all uneven, fast then slow. In addition, the liquid is not thick enough to provide good coverage for dark under eye circles, which is the whole reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I used to get this at a pharmacy for half the price but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for a long time, so I ordered it. It looks like it&#x27;s been updated, the cap is clear as apposed to the one I had before and it&#x27;s a little more sheer/gives less coverage.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still really really good though, I hate wearing foundation and I use this all over my face, not just under my eyes. It&#x27;s a tiny bit greasy but still a lot better/lighter than foundation and still gives really great coverage.</li>
            <li> Amazing it&#x27;s the only makeup I know that matches my skin tone</li>
            <li> Best under eye dark spot thing i found</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effect is good, but it isn&#x27;t too effective at stopping dark circles. It essentially rolls patchy makeup over your skin, which you then spread to evenly cover the circles, but it seems as if it&#x27;s only effective for people with a certain skin tone. It helped make circles somewhat less prominent on my face, but it certainly didn&#x27;t cover them up much.</li>
            <li> I thought it actually resolves the dark circle issues but it has a concealer in it so its not really helping, more like its a fancy cover up that looks powdery when you apply it. I am not a fan and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it is extremely good to me cover my eyes perfectly. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Color is perfect to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I miss the days when I was a teen a didn&#x27;t need to wear any face makeup- well those days have come and gone. Now i am blessed with waking up every morning with dark circles under my eyes- its horrible. I have tried a bunch of different under eye concealers and i hate when they are chalk-like or leave traces of the makeup under your eye- well not this wand! I love how milky the concealer is - it simple rolls on and its a very sheer liquid layer that rubs right into your skin so it looks natural- you would have no idea I was wearing makeup. I love this- i think it is a makeup staple moving forward.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself on sale for $13.00 at Walmart my mom wanted some and I bought it on here for her - we both love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it but I don&#x27;t hate it. It&#x27;s a little cakey for my taste but to each his own.</li>
            <li> Product covers and seems to lighten the eye area to look younger and less tired.  I will continue to use and recommend if someone is looking for good coverage.</li>
            <li> this will be my second purchase, my first one is almost finished and don&#x27;t want to run out of this eye roller. Very effective indeed!!!</li>
            <li> Covers better than expected. Does not clump up in the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the eye pens by Garnier in the green tube for years and love them so I thought I&#x27;d try this. It will take some getting used to as I usually slather on the eye gel with several swipes of the roller ball in order to &amp;#34;deflate&amp;#34; my under eye bags. You cannot do that with this one because it oozes out concealer, so it&#x27;s a one-swipe shot! That said, the color of the concealer is a nice cover for dark circles.</li>
            <li> So far I like the concept. The ball is a little smaller than I would have thought and the product comes out fast. Unless you blend it in or have light/fair skin its a little much. It gives my eyes a more awakened look. So far from the one day I used it i think i like it...I will continue to use and see if it gets better</li>
            <li> I have struggled with really dark undereye circles for the past few years, and have tried out many products such as Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste and Maybelline&#x27;s Age Rewind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, Asian skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dark circle eye roller should be enough if you only have light dark circles under your eye, but if you have pretty bad dark circles like I do, this concealer will not come close to covering your dark circles completely. What I do to cover about 89% of my dark circles is I:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Put Burt&#x27;s Bees repair serum under my undereyes, otherwise they get dry and it&#x27;s hard to apply concealer without severe creasing and dryness. I wait a few moments before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Applying a pink/salmon concealer, Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste on top. I apply with caution as Erase Paste is REALLY dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Applying Garnier skin renew roller on top. It blends SO easily, compared to Erase Paste and Maybelline&#x27;s roller. I just need a few pats here and there to cover at least 60% of my dark circles. That&#x27;s why I love this roller, but the only downfall is that it&#x27;s yellow-colored and not pink, which makes it less effective for dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Applyng Maybelline age rewinder in medium, which is harder to blend but gives a bit more coverage than Garnier skin renewe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. (optional) Applying Maybelline age rewinder brightener</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, wish somebody had told me about it sooner!</li>
            <li> It is a great product!!</li>
            <li> Ive spent a lot of money trying different products for the circles under my eyes- which I just hate because I feel it ages me. This product is really great! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it&#x27;s super easy and clean when applying. I saw an improvement in just a couple days. I&#x27;d say: go for it!</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and helps incredibly with dark circles. The roll on application is great because the metal roller ball stays cool and helps decrease puffiness. Sometimes I use it on small blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> Good light coverage. If you are looking for a miracle product to completely hide your under eye circles than this is not the product for you. It does however, cover quite naturally when paired with a light powder and hides a natural amount of under eye darkness without making you look like its caked on.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It does what it says.  It is a concealer with a little pick-me-up.  It is cooling and helps to cover dark circles. I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is stupid. It rolls on creamy and too light for me, for anybody almost. And once you rub it in it takes on a milky, I-just-covered-a -bruise-with-makeup-badly look. I would rather rock my dark circles under my eyes than this, I-tried-and-failed look.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot though I feel the roller ball is too large for the targeted under eye area</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It glows to hide shadows too.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice undereye concealer and I think it slightly depuffs the area.  will continue to use and will likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this NYC color stick for about 4 months and I hated that it slightly pulled at my skin but did a great job covering up. So I went on a hunt for something better. I read reviews about this product but couldn&#x27;t find it at my local drug store. So I figured it got discontinued. Then my mom mentioned she had one and didn&#x27;t use it often. I fell in love. This is an amazing product. I have found it at walmart for a similar price as amazon. I use this every day before I put on my make up. I just roll it under my eyes then use concealer a little on the rest of my face giving it a chance to dry. Then I use my liquid make up over it and the dark circles are GONE!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help hide the redness that I naturally have under my eyes but it doesn&#x27;t. I do like that it brightens up everything else though.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes. I would recommend this. Make sure you get the correct tint.</li>
            <li> I have been buying and trying expensive and inexpensive under eye circle products for years. This is by far the best under eye circle product I have ever used. I have been relying on this for 3 years. It goes on smooth, blends well and covers for hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing results after a few months but it is a good concealer. So loose and win.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product about 6 months ago and now every one of girlfriends is using it! I have chronic dark circles even if I get 8 hours of sleep and this is the only product that I have used that hides them. I love the applicator and it usually lasts 3 months and I use a few times daily! This is a must-have if you often look tired or suffer from dark circles!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really dark circles or excessive puffiness. I also don&#x27;t like using concealer on my under eye area, it always seems to look cakey. This product is perfect at making me look more awake in the mornings. I like the feel of the cool metal ball. The coverage is light and blends in perfectly.  It really does make a difference in helping me look bright eyed and awake. Absolutely no cakiness. I use a fine powder over top to set. I don&#x27;t think it would cover dark circles very well. If you&#x27;re looking for coverage,  I think you would be disappointed.  I think it would work great under concealer. I am really impressed with this and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I like putthing this on in the mornings as I get ready for my day. It has a really nice cooling feeling as you apply it under your eyes. i really like the product.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer so much that I subscribed on Amazon. The concealer is a great medium-coverage item that can easily be thrown into a makeup bag as it needs no special brushes. I reach for this over higher end brands.&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: wet&lt;br /&gt;Coverage: medium to light. Would be enough for the darkest circles&lt;br /&gt;Light/Medium Color: Best for lighter porcelain tones&lt;br /&gt;Application: rollerball and fingers to blend</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this makeup product.  I will certainly buy it again. I use it to cover the dark circles I have under my eyes (hereditary).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t received what I asked for. I received another item.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have really dark under eye circles, but this stuff really covers them up amazingly well and I feel a lot more confident when I use it!</li>
            <li> it works well on me!! I do love it!!</li>
            <li> really great..non irritating. Cool roller ball feels very nice. Liquid texture does not pull at eye. Soft neutral fair/ medium color doesn&#x27;t make you look like you have white bandaids under your eye! Feels firming also. I would say that this great product covers appx. 60% of the dark circles, Which I think is A LOT. Even without foundation, my eyes have taken on their beautiful old almond shape. The area doesn&#x27;t look nearly as dark and bruised as before. This product also works very well with foundation, because it doesn&#x27;t have a real color or texture that will clash with your foundation</li>
            <li> its not bad, but not a miracle or even a game changer!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried that this color would be too light/sheer for me based on some of the other reviews but it turned out fine. I don&#x27;t know how well it actually hides my dark circles, but it is much easier to apply and blend in than my other concealers which is reason enough for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li> This product delivers-conceals darkness and shrinks swelling.  I use it every day and will for life.  It is better than any concealer on the market.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money for me.  Tried it several times, but not enough coverage.  The heavy duty stuff is so much better thn this...</li>
            <li> The tint is not strong enough to cover the dark circles but it&#x27;s a good and convenient product that you can use during day time. I just take this in my bag and every time I go to the bathroom, I moisture my eyes with it. However, I do not see the signs of aging disappear or do much about the fine lines. But I think it&#x27;ll help me to prevent the possible future winkles.&lt;br /&gt;If we constantly use lip balm and use hand cream, why not care for our eyes?</li>
            <li> I love this. Fits good and looks great!</li>
            <li> I love how this eye roller feels when you put it on! It is cold and definitely helps to wake you up in the morning. It covers dark circles very well and blends well with my skin tone. I&#x27;m on the pale side and thought it would be too dark, but it blends very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing! When I can, I&#x27;m stocking up on this item!!!!! My dark circles vanished, and are noticeably brighter even without this on now! And I have only used it 3 times so far!!! GREAT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have used Garnier Anti-dark circle Eye Roller for awhile now and it is the best product I have tried to help hide my dark circles.  I have tried many other products and brands and this is the best.  Can buy at the local drugstore, but is less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get people and their reviews sometimes.  I have used so many products (DOZENS) over the years and I come back to this one.  Why?  Because it has blendability and coverage that no other products do and it doesn&#x27;t burn the delicate skin under my eyes.  I have had dark circles since I was 18 and now I&#x27;m 36.  No amount of sleep, exercise or good diet does anything for mine.  So I have no choice but to conceal them the best I can.  Other concealers are either too thick (which inevitably gather in the creases under my eyes), are too thin (which provides no coverage) or are the wrong color which makes me look weird.  I have no idea whether the caffeine does anything for my dark circles, but honestly what ingredient really makes any kind of lasting impression on dark circles??  There is NOT ONE ingredient that permanently fixes dark circles.  They are hereditary for the most part and nothing will fix them, not even plastic surgery.  Ladies, give yourselves a break and spend the $10 on this.  And if you are one of the people who expects any product to be a miracle, well, you will be disappointed with this and EVERY other product out there.  I can tell you from many years of experience and many hundreds of wasted dollars in products that this product is soooo much better than Clarins, Clinique, NARS, MAC, Lancome and all of the other countless brands I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> too light for my skin tone</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. It&#x27;s so light and spreads really well. I can tell a huge difference when I apply this under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Pretty good coverage.</li>
            <li> Best anti dark circle ever used.</li>
            <li> It reduces the looks of dark spots under the eyes but I really would not recommend this is if you have a brown to dark complexion. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave this 3 stars other than that this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The product has damaged pockets and purses because the tinted concealer leaks out. At first I thought that I had simply not closed the cap tightly, only to have more fabric soiled by it. I took to transporting it in a plastic baggy with a tissue wrapped around the tip. Mind you this is just storing/using around town, not airplane travel that would affect the pressure. I give it a check minus for concealing under-eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I have not used a concealer before and I have really enjoyed this one.  It goes on and when it dries it pats out and matches my complexion.  I would suggest to friends.  In fact I saw this on a YouTube demonstration and that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price. There&#x27;s better out there but like I said for the price it&#x27;s pretty good. I would probably buy again</li>
            <li> This product does not work as well as I would have liked. Application is easy but coverage was not great.</li>
            <li> matches my skin color. it acts more like a concealer</li>
            <li> I have fair skin.  This product goes on pretty thick so I need use my finger to apply, not the roller.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  Too watery.</li>
            <li> The Product itself is great. But the product comes out the of the tip in travel</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, I am an absolute makeup/skincare junkie!!!I read great reviews about this product &amp; thought for the price it was worth checking out. Soooooo glad I did. I LOVE this stuff &amp; if Garnier ever retires this product I will cry myself an ocean. Grantite I do not have deep dark circles. I am olive complected, with average dark circles(wear concealor daily). This product is amazing for puffy eyes and the light particles mask any dark shades. I even use this here &amp; there along the lip line as a lighlighter. EXCELLENT PRODUCT. Home run Garnier!!!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Easy, nice, good. :-)</li>
            <li> Trusted friend recommended this and she usually uses high end products and takes VERY good care of herself! I immediately bought this and was willing to continue to try it a few weeks because most eye products cause irritation and this did not or most products don&#x27;t blend well. I have never found an eye cream I could apply with my concealer on top, so it could have been a good idea.  This is merely a thin concealer and it seems to crease if used in excess and because its tinted, I don&#x27;t use it at night. It&#x27;s actually too tinted to use in significant amounts as I like to \\&quot;overuse\\&quot; creams. It&#x27;s a nice formula, but very thin, and I doubt it&#x27;s actually therapeutic. The rolling ball delivery method is not useful as you still have to blend with a finger or brush and must be wasting huge amounts of product as well, which I hate to do!</li>
            <li> absolutely works.............circles disappear and they (after about a week) are totally gone.  the color applied (conceler) is a good natural color and I have recommended to several friends (who have dark circles).  They too are very pleased with the results.</li>
