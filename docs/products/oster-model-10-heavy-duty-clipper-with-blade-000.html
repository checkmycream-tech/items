            <li>Only the best I love these clippers</li>

            <li>Wish I had bought it 10 years ago instead of the cheap drug-store models.  </li>
            <li>They get real hot while shaving head with just the blade</li>

            <li>This is one powerful clipper.</li>
            <li>Very quiet operation and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the motor and internal mechanics are the same as the 76, it&#x27;s just a Man&#x27;s version ;)</li>
            <li>Cutting heads are larger than anticipated but the cut is excellent.</li>

            <li> great clipper and love the quick detachable blades. Very quiet operation and easy to clean.  use it for all of the boys no problem</li>
            <li> This rocks! I bought it for myself, but my sister (who works on models&#x27; hair for national commercials) LOVES it and uses it everytime she comes over to cut our hair. Better than the Classic 76 because it is easier to hold. I&#x27;m pretty sure the motor and internal mechanics are the same as the 76, it&#x27;s just a Man&#x27;s version ;)</li>

            <li> This is one powerful clipper. Only complaint is that the clipper blade gets warn after a little bit. Beside that buy it without any hesitation.</li>
            <li> Very Heavy Duty. Bought blade size 2 for beard trimming to 1/4&amp;#34;. Using it for home use, so it&#x27;ll likely last the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Great handling, sturdy construction, what&#x27;s not to love.</li>
            <li> Would by again great item ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Smooth cutting action and lighter than the 76&#x27;s. Delivery was quick and product was in pristine condition, Highly recommend to those who choose to cut their own hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oster clipper and blades for my son, a third generation barber, and he loves the product. The delivery was as promised.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in product.  Contained protein material in clipper housing and blade.</li>
            <li> I have had this pair of clippers for a month.. the on off switch has broken off.. they are really loud and not very durable.</li>
