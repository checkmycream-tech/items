            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>This one was great.  </li>
            <li>Ordered it for my niece and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal for the amount of jagua that you receive.  </li>
            <li>The designs are good, too.  </li>
            <li>I am still appreciative of the kit and look forward to playing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product itself, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>On my skin it looked more like I drew sharpie on myself instead of henna</li>
            <li>Maybe I broke it, but it seems to leak out of the top where the plastic tip meets the bottle while you&#x27;re applying the jagua.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>The product is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>Better of just ordering the ink by itself and getting some tracing paper, would have been way cheaper then ordering this at this price</li>
            <li>/&gt;1)put design under top 1st</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of joy out of this product and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The kit was easy to use and looked fantastic when completed and as the days went by, got even better looking!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, love the colors.  </li>
            <li>The value for how much \\&quot;ink\\&quot; you get is good, and the kit comes with all you need to experiement with it.  </li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t easy to apply and does stain.</li>
            <li>For those new to Jagua, this is a good introductory kit.  </li>
            <li>The kit looks like someone put it together at home, but that is fine.  </li>
            <li>It came with a bunch printed out sample tattoos which could be helpful if you&#x27;re not going free hand.</li>
            <li>original design from under 1st sheet&lt;</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 15 year old daughter because she wanted a tattoo, this is the next best thing, she loves it, she is an artist.</li>
            <li>Fun to play with.  </li>
            <li>good Kit, the paint last at least 15 days and has a good quality.</li>
            <li>we did not like this kit, the ink got EVERY WHERE even though we followed the directions exact, and I did not touch any body parts, except the part being tattooed.</li>
            <li>Interesting change from the standard henna.</li>
            <li>Fun to try but really pricey compared to henna.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2)use pencil (easier for later) to copy design onto top sheet</li>
            <li>This kit was very satisfactory!</li>
            <li>jagua has peeled off (no info was included on how long to leave, longer the better I&#x27;m guessing, 3 hours?)</li>
            <li>Really happy that is a small business and an all natural product.  </li>
            <li>The cost of two little bottles doesn&#x27;t help in making really nice designs.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Thanks-</li>
            <li>The henna stained very well, for about three weeks I believe.</li>
            <li>Overall very fun.  </li>
            <li>I think multiple applications will help, and with a steady hand and following the directions you can still end up with a nice, temporary tattoo.</li>
            <li>Only issue is with the designs, it would be better if they were actually transferable.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how many tattoos I got out of this &amp; how dark they came out.  </li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li>Wasnt really what i expected</li>

            <li> Hard to do for amateur needs to be a professional to use this kid</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect a really dark tattoo.  </li>
            <li> or else it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>

            <li> There was nothing technically wrong with it, but I think I prefer the other henna that turns out a brown color over the black/blue color this product shows up as.</li>
            <li> and I find it difficult to get thinner lines or to do detail, but maybe that&#x27;s just lack of experience.</li>

            <li> Ordered it for my niece and she loved it.  Really happy that is a small business and an all natural product.  The kit was easy to use and looked fantastic when completed and as the days went by, got even better looking!</li>
            <li> Jagua lasts a long time on the skin. After applying once to my arm, and with showers 1-2 times daily, it lasted about 4 1/2 weeks. It began to fade however at the 3 1/2 week mark.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. There was nothing technically wrong with it, but I think I prefer the other henna that turns out a brown color over the black/blue color this product shows up as. On my skin it looked more like I drew sharpie on myself instead of henna like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> For those new to Jagua, this is a good introductory kit.  The value for how much \\&quot;ink\\&quot; you get is good, and the kit comes with all you need to experiement with it.  The kit looks like someone put it together at home, but that is fine.  Remember, this is Jagua so don&#x27;t expect a really dark tattoo.  I think multiple applications will help, and with a steady hand and following the directions you can still end up with a nice, temporary tattoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal for the amount of jagua that you receive.  The designs are good, too.  The tattoos come through just as expected.  Not sure about the applicator bottle, though.  Maybe I broke it, but it seems to leak out of the top where the plastic tip meets the bottle while you&#x27;re applying the jagua.  Overall very fun.  I haven&#x27;t tried anything too big and I find it difficult to get thinner lines or to do detail, but maybe that&#x27;s just lack of experience.</li>
            <li> we did not like this kit, the ink got EVERY WHERE even though we followed the directions exact, and I did not touch any body parts, except the part being tattooed. now its sitting in a drawer drying up and wasting away.</li>
            <li> Love the product itself, very easy to use.  Only issue is with the designs, it would be better if they were actually transferable.  Would absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t easy to apply and does stain. It works okay. I wished that the bottles were in a larger quantity. The cost of two little bottles doesn&#x27;t help in making really nice designs. The product is okay. Interesting change from the standard henna. Fun to try but really pricey compared to henna.</li>
            <li> Hard to do for amateur needs to be a professional to use this kid or else it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> We received the kit and was upset to find out that it really not ready to use. My husband was looking for that art already on the transfer paper it it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  Easy to use, love the colors.  Fun to play with.  Perfect for an Indian Festival!! Loved it!</li>
            <li> Wasnt really what i expected</li>
            <li> Thanks- Everything was great!!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> good Kit, the paint last at least 15 days and has a good quality.</li>
            <li> Information you will probably want to know that is NOT included or NOT clear. I am still appreciative of the kit and look forward to playing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;transfer paper.&lt;br /&gt;1)put design under top 1st white (sketch) paper&lt;br /&gt;2)use pencil (easier for later) to copy design onto top sheet&lt;br /&gt;3)remove original design from under 1st sheet&lt;br /&gt;4)retrace design pushing hard so the paper pushes against the blue inked paper and leaves the design on white paper&lt;br /&gt;5)cut out that white paper piece, put ink side against skin, place moist towel against paper and hold for probably 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;6)ink should have transferred, now use jagua to cover design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included Lip Balm&lt;br /&gt;1)after jagua has peeled off (no info was included on how long to leave, longer the better I&#x27;m guessing, 3 hours?) put lip balm over it and this will protect it from water fading it sooner.</li>
            <li> This kit was very satisfactory! I was a bit unsure however, which was the transfer paper and how to use it. The henna stained very well, for about three weeks I believe. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of joy out of this product and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how many tattoos I got out of this &amp; how dark they came out.  I&#x27;ve used other jagua &amp; henna inks before &amp; some have irritated my skin.
