            <li>Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is very sweet and to die for.</li>
            <li>Lovely, light tropical scent.</li>
            <li>I use it straight out from the shower and its a really good lotion to use.</li>
            <li>but if you really like watermelon this will be good for you.</li>
            <li>Original scent &amp; texture much better than this one.</li>
            <li>Love Hempz lotion original and pomegranate, but</li>
            <li>I prefer the original scent more.</li>
            <li>going to buy original and more age defying soon.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly</li>
            <li>The watermelon is too strong.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with item, shipping is fast.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin beautiful without the oily after math of a regular lotion.</li>
            <li>I would like it better if it had an herbal note to cut the sweet notes.  </li>
            <li>I received it only a couple days after ordering, which was totally awesome, and it was carefully packaged and in perfect condition (no lotion on the bottle, no broken pump).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>The scent is also light and pleasant - not too girly, not too &#x27;Old Spice&#x27; guy.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on the smell and it makes my skin so soft, I love it!</li>
            <li>and I am a huge coconut fan</li>
            <li>huge brownie points went</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a light scent</li>
            <li>I returned it for the vanilla plum scent which my boyfriend and I both enjoy.</li>
            <li>Great for my skin, especially when I have been out in the sun alot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and moisturizing that I use it on my face , it&#x27;s been 2 weeks</li>

            <li>Some people said it smelled cheap, but I don&#x27;t think so.</li>

            <li>Also you can&#x27;t beat that it is cruelty free.</li>

            <li>Same silkily feel, great new scent!  </li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and made my skin so smooth and soft!!  </li>
            <li>I love it , can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>I like the original scent of this  lotion very much  </li>
            <li>The lotion had leaked out a little from the top - which wasn&#x27;t a huge deal - more of an annoyance.</li>
            <li>Light weight, but very mositurizing.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and am able to use this lotion at any time of day and part of skin and not have side effects.</li>
            <li>I rarely give out 5 stars for anything</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>This scent smells like fresh coconut and watermelon as it states.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent so far</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I do love love Hempz lotions in other scents though</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to love this product with no complaint, but it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin at all.</li>
            <li>It has an odd fruity smell, but is still enjoyable, more watermelon than coconut.</li>
            <li>scent is VERY fruity and sweet</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this particular scent on Amazon and even with shipping</li>
            <li>Use it all the time  Love it  the other ones are good to different sent</li>
            <li>delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin very soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really put my finger on exactly what it smells like, but it&#x27;s not coconuts or watermelon!</li>
            <li>Felt that it smelled more like a white melon and cucumber, than watermelon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a avid review reader</li>
            <li>I love the actual HEMP lotion.</li>
            <li>product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>the smell of it took some getting use to, but now i  like it, but at first i didn&#x27;t, but this was not the sellers fault.</li>
            <li>but I really smell the watermelon!</li>
            <li>Super rich creamy lotion, especially for my feet</li>
            <li>It soaks in very fast &amp; leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really smell very much of the coconut</li>
            <li>Love the scent, lotion sinks in fast - a light lotion, not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Hempz is my very favorite lotion and the only place I can find it locally is Ulta</li>
            <li>I would probably choose a different one with a strong scent you can handle like a mint lotion or something, idk</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I have used it everyday after tanning, and my skin has never felt so healthy!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using this particular scent...</li>
            <li>so i thought i would love this scent, but it is just kind of weird.</li>
            <li>Recommend taping top closed.</li>
            <li>The lotion locks in and hydrated gently.</li>
            <li>Very luxurious scent and goes on non-greasy but leaves skin very well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Rejuvenates and hydrates very well.</li>
            <li>This lotion is fast absorbing and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Really hydrates the skin and leaves it</li>
            <li>My whole family and wife&#x27;s family have all switched to this brand lotion.</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>The lotion is also very moisturizing....</li>
            <li>Did not like the scent as much as thought I would.</li>
            <li>I like the Hempz line and my absolute favorites</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very perfumey.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft, but  not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves the Hempz product line.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, dries fast, leaves skin feeling nourished.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>It is very moisturing.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy and absorbs into the skin really nice without any stickiness afterwards.</li>
            <li>I am a sucker for product that smells good.</li>
            <li>Will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to mix it up if suggest this scent, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with original next time.</li>
            <li>The other scented products of HEMPZ are better</li>
            <li>After not being able to figure out what smelled funny (like pee or something) for a few days - I realized it was the lotion.</li>
            <li>it was still more than half off what I would have paid at the store.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy this particular scent again.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t care for this particular scent.</li>
            <li>This same bottle retails for more than double in stores.</li>
            <li>fresh and light but long lasting.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave the heavy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the pomegranate</li>
            <li>Maybe something a little more</li>
            <li>It smells like summer and makes your skin very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>This brand is not thick like malibu.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s runnier than normal lotion.</li>
            <li>Have used cucumber jasmine before, but this is definitely my new go to scent.</li>
            <li>This was a new fragrance for me.</li>
            <li>what planet do they live on?</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more when my bottle is empty</li>
            <li>entire family addicted to this lotion all scents are great not sticky slimy or overpowering smell</li>
            <li>This scent isn&#x27;t a difference between a cheap or more expensive scent.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin, but I can use this for my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Very soft skin to follow after use.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the nice feel of this lotion but found this scent a little disappointing.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this and can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other scents they have.</li>
            <li>Like it is old !  </li>
            <li>but it is the first cream to actually help his skin.  </li>
            <li>It makes my dkin so soft, would reccomend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>but seriously, the scent is just fantastic...so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>and so far it hasn&#x27;t made me break out.</li>
            <li>Kinda has an old, musty smell.</li>
            <li>Smells oily and scent doesn&#x27;t last very Kong.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I buy now, and the price on Amazon is absolutely rock-bottom.</li>
            <li>Love the Hempz products just not thrilled at the scent.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong at first but doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had one from the previous bottle I used.</li>
            <li>I find that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other scents (because its winter maybe), it may be better for the summer months instead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and watermelony, with just a little bit of coconut and floral scents.</li>
            <li>but it smelled horrible (like a cheap fruity perfume) which was so overwhelming I threw the whole thing right in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a long time and it really works in winter time</li>
            <li>The lotion is exactly what I expected...</li>
            <li>So, now I&#x27;ve gotta find a pump for a brand new bottle of lotion...that should have been closed properly in the first place, but wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If you are older and your skin gets dry, and drier, you can use this over and over again without looking slippery.  </li>
            <li>Top was broken when received 😫</li>
            <li>It also does not seem as thick as the original or age defying moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Not a single complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like a bad lotion that you get for free with a drug store cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>about 4 times and each time hated it more and more.  </li>
            <li>The price is very decent i have had the same bottle for two months and use it everyday for my whole body and haven&#x27;t made it half way threw it.  </li>
            <li>I am a guy and live in a dry climate and hands\arms\elbows are always dry in the fall\winter.</li>

            <li> I usually love this brand lotion.</li>
            <li> This one isnt appealing to me at all.</li>

            <li> It has a mostly coconut smell with a bit of melon in it.</li>
            <li> I love the lotion.</li>
            <li> BUT the top was opened on the package and the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Did sting a bit if you get in eyes, so unless you get unscented, this will most often be the case.</li>

            <li> I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It may smell better once it mixes with your body chemistry</li>
            <li> I order lots off of Amazon and that almost never happens so that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Simply the best combination of fragrances!  </li>

            <li> I love the pomegranate and thought I would try this one.  </li>
            <li> Me too :-)</li>
            <li> As of now, I&#x27;ll be purchasing again :)</li>
            <li> and I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the company</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but I will stick with the original</li>
            <li> Very clean and not an overpowering scent like some others.</li>
            <li> Performance is as good as I&#x27;ve come to expect from Hempz, though not my first choice, but considering the price and availability</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is very sweet and to die for.</li>
            <li> Lovely, light tropical scent.</li>
            <li> I use it straight out from the shower and its a really good lotion to use.</li>
            <li> but if you really like watermelon this will be good for you.</li>
            <li> Original scent &amp; texture much better than this one.</li>
            <li> Love Hempz lotion original and pomegranate, but</li>
            <li> I prefer the original scent more.</li>
            <li> going to buy original and more age defying soon.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> The watermelon is too strong.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with item, shipping is fast.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin beautiful without the oily after math of a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I would like it better if it had an herbal note to cut the sweet notes.  </li>
            <li> I received it only a couple days after ordering, which was totally awesome, and it was carefully packaged and in perfect condition (no lotion on the bottle, no broken pump).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> The scent is also light and pleasant - not too girly, not too &#x27;Old Spice&#x27; guy.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on the smell and it makes my skin so soft, I love it!</li>
            <li> and I am a huge coconut fan</li>
            <li> huge brownie points went</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a light scent</li>
            <li> I returned it for the vanilla plum scent which my boyfriend and I both enjoy.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin, especially when I have been out in the sun alot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and moisturizing that I use it on my face , it&#x27;s been 2 weeks</li>
            <li> And it really smells nice.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> This smells AMAZING &amp; is very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Some people said it smelled cheap, but I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> Also you can&#x27;t beat that it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> This watermelon and coconut smells so good and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> When I smelled it out of the bottle at first whiff I thought it smelled pretty good.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Very fresh.</li>
            <li> The fresh coconut &amp; watermelon smell is amazing &amp; the lotion is very moisturizing!  </li>

            <li> This product is awesome, smells great , and no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> This new scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love hempz lotion, but this smell reminds me too much of cucumber melon.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to order more.</li>
            <li> Why the hell does this lotion get such good reviews?</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion, because I needed a good deep moisturizer to use after tanning in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> The sent is sweet and can be smelled threw clothing.</li>
            <li> the scent is ok, nothing to really write home about.</li>
            <li> Came super fast and I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> This has a clean fragrance and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> Does smell clean and fresh</li>
            <li> This one smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The lotion also absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super hydrating.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly..</li>
            <li> , They must think I&#x27;m a sweet treat for hot summer days!</li>
            <li> I just need to make sure that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Same silkily feel, great new scent!  </li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and made my skin so smooth and soft!!  </li>
            <li> I love it , can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> I like the original scent of this  lotion very much  </li>
            <li> The lotion had leaked out a little from the top - which wasn&#x27;t a huge deal - more of an annoyance.</li>
            <li> Light weight, but very mositurizing.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am able to use this lotion at any time of day and part of skin and not have side effects.</li>
            <li> I rarely give out 5 stars for anything</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This scent smells like fresh coconut and watermelon as it states.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent so far</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I do love love Hempz lotions in other scents though</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love this product with no complaint, but it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It has an odd fruity smell, but is still enjoyable, more watermelon than coconut.</li>
            <li> scent is VERY fruity and sweet</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this particular scent on Amazon and even with shipping</li>
            <li> Use it all the time  Love it  the other ones are good to different sent</li>
            <li> delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin very soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really put my finger on exactly what it smells like, but it&#x27;s not coconuts or watermelon!</li>
            <li> Felt that it smelled more like a white melon and cucumber, than watermelon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a avid review reader</li>
            <li> I love the actual HEMP lotion.</li>
            <li> product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> the smell of it took some getting use to, but now i  like it, but at first i didn&#x27;t, but this was not the sellers fault.</li>
            <li> but I really smell the watermelon!</li>
            <li> Super rich creamy lotion, especially for my feet</li>
            <li> It soaks in very fast &amp; leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really smell very much of the coconut</li>
            <li> Love the scent, lotion sinks in fast - a light lotion, not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Hempz is my very favorite lotion and the only place I can find it locally is Ulta</li>
            <li> I would probably choose a different one with a strong scent you can handle like a mint lotion or something, idk</li>
            <li> Will certainly purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday after tanning, and my skin has never felt so healthy!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using this particular scent...</li>
            <li> so i thought i would love this scent, but it is just kind of weird.</li>
            <li> Recommend taping top closed.</li>
            <li> The lotion locks in and hydrated gently.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious scent and goes on non-greasy but leaves skin very well moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Rejuvenates and hydrates very well.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fast absorbing and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Really hydrates the skin and leaves it</li>
            <li> My whole family and wife&#x27;s family have all switched to this brand lotion.</li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> The lotion is also very moisturizing....</li>
            <li> Did not like the scent as much as thought I would.</li>
            <li> I like the Hempz line and my absolute favorites</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very perfumey.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft, but  not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves the Hempz product line.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, dries fast, leaves skin feeling nourished.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> It is very moisturing.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and absorbs into the skin really nice without any stickiness afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for product that smells good.</li>
            <li> Will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to mix it up if suggest this scent, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with original next time.</li>
            <li> The other scented products of HEMPZ are better</li>
            <li> After not being able to figure out what smelled funny (like pee or something) for a few days - I realized it was the lotion.</li>
            <li> it was still more than half off what I would have paid at the store.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy this particular scent again.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t care for this particular scent.</li>
            <li> This same bottle retails for more than double in stores.</li>
            <li> fresh and light but long lasting.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave the heavy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the pomegranate</li>
            <li> Maybe something a little more</li>
            <li> It smells like summer and makes your skin very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This brand is not thick like malibu.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s runnier than normal lotion.</li>
            <li> Have used cucumber jasmine before, but this is definitely my new go to scent.</li>
            <li> This was a new fragrance for me.</li>
            <li> what planet do they live on?</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more when my bottle is empty</li>
            <li> entire family addicted to this lotion all scents are great not sticky slimy or overpowering smell</li>
            <li> This scent isn&#x27;t a difference between a cheap or more expensive scent.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin, but I can use this for my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Very soft skin to follow after use.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the nice feel of this lotion but found this scent a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this and can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other scents they have.</li>
            <li> Like it is old !  </li>
            <li> but it is the first cream to actually help his skin.  </li>
            <li> It makes my dkin so soft, would reccomend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> but seriously, the scent is just fantastic...so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> and so far it hasn&#x27;t made me break out.</li>
            <li> Kinda has an old, musty smell.</li>
            <li> Smells oily and scent doesn&#x27;t last very Kong.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I buy now, and the price on Amazon is absolutely rock-bottom.</li>
            <li> Love the Hempz products just not thrilled at the scent.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong at first but doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had one from the previous bottle I used.</li>
            <li> I find that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other scents (because its winter maybe), it may be better for the summer months instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and watermelony, with just a little bit of coconut and floral scents.</li>
            <li> but it smelled horrible (like a cheap fruity perfume) which was so overwhelming I threw the whole thing right in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time and it really works in winter time</li>
            <li> The lotion is exactly what I expected...</li>
            <li> So, now I&#x27;ve gotta find a pump for a brand new bottle of lotion...that should have been closed properly in the first place, but wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If you are older and your skin gets dry, and drier, you can use this over and over again without looking slippery.  </li>
            <li> Top was broken when received 😫</li>
            <li> It also does not seem as thick as the original or age defying moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Not a single complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like a bad lotion that you get for free with a drug store cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> about 4 times and each time hated it more and more.  </li>
            <li> The price is very decent i have had the same bottle for two months and use it everyday for my whole body and haven&#x27;t made it half way threw it.  </li>
            <li> I am a guy and live in a dry climate and hands\arms\elbows are always dry in the fall\winter.</li>
            <li> A definite must for anyone who tans or has dry skin, a definite must for everyone!</li>
            <li> The combo of coconut &amp; watermelon is a strange combo.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> Like when you leave a load of laundry in the washing machine too long.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time when applied.</li>
            <li> (which doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to take long)!</li>
            <li> but this one smells so strange!</li>
            <li> Made my dry skin burn when I applied it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who has had very dry skin for a long time.  </li>
            <li> You have a slight scent of the coconut &amp; watermelon, which you can smell, but it&#x27;s mixed with something else that&#x27;s overpowering it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> It is a little fruity and minty at the same time.</li>
            <li> Minimal loss.</li>
            <li> Not really coconut and not really</li>
            <li> I started using it 15 to 20 years ago after going into the tanning salon but probably started using it on an everyday basis for the last 10-15 years.</li>
            <li> The scent also has staying power for roughly 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> Want to send it back but not worth the aggravation and cost!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other scents.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like the other bottle I received.</li>
            <li> Will try other scents.</li>
            <li> The others seem watered down.</li>
            <li> This item seem to be watered down.</li>
            <li> Slightly lighter weight than the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The other products for moisturising pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your skin an oily mess like others.</li>
            <li> A little dab is all you need.</li>
            <li> but now that I&#x27;ve tried this one I have to say I like to use it everyday because of how it makes my skin feel and smell.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like really heavy fragrances because they give me headaches, and this one is not too heavy or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this - head to Duane Reade and puck up their coconut aloe after sun lotion.</li>
            <li> The selling point for me is it is a light-weight lotion and absorbs within a few minutes without leaving a residue.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, these are two scents that should have never been combined.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a very odd scent that I&#x27;m not fond of.</li>
            <li> It was watered down and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this combo, and the reviewers who said it smelled badly just didn&#x27;t have a love for those two scents like I do.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, but this scent really is plain terrible...</li>
            <li> Love his brand but this scent is horrible, coconut and watermelon.</li>
            <li> Strong, overpowering and artificial smelling!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to throw the whole thing away.</li>
            <li> It is normally a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> Seems like a fake watered down product.</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell is bad enough in my opinion to deduct 3stars!  </li>
            <li> Seems weak and watery.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a fake or what,</li>
            <li> Just wish it actually moisturized :(</li>
            <li> - just sort of odd and artificial.  </li>
            <li> Although, I bought if from this person &amp;#34;sunless deals&amp;#34; and you sent me it broken.</li>
            <li> but I was so sad it had broken and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smells like throw up if u buy this u going to be sad</li>
            <li> and I must say, I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Not happy with the coconut at all !!! ...</li>
            <li> Needless to say I have about 3/4 of a bottle that will be thrown away....</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with the</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be really artificial.</li>
            <li> it gets really cold</li>
            <li> Not so crazy about the scent.  </li>
            <li> The really disappointing part is that the pump won&#x27;t dispense the lotion.</li>
            <li> just what is needed during this cold drying weather.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> , it was just unpleasant, so I ended up not using it.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like watermelon that has gone bad.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you give it a try.</li>
            <li> Smells like a dirty dish rag!</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell yummy and tropical, but it stinks!</li>
            <li> this scent is just awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awful smell</li>
            <li> I hate greasy lotion!</li>
            <li> Bummed out that it smells so nasty.</li>
            <li> but this one smells terrible.</li>
            <li> This scent is horrible!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I get so many compliments on the smell and it makes my skin so soft, I love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Smells fresh!</li>
            <li> Lotion had come open in shipping. Recommend taping top closed. Minimal loss.</li>
            <li> Not an incredible smell, but it&#x27;s not a horrible smell. If you&#x27;re looking to mix it up if suggest this scent, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with original next time. Perfect for a fresh clean scent though and it&#x27;s a light scent</li>
            <li> Lovely, light tropical scent. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Slightly lighter weight than the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; Hempz lotion. This has a clean fragrance and is quickly absorbed. Will certainly purchase this again. Makes a great gift for family or friends.</li>
            <li> Perfect lotion, not greasy, does the job, good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this scent.  Very clean and not an overpowering scent like some others. Non greasy, absorbs quickly. Have used cucumber jasmine before, but this is definitely my new go to scent.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> The combo of coconut &amp; watermelon is a strange combo. Won&#x27;t buy this particular scent again. I do love love Hempz lotions in other scents though</li>
            <li> love the sent and great lotion</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizing product and great fragrance.  I am very happy!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like watermelon that has gone bad. There is no coconut scent. It is a good lotion but I can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li> Scent more melon than coconut/watermelon combo.  Original scent &amp; texture much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I love hempz lotion, but this smell reminds me too much of cucumber melon. I&#x27;ll stick to the original scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Smells great!</li>
            <li> Top was broken when received 😫</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! Just like watermelons!</li>
            <li> Great product! Great expierence :)</li>
            <li> Would have rather just had coconut fragrance. The watermelon is too strong.</li>
            <li> I love coconut, I love watermelon... To me this lotion smelled like neither. I found the scent to be really artificial. I returned it for the vanilla plum scent which my boyfriend and I both enjoy.</li>
            <li> Great lotion but not the smell of this one. Will definitely buy the orginial scent next time.</li>
            <li> Love Hempz lotion. This was a new fragrance for me. It&#x27;s nice, but I will stick with the original it&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
            <li> I love it!  It has helped me keep my tan longer and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Its really good with the lotion part, but the smell of it is REALLY strong! I would probably choose a different one with a strong scent you can handle like a mint lotion or something, idk</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but smells amazing</li>
            <li> Lovely!  My husband and I only use Hempz lotion and this fragrance is wonderful.  He prefers the original scent but I like them all.</li>
            <li> Love Hempz lotion original and pomegranate, but this scent is just awful.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Love their lotions!</li>
            <li> Smells so good going on! But the scent lasts for like five minutes! I wish it lasted longer! 😊 but my hubby loves the smell so I put it on before bed 😏</li>
            <li> daughter in law loves it</li>
            <li> Smells like sugary fruit loops and it did not provide any extra relief to my muscles</li>
            <li> Girls...talk about teenage dream smell!! The smell of this product is very sweet and to die for. After setting into the skin it is faint and lovely. The lotion locks in and hydrated gently. I have extremely sensitive skin and am able to use this lotion at any time of day and part of skin and not have side effects. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome feels awesome. Doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time  Love it  the other ones are good to different sent</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and moisturizes even more amazingly than it smells! I will definitely be ordering more when my bottle is empty (which doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to take long)!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. Very fresh.</li>
            <li> Smells great love it.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious scent and goes on non-greasy but leaves skin very well moisturized.  I don&#x27;t always use a lotion but now that I&#x27;ve tried this one I have to say I like to use it everyday because of how it makes my skin feel and smell.  It&#x27;s scent is truly heavenly!</li>
            <li> Love this brand of lotion! This fragrance was good, but not my favorite. Does smell clean and fresh</li>
            <li> Very pleased with item, shipping is fast.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, great price.</li>
            <li> Love the Hempz products.  This one smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My family and I have used Hempz Lotion for over a year now and its amazing. First off its smells delicious. Second they have multiple scents for all types of consumers. Doesnt leave a oily residue. Rejuvenates and hydrates very well.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizing without feeling greasy. The fragrance is soooo good.....fresh and light but long lasting. This is my 4th bottle and still love it</li>
            <li> Just what I had ordered. Great for my skin, especially when I have been out in the sun alot. It has an okay smell. Arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I use it straight out from the shower and its a really good lotion to use. Not greasy at all, and a great smell!</li>
            <li> This lotion is fast absorbing and lasts all day.  Really hydrates the skin and leaves it feeling fully nourishing.  Has a wonderful clean fresh smell that&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfumes</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and feels great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful it&#x27;s smells like throw up if u buy this u going to be sad it&#x27;s awful smell no way I will never buy this again</li>
            <li> Best after tan moisturizer out there. Highly recommend. Leaves skin beautiful without the oily after math of a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I like the original scent of this  lotion very much  and I am a huge coconut fan so i thought i would love this scent, but it is just kind of weird. Not really coconut and not really watermelon - just sort of odd and artificial.  Go with the original scent and you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like summertime!!! It makes me feel like I&#x27;m on vacation when I have it on.  It&#x27;s wonderful and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good to me, it was just unpleasant, so I ended up not using it. Does not smell like coconut at all to me.</li>
            <li> Felt that it smelled more like a white melon and cucumber, than watermelon. Returned product.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and feels great! I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other scents. I am really happy with this product and my skin is just loving it. It isn&#x27;t heavy and absorbs into the skin really nice without any stickiness afterwards. Going to order more soon for sure!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing!  It&#x27;s one of my favorite lotions.  Plus, it is a great deal!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try HEMPZ lotion. This watermelon and coconut smells so good and leaves my skin so soft. It&#x27;s so light and moisturizing that I use it on my face , it&#x27;s been 2 weeks and so far it hasn&#x27;t made me break out. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love the product, however when I ordered I just didn&#x27;t notice the scent (not a coconut fan). My mistake. Otherwise the product works great. Will order again in a different scent</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  Getting ready to order more.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing. My husband loves it and he never says anything about my products. It moisturizes beautifully and it&#x27;s nice not to itch or get the &amp;#34;fidgets&amp;#34;. Anyone that can&#x27;t have gluten in their lives know what I am saying. Great product!</li>
            <li> I usually love this brand lotion. This one isnt appealing to me at all. Kind of repulsive-in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Hempz is my very favorite lotion and the only place I can find it locally is Ulta and it&#x27;s pretty expensive.  I was excited to find this particular scent on Amazon and even with shipping it was still more than half off what I would have paid at the store.  The coconut watermelon scent is absolutely amazing and the lotion has a great texture and not greasy as some lotions can be.  I will definitely be buying more of this and can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other scents they have.</li>
            <li> Awesome......coconut lotion and oil....so great for your body and feet</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you give it a try. I rarely give out 5 stars for anything and I&#x27;m a avid review reader and I try to review everything I buy on here. My whole family and wife&#x27;s family have all switched to this brand lotion. The coconut is My wife&#x27;s favorite and I like the hempz triple moisture.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells beyond delicious and reminds me so much of summer time!  Its a great lotion, too.  My skin feels dreamy afterwards.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the Hempz brand  Not to thrilled with this scent</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing. It smells like summer and makes your skin very shiny and soft. I would definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I can&#x27;t find my favorite hemp oil lotion by Malibu - the mojito scented one. This brand is not thick like malibu. Seems weak and watery. But it does smell good, like everyone else has said!</li>
            <li> Feels awesome on skin. I love anything with watermelon scent, but was not impressed with this. I will continue to buy Hempz products but never again in this scent. Kinda has an old, musty smell.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best.  And it really smells nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s normal bc it&#x27;s vegan but it&#x27;s runnier than normal lotion. It&#x27;s fine I just need to make sure that&#x27;s normal. The smell is good but I&#x27;m not 100% use to it yet. It&#x27;s different</li>
            <li> Love this brand of lotion. The aroma is awesome!</li>
            <li> Boyfriend told me it smelled like butter. Otherwise great lotion.</li>
            <li> Love Hemphill didn&#x27;t love the flavor</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t liek the coconut smell but love the lotion.</li>
            <li> Wonderful light and summery scent that makes your skin feel like silk! This is a definite must for those of you that can&#x27;t deal with flowery scents....I love this!</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Smells great and keeps the no-see-ums away.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the same product. Smells oily and scent doesn&#x27;t last very Kong.</li>
            <li> it make my skin silky. Very good product.</li>
            <li> You will never find a lotion that smells better than this</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t care for this particular scent. Lotion is great tho.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great I have used it for a long time and it really works in winter time it gets really cold and this is the only thing that helps my skin</li>
            <li> Came super fast and I love this lotion. Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> The bottle I ordered came with a faulty pump. Luckily I had one from the previous bottle I used. Love, love, love Hempz lotion. This is the first time I am using this particular scent...and I must say, I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Smells nice. A friend got me to try some in my hair, and it works quite nicely actually.</li>
            <li> entire family addicted to this lotion all scents are great not sticky slimy or overpowering smell</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and I love it. I like most Hempz smells and this one did not disappoint. It has a mostly coconut smell with a bit of melon in it. I don&#x27;t like really heavy fragrances because they give me headaches, and this one is not too heavy or overpowering. The lotion also absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy feeling. My husband even uses it.</li>
            <li> The scent of the lotion actually smells rancid. Like it is old !  Not happy with the coconut at all !!! ...and I purchased 2. Any suggestions as to what I can do...can it be returned ?</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff  ever!!  Smells fantastic and made my skin so smooth and soft!!  I am on my second bottle and have even bought one for my daughter.  Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> the stuff is really good. it smells awesome and doesnt leave an oily after feel. the only problem i hat with it was that it was a knock off and not truly hempz lotion as i could tell because the bottle was different than all i have ordered before.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! The smell is a little strong at first but doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I buy now, and the price on Amazon is absolutely rock-bottom. This same bottle retails for more than double in stores. I&#x27;m delighted!!</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is absolutely amazing! I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> Not so crazy about the scent.  The other scented products of HEMPZ are better</li>
            <li> This smells AMAZING &amp; is very moisturizing without being greasy. It soaks in very fast &amp; leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Smells Yummy!&lt;br /&gt;Feels good all over!&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes!</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for product that smells good. This product does just that and it&#x27;s super hydrating. I will def repurchase this product!</li>
            <li> Nice product. I have always loved the nice feel of this lotion but found this scent a little disappointing. It does not smell at all like coconut but if you really like watermelon this will be good for you. I prefer the original scent more.</li>
            <li> love the thickness of product and fragrances are great...going to buy original and more age defying soon. works very well</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Hempz always delivers and this is a nice summery scent!</li>
            <li> The lotion is exactly what I expected...I love the lotion. BUT the top was opened on the package and the pump doesn&#x27;t work. The lotion had leaked out a little from the top - which wasn&#x27;t a huge deal - more of an annoyance. The really disappointing part is that the pump won&#x27;t dispense the lotion. So, now I&#x27;ve gotta find a pump for a brand new bottle of lotion...that should have been closed properly in the first place, but wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to see my package come in with my favorite lotion but I was so sad it had broken and so much got wasted.</li>
            <li> Why the hell does this lotion get such good reviews? Not sure if I got a fake or what, but it smelled horrible (like a cheap fruity perfume) which was so overwhelming I threw the whole thing right in the garbage. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this - head to Duane Reade and puck up their coconut aloe after sun lotion. You&#x27;ll thank me later.</li>
            <li> What a Yummy smell. It is a very good product. It leaves your skin very soft &amp; smooth. It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Seems like a fake watered down product. Nothing like the other bottle I received.</li>
            <li> This coconut and watermelon scented lotion smells amazing.  The lotion is also very moisturizing....but seriously, the scent is just fantastic...so fresh and clean.  Love it.  It&#x27;s also vegan and paraben free which is great.</li>
            <li> Did not like the scent as much as thought I would.</li>
            <li> Super happy with product</li>
            <li> Smells delightful wish it was free delivery .</li>
            <li> Love the scent, lotion sinks in fast - a light lotion, not heavy or greasy.  Did sting a bit if you get in eyes, so unless you get unscented, this will most often be the case.</li>
            <li> feels so good on your skin and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Super rich creamy lotion, especially for my feet which is what I used it for, great scent....I&#x27;ll be buying pomegranate soon.</li>
            <li> I love all the Hempz products, and since this one of the newer items in their product line I had to try it, and it was awesome.  Love the smell of coconuts and the watermelon just adds that cooling sensation, great for after tanning, and a pedicure</li>
            <li> Smells great and not greasy. I hate greasy lotion! my dogs like it too, They must think I&#x27;m a sweet treat for hot summer days!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I am a guy and live in a dry climate and hands\arms\elbows are always dry in the fall\winter. I put this on my desk and use if when I get into the office. A little dab is all you need. The selling point for me is it is a light-weight lotion and absorbs within a few minutes without leaving a residue. The scent is also light and pleasant - not too girly, not too &#x27;Old Spice&#x27; guy. Co-workers in surrounding cubicles won&#x27;t be overwhelmed by the scent. In fact, once they find it on your desk, everyone will want to start using it.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was sure that I would love this lotion. I absolutely love the smell of coconut and watermelon. I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this combo, and the reviewers who said it smelled badly just didn&#x27;t have a love for those two scents like I do. I can&#x27;t really put my finger on exactly what it smells like, but it&#x27;s not coconuts or watermelon! When I smelled it out of the bottle at first whiff I thought it smelled pretty good. Some people said it smelled cheap, but I don&#x27;t think so. This scent isn&#x27;t a difference between a cheap or more expensive scent. There&#x27;s another fragrance in this besides coconut, and watermelon. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good. You have a slight scent of the coconut &amp; watermelon, which you can smell, but it&#x27;s mixed with something else that&#x27;s overpowering it. After wearing this for a couple days I&#x27;ve noticed my clothing I take off before bed doesn&#x27;t smell good. It&#x27;s just a very odd scent that I&#x27;m not fond of. I gave it 2stars bc I love the actual HEMP lotion. Yes, the smell is bad enough in my opinion to deduct 3stars!  So, I would probably buy this again, but NOT in this scent.</li>
            <li> Bummed out that it smells so nasty. Like a bad lotion that you get for free with a drug store cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the way it makes my skin feel, just love it!  It&#x27;s one if those lotions you still get a whiff of after hours in the ER, LOL, gotta appreciate that!</li>
            <li> The fresh coconut &amp; watermelon smell is amazing &amp; the lotion is very moisturizing!  I think this will be a perfect summer lotion.</li>
            <li> I love hempz brand however this is not their best sent, It makes me feel like I smell almost mildewy...</li>
            <li> Lotion feels great but the smell of this scent upsets my stomach.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT. Smells so good and leaves your skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Someone wrote this smelled Manly smelling&amp;#34;.....what planet do they live on? Don&#x27;t listen to this comment. This scent smells like fresh coconut and watermelon as it states. Makes you feel like you just walked out of a spa on a tropical vacation :D : D</li>
            <li> i LOVEEEEE this smell!</li>
            <li> Stick with the original. The others seem watered down. Like this one.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good! I love it. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave the heavy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, these are two scents that should have never been combined.  I like the Hempz line and my absolute favorites are the Citrus Blossom and the Triple Whipped.  This one just didn&#x27;t strike my fancy.  I tried it about 4 times and each time hated it more and more.  Needless to say I have about 3/4 of a bottle that will be thrown away....sigh.  Performance is as good as I&#x27;ve come to expect from Hempz, though not my first choice, but considering the price and availability, it is my go-to for daily moisturizing and skin smoother.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing. I started using it 15 to 20 years ago after going into the tanning salon but probably started using it on an everyday basis for the last 10-15 years. It keeps my skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light smell.  Light weight, but very mositurizing.</li>
            <li> Smells like a dirty dish rag!</li>
            <li> Awesome and smells great!!!</li>
            <li> I love Hempz.  It is the ONLY lotion I use.  This new scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the hands-down most amazing smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It&#x27;s sweet and watermelony, with just a little bit of coconut and floral scents. Perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> great price and I love this lotion</li>
            <li> delivery was super fast. product was exactly as described. the smell of it took some getting use to, but now i  like it, but at first i didn&#x27;t, but this was not the sellers fault.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Awesome smells great and works amazingly</li>
            <li> This is my favorite smell of all lotions that I ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, but I can use this for my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;Love it !!</li>
            <li> The smell is overwhelming! I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get use to it. I&#x27;d hate to throw the whole thing away. It&#x27;s very perfumey. I would recommend not getting this. It does moisturize though, hence the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This stuff is delicious. I LOVE the smell. It is a little fruity and minty at the same time. Very soft skin to follow after use. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! So good!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Excellent price.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this lotion! It is perfect for the summer, it has a great scent. Will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Great product, no matter which &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; you buy. I like them all.</li>
            <li> Made my dry skin burn when I applied it.  Smells great though.</li>
            <li> The scent is kinda &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smelling.  Love the Hempz products just not thrilled at the scent.  Will try other scents.</li>
            <li> Although I did get complimented on the scent, I was not a big fan. It may smell better once it mixes with your body chemistry but I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The other products for moisturising pale in comparison. This product is awesome, smells great , and no more dry skin. I love it , can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome great smell, great pricefast delivery thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on so smooth. Does not feel greasy at all. The pump bottle is a big plus. The smell isn&#x27;t as great as I would have hoped, but it doesn&#x27;t stink. Even though the smell isn&#x27;t that great, I would still recommend it as a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The product is great but the packaging wasn&#x27;t, the bottle split in shipment &amp; we lost some lotion. I order lots off of Amazon and that almost never happens so that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> the best wont use nothing else</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft, but  not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> This item seem to be watered down. It is normally a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this.</li>
            <li> I buy this religiously. I love coconut products, so good for your hair and skin. This lotion smells great, and works fantastic. I love this.</li>
            <li> I love coconut scent and watermelon scent - how could I go wrong buying this lotion?? After not being able to figure out what smelled funny (like pee or something) for a few days - I realized it was the lotion. Gave it away to someone and told them not to wear it around me.</li>
            <li> Simply the best combination of fragrances!  Same silkily feel, great new scent!  Makes for a perfect combination that is perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> I loved the product  but  did not like the scent  I got the original  and though I would like this</li>
            <li> I love hempz lotion but this one smells so strange! Like when you leave a load of laundry in the washing machine too long.</li>
            <li> Great Great Summer Smell!</li>
            <li> Wow smells great skin never felt so good</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion, because I needed a good deep moisturizer to use after tanning in a tanning bed. I received it only a couple days after ordering, which was totally awesome, and it was carefully packaged and in perfect condition (no lotion on the bottle, no broken pump). It has an odd fruity smell, but is still enjoyable, more watermelon than coconut. I have used it everyday after tanning, and my skin has never felt so healthy! It&#x27;s so smooth and hydrated, I love this lotion! A definite must for anyone who tans or has dry skin, a definite must for everyone! Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who has had very dry skin for a long time.  Not only does it smell amazing but it is the first cream to actually help his skin.  Will definitely be buying again and again</li>
            <li> This lotion is amAzing!! My favorite scent so far and it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Worth the price. Although, I bought if from this person &amp;#34;sunless deals&amp;#34; and you sent me it broken. Still waiting to get my money back for shipping... Good lotion though.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love this product with no complaint, but it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin at all. Not even if I&#x27;d moisturized after a showerand just used this before leaving home. I am absolutely obsessed with the smell-- it is perfecttttt. Just wish it actually moisturized :(</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It makes my skin so soft and it smells amazing! Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> Love it but the pump dont work but I am keeping it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really smell very much of the coconut but I really smell the watermelon! It also does not seem as thick as the original or age defying moisturizers. I would buy again, but for use in the summer time.</li>
            <li> this is the best lotion i love the smell its light and refreshing. great summer scent!</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell yummy and tropical, but it stinks! I definitely don&#x27;t feel like I should be drinking and umbrella cocktail! I won&#x27;t be purchasing this flavor again!</li>
            <li> This company makes very nice moisturizers.  It feels great after being in a chlorinated pool as well as when you get out of a sun booth.  If you are older and your skin gets dry, and drier, you can use this over and over again without looking slippery.  It is a very pleasant feel without feeling greasy. They say it maintains a tan, it might help, but I&#x27;m getting tanner all the time.</li>
            <li> I love the pomegranate and thought I would try this one.  I had to give it two stars because the smell is over powering.  I can&#x27;t give it away.  The lotion itself is great and makes my skin feel very smooth.  I highly recommend the pomegranate but this one smells terrible.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves the Hempz product line. I get huge brownie points went I order her a bottle or two. She says she loves how this lotion makes her skin feel. Me too :-)</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Simply GREAT lotion - lasts/smells great/reasonable $ !!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product came fast, and smelled so great! It makes my dkin so soft, would reccomend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love his brand but this scent is horrible, coconut and watermelon. The citrus scent is amazing though!</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time! Product smells amazing!! Will be using product later tonight!! As of now, I&#x27;ll be purchasing again :)</li>
            <li> On time and as described! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly..nice summertime smell</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this so bad!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is second to none.  Lightweight, dries fast, leaves skin feeling nourished.  Not a single complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;The scent is VERY fruity and sweet which makes me think it smells inexpensive, like Bath &amp; Body Works stuff.  The scent also has staying power for roughly 3 hours.  I would like it better if it had an herbal note to cut the sweet notes.  Maybe something a little more Jo Malone-ish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again in another scent but I hope they consider adding some more sophisticated blends because the moisturizer is excellent,</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and I love the smell of this lotion. It is very moisturing.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and smells like fresh coconut.</li>
            <li> It was watered down and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> always purchase. love it</li>
            <li> Great product. Nice and creamy just what is needed during this cold drying weather. I love the scent.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing. It does not leave your skin an oily mess like others. Also you can&#x27;t beat that it is cruelty free. The price is very decent i have had the same bottle for two months and use it everyday for my whole body and haven&#x27;t made it half way threw it.  The sent is sweet and can be smelled threw clothing. Great for people who go tanning it moisturizes without removing any bronzing agents  . I love this product and the company</li>
            <li> Best lotion. I have very dry skin and this lasts all day and it smells delightful</li>
            <li> the scent is ok, nothing to really write home about. I find that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other scents (because its winter maybe), it may be better for the summer months instead.</li>
            <li> smells so good, very smooth but not overly oily. It lasts a long time when applied.</li>
            <li> This scent is horrible!! Strong, overpowering and artificial smelling!! So bummed out... I love this brand, but this scent really is plain terrible... Want to send it back but not worth the aggravation and cost!!</li>
