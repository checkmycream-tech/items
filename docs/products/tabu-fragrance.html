            <li>The Tabu dusting powder I ordered for my Mom was perfect.  </li>
            <li>The perfect gift!</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is the scent my mother favored and now so do I -  for dusting powder and to freshen my underwear drawer.</li>
            <li>Great buying experience.  </li>
            <li>Everyone thinks I smell great.  </li>
            <li>Great item</li>
            <li>Good gift, great service, and will be purchased again.</li>
            <li>The talc quality is good.</li>
            <li>So I decided to look on Amazon, and of course, found some at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>She loved it</li>
            <li>love the powder after a shower!</li>
            <li>I have used and liked Tabu Dusting Powder for years.</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent, sheer powder, a great compliment to any woman&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li>My mother was thrilled to receive her Tabu.</li>
            <li>It was a strong scent for a 13 year-old but a good one.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was the only place I could find this wonderful TABU dusting powder.</li>
            <li>Once you use it, and slip into your favorite gown, you&#x27;ll feel like a million bucks.  </li>
            <li>My favorite smell for sure.</li>
            <li>I will be giving more of this flavor.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, she is happy.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want.  </li>
            <li>I love Tabu.  </li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s the best dusting you can have.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Glad someone still sells it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t find many women wearing it these days, but I like it.</li>
            <li>I love Tabu.</li>
            <li>Now, every time I smell the Tabu scent I am immediately transported back to my unforgettable trip across the Atlantic.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted to find an item that is important to her but unvailable through local channels</li>
            <li>/&gt;The powder is true to the perfume.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, got it in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Item well packaged, just as described, quick and easy transaction and really fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel cool and pampered after a shower at the end of a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>It is getting harder to find every year at a good price.</li>
            <li>Certainly not dusted off by the supplier - the product was promptly shipped and I received it in good order.  </li>
            <li>So glad to finally find Tabu for my mom.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Also, as a grown woman, I don&#x27;t want to smell like a baby and Tabu Dusting Powder certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like baby powder.</li>
            <li>This is an item that my elderly mother wanted and is no longer available locally.  </li>
            <li>Rushed to Amazon to get as much as I could before it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li>My 89 year old Mom loves this powder!!!  </li>
            <li>An old fashioned powder puff to pat this Tabu dusting powder in all the right places.  </li>
            <li>Such fun!</li>
            <li>Of all the dusting powders I have ever used, Tabu is by far the best for several reasons: It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy, \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; odor; it comes in an attractive container; it&#x27;s not as expensive as other brand-name powders.</li>
            <li>It is a heavy perfume smell and probably used better in Fall and Winter</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as I remember it being the last time I purchased it .</li>
            <li>This stuff is very hard to find and my elderly mother-in-law was absolutely thrilled when I found it for her.</li>
            <li>Tabu is an old perfume, but it is still up-to-date.  </li>
            <li>This sent takes me back to my high school days.</li>
            <li>Just as expected and fast shipping.</li>

            <li> Tabu is an old perfume, but it is still up-to-date.  If you like your scent to smell like spice.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is true to the perfume.  It is a heavy perfume smell and probably used better in Fall and Winter</li>
            <li> Great buying experience.  Item well packaged, just as described, quick and easy transaction and really fast delivery.  What more could you want.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love Tabu.  Everyone thinks I smell great.  When I heard they were possibly discontinuing the bath powder, I was devastated.  Rushed to Amazon to get as much as I could before it&#x27;s gone.</li>

            <li> I was given a bottle of Tabu perfume years ago when I was 13.  It was a strong scent for a 13 year-old but a good one.  The reason for the gift was a going away gift because I was going on a voyage: a trip on an ocean liner to Sweden.  Now, every time I smell the Tabu scent I am immediately transported back to my unforgettable trip across the Atlantic.  I love Tabu.</li>
