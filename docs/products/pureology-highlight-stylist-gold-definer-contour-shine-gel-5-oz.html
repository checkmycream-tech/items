            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>A must try for anyone who wants their hair to look great!</li>
            <li>It does kind of bring out the blondness of your hair and adds a lot of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works great on my curls and gives great highlights.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it promises, nice hold, beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>Love how my highlights shine</li>
            <li>All  Pureology products are safe for keratin treated hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that really controls unruly curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist gave me this product to try and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like gel shine, not a shine straightner.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>It tames most of my frizz too.</li>
            <li>The combo had been amazing for great blowouts with my keratin treated no naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love the golden highlights as well</li>
            <li>I use this product along with Global Keratin Hair taming system to create an awesome mix for styling/blowing out my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>the highlights and low lights are all more prominent.  </li>
            <li>Seem to hold up well in high humidity for most of the day.</li>
            <li>It is also nice because like all pureology products it does not create buildup so you can re-wet it the next day (or even add a little more) and it looks just as good.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite pureology product for summer.</li>
            <li>The small sizes are great for travel.</li>
            <li>Just need to use a little hair spray after and good to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty lackluster.</li>
            <li>Good for my hair and does not make your scalp itchy and hair heavy.  </li>
            <li>It helps hair really hold a style, whether by just blow drying or using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Very Thick, causing it to make my hair &amp;#34;stick together&amp;#34;, after mixing with another brand of algon oil, it is VERY nice to use.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will keep buying from Amazon, half the cost of the salon!</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, color treated hair (light brown) and am always searching for a product that will add thickness and volume to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and this actually manages to give good hold and volume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other problems I encountered with this was after the first few hours of using this, my hair started catching and clinging to other strands which gave the sensation of split ends when I&#x27;d run my fingers through it</li>
            <li>Just a small amount give my highlighted hair body and better manageability.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy and helps my fine hair behave without stiffness or gunk.</li>
            <li>Even if I find my Pureology products slightly cheaper elsewhere in the future, I will still order from this seller with the knowledge that not only will I be getting a quality product at an excellent price, but they stand behind your purchases.</li>
            <li>Have Colored Blond Hair which is very fine and thin .</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon.com is much lower than other sites or stores</li>
            <li>I needed something that I could just put in right out of the shower and allow to air dry without turning into a frizzy mess.  </li>

            <li> The thickness and volume it adds is quite dramatic on my fine hair and my hair never feels sticky.  </li>
            <li> and I only need one to two pumps, so a bottle will last a very long time, even with daily use.  </li>
            <li> Originally I had posted negative feedback due to the condition of the product delivered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to apply to your hair, a pain to style with, and gave minimal good results but plenty of bad ones.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous for thin, stringy highlighted hair!</li>
            <li> I used a teeny amount of product for my thick, semi-coarse hair, keeping it off my roots, and blow-dried it straight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and crunchy like other gels do, it leaves my hair soft and manageable!  </li>
            <li> The next day my hair was oily, limp, and just flat.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s got a really sticky texture which made it really hard to get my round boar bristle brush through my hair without getting my hair stuck or tangled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the only I can use for my hair to keep it tame -</li>
            <li> Made my hair greasy and limp.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky on the hair.</li>
            <li> biggest issue with it is how heavy it is.</li>
            <li> I usually get 3-4 days before needing to shampoo again.</li>
            <li> I am lazy, I don&#x27;t like styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> Much less expensive than my hairdresser&#x27;s price, so I buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this was just really disappointing.</li>

            <li> Nice product. Not too heavy and helps my fine hair behave without stiffness or gunk. I use it daily along with the Luminator in the same line. Much less expensive than my hairdresser&#x27;s price, so I buy it on Amazon. The small sizes are great for travel.</li>
            <li> Love how my highlights shine</li>
            <li> I use this product along with Global Keratin Hair taming system to create an awesome mix for styling/blowing out my naturally curly hair. All  Pureology products are safe for keratin treated hair. This is a great product that really controls unruly curly hair. Pair with the GK heat protectant for styling. The combo had been amazing for great blowouts with my keratin treated no naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great for definition. I love the golden highlights as well</li>
            <li> Have Colored Blond Hair which is very fine and thin . This product does a very nice job of giving hair lift and hold and some&lt;br /&gt;shine . Just need to use a little hair spray after and good to go. Seem to hold up well in high humidity for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Made my hair greasy and limp.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, color treated hair (light brown) and am always searching for a product that will add thickness and volume to my hair.  This gel is that holy grail hair styling product I&#x27;ve been searching for!!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and crunchy like other gels do, it leaves my hair soft and manageable!  It also seems to bring out the diminsion in my hair - the highlights and low lights are all more prominent.  It helps hair really hold a style, whether by just blow drying or using a curling iron.  The thickness and volume it adds is quite dramatic on my fine hair and my hair never feels sticky.  The price on Amazon.com is much lower than other sites or stores and I only need one to two pumps, so a bottle will last a very long time, even with daily use.  A must try for anyone who wants their hair to look great!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist gave me this product to try and I love it. Just a small amount give my highlighted hair body and better manageability. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky on the hair. I&#x27;m purchasing from Amazon to save the $5 mark-up my hair salon adds.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this from Pureology when they were running the promotions for this and the sea salt spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty lackluster. It does kind of bring out the blondness of your hair and adds a lot of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with it is how heavy it is. I used a teeny amount of product for my thick, semi-coarse hair, keeping it off my roots, and blow-dried it straight. The next day my hair was oily, limp, and just flat. I had to wash my hair two days in a row and that NEVER happens to my hair. I usually get 3-4 days before needing to shampoo again. Personally, I think that&#x27;s unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other problems I encountered with this was after the first few hours of using this, my hair started catching and clinging to other strands which gave the sensation of split ends when I&#x27;d run my fingers through it (you know that static-y, pulling feeling you get when you have them?). Also, it&#x27;s got a really sticky texture which made it really hard to get my round boar bristle brush through my hair without getting my hair stuck or tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this was just really disappointing. It&#x27;s a pain to apply to your hair, a pain to style with, and gave minimal good results but plenty of bad ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like gel shine, not a shine straightner. But it&#x27;s ok I love any pureology products I notice the difference in my hair !</li>
            <li> Good for my hair and does not make your scalp itchy and hair heavy.  I love this product and will keep buying from Amazon, half the cost of the salon!</li>
            <li> Received in good time at great price. Really works great on my curls and gives great highlights. Will purchase again.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite pureology product for summer. I have thick wavy hair and this actually manages to give good hold and volume. It tames most of my frizz too. It is also nice because like all pureology products it does not create buildup so you can re-wet it the next day (or even add a little more) and it looks just as good.</li>
            <li> I already knew that I loved this product as I have been using it &amp; needed more!! It is fabulous for thin, stringy highlighted hair! Originally I had posted negative feedback due to the condition of the product delivered. I believe it was NOT the fault of the seller, however either way, gel was frozen solid.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, within 24 hours the seller contacted me to rectify the matter. This type of service has now made me a &amp;#34;loyal&amp;#34; customer.  Even if I find my Pureology products slightly cheaper elsewhere in the future, I will still order from this seller with the knowledge that not only will I be getting a quality product at an excellent price, but they stand behind your purchases.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it promises, nice hold, beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is the only I can use for my hair to keep it tame - I am lazy, I don&#x27;t like styling my hair.  I needed something that I could just put in right out of the shower and allow to air dry without turning into a frizzy mess.  This product does the trick for me, it is liquid gold for my hair!</li>
            <li> Very Thick, causing it to make my hair &amp;#34;stick together&amp;#34;, after mixing with another brand of algon oil, it is VERY nice to use.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it&#x27;s a very good hair product.</li>
