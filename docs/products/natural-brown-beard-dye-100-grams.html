    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Followed directions perfectly.  </li>
            <li>is the best way I can describe</li>
            <li>Worked perfect.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great compared to Just for men.  </li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>it was on my face, I thought oh great</li>
            <li>Great value.  </li>
            <li>Also, the dye has to be re-applied about every 2weeks to  maintain good color for the remainder of the beard.</li>
            <li>but the results are good and no chemical burns, rashes, or reactions.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and didn&#x27;t get good results.  </li>
            <li>My wife understands why I&#x27;m using this dye, but she doesn&#x27;t think it looks as good as JFM when it&#x27;s all said</li>
            <li>Anything is better than gray!</li>
            <li>MUCH better than Just for Men !  </li>
            <li>Take your time and this product works nicely.</li>
            <li>kind of a musty, swampy smell.</li>
            <li>You can get a BUNCH more use out of a package than the JFM which I could never seem to get more than 2 or 3 uses out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product smelled OK during the hour you leave it on.  </li>
            <li>OK, the package says it will darken overnight to brown.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;JFM might be easier and better coverage</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will probably be using this forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most hair dyes</li>
            <li>Make sure you watch the youtube video.</li>
            <li>I think with continued use I will get the tone more brownish, and I won&#x27;t be getting those scalp pimples anymore from all those toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>The dye itself works OK.</li>
            <li>( much more bearable than chemical smells) and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the ease and consistent quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>So feel free to take this review with a dose of salt.</li>
            <li>Cleaning your beard / hair is important and using a sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>On my mostly gray areas, &amp;#34;Brown&amp;#34; comes out noticeably more red than most people would think of brown.</li>
            <li>Do not use soap to clean it out.  </li>
            <li>That way, you can get clean and leave this stuff untouched by soap ( as I suspect I got soap on parts of the areas</li>
            <li>It makes me feel good not only about the cost savings, but that I am not contaminating the water supply.</li>
            <li>Works good - but have to apply weekly as it turns into a reddish tint.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely reorder as I am allergic to the components in Just&lt;br /&gt;For Men.</li>
            <li>Actually they recommend brushing TWICE for good measure.</li>
            <li>Considering that it takes more than an hour for the application, for me using one of the peroxide dyes ( like Just-For-Men) that takes only 5min is more convenient.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful hair coloring product: it applies well, sets in under an hour, makes my hair shiny, soft and manageable, and -- most importantly for me -- covers my grey hair until the grey becomes visible by growing out.  </li>
            <li>,.. I threw the remainder out wasn&#x27;t worth it ...</li>
            <li>and i can see improvement right away</li>
            <li>I started using it because, like most people, I was having major skin irritation problems with Just for Men.</li>
            <li>the only down sides are waiting an hour and some may not find the smell very pleasant but to me its well worth it compared to the itching and burning the chemical dyes</li>
            <li>However, when I shampoo three times before applying the henna, the resulting hair color is beautiful everywhere and very long lasting.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that has suffered with JFM,while Henna Hut Natural brown beard dyeing process takes 20x longer than JFM in my opinion its 20x better.</li>
            <li>First:</li>
            <li>Wife says that I look like a chia pet when I first put this on and before washing it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dye is only okay.</li>
            <li>the first thing I felt was NOTHING...</li>
            <li>My beard actually felt better not brittle like JFM made it</li>
            <li>I applied it the first time).</li>
            <li>This is my first experience using Henna.</li>
            <li>so it covers the hair completely during application, but the tips of the hair still end up looking too light compared to the hair underneath.</li>
            <li>Henna will only color very clean hair.  </li>
            <li>If I only shampoo my hair twice before applying the henna, the color doesn&#x27;t take very well in the more oily areas.  </li>
            <li>I could tell the difference right away, but it actually got better as time passed, the color looked very natural</li>
            <li>Mix enough product with strong hot coffee and a couple of drops of apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>I was really reluctant to use the product.  </li>
            <li>I was really, really reluctant.  </li>
            <li>I tried 50:50 one time and it was too much indigo and had a bit of a purple tint.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned my face as described on the directions I started applying, I covered my whole beard</li>
            <li>Absolutely it did</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t seem to color the very tips of the hair.</li>
            <li>But second, I&#x27;m surprised that there isn&#x27;t more mention of the color issue in the reviews.</li>
            <li>It was lighter brown that I had hoped, but it was better than my natural Grey color.  </li>
            <li>The match with the surrounding dark hair was good enough that it serves the purpose</li>
            <li>Not necessarily bad, just different.  </li>
            <li>and i am very happy with it , i made the switch from the JFM chemical dyes because they started to make my face itch like crazy and burn , The Henna powder is easy to mix up just add a bit of water and stir til you get the right consistency it says like yogurt, then i apply a thick coat of it to my hair and beard wait an hour rinse</li>
            <li>I used strong, hot coffee instead of tap water and a few drops of apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li>my instructions: Clean beard with soap and toothbrush, towel dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just such a shame that someone can&#x27;t come up with a quick, lasting, color-accurate product that can really rival JFM.</li>
            <li>It took me a few application attempts to realize that it is essential first to wash the hair (preferably with a Henna Hut shampoo) until it is completely oil free and squeaky-clean.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions carefully, washing my beard before hand etc., but my beard only got yellow and very light brown.</li>
            <li>After all, anyone using this product wants their gray or white hair brown.</li>
            <li>For me, so far, this misses the mark.</li>
            <li>I found Henna Hut Natural brown beard dye</li>
            <li>Hut Natural brown beard dye is a powder (greenish color) that you mix with tap water to make a yogurt like consistency</li>
            <li>and then I felt absolutely nothing for the entire time</li>
            <li>and it makes your beard and hair feel soft-</li>
            <li>more so I forced myself to go through this self-punishing ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take a complete shower, wash your hair and beard first THEN towel dry and apply this product!</li>
            <li>I left it on my beard for a little over an hour, having it on my face kind of reminded me of a mud mask after a while the product starts to dry like mud.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover the grey ends of my beard very well.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>but by the morning the color has really started to come out and is now noticeably darker , i only have a bit of grey on the temples of my head and the goatee area of my beard</li>
            <li>Not allergy or reactions at all, same natural look.</li>
            <li>and at first my beard hair appears to have a greenish tint, but within a few hours after removing the product it darkens to a natural looking brown.</li>
            <li>, the smell is nowhere near as bad as described in some other reviews I read, it does have a smell but not bad at all, kind of an earthy smell</li>
            <li>Some other comments seem to indicate that the dark brown (which seems in short supply, if available at all) tends toward the blue/green end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li>The feeling was a little tingly the first minute</li>
            <li>I mix this with hot coffee and a few drops of vinegar as one writer suggested.  </li>
            <li>product is easy to mix up and apply and is much less messy than chemical applications.</li>
            <li>This Henna Dye is much much cheaper, and there is less irritation when using.</li>
            <li>is a good product for me, a little burn while waiting an hour and a half, but I might have scrubbed too hard with the tooth brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to not move around much during the hour you have it on or you end up dropping little bits of Henna dye goop.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t get it quite thick enough or use enough.  </li>
            <li> it was a little messy, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I used this to dye my hair and it made my hair very thick full of body and shiny.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have to say is the one hour application time which makes applying not real convenient but the results mke it worth it.</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;m applying it to my mustache, it&#x27;s right under my nose and the smell is not pleasant...</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, but I could swear the smell of it makes me a little light-headed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice reddish sheen in the sunlight, which isn&#x27;t bad at all</li>
            <li> Not even remotely the same experience.  </li>
            <li> It lasts as long as the JFM in my experience.  </li>
            <li> After reading the instructions, it says white or gray hairs will turn green, red or blue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who uses this product to color away the grey in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It requires you to carefully brush your beard (I use a toothbrush and soap) prior to applying.</li>
            <li> After being another burn victim of Just for Men beard dyes, I tried this.</li>
            <li> Coat beard with enough product to matt all the hair down.  </li>
            <li> Use enough product to cover and matt the hair down!  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wash with harsh shampoo, it should last awhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did turn my grey green but that turned brown by the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it usually last me 2 to 3 weeks before it starts to get dull again</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is some seriously weird stuff.  Not necessarily bad, just different.  Makes me feel like a hippie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a victim of the &#x27;just for men&#x27; (JFM) curse of horrible itching and a rash that was getting worse as I used it more regularly.  After doing some Googling, I realized others were having much worse reactions than I had, and there was potential it could get worse for me if I continued using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after hours of searching, I found and tried this stuff. Not even remotely the same experience.  There is some earthy smell going on, but not that unpleasant, just very distinctive.  The color wasn&#x27;t as tunable as the tons of shades offered by JFM.  In the end, I had no reaction or irritation to it.  The color did change somewhat overnight (got darker).  It was lighter brown that I had hoped, but it was better than my natural Grey color.  It lasts as long as the JFM in my experience.  The match with the surrounding dark hair was good enough that it serves the purpose and I look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual dying takes a lot longer.  You have to not move around much during the hour you have it on or you end up dropping little bits of Henna dye goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carry it around in a baggie on trips which has worked well.  You can get a BUNCH more use out of a package than the JFM which I could never seem to get more than 2 or 3 uses out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat inconvenient... yes, but I refuse to use the JFM battery acid ever again, and there aren&#x27;t a lot of options.  Take your time and this product works nicely.</li>
            <li> My opinion is that this product is awful.  After reading the instructions, it says white or gray hairs will turn green, red or blue I was really reluctant to use the product.  After all, anyone using this product wants their gray or white hair brown. After opening the package and discovering the product was GREEN I was really, really reluctant.  Anyway, I decided to give it a try.  The product smelled OK during the hour you leave it on.  After I rinsed it after the hour my goatee had a green hue.  OK, the package says it will darken overnight to brown.  How green can turn to brown is a mystery to me.  Well, needless to say, my mustache and goatee had a green hue in the morning.  After two days, it was still green, no brown, so I decided to shave it off and I pitched the remainder of the product.  If you decide to try this product, you have been warned.  Trust me, there is no metamorphosis from green to brown !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t appear as a verified purchaser because I bought this product elsewhere. So feel free to take this review with a dose of salt. First: The big plus is that it won&#x27;t cause the sort of blistering reaction that JFM does. (And if you use JFM and haven&#x27;t encountered that yet, I firmly believe that eventually you will.) But second, I&#x27;m surprised that there isn&#x27;t more mention of the color issue in the reviews. On my mostly gray areas, &amp;#34;Brown&amp;#34; comes out noticeably more red than most people would think of brown. Some other comments seem to indicate that the dark brown (which seems in short supply, if available at all) tends toward the blue/green end of the spectrum. So though I want to try dark brown (if/when I find it) I&#x27;m skeptical. It&#x27;s just such a shame that someone can&#x27;t come up with a quick, lasting, color-accurate product that can really rival JFM. For me, so far, this misses the mark.</li>
            <li> Wife says that I look like a chia pet when I first put this on and before washing it out.&lt;br /&gt;So, I have used this for about a month now and before I started using it, I read all the reviews for tips.  Cleaning your beard / hair is important and using a sulfate free shampoo.  I mix this with hot coffee and a few drops of vinegar as one writer suggested.  I also add about 1/3 indigo to reduce the reddish tint as some have said would occur.  I tried 50:50 one time and it was too much indigo and had a bit of a purple tint.  So keeping to 1:3 ratio is important.&lt;br /&gt;Also, suggest having it in your hair for 60 to 90 minutes before washing out.  Do not use soap to clean it out.  Just take a shower and let the water wash it out.  I did this for multiple days in a row and made a big difference by third application.  For some reason, its not a 100% on my beard but does do well on my hair.  If you don&#x27;t wash with harsh shampoo, it should last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;JFM might be easier and better coverage but I think JFM is dangerous to your health.</li>
            <li> This product works! I used Just For Men for years and kept having reactions to it, it made my skin itch, sometimes hardly noticeable and sometimes extremely irritating. I tried another product that worked without the reactions but had to apply it every day so it was not convenient. This product works well with no reaction and it lasts for several days, also it doesn&#x27;t stain skin or clothes like the others. The only negative I have to say is the one hour application time which makes applying not real convenient but the results mke it worth it.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t last very long. I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and you get enough to apply several times. I&#x27;d say 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> This dye is only okay. It doesn&#x27;t cover the grey ends of my beard very well. Also, the dye has to be re-applied about every 2weeks to  maintain good color for the remainder of the beard. Considering that it takes more than an hour for the application, for me using one of the peroxide dyes ( like Just-For-Men) that takes only 5min is more convenient.</li>
            <li> After being another burn victim of Just for Men beard dyes, I tried this. Yes, it stinks when you put it on, Yes application time is alot longer (45 minutes vs. 5 minutes), but the results are good and no chemical burns, rashes, or reactions. It also lasts longer for me than JFM did. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great compared to Just for men.  Not allergy or reactions at all, same natural look.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it only lasts about four days and has to be redone.</li>
            <li> Not good , won&#x27;t buy again. Color did not grab</li>
            <li> I used this to dye my hair and it made my hair very thick full of body and shiny. I love this stuff and will probably be using this forever.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully, washing my beard before hand etc., but my beard only got yellow and very light brown. I tried it a few times and just gave up. I really wanted it to work but the results were not good for me with my grey beard.</li>
            <li> Turned beard green. Followed directions perfectly.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair coloring product: it applies well, sets in under an hour, makes my hair shiny, soft and manageable, and -- most importantly for me -- covers my grey hair until the grey becomes visible by growing out.  Henna will only color very clean hair.  It took me a few application attempts to realize that it is essential first to wash the hair (preferably with a Henna Hut shampoo) until it is completely oil free and squeaky-clean.  For me, that means shampooing thoroughly three times and rinsing well, and paying particular attention to scrubbing around the hairline at the forehead, temples, and base of scalp.  If I only shampoo my hair twice before applying the henna, the color doesn&#x27;t take very well in the more oily areas.  However, when I shampoo three times before applying the henna, the resulting hair color is beautiful everywhere and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of Henna hair and beard dye for over a year now and i am very happy with it , i made the switch from the JFM chemical dyes because they started to make my face itch like crazy and burn , The Henna powder is easy to mix up just add a bit of water and stir til you get the right consistency it says like yogurt, then i apply a thick coat of it to my hair and beard wait an hour rinse and i can see improvement right away but by the morning the color has really started to come out and is now noticeably darker , i only have a bit of grey on the temples of my head and the goatee area of my beard so it usually last me 2 to 3 weeks before it starts to get dull again the only down sides are waiting an hour and some may not find the smell very pleasant but to me its well worth it compared to the itching and burning the chemical dyes started to give me</li>
            <li> It worked for me.  One star off for the instructions.  I followed the instructions and didn&#x27;t get good results.  My wife uses a similar product for her hair and the instructions suggest some additives and a longer wait time before rinsing.  I used strong, hot coffee instead of tap water and a few drops of apple cider vinegar.  Use enough product to cover and matt the hair down!  The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t get it quite thick enough or use enough.  It did turn my grey green but that turned brown by the morning.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for me, a little burn while waiting an hour and a half, but I might have scrubbed too hard with the tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;So my instructions: Clean beard with soap and toothbrush, towel dry.  Mix enough product with strong hot coffee and a couple of drops of apple cider vinegar. Coat beard with enough product to matt all the hair down.  Leave product in for at least 70 min.  I left mine in for 90 min.  Rinse with hot water then with cold water.  I had no problems with skin staining.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as I continued to have nasty skin reactions to Just for Men. This product works great. I like to leave it on a little longer than suggested (about an hour and a half) and at first my beard hair appears to have a greenish tint, but within a few hours after removing the product it darkens to a natural looking brown. It lasts on my beard about 4-5 days until my hair grows out. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of complements on the results.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work at all the same gray hairs that were there before were the same ones that were there when I washed it out .,.. I threw the remainder out wasn&#x27;t worth it ... I rather use the just for men and put a skin protectant to avoid irritation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who uses this product to color away the grey in my hair.  I&#x27;m allergic to most hair dyes and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the ease and consistent quality of this product.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Make sure you watch the youtube video.</li>
            <li> I used Just for Men for about a year and dreaded re-dyeing because I knew it was going to take several days to recuperate. Just for Men always left my beard feeling brittle and itchy and my face burning I hated it, but being 43 hated all the gray more so I forced myself to go through this self-punishing ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found Henna Hut Natural brown beard dye, I didn&#x27;t even know this stuff existed, I thought I was forever stuck with JFM. I was very skeptical of Henna Hut Natural brown beard dye but decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henna Hut Natural brown beard dye is a powder (greenish color) that you mix with tap water to make a yogurt like consistency once mixed it looks allot like green pea baby food, and somewhat smells like it too, the smell is nowhere near as bad as described in some other reviews I read, it does have a smell but not bad at all, kind of an earthy smell is the best way I can describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned my face as described on the directions I started applying, I covered my whole beard it was a little messy, but not bad. I left it on my beard for a little over an hour, having it on my face kind of reminded me of a mud mask after a while the product starts to dry like mud. The feeling was a little tingly the first minute and then I felt absolutely nothing for the entire time it was on my face, I thought oh great this stuff is not going to work (because with JFM by 3min in my face was burning) so I waited 1hr and 10min and rinsed it off with just water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the product was all washed of and I toweled dried my face, the first thing I felt was NOTHING... No burning... NO Stinging...NO itching. My beard actually felt better not brittle like JFM made it feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to what everyone would like to know did it work? Absolutely it did I could tell the difference right away, but it actually got better as time passed, the color looked very natural I highly recommend this product to anyone that has suffered with JFM,while Henna Hut Natural brown beard dyeing process takes 20x longer than JFM in my opinion its 20x better. I highly recommend this product, and any Just for Men suffers I recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was looking for coupons for &#x27;Just for Men&#x27; or maybe a cheaper way to order online when I stumbled upon this product. When I saw it used henna, I flashed back to Lucille Ball and her well-known use of this herb for her fiery red hair! That it is in brown fascinated me, and also the fact that this product is safer not only for me to use regularly ( seeing how I have lost the battle with gray) but also the environment! Or one hopes, but from research I did, I can&#x27;t find any negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to mix up and apply and is much less messy than chemical applications. Even if you do get it on you, it doesn&#x27;t stain as rapidly as chemicals. I read how you rinse it out only with water and then tried to use soap on my face and rest of body after it &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; for 1 hour. It looks green and smells of spinach ( much more bearable than chemical smells) and rinses out easily. Since my last chemical use was a blondish highlight ( I misread the box) the Henna Hut wasn&#x27;t as dark as I was shooting for. But I learned that it takes a few apps to get it to the color you want, and to leave it on a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I reapplied my second time last night and here&#x27;s my tip: Take a complete shower, wash your hair and beard first THEN towel dry and apply this product! That way, you can get clean and leave this stuff untouched by soap ( as I suspect I got soap on parts of the areas I applied it the first time). Worked perfect. It has a nice reddish sheen in the sunlight, which isn&#x27;t bad at all and it makes your beard and hair feel soft- no odor after rinsing. Anything is better than gray! I think with continued use I will get the tone more brownish, and I won&#x27;t be getting those scalp pimples anymore from all those toxic chemicals. It makes me feel good not only about the cost savings, but that I am not contaminating the water supply. Everyone needs to try this product!</li>
            <li> Great value.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works good - but have to apply weekly as it turns into a reddish tint.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely reorder as I am allergic to the components in Just&lt;br /&gt;For Men.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using Henna. I started using it because, like most people, I was having major skin irritation problems with Just for Men. I&#x27;ve used this product now about 4 times. The dye itself works OK. Although it doesn&#x27;t seem to color the very tips of the hair. I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;caking&amp;#34; very thick so it covers the hair completely during application, but the tips of the hair still end up looking too light compared to the hair underneath. My wife understands why I&#x27;m using this dye, but she doesn&#x27;t think it looks as good as JFM when it&#x27;s all said and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One BIG difference with this product and JFM is the amount of time it takes to apply. JFM takes about 5 minutes. This product takes over an hour by the time the process is all done. It requires you to carefully brush your beard (I use a toothbrush and soap) prior to applying. Actually they recommend brushing TWICE for good measure. Then you&#x27;re supposed to CAKE it on thick to cover all the hair...and then wait for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t that big a deal if it didn&#x27;t smell so bad. But since I&#x27;m applying it to my mustache, it&#x27;s right under my nose and the smell is not pleasant...kind of a musty, swampy smell. Maybe I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, but I could swear the smell of it makes me a little light-headed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably try a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> MUCH better than Just for Men !  So far, I like this product - Not as irritating as Just for Men.  I had been using JFM for years, and developed a bad allergy / bad reaction to the product recently, and it only lasted 1 week - 10 days !  This Henna Dye is much much cheaper, and there is less irritation when using.</li>
