            <li>So refreshing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Love the skin effects it has....</li>
            <li>firmness, skin tone, all better since I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Love this spray,</li>
            <li>This product was so much more affordable than finding in my health food store, a regional business.  </li>
            <li>(Especially great when I had really short hair and would wake up looking like a rooster.)  </li>
            <li>Feels Refreshing.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>and it feels lovely; I use it to spray my hair in between washes to refresh it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not a big fan of rose scents but this is great.  </li>
            <li>This product not only does fantastic things to my skin, it smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Product smells very good (natural and clean), keeps my skin plump and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised to see it in amazon at a better price!!</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>In the summer I put it in the fridge and on hot days, I can&#x27;t stop squirting myself in the face; yes, I know that sounds goofy, but it feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li>light fragrance and the sprayer is a fine mist</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>Love this rose water facial spray, great for down the boat on very hot days!</li>
            <li>My face feels nice, soft and moisturized (not greasy)</li>
            <li>so it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this spray as a refresher or toner or just because. :)</li>
            <li>The scent only lasts for a short time, but after so long with no scents it is a real treat to get that wonderful rose smell!  </li>
            <li>bought 3 - will definitely repurchase 3 more!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read any of the ingredients, but I love the effect it has on my overly sensitive and eczema ridden skin!</li>
            <li>Moisturizers are great for holding moisture in your skin, and a few spritzes of this gives my moisturizer something to hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Rose water for 25 years from different brands.</li>
            <li>In fact, it makes it look fresh like just applied.</li>
            <li>For years I have not been able to use anything with scents (even natural ones) because of my husband&#x27;s sensitivity to them.  </li>
            <li>The sprayer is so great in fact that I keep my old bottles and fill them with regular water for misting my hair during styling.</li>
            <li>I am currently pregnant and looking for refreshment in this hot weather.</li>
            <li>Price is just right.  </li>
            <li>This product is very refreshing, and helps to cool me down.</li>
            <li>Scent is light, ( if you do have a sensitive sniffer) the scent with quickly dissipate.</li>
            <li>The 3 pack is very economical and highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this for several years now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I use this product a lot in summer to refresh my face on a hot day.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting such strong rosewater smell.</li>
            <li>I will certainly consider buying this product again.</li>
            <li>I mostly use to set my make up, but also after a few hours when my skin starts feeling a bit dry, i spray it over my face, and i get back that nice glow, and refreshes my skin!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, I have had no problems, with breakouts, oily skin, or it drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>It also makes my moisturizer last longer because the moisture on your skin allows you to use less moisturizer and still easily cover your whole face.  </li>
            <li>The sprayer provides a fine mist instead of big droplets, so your face doesn&#x27;t feel dripping wet when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>I found this product at a Seattle store near the pikes market</li>
            <li>and I am 66 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>Rosewater is a natural toner for the skin to remove make and oil.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love this facial spray, it is something I use everyday.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I found this product at a Seattle store near the pikes market and I was surprised to see it in amazon at a better price!! I use it and so does my husband for face and back. I&#x27;ve used Rose water for 25 years from different brands. I love this one!</li>
            <li> I spray this on my face after my shower to close my pores.  Smells like a rose bouquet.  I&#x27;m usually not a big fan of rose scents but this is great.  So refreshing and moisturizing.  I do follow with a whip shea mix I made of unrefined shea butter, jojoba oil, emu oil and grapeseed oil.  My face feels nice, soft and moisturized (not greasy) all day long.  I highly recommend this spray as a refresher or toner or just because. :)</li>
            <li> Great price - great product!  So very refreshing ... bought 3 - will definitely repurchase 3 more!</li>
            <li> This rose water feels really nice on your face and has a light and pleasant scent to boot. I always use it before I put on moisturizer. In the summer I put it in the fridge and on hot days, I can&#x27;t stop squirting myself in the face; yes, I know that sounds goofy, but it feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be without this product.  Price is just right.  My skin is very dry and I am 66 yrs old.  One of the saddest things about aging is leather looking skin.  This helps my skin through out the day.  Spritz after face wash, after skin care application and to set makeup.  Product smells very good (natural and clean), keeps my skin plump and hydrated.  I also spritz throughout the day and it does not disturb my makeup.  In fact, it makes it look fresh like just applied.</li>
            <li> I use this over my entire body. I add it to my body lotion, my face cream, and on my feet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now. I usually purchase this at a local health food/vitamin store. If there is one thing I hate it is being sweaty. This product is very refreshing, and helps to cool me down. I have very sensitive skin, I have had no problems, with breakouts, oily skin, or it drying out my skin. Scent is light, ( if you do have a sensitive sniffer) the scent with quickly dissipate. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit too strong for my taste. I like the moisturizing effect this spray does to my skin. I use it twice a day or anytime I want to feel refreshed .</li>
            <li> I love this product!  For years I have not been able to use anything with scents (even natural ones) because of my husband&#x27;s sensitivity to them.  This product not only does fantastic things to my skin, it smells wonderful!  The scent only lasts for a short time, but after so long with no scents it is a real treat to get that wonderful rose smell!  Love the skin effects it has....firmness, skin tone, all better since I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Love this spray, light fragrance and the sprayer is a fine mist so it dries quickly.  Hydrates skin and is great for setting make-up as well.</li>
            <li> I love this facial spray, it is something I use everyday.  It is especially nice in the summer months, cool and refreshing.  I have been using it for years.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the 3-pack twice now. This stuff makes my skin feel so refreshed, and always ships in a timely manner. I&#x27;ve even convinced my sister to start using it.</li>
            <li> This product was so much more affordable than finding in my health food store, a regional business.  Well over 1/2 the cost.  I gave a couple of bottles as a gift and kept one for myself to try.  I will certainly consider buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for several years now, and I love it. Moisturizers are great for holding moisture in your skin, and a few spritzes of this gives my moisturizer something to hold. It also makes my moisturizer last longer because the moisture on your skin allows you to use less moisturizer and still easily cover your whole face.  The sprayer provides a fine mist instead of big droplets, so your face doesn&#x27;t feel dripping wet when you&#x27;re done. The sprayer is so great in fact that I keep my old bottles and fill them with regular water for misting my hair during styling. (Especially great when I had really short hair and would wake up looking like a rooster.)  I also keep a bottle at work. When you&#x27;re tired or your skin feels dry, spraying a fine mist wakes you up without destroying your makeup.</li>
            <li> This rose water facial spray is awesome! I mostly use to set my make up, but also after a few hours when my skin starts feeling a bit dry, i spray it over my face, and i get back that nice glow, and refreshes my skin! It&#x27;s a great value, at a great price! definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The Rosewater is lovely and the spray is very easy to use. Makes your face feel refreshed and clean.The 3 pack is very economical and highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> Love this rose water facial spray, great for down the boat on very hot days!</li>
            <li> I use this product a lot in summer to refresh my face on a hot day. But I use it in winter as well. It&#x27;s great for setting makeup.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I didn&#x27;t read any of the ingredients, but I love the effect it has on my overly sensitive and eczema ridden skin! I tend to be dry.. so I use this spray after the shower all over my skin, and then apply my usual creams. I also use it to set my makeup in the morning (since I shower at night). Rosewater is a natural toner for the skin to remove make and oil. Great for mild sunburns, and maintaining the pH balance of the skin. And you can&#x27;t beat this price!!</li>
            <li> Feels Refreshing. Smells beautiful. I use the Rosewater spray instead of a toner. Sometimes I will spray it in my hair for added moisture.</li>
            <li> I am currently pregnant and looking for refreshment in this hot weather. I&#x27;ve been using this spray for multiple reasons over the last month or so and I just love it. At night time I spray my face before putting on night cream; at work when I feel my skin is dry I spritz my face and it feels lovely; I use it to spray my hair in between washes to refresh it. The smell is amazing, I love roses and this has a potent but not overpowering smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using this on my baby when she comes to refresh her during the summer. I have extremely sensitive skin and this has not caused any reaction at all so I think it will be good for the baby too.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful, very very hydrating but too hydrating for me it made me break out in tiny clusters of pimples all over my forehead and sides of face, took over two weeks for them to go away. I have oily skin, so i gave it to my aunt and she loves it!!</li>
            <li> I spray a bit on after cleansing face or doing a chemical peel. This just calms my face down. I then follow with moisturizer after it dries. Also spray makeup brushes with it when foundation or bronzer need some help blending into my skin. Finally, I use it to settle my makeup, as powders and blush can sit on skin at times.</li>
            <li> This product is indeed rosewater, and it does have good humectants in it. But I was about to complain to the company and state the the product never arrived - it arrived the afternoon I was planning on sitting down to write the complaint. It took a very long time to arrive. I was also surprised at the number of other ingredients listed on the bottle. I had thought I was just buying rosewater, not rosewater and 15 other additives. Nevertheless, it smells wonderful and will do the job. I will use it, but will look into buying a different brand with fewer additives before purchasing this brand again.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such strong rosewater smell. I tried it out for 3 days but even as the smell disappears after a few min. I will look for another less smelling toner.</li>
