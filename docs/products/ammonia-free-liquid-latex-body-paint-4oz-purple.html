            <li>This stuff is fantastic for nail art!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product, it was as described and does exactly what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>The smell takes some getting used to, it&#x27;s a bit strong, but other than that it works wonderfully</li>
            <li>It is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It probably would be better to just clean the area with polish remover.  </li>
            <li>but it has a strong odor.</li>
            <li>Peals off easily, drys quickly!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, deep color upon drying.</li>
            <li>product description is accurate  </li>
            <li>Ammonia free</li>
            <li>I use this when I do my nails for easy clean up and it works so well.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the possibilities.</li>
            <li>Removed one star because even though it says ammonia free, it will knock you out with an ammonia smell.</li>
            <li>this is so much more economical.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and i originally purchased this for cosplay and to make tattoos on his arms.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the intent of using it in for nail polish clean up.</li>
            <li>Makes clean up a breeze.</li>
            <li>Definitely the pickup for a good makeshift nail barrier.</li>
            <li>I wore it for several hours on my arm, forgetting I had it on there at several points, and it stayed there perfectly.</li>
            <li>the color did not look vibrant without many coats.</li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s really well and peels off easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you are looking for an easy clean up method for doing your nails.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff works better than liquid palisade and is much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I know most Indie brands sell their own these days, and as much as I love supporting Indie brands...</li>
            <li>It arrived right on time,n</li>
            <li>It just peels right off.</li>
            <li>I was able to save most of that stuff, but also learned that it completely ruins nail files.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and removes in one large piece.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every nail polish lover should own this, im a super messy painter and with this liquid latex its so much easier to clean up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty rancid.</li>
            <li>I used a foam brush and it worked perfectly for a fake tattoo for a costume.</li>
            <li>SHAVE FIRST</li>
            <li>imagine using it for its intended purpose, by the time you left the house you would have to reapply it, as most of it would have fallen off with movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are companies that charge $10 and up for a teeny tiny bottle of latex to put around your nails, but this stuff works just as well and comes with WAY MORE.</li>
            <li>I just filled and empty nail polish bottle with it for easy use.  </li>
            <li>I just use and old but clean makeup brush and apply it that way.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>It worked really well</li>
            <li>Very ggoid quality.</li>
            <li>You really need 2 coats to make removal easier.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>I cannot get over how much easier this made the whole process.</li>
            <li>it clumped in his arm hair and pulled it out with much pain resulting.</li>
            <li>(I use it very often too).</li>
            <li>Mess free clean up.</li>
            <li>Problem is, because it dries so quickly, it&#x27;s easy for the latex to dry on the lid and where the lid screws on.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done, the dry latex pulls up easily with tweezers.</li>
            <li>Because of that, with my first bottle of liquid latex I could not get it to screw on all of the way, so it spilled completely into my bag of nail art supplies.</li>
            <li>It really easy to apply, since I don&#x27;t have and empty nail polish bottle (what a surprise)</li>
            <li>I use this to protect my fingers/cuticles from nail polish during stamping or ombre manicures and it works as well or better than Mess</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It goes on a light purple color and dries within 15 seconds tops to a dark purple color.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;m always 10 steps behind everyone when it comes to new nail trends/ ideas.</li>
            <li>but after some searching around, this makes so much more sense than getting a little tube that cost twice as much or even one that cost the same amount but only has 1/3 of the liquid inside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>previously, I was using a q-tip or a brush dipped in acetone to clean up around my nails after stamping.</li>
            <li>A little stinky, but the smell goes away after it quickly dries.</li>
            <li>it works good for my nail art cleans all the mess for such a small bottle</li>
            <li>But once your common sense kicks in, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using it for nails, definitely think about washing out an old nail polish bottle with acetone and filling it with the liquid latex.</li>
            <li>This is so much cheaper than other brands marketed toward nails.</li>
            <li>It was a hot mess.</li>

            <li> This is so much cheaper than other brands marketed toward nails.</li>
            <li> It was a hot mess.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll last a very long time even.</li>
            <li> Waiting for it to dry because you have to use several coats is time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I am a super sloppy nail stamper, I get stamping polish all over my cuticles and the sides of my fingers.</li>
            <li> I do clean my cuticles first of course, and apply it before the base coat because somehow I even manage to get that</li>
            <li> It makes it 100x easier to apply and doesn&#x27;t dry up while you&#x27;re applying it on your fingers.</li>
            <li> I feel like this one little tub will last me forever.</li>
            <li> So I used a tiny funnel to pour a bit of this into an empty nail polish bottle that I had, then brushed it onto my cuticles and the area all around my nails, waited a few minutes for it to dry, then proceeded to stamp and be as messy as I wanted to be.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not exactly the use it&#x27;s made for</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how well it would perform for any activities other than nail art...</li>
            <li> but it ruins the brush.</li>
            <li> Thicker layers are dark, thin layers can be darn near transparent.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine about a month or two ago and am not even half way done with it</li>
            <li> Just dont forget that if you&#x27;re using it for that to get some empty polish bottles because its pretty much impossible to apply without them</li>
            <li> Not very efffetive and hard to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a barrier for when I do messy nail art.</li>
            <li> The acetone dried out my fingers</li>
            <li> I feel like this product was a waste of money</li>
            <li> No More liquid tape product.  </li>
            <li> I hated the smell at first after a few uses of it</li>
            <li> and I always inadvertently ended up removing some polish because I am clumsy</li>
            <li> and I have shaky hands.</li>
            <li> The only down side is it STINKS!!!</li>
            <li> it does have a weird smell</li>
            <li> for my nail a lot  betterthan paying 22$ for the other stuff (which is insane)</li>
            <li> When removing, it does stick to body hair, and that can be painful, so do follow directions.</li>

            <li> I use this when painting my nails. Makes cleaning a breeze!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing, but OMG the SMELL!! it&#x27;s pretty rancid.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff works better than liquid palisade and is much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Great idea to use for water marbling nails! Works very well</li>
            <li> I use this to protect my cuticles from polish while doing nail art. It works fantastic! It dries quickly and removes in one large piece. If you&#x27;re looking for a liquid latex for nail art then this is it! This is so much cheaper than other brands marketed toward nails.</li>
            <li> I use this as a skin protector for around the nails on my nail clients. It works great when stamping or doing water marble to keep the polish off the skin. Do your design then just peel this latex off for a perfect manicure.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I used latex body paint as a substitute for liquid palisade. It worked really well but it ruins the brush.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> For the price its an okay product. Once opened it dries out a bit. Ammonia free but it has a strong odor.</li>
            <li> Love it .use for my nail a lot  betterthan paying 22$ for the other stuff (which is insane) some people say the smell bothers them. . DID NOT  notice a odor or bother me what so ever. And I can smell anything</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect! I use this around my nails for when I paint them and do water marble art. Peals off easily, drys quickly! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It arrived right on time,n it was totally wat i was expecting...</li>
            <li> Not very efffetive and hard to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! I use this when I do my nails for easy clean up and it works so well.</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s really well and peels off easily and dries quickly. Problem is, because it dries so quickly, it&#x27;s easy for the latex to dry on the lid and where the lid screws on. Because of that, with my first bottle of liquid latex I could not get it to screw on all of the way, so it spilled completely into my bag of nail art supplies. I was able to save most of that stuff, but also learned that it completely ruins nail files. I use it whenever I do nail art and it works perfectly for that, but it defiantly could use better packaging.</li>
            <li> The color is nice and bright. It is easy to remove. Not recommended for air bush usage. Enjoy the possibilities.</li>
            <li> I approve of this product two thumbs up it works good for my nail art cleans all the mess for such a small bottle you get a lot of usage out of it the price is good it does have a weird smell but you get used to it after awhile</li>
            <li> Really amazing for doing your nails, peels off quick!</li>
            <li> This is a affordable alternative cuticle protector for the nail polish junkie like me. This will take you an eternity to actually go through this. The only down side is it STINKS!!!</li>
            <li> I used a foam brush and it worked perfectly for a fake tattoo for a costume. Thicker layers are dark, thin layers can be darn near transparent. But once your common sense kicks in, it works just fine. I wore it for several hours on my arm, forgetting I had it on there at several points, and it stayed there perfectly. It didn&#x27;t peel, and it did mold with my body. When removing, it does stick to body hair, and that can be painful, so do follow directions.</li>
            <li> I receive muy refound thank you!</li>
            <li> Product as described. Very ggoid quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Definitely the pickup for a good makeshift nail barrier. Just dont forget that if you&#x27;re using it for that to get some empty polish bottles because its pretty much impossible to apply without them</li>
            <li> Everything was as posted</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;m always 10 steps behind everyone when it comes to new nail trends/ ideas. So initially I was going to buy another item but after some searching around, this makes so much more sense than getting a little tube that cost twice as much or even one that cost the same amount but only has 1/3 of the liquid inside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every nail polish lover should own this, im a super messy painter and with this liquid latex its so much easier to clean up. It goes on a light purple color and dries within 15 seconds tops to a dark purple color. It really easy to apply, since I don&#x27;t have and empty nail polish bottle (what a surprise) I just use and old but clean makeup brush and apply it that way. I do clean my cuticles first of course, and apply it before the base coat because somehow I even manage to get that everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall its amazing and it&#x27;ll last a very long time even.</li>
            <li> I love this product, very happy</li>
            <li> I use this to protect my fingers/cuticles from nail polish during stamping or ombre manicures and it works as well or better than Mess No More liquid tape product.  You really need 2 coats to make removal easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intent of using it in for nail polish clean up. It works very well, I love the color so I can see where I put it. I love that it dries in a darker color. I hated the smell at first after a few uses of it I was used to the smell. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. :) I have been using it for a couple months and I have maybe used a fourth of it.</li>
            <li> A little stinky, but the smell goes away after it quickly dries. Beautiful, deep color upon drying.</li>
            <li> Works great and dries fast. If you&#x27;re using it for nails, definitely think about washing out an old nail polish bottle with acetone and filling it with the liquid latex. It makes it 100x easier to apply and doesn&#x27;t dry up while you&#x27;re applying it on your fingers. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a barrier for when I do messy nail art. I poured it into a nail polish bottle and paint it on the skin around my nail. When I&#x27;m done, the dry latex pulls up easily with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product, it was as described and does exactly what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> Perfect for manicures! Makes clean up a breeze. Removed one star because even though it says ammonia free, it will knock you out with an ammonia smell.</li>
            <li> product description is accurate  I&#x27;m using it to keep the finger nail polish off my skin. That&#x27;s not exactly the use it&#x27;s made for but it works very well. I would rather pay $9.95  for 4 ounces of latex paint as $9  for 0.5 ounces someone else put in a nail polish bottle!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Great for nail art.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for nail art! I am a super sloppy nail stamper, I get stamping polish all over my cuticles and the sides of my fingers. previously, I was using a q-tip or a brush dipped in acetone to clean up around my nails after stamping. The acetone dried out my fingers and I always inadvertently ended up removing some polish because I am clumsy and I have shaky hands. It was a hot mess. So I used a tiny funnel to pour a bit of this into an empty nail polish bottle that I had, then brushed it onto my cuticles and the area all around my nails, waited a few minutes for it to dry, then proceeded to stamp and be as messy as I wanted to be. I cannot get over how much easier this made the whole process. It just peels right off. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve survived without it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well it would perform for any activities other than nail art...but if you are thinking of buying it for nail art, I cannot recommend it enough. I know most Indie brands sell their own these days, and as much as I love supporting Indie brands... this is so much more economical. I feel like this one little tub will last me forever.</li>
            <li> I was trying to use this for my Amethyst cosplay and when I did a makeup test with it, it turned me into a latex blueberry. Took 30 minutes to peel off. I feel like this product was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Ordered on Saturday and got it on Monday!  Super happy and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a cleanup tool for when I do nail art, and it works great!  I just filled and empty nail polish bottle with it for easy use.  The smell takes some getting used to, it&#x27;s a bit strong, but other than that it works wonderfully</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again. Great for nail art/ marbling</li>
            <li> This product it&#x27;s amazing. I used it for my nailart and i am very happy.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and i originally purchased this for cosplay and to make tattoos on his arms. it clumped in his arm hair and pulled it out with much pain resulting. the color did not look vibrant without many coats. SHAVE FIRST</li>
            <li> Mess free clean up. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Great for Nail stamping Easy clean UP, smells kinda fishy but it works!</li>
            <li> It works well if it stays on.  It seems to peel off on its own.  When I use it, I use finger separators so it won&#x27;t accidentally brush against another finger and curl up, then peel off.  Waiting for it to dry because you have to use several coats is time consuming.  It probably would be better to just clean the area with polish remover.  I would have given it one star, but once I started using the finger separators it sort of solved one issue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t imagine using it for its intended purpose, by the time you left the house you would have to reapply it, as most of it would have fallen off with movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I use this when I do my nails and it is amazing! There are companies that charge $10 and up for a teeny tiny bottle of latex to put around your nails, but this stuff works just as well and comes with WAY MORE. I ordered mine about a month or two ago and am not even half way done with it (I use it very often too). Highly recommended if you are looking for an easy clean up method for doing your nails.</li>
            <li> using it as a cuticle guard for nail art.  Perfect and much much better than 22$ for .3oz &#x3D;)</li>
