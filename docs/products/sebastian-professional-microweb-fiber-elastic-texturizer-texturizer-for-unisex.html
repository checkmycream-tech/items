            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>

            <li>I have used this product for many years, it is a awesome styling product.</li>
            <li>Love it best product IVE FOUND IN YEARS !!!!!!</li>
            <li>perfect for my husbands strong hair</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 10 years and even with the upgrading and changing by Sebastian I still find it is the best for my fine, frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is honestly the best, most reliable hair product I&#x27;ve ever used, in every way.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Has a good scent to it as well.</li>
            <li>my husband uses this every day, still looks quite good when the motorcycle helmet comes off</li>
            <li>Best price and quick delivery</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>&quot; I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this item!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love Amazon for ease of ordering!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and this product has amazing results.</li>
            <li>My hair is frizzy and puffy, but once I put this Microweb fiber in, it separates into nice curls that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>However, with patience the product thickens hair and styles quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>If you like to &amp;#34;piece&amp;#34; your hair, texturize it and see the layers, this product gives a nice result without being &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>so you can kind of make a spider web with it between your hands and basically lay it on your head to keep your hair in place.  </li>
            <li>Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hair looking fresh!</li>
            <li>I love this product and was thrilled when I found this company.</li>
            <li>hair is very fine.  </li>
            <li>I bought this originally from a salon and loved it....</li>
            <li>Ok, so I rarely write reviews, but this stuff is so great that I just had to.  </li>
            <li>Just imagine contacting every seller asking who&#x27;s got new authentic product - good luck!</li>
            <li>she love it.</li>
            <li>I pay much more at the salon I go too.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I have so many tubs of \\&quot;hair</li>
            <li>This microweb fiber creates a look I love with just a bit of texture, without the greasy look.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about it - a well-deserved five stars!</li>
            <li>and I love the things I can do with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love Sebastian.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Just work this magic into your hair with your hands, scrunch, and style the way you want.  </li>
            <li>Had to go back to the salon and re-buy it - perfect!  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I buy it  :)  </li>
            <li>Love  this stuff.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This gives my hair better definition and more body.</li>
            <li>Suggest that the Sabastian hair gel is a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I will order more when this is gone.</li>
            <li>This is my fiance&#x27;s favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>Again, my wife loves it, therefore, I love it.  </li>
            <li>She gets way better results than I do, but I&#x27;m getting better with continued use.</li>
            <li>love that it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s product in my hair, and I love that I can rearrange and move my hair around whenever I like and it will stay.</li>
            <li>One of the more helpful products to give texture to hair-- non intrusive and makes your hair stay where you put it and also shine.</li>
            <li>Better than any hair gel or putty out there</li>
            <li>Price even better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have tested more gels/pastes than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li>i had more money to spend on it, i would gladly buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair style is short and spiky and this gel spikes it perfectly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it!</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>I can purchase this from my beautician but I would pay more for it there.  </li>
            <li>so I knew I would be satisfied when purchasing it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks soo professional &amp; beautifully put together, when I use it.</li>
            <li>i bought one bottle and loved it, but the amount i loved it wasn&#x27;t worth spending 4-5X what i normally do.</li>
            <li>And the most important test is how my hair looks after using it.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I sought out the product</li>
            <li>I almost have to leave the sink running hot while I put it in, or I won&#x27;t be able to turn it on when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li>Not an easy product to purchase locally...have resorted to purchasing online....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel crunchy.</li>
            <li>easy to manage after putting on for my daughter&#x27;s competition hair styles.</li>
            <li>One of my tests is how easily it washes off my hands after I&#x27;ve applied it, because that lets me know how easily it will wash out of my hair.</li>
            <li>While it is easy to work into your hair, like gel, it is made of some sort of plastic</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not slimy.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to travel with because it isn&#x27;t a liquid or gel.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to piece and style.</li>
            <li>It also rinses out of the hair easily without the need for a washing.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really heavy, and gives good definition to many styles.  </li>
            <li>I went right out and bought some and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Great product  holds just right not to stiff and great for longer hair.</li>
            <li>Love how flexible it is, and love how much texture it gives my hair!</li>
            <li>Gives a boost to fine hair in the wintertime.</li>
            <li>I have also used this product for years and it works well with fine hair -my</li>
            <li>It gives my fine hair that texture it needs to stay in place.  </li>
            <li>For an easy messy look this is the best!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love what it does for my straight hair as well as my curls!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipment, nice to save a drive to the fancy hair product store and avoid the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; product demos.</li>
            <li>but the product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is an fantastic hair product I was introduded by my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>it is great, she told me only to use a pea-sized amount</li>
            <li>I use a hair razor to get lots of layers in my hair, and I love Sebastian&#x27;s microweb fiber because it really texturizes my hair and gives more definition to the layers.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product at a salon, and while getting it here is cheaper</li>
            <li>and I could not believe how nice and spiky, but not hard or sticky my hair was.</li>
            <li>For best use make sure to dry hair until almost but not completely dry.</li>
            <li>product is also clean.  </li>
            <li>Throughout the day, from right when I&#x27;ve put it in all the way up to bed time, I can run my fingers through it and re-style/move it, and it always keeps its hold!</li>
            <li>I use it daily and believe it is good for my hair.  </li>
            <li>sure why someone said it felt &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or like &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; maybe they used way to much?</li>
            <li>I know you will love it as much as i did</li>
            <li>This is a good value and I will buy again when I finally run out!</li>
            <li>The great thing is that unlike gels and other products, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; at the end of the day, but you can still tell there has been product put in it.</li>
            <li>WOULD HIGHLY BUY MORE</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, our appearance is important because it is the first thing people see.  </li>
            <li>It is part of the all important first impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Paid full price, but it was worth it</li>
            <li>slightly damp hair and dime sized amount &#x3D; win</li>
            <li>this product is good for my hair once it is almost dry.  </li>
            <li>It was also pretty pricey!</li>
            <li>This product costs a little more than cheap hair gels and performs much, much better for any way that I style my hair.</li>
            <li>but I was suprised it was this little bottle of stuff to really give my hair that fuller look if needed, or the perfectly controled messy hair that looks good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s literally the only hair product that has ever worked for me, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>You put about an inch worth on your hand and clap your hands together to activate.  </li>
            <li>Love how it holds my hair but still feels soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff is by far my favorite hair product of all time.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is the only hair product I have ever purchased on recommendation from my hair stylist and actually used and loved!</li>
            <li>The price is right too</li>
            <li>Your hair remains soft as well, not hard like gel or mousse is apt to feel.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I am able to put this in my hair wet after I put in a smooth serum from Sojourn and it gives my curls definition and its still touchable.</li>
            <li>Right now, my husband, who is a complete product-a-phobe, is letting me use this in his hair to define his natural waves while he sports a longer-than-usual \\&quot;do\\&quot;!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is always holding its style and oddly enough, this will sometimes allow you to restyle your hair without having to add any more product.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I thought it was going to make my hair sticky, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have used this product since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it does a great job of taming long, curly hair without making it greasy or crunchy.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this stuff when I first chopped off a whopping 17 inches of hair into a pixie.</li>
            <li>I love this product I have short pixie hair and it defines well.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Saved money and delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>but once I&#x27;ve worked it where I want it I splash a tiny bit of water and rub palms together and apply to my ends a bit more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds my style perfectly in place all day, from morning to night, just using the same small dab that you would toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for several years and continue to love it.  </li>
            <li>#34;I don&#x27;t have dandruff, it&#x27;s the gel&amp;#34;), and it is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Have used this brand for several years now and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product several times and love it.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li>Makes your hair look really good, not to heavy.</li>
            <li>The saline one had much more texture to it, this one made my hair flat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and natural looking, and it holds ALL day, pretty much no matter what.</li>
            <li>The service was superior, I had the product in just a few days!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser introduced me to this product; she knows I&#x27;m very particular about what I use.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase again.  </li>
            <li>I have never used anything close to it and can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>I have short and fine hair and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>I have used so many professional products, and I really always go back to them for my styling products...</li>
            <li>hairdresser used this product at my last cut but had none available for sale at the time.  </li>
            <li>When the product comes out it is very glue like.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly &amp; frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It works really well with his hair</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t quite make out how to use it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, well packaged.</li>
            <li>Stuff has a nice strong hold with only using a small amount.  </li>
            <li>Stuff is amazing have been using it for years now provides hold without that gel stiff look</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly everything in any brick-and-mortar store around to get the right product to use in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this for the past couple years and love it!  </li>
            <li>Love the product - have tried other brands</li>
            <li>Speaking from experiece many items are sold being pass due date.</li>
            <li>, if your going for that messy hair look and you need a product that is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t an exact match, but it is the closest I have found so far.</li>
            <li>it washed out easily and went in fairly easily, although it&#x27;s kind of hard to work in to dry hair as the product is fairly dry</li>
            <li>The most recent bottle I received was different.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this texturizer.....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>my wife highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>And I had instant success using it myself.</li>
            <li>Great for textured styles but only use a little bit!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product...a little pricey, but only takes small amount.  </li>
            <li>so the top is more evenly cut and have a somewhat thick layer of hair with the sides and back really short.</li>
            <li>Start out with a very small amount, rub between fingers to warm, then comb fingers through the areas desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I started using it about 2 years ago and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Yet never gets crunchy or flaky, it&#x27;s not sticky or waxy, it doesn&#x27;t look dirty; in fact it looks and feels like normal, clean hair that magically stays in place all day!</li>
            <li>I have finely textured hair and a lot of products tend to weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Another is how it smells - I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors.</li>
            <li>(I came directly to Amazon and placed my order!)</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at the salon and the second through Amazon.</li>
            <li>While this product doesn&#x27;t completely solve the issue in say, Florida, but elsewhere it perfects my curls!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser first used this on my hair a year or say back.</li>
            <li>Only takes a little, smells great, and does not weight hair down.</li>
            <li>I am a professional hairstylist</li>
            <li>It makes hair stay soft, not crunchy.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to be old product.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no way to tell how much product is left in the container.</li>
            <li>This product is a must if you have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair looks natural.</li>
            <li>I can make it look smooth or messy.</li>
            <li>and I work early in the morning and don&#x27;t make the time to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li>AND it still has natural movement and feel--no stiffness or stickiness.  </li>
            <li>only drawback whatsoever is that it&#x27;s really tacky on my *hands</li>
            <li>I wanted my hair to feel soft and Sebastian delivers it.</li>
            <li>but my point is it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>but no where near the pliable texture that can be rearranged</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anybody, especially those who&#x27;ve had wretched luck with hair products and never gotten anything to hold their hair.</li>
            <li>She gave me a new short haircut &amp; when she styled it</li>
            <li>not thrilled with the price though, when I was able to find it locally, paid 1/3 the online price.</li>
            <li>Now on top of this I use a little mousse and texturizer by same company and dry my hair with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s nice, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll continue using it due to the price.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product;  a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I washed it out and went back to my old product.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, short, processed hair!</li>
            <li>the pump is also nice because i don&#x27;t feel like the last little bit in the tube is wasted and just enough comes out for one use.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally curly waviness to my hair as it grows and it becomes more difficult to control.</li>
            <li>I have straight, medium-length, thick hair, that doesn&#x27;t hold much of a style.</li>
            <li>It was in an army green plastic tub with a hexagon dark grey top.  </li>
            <li>As long as you use the correct amount (one pump, distributed over your palms) , this product gives your dull and body-less hair a nice, (slightly) damp texture without causing the problems associated with hair gels.</li>
            <li>after paying as much for &amp;#34;handling&amp;#34; as I did for the product I found that there is about two squirts and surprise the bottle is empty!!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered through Amazon and although it smells a little different than when I buy through the salon</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t do my hair without a little of the micro web, and aveda pure abundance hair spray.</li>
            <li>This is seriously a lifetime-long hair dream come true.</li>
            <li>I have very thick coarse hair and only use a pea size amount and that works just fine.</li>
            <li>a little more wet - so use only a little.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe but it feels more like a hair that hasn&#x27;t been shampooed in a few days.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for many years, it is a awesome styling product.</li>
            <li> Love it best product IVE FOUND IN YEARS !!!!!!</li>
            <li> perfect for my husbands strong hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years and even with the upgrading and changing by Sebastian I still find it is the best for my fine, frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is honestly the best, most reliable hair product I&#x27;ve ever used, in every way.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Has a good scent to it as well.</li>

            <li> The fragrance is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> &quot; I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this item!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love Amazon for ease of ordering!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this product has amazing results.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy and puffy, but once I put this Microweb fiber in, it separates into nice curls that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> However, with patience the product thickens hair and styles quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> If you like to &amp;#34;piece&amp;#34; your hair, texturize it and see the layers, this product gives a nice result without being &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> so you can kind of make a spider web with it between your hands and basically lay it on your head to keep your hair in place.  </li>
            <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hair looking fresh!</li>
            <li> I love this product and was thrilled when I found this company.</li>
            <li> hair is very fine.  </li>
            <li> I bought this originally from a salon and loved it....</li>
            <li> Ok, so I rarely write reviews, but this stuff is so great that I just had to.  </li>
            <li> Just imagine contacting every seller asking who&#x27;s got new authentic product - good luck!</li>
            <li> she love it.</li>
            <li> I pay much more at the salon I go too.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I have so many tubs of \\&quot;hair</li>
            <li> This microweb fiber creates a look I love with just a bit of texture, without the greasy look.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about it - a well-deserved five stars!</li>
            <li> and I love the things I can do with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love Sebastian.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Just work this magic into your hair with your hands, scrunch, and style the way you want.  </li>
            <li> Had to go back to the salon and re-buy it - perfect!  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I buy it  :)  </li>
            <li> Love  this stuff.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This gives my hair better definition and more body.</li>
            <li> Suggest that the Sabastian hair gel is a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I will order more when this is gone.</li>
            <li> This is my fiance&#x27;s favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Again, my wife loves it, therefore, I love it.  </li>
            <li> She gets way better results than I do, but I&#x27;m getting better with continued use.</li>
            <li> love that it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s product in my hair, and I love that I can rearrange and move my hair around whenever I like and it will stay.</li>
            <li> One of the more helpful products to give texture to hair-- non intrusive and makes your hair stay where you put it and also shine.</li>
            <li> Better than any hair gel or putty out there</li>
            <li> Price even better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have tested more gels/pastes than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li> i had more money to spend on it, i would gladly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My hair style is short and spiky and this gel spikes it perfectly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Enjoy it!</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> I can purchase this from my beautician but I would pay more for it there.  </li>
            <li> so I knew I would be satisfied when purchasing it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks soo professional &amp; beautifully put together, when I use it.</li>
            <li> i bought one bottle and loved it, but the amount i loved it wasn&#x27;t worth spending 4-5X what i normally do.</li>
            <li> And the most important test is how my hair looks after using it.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I sought out the product</li>
            <li> I almost have to leave the sink running hot while I put it in, or I won&#x27;t be able to turn it on when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> Not an easy product to purchase locally...have resorted to purchasing online....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel crunchy.</li>
            <li> easy to manage after putting on for my daughter&#x27;s competition hair styles.</li>
            <li> One of my tests is how easily it washes off my hands after I&#x27;ve applied it, because that lets me know how easily it will wash out of my hair.</li>
            <li> While it is easy to work into your hair, like gel, it is made of some sort of plastic</li>
            <li> Easy to use and not slimy.  </li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to travel with because it isn&#x27;t a liquid or gel.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to piece and style.</li>
            <li> It also rinses out of the hair easily without the need for a washing.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really heavy, and gives good definition to many styles.  </li>
            <li> I went right out and bought some and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product  holds just right not to stiff and great for longer hair.</li>
            <li> Love how flexible it is, and love how much texture it gives my hair!</li>
            <li> Gives a boost to fine hair in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> I have also used this product for years and it works well with fine hair -my</li>
            <li> It gives my fine hair that texture it needs to stay in place.  </li>
            <li> For an easy messy look this is the best!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love what it does for my straight hair as well as my curls!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, nice to save a drive to the fancy hair product store and avoid the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; product demos.</li>
            <li> but the product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is an fantastic hair product I was introduded by my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> it is great, she told me only to use a pea-sized amount</li>
            <li> I use a hair razor to get lots of layers in my hair, and I love Sebastian&#x27;s microweb fiber because it really texturizes my hair and gives more definition to the layers.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product at a salon, and while getting it here is cheaper</li>
            <li> and I could not believe how nice and spiky, but not hard or sticky my hair was.</li>
            <li> For best use make sure to dry hair until almost but not completely dry.</li>
            <li> product is also clean.  </li>
            <li> Throughout the day, from right when I&#x27;ve put it in all the way up to bed time, I can run my fingers through it and re-style/move it, and it always keeps its hold!</li>
            <li> I use it daily and believe it is good for my hair.  </li>
            <li> sure why someone said it felt &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or like &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; maybe they used way to much?</li>
            <li> I know you will love it as much as i did</li>
            <li> This is a good value and I will buy again when I finally run out!</li>
            <li> The great thing is that unlike gels and other products, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; at the end of the day, but you can still tell there has been product put in it.</li>
            <li> WOULD HIGHLY BUY MORE</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, our appearance is important because it is the first thing people see.  </li>
            <li> It is part of the all important first impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Paid full price, but it was worth it</li>
            <li> slightly damp hair and dime sized amount &#x3D; win</li>
            <li> this product is good for my hair once it is almost dry.  </li>
            <li> It was also pretty pricey!</li>
            <li> This product costs a little more than cheap hair gels and performs much, much better for any way that I style my hair.</li>
            <li> but I was suprised it was this little bottle of stuff to really give my hair that fuller look if needed, or the perfectly controled messy hair that looks good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally the only hair product that has ever worked for me, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> You put about an inch worth on your hand and clap your hands together to activate.  </li>
            <li> Love how it holds my hair but still feels soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far my favorite hair product of all time.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I have ever purchased on recommendation from my hair stylist and actually used and loved!</li>
            <li> The price is right too</li>
            <li> Your hair remains soft as well, not hard like gel or mousse is apt to feel.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I am able to put this in my hair wet after I put in a smooth serum from Sojourn and it gives my curls definition and its still touchable.</li>
            <li> Right now, my husband, who is a complete product-a-phobe, is letting me use this in his hair to define his natural waves while he sports a longer-than-usual \\&quot;do\\&quot;!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is always holding its style and oddly enough, this will sometimes allow you to restyle your hair without having to add any more product.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I thought it was going to make my hair sticky, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since it first came out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it does a great job of taming long, curly hair without making it greasy or crunchy.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this stuff when I first chopped off a whopping 17 inches of hair into a pixie.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have short pixie hair and it defines well.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Saved money and delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> but once I&#x27;ve worked it where I want it I splash a tiny bit of water and rub palms together and apply to my ends a bit more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds my style perfectly in place all day, from morning to night, just using the same small dab that you would toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years and continue to love it.  </li>
            <li> #34;I don&#x27;t have dandruff, it&#x27;s the gel&amp;#34;), and it is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Have used this brand for several years now and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product several times and love it.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li> Makes your hair look really good, not to heavy.</li>
            <li> The saline one had much more texture to it, this one made my hair flat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and natural looking, and it holds ALL day, pretty much no matter what.</li>
            <li> The service was superior, I had the product in just a few days!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product; she knows I&#x27;m very particular about what I use.</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase again.  </li>
            <li> I have never used anything close to it and can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> I have short and fine hair and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I have used so many professional products, and I really always go back to them for my styling products...</li>
            <li> hairdresser used this product at my last cut but had none available for sale at the time.  </li>
            <li> When the product comes out it is very glue like.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly &amp; frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It works really well with his hair</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t quite make out how to use it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, well packaged.</li>
            <li> Stuff has a nice strong hold with only using a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Stuff is amazing have been using it for years now provides hold without that gel stiff look</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly everything in any brick-and-mortar store around to get the right product to use in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the past couple years and love it!  </li>
            <li> Love the product - have tried other brands</li>
            <li> Speaking from experiece many items are sold being pass due date.</li>
            <li> , if your going for that messy hair look and you need a product that is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an exact match, but it is the closest I have found so far.</li>
            <li> it washed out easily and went in fairly easily, although it&#x27;s kind of hard to work in to dry hair as the product is fairly dry</li>
            <li> The most recent bottle I received was different.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this texturizer.....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my wife highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> And I had instant success using it myself.</li>
            <li> Great for textured styles but only use a little bit!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product...a little pricey, but only takes small amount.  </li>
            <li> so the top is more evenly cut and have a somewhat thick layer of hair with the sides and back really short.</li>
            <li> Start out with a very small amount, rub between fingers to warm, then comb fingers through the areas desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> I started using it about 2 years ago and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Yet never gets crunchy or flaky, it&#x27;s not sticky or waxy, it doesn&#x27;t look dirty; in fact it looks and feels like normal, clean hair that magically stays in place all day!</li>
            <li> I have finely textured hair and a lot of products tend to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Another is how it smells - I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors.</li>
            <li> (I came directly to Amazon and placed my order!)</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at the salon and the second through Amazon.</li>
            <li> While this product doesn&#x27;t completely solve the issue in say, Florida, but elsewhere it perfects my curls!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser first used this on my hair a year or say back.</li>
            <li> Only takes a little, smells great, and does not weight hair down.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist</li>
            <li> It makes hair stay soft, not crunchy.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to be old product.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no way to tell how much product is left in the container.</li>
            <li> This product is a must if you have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair looks natural.</li>
            <li> I can make it look smooth or messy.</li>
            <li> and I work early in the morning and don&#x27;t make the time to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li> AND it still has natural movement and feel--no stiffness or stickiness.  </li>
            <li> only drawback whatsoever is that it&#x27;s really tacky on my *hands</li>
            <li> I wanted my hair to feel soft and Sebastian delivers it.</li>
            <li> but my point is it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> but no where near the pliable texture that can be rearranged</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anybody, especially those who&#x27;ve had wretched luck with hair products and never gotten anything to hold their hair.</li>
            <li> She gave me a new short haircut &amp; when she styled it</li>
            <li> not thrilled with the price though, when I was able to find it locally, paid 1/3 the online price.</li>
            <li> Now on top of this I use a little mousse and texturizer by same company and dry my hair with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s nice, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll continue using it due to the price.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product;  a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I washed it out and went back to my old product.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, short, processed hair!</li>
            <li> the pump is also nice because i don&#x27;t feel like the last little bit in the tube is wasted and just enough comes out for one use.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally curly waviness to my hair as it grows and it becomes more difficult to control.</li>
            <li> I have straight, medium-length, thick hair, that doesn&#x27;t hold much of a style.</li>
            <li> It was in an army green plastic tub with a hexagon dark grey top.  </li>
            <li> As long as you use the correct amount (one pump, distributed over your palms) , this product gives your dull and body-less hair a nice, (slightly) damp texture without causing the problems associated with hair gels.</li>
            <li> after paying as much for &amp;#34;handling&amp;#34; as I did for the product I found that there is about two squirts and surprise the bottle is empty!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered through Amazon and although it smells a little different than when I buy through the salon</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do my hair without a little of the micro web, and aveda pure abundance hair spray.</li>
            <li> This is seriously a lifetime-long hair dream come true.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair and only use a pea size amount and that works just fine.</li>
            <li> a little more wet - so use only a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe but it feels more like a hair that hasn&#x27;t been shampooed in a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got really thin, fine hairs, but there&#x27;s so much that it&#x27;s actually thick overall, and nothing else has ever held it in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My do doesn&#x27;t fade or fall flat all day; in fact, I can even re-shape and re-style it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a male with 2-3 inch long hair.</li>
            <li> I can \\&quot;refluff\\&quot; my hair throughout the day when it goes flat, without having to worry about any \\&quot;hairspray crustiness.\\&quot; Order this product on Amazon for $5 cheaper than at the salon!</li>
            <li> I was looking for firm hold, but that left hair manageable, soft, without being too shiny or sticky.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but it is more expensive than other products.</li>
            <li> Insanely expensive hair product that your well groomed child will be convinced is the only product that will adequately give the necessary firmness to his do.</li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I use this product to separate my long layers to give my hair movement.  </li>
            <li> Just a tiny dab lays down those fly-ways in an instant and the product lasts ALL day, even through a workout.</li>
            <li> or it gives you a wet looking hair and to only use when your hair is fully dry.</li>
            <li> Read instructions carefully and put a tiny bit on your finger tip, spread on your other fingers and then work on your hair.</li>
            <li> It takes such a small amount for me this will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use the thickener gel and the building spray while wet and this after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Using it on wet or dry hair doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> when I wear it flat ironed and down</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little dab in your palm.</li>
            <li> but it was not really what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Left it heavy, almost gooy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For another look - the crunchier, wet look - which I also like</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Additionally, you need minimal amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is cut almost identical to pink and miley cyrus.</li>
            <li> (I have short hair) but doesn&#x27;t make it stiff like some gels.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product I got was a little old</li>
            <li> is soft with subtle definition the way I use it.</li>
            <li> My other alternative would be Redken Rewind 06 which is similar with just a little less holding power.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike other texturing and paste products I&#x27;ve tried it doesn&#x27;t take 3 shampoo sessions to wash it out.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do with it now, as its been open &amp; used once.</li>
            <li> i was hoping that this product would help my hair hold the curl like the other product did....</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product, although it&#x27;s still in my cabinet with a bunch of other products I probably won&#x27;t use again.  </li>
            <li> My only problem with this product is the packaging, because it&#x27;s very hard to gauge when you&#x27;re running low on product.</li>
            <li> You use very little so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Had no success and just do not use it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is probably average in thickness (per strand)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as the prior bottles.  </li>
            <li> It almost seemed like it was watered down</li>
            <li> was trying to save money getting it for half the price.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff for about half what I was paying at the salon.  </li>
            <li> but make my hair feel bogged down and sticky...</li>
            <li> Purchased this product previously from beauty salon and tried purchasing it online to save a little cash, but it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I rub a dime sized amount of product between my hands, and then \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; it through my just blow-dried hair, then set it with a little bit of hairspray.</li>
            <li> It adds a ton of texture to my little pixie cut.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it since my hair grew out a little.  </li>
            <li> Does not make my hair greasy and a little goes</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky on my hands</li>
            <li> and so it is not at all messy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> Both products are WAY cheaper here on Amazon than in the salon, and so far I haven&#x27;t gotten anything that I thought was a fake.</li>
            <li> I have very short, spiky hair and have grown tired of the \\&quot;thickening glue\\&quot; hair product that I have been using.</li>
            <li> - one of these usually lasts me almost half a year I think.</li>
            <li> I like this when I want a rocker look and don&#x27;t want to look gelled up and stiff.  </li>
            <li> It keeps one&#x27;s hair neat and in place without being too stiff or too greasy.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had a lot of it and, after many years of dyeing, the texture is just disastrous (dull, thin and frizzy).  </li>
            <li> Microweb provides texture, control and a small bit of shine with none of the stiffness or crunchiness of mousse or stiff gels.</li>
            <li> I use a curling iron and then use this to push it up with a little hairspray and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> * after I&#x27;ve put it in, and it&#x27;s a little hard to get it off.</li>
            <li> it was too sticky and gooey, even when i put a very small amount on my fingers, it weighed down my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is either expired or not authentic.  </li>
            <li> not sure how it helps :?</li>
            <li> It is one of the very few I&#x27;ve found that gives the hair plenty of texture and volume while still leaving it flexible.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard and crusty.  </li>
            <li> If I have a complaint, it&#x27;s that the dispenser doesn&#x27;t always work well</li>
            <li> Crazy as it sounds, though, it&#x27;s only my hands and not at all my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * work if you have lots of hair as it is too thick to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> I would describe my hair as thick and somewhat course.</li>
            <li> I use very very little of it and pull pieces !</li>
            <li> I found it to be much less expensive online than in the&lt;br /&gt;salon.</li>
            <li> I hardly have to do anything else!</li>
            <li> Poor description</li>
            <li> expensive lesson...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Amazon purchased bottle didn&#x27;t hold up to my standards.</li>
            <li> was looking for something comparable to Sebastian Twisted Taffy...</li>
            <li> I was after the salon quality, Sebastian has a department store line and this unfortunately came from that without me having any way to know until it arrived.</li>
            <li> it is a bit expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years to get my crazy waives under control.</li>
            <li> This product is the closest I&#x27;ve found to the now-discontinued Twisted Taffy by Sebastion!</li>
            <li> it is just sitting in my drawer :(</li>
            <li> I bought this product base on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Stuff is amazing have been using it for years now provides hold without that gel stiff look</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever used</li>
            <li> I use this every day and man does it work well. My hair is always holding its style and oddly enough, this will sometimes allow you to restyle your hair without having to add any more product. It doesnt feel gunky or gooey. Your hair can still be played with and everything. The only downside is that they raised the price on it recently</li>
            <li> Not an easy product to purchase locally...have resorted to purchasing online....not thrilled with the price though, when I was able to find it locally, paid 1/3 the online price.</li>
            <li> I think that this will be good but have to figure out how best to use it. My sister-in-law recommended it. she love it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;WOW,\\&quot; I absolutely love this stuff! It&#x27;s easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel crunchy. Love how flexible it is, and love how much texture it gives my hair! My hair looks soo professional &amp; beautifully put together, when I use it. I highly recommend this texturizer.....it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this product and was thrilled when I found this company. I pay much more at the salon I go too. The service was superior, I had the product in just a few days! I have curly hair and this product has amazing results. I have never used anything close to it and can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> Love this item! easy to manage after putting on for my daughter&#x27;s competition hair styles.</li>
            <li> This is a great product .My hair is very fine.  It gave my hair body and texture. I have gotten many compliments since I started using this product. When I first put it on, I thought it was going to make my hair sticky, but it didn&#x27;t. I would recomend this product.</li>
            <li> This product works great for my hair type. I have a naturally curly waviness to my hair as it grows and it becomes more difficult to control. Microweb provides texture, control and a small bit of shine with none of the stiffness or crunchiness of mousse or stiff gels. Also, unlike other texturing and paste products I&#x27;ve tried it doesn&#x27;t take 3 shampoo sessions to wash it out. I would have given it 5 stars but it is more expensive than other products. My other alternative would be Redken Rewind 06 which is similar with just a little less holding power.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I didn&#x27;t like it but it was not really what I was looking for.  It was also pretty pricey!</li>
            <li> Gives hair body and shape.</li>
            <li> Best price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have short and fine hair and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> After trying a bunch of products for my hair, I&#x27;ve been using this one for a couple of years. It is one of the very few I&#x27;ve found that gives the hair plenty of texture and volume while still leaving it flexible. The price is right too - one of these usually lasts me almost half a year I think.</li>
            <li> rub into palms and then touch with fingers to apply to hair.  Gives a boost to fine hair in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I have ever purchased on recommendation from my hair stylist and actually used and loved! I have so many tubs of \\&quot;hair wax\\&quot; type products that get close to the look I want, but when I style my hair myself w/ them, it just makes my hair look greasy. I have straight, medium-length, thick hair, that doesn&#x27;t hold much of a style. This microweb fiber creates a look I love with just a bit of texture, without the greasy look. I rub a dime sized amount of product between my hands, and then \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; it through my just blow-dried hair, then set it with a little bit of hairspray. I can \\&quot;refluff\\&quot; my hair throughout the day when it goes flat, without having to worry about any \\&quot;hairspray crustiness.\\&quot; Order this product on Amazon for $5 cheaper than at the salon! My only problem with this product is the packaging, because it&#x27;s very hard to gauge when you&#x27;re running low on product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product; she knows I&#x27;m very particular about what I use. I have finely textured hair and a lot of products tend to weigh it down. Not the Microweb Fiber! And I had instant success using it myself. (I came directly to Amazon and placed my order!) One of my tests is how easily it washes off my hands after I&#x27;ve applied it, because that lets me know how easily it will wash out of my hair. Another is how it smells - I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors. This has a very nice, but not lingering odor. And the most important test is how my hair looks after using it. Sebastian&#x27;s Microweb Fiber passed with flying colors. I cannot say enough great things about it - a well-deserved five stars!</li>
            <li> I have used this product since it first came out.  It was in an army green plastic tub with a hexagon dark grey top.  That was years ago, probably around 1997.  I am a professional hairstylist and I love the things I can do with this product.  It&#x27;s not really heavy, and gives good definition to many styles.  I love Sebastian. I have used so many professional products, and I really always go back to them for my styling products...Right now, my husband, who is a complete product-a-phobe, is letting me use this in his hair to define his natural waves while he sports a longer-than-usual \\&quot;do\\&quot;!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You put about an inch worth on your hand and clap your hands together to activate.  Then scrunch, scrunch, scrunch.  My hair is frizzy and puffy, but once I put this Microweb fiber in, it separates into nice curls that lasts all day.  I can even spritz my hair with water the next day to reactivate it.  I love this product. It makes hair stay soft, not crunchy.  I haven&#x27;t found anything that even comes close to it.</li>
            <li> The best for natural-looking styled hair. For best use make sure to dry hair until almost but not completely dry. I&#x27;m on my 10th container of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Exellent hair product! Not too sticky, so hair can &amp;#34;move&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> It seemed to be old product. I have been using this product for 5 years and it was not the same.&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to save money getting it for half the price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do my hair without a little of the micro web, and aveda pure abundance hair spray. These two work wonders together. For an easy messy look this is the best!</li>
            <li> This product is either expired or not authentic.  I say this because it does not have the microweb properties that it should have.  I now only purchase this product from the salon where I get my hair cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this product base on the reviews.  it was too sticky and gooey, even when i put a very small amount on my fingers, it weighed down my hair.  it is just sitting in my drawer :(</li>
            <li> If you like a tousled hairstyle, with bits of \\&quot;separated\\&quot; hair, this is the product that will make it happen!  Just work this magic into your hair with your hands, scrunch, and style the way you want.  A tiny bit of spray will hold your style all day.&lt;br /&gt;This product is also clean.  While it is easy to work into your hair, like gel, it is made of some sort of plastic and so it is not at all messy.  It won&#x27;t come off on your pillow when you sleep.  Your hair remains soft as well, not hard like gel or mousse is apt to feel.&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser used this product at my last cut but had none available for sale at the time.  I loved it so much that I sought out the product and I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> This product does not work on my hair as described. Left it heavy, almost gooy. I could not do a thing with it. I washed it out and went back to my old product.  Not sure what to do with it now, as its been open &amp; used once. expensive lesson...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and I absolutely love what it does for my straight hair as well as my curls!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it does a great job of taming long, curly hair without making it greasy or crunchy. If I have a complaint, it&#x27;s that the dispenser doesn&#x27;t always work well and there&#x27;s no way to tell how much product is left in the container.</li>
            <li> This stuff that I received was all watery and runny.  Awful!  Had to go back to the salon and re-buy it - perfect!  Paid full price, but it was worth it cuz it&#x27;s a great product.  Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> after paying as much for &amp;#34;handling&amp;#34; as I did for the product I found that there is about two squirts and surprise the bottle is empty!!</li>
            <li> I have also used this product for years and it works well with fine hair -my only issue is once it dries it does leave (sometimes) a residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this stuff when I first chopped off a whopping 17 inches of hair into a pixie. I am in love with this stuff. It adds a ton of texture to my little pixie cut. I bought my first bottle at the salon and the second through Amazon. Unfortunately, the Amazon purchased bottle didn&#x27;t hold up to my standards. The Amazon bottle material did not make the &amp;#34;web&amp;#34; texture it is suppose to, therefore not the same effect. I didn&#x27;t send it back and I&#x27;m almost done with this bottle. I&#x27;ll give Amazon another chance but definitely sending it back if I get the same result.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product;  a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally from a salon and loved it....I ran out so I purchased it online. When it arrived I was very disappointed. It was not the same as the one I bought in salon. I ended up throwing it away. The saline one had much more texture to it, this one made my hair flat. It almost seemed like it was watered down</li>
            <li> I like this when I want a rocker look and don&#x27;t want to look gelled up and stiff.  If you use once a day, you&#x27;ll go through a bottle in a about 9 days with shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> When the product comes out it is very glue like.  However, with patience the product thickens hair and styles quite nicely.  I will certainly purchase again.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I have very curly &amp; frizzy hair. While this product doesn&#x27;t completely solve the issue in say, Florida, but elsewhere it perfects my curls!</li>
            <li> I use a hair razor to get lots of layers in my hair, and I love Sebastian&#x27;s microweb fiber because it really texturizes my hair and gives more definition to the layers.</li>
            <li> Petroleum based glue! Makes your hair feel like sticky crud. Will *not* work if you have lots of hair as it is too thick to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair body and lift and keeps it in place.  Have been using  this for years.  Highly recommend use.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the past couple years and love it!  It gives my fine hair that texture it needs to stay in place.  This is the first time I ordered through Amazon and although it smells a little different than when I buy through the salon it works just the same.  Not sure if the product I got was a little old but it still works.</li>
            <li> This product is for anyone looking to replace the Pureology texture twist product. It isn&#x27;t an exact match, but it is the closest I have found so far. It can be a little more wet - so use only a little.</li>
            <li> My son loves this so I buy it  :)  Had his hair styled once and this is what she used.  He&#x27;s been ordering every since.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price off Amazon.  Just a tiny dab lays down those fly-ways in an instant and the product lasts ALL day, even through a workout. Save money and buy it from here! Fast shipment, nice to save a drive to the fancy hair product store and avoid the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; product demos. LOL</li>
            <li> Love  this stuff. Holds all day without  frizz and my hair loves  to frizz!  I just use a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> cheapest price around</li>
            <li> Purchased it when I saw the great job it did when used by my hairdresser.  Cannot get the same results at home and have even looked at the video to see why.  Had no success and just do not use it.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. doesn&#x27;t make my hair look like i have product in it but holds all day. the pump is also nice because i don&#x27;t feel like the last little bit in the tube is wasted and just enough comes out for one use.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for those with thinner hair.  It add texture and fiber!</li>
            <li> This product is a must if you have naturally curly hair.  I started using it about 2 years ago and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This product costs a little more than cheap hair gels and performs much, much better for any way that I style my hair. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Use it daily. A bit costly but the product is fantastic. Highly recommended. .............nothing else to write but they have a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Great hold!  Easy to use and not slimy.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard and crusty.  Hair looks natural.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have short pixie hair and it defines well. I can make it look smooth or messy. Great product</li>
            <li> I have lots of body to where it curls and I work early in the morning and don&#x27;t make the time to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair. I am able to put this in my hair wet after I put in a smooth serum from Sojourn and it gives my curls definition and its still touchable. I have been using this product for a couple years and will continue to use it. Best prices on amazon too!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does exactly what it says. Makes your hair look really good, not to heavy. I have used this product for many years, it is a awesome styling product. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Saved money and delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> This product is the closest I&#x27;ve found to the now-discontinued Twisted Taffy by Sebastion! This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair quite as moist looking as the Taffy did, so I use this along with a texturizing spray and it does the job! Now using 2 products to accomplish the same as 1, but no complaints!</li>
            <li> my wife highly recommend this product she says it works great on her hair and she will buy it again and again and again</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.  This product is just what I needed to give body and control in styling my very short hair.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I rarely write reviews, but this stuff is so great that I just had to.  My hair is probably average in thickness (per strand) but I&#x27;ve never had a lot of it and, after many years of dyeing, the texture is just disastrous (dull, thin and frizzy).  This product is a miracle.  My hairdresser used it last time I got a cut and I was so happy with the amount of body and texture it provided that I ordered it on amazon immediately.  Just got the package and applied it and it looks like I just walked out of the salon again!!!  It gives my hair body, separation/texture and shine AND it still has natural movement and feel--no stiffness or stickiness.  Smells great too! I&#x27;m ecstatic.  This is seriously a lifetime-long hair dream come true.</li>
            <li> This gives my hair better definition and more body. You use very little so it lasts a long time. Read instructions carefully and put a tiny bit on your finger tip, spread on your other fingers and then work on your hair. You don&#x27;t need hair spray when you use this which is great. And there is no stickiness!! Easy to travel with because it isn&#x27;t a liquid or gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it since my hair grew out a little.  Although I still have short hair, it doesn&#x27;t seem to help give me body .  Suggest that the Sabastian hair gel is a lot better.  Then again- if your hair is short and spikey style, might work well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair product!! Use after showering &amp; washing hair, then the next day you only have to brush in place. Especially with short hair.</li>
            <li> Great hair product. I use it daily and believe it is good for my hair.  I will order more when this is gone.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly everything in any brick-and-mortar store around to get the right product to use in my hair. This stuff beats them all. It gives an excellent hold and a lot of resiliency and volume to my hair. This now my go-to product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! You just have to try it! Does not make my hair greasy and a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why someone said it felt &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or like &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; maybe they used way to much? I don&#x27;t know but that has never been my experience!&lt;br /&gt;Hair is soft with subtle definition the way I use it. It is a little sticky on my hands but once I&#x27;ve worked it where I want it I splash a tiny bit of water and rub palms together and apply to my ends a bit more. Works great!</li>
            <li> This is an fantastic hair product I was introduded by my hairdresser.  She gave me a new short haircut &amp; when she styled it, she used this &amp; it gave it a lift and textured look.  I&#x27;ve had a pixie for the last 3 years &amp; sometimes I like to wear it all up and spiky looking - this does the trick.  It also helps keep my pixie looking great. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is my fiance&#x27;s favorite hair product. It works really well with his hair and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> was looking for something comparable to Sebastian Twisted Taffy...this product is good for my hair once it is almost dry.  i have curly hair.  i was hoping that this product would help my hair hold the curl like the other product did....it is ok though, but expensive, so i use it sparingly....</li>
            <li> I was looking for firm hold, but that left hair manageable, soft, without being too shiny or sticky.  This did the trick.  Only takes a little, smells great, and does not weight hair down.</li>
            <li> I decided one to day to chop 8 inches of my hair off based on  a pick I saw in a magazine.And she pulled it off perfectly.  the cut is identical but I was suprised it was this little bottle of stuff to really give my hair that fuller look if needed, or the perfectly controled messy hair that looks good</li>
            <li> Again, my wife loves it, therefore, I love it.  Best price, too!</li>
            <li> Love how it holds my hair but still feels soft.</li>
            <li> Stuff has a nice strong hold with only using a small amount.  Has a good scent to it as well.</li>
            <li> Could not even imagine doing my hair without this stuff, works great.</li>
            <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hair looking fresh!</li>
            <li> I use the thickener gel and the building spray while wet and this after my hair is dry. This makes it easy to piece and style. Love it!</li>
            <li> As long as you use the correct amount (one pump, distributed over your palms) , this product gives your dull and body-less hair a nice, (slightly) damp texture without causing the problems associated with hair gels. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my haircutter. She gets way better results than I do, but I&#x27;m getting better with continued use. If you like to &amp;#34;piece&amp;#34; your hair, texturize it and see the layers, this product gives a nice result without being &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.  I put some in my hand then rub hands together and also put some on the tops of my hands. Then I run my hands thru my (dry,styled) hair and then pull out pieces as I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For another look - the crunchier, wet look - which I also like, I use another terrific product Wax Works by Paul Mitchell. Both products are WAY cheaper here on Amazon than in the salon, and so far I haven&#x27;t gotten anything that I thought was a fake.</li>
            <li> Love it best product IVE FOUND IN YEARS !!!!!! KEEP HAIR IN PLACE AND HOLDS WONDERFULLY !!! WOULD HIGHLY BUY MORE</li>
            <li> Purchased this product previously from beauty salon and tried purchasing it online to save a little cash, but it was a waste of money.  The product doesn&#x27;t dispense correctly and it&#x27;s just goopy.  It&#x27;s supposed to be sticky and &#x27;elastic&#x27; so you can kind of make a spider web with it between your hands and basically lay it on your head to keep your hair in place.  Maybe the product was frozen....?</li>
            <li> I got this stuff for about half what I was paying at the salon.  I like the way it helps my hair keep its shape (I have short hair) but doesn&#x27;t make it stiff like some gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence with this product...I really couldn&#x27;t quite make out how to use it. It seemed like it did nothing but make my hair feel bogged down and sticky...I am not an authority on this so can&#x27;t say I would or would not reccomend it....</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far my favorite hair product of all time. It&#x27;s literally the only hair product that has ever worked for me, and it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve got really thin, fine hairs, but there&#x27;s so much that it&#x27;s actually thick overall, and nothing else has ever held it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds my style perfectly in place all day, from morning to night, just using the same small dab that you would toothpaste. Using it on wet or dry hair doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. My do doesn&#x27;t fade or fall flat all day; in fact, I can even re-shape and re-style it throughout the day. Yet never gets crunchy or flaky, it&#x27;s not sticky or waxy, it doesn&#x27;t look dirty; in fact it looks and feels like normal, clean hair that magically stays in place all day! Throughout the day, from right when I&#x27;ve put it in all the way up to bed time, I can run my fingers through it and re-style/move it, and it always keeps its hold! I never have to touch it up or re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s product in my hair, and I love that I can rearrange and move my hair around whenever I like and it will stay. I think those are the best things about this product that is the best product! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback whatsoever is that it&#x27;s really tacky on my *hands* after I&#x27;ve put it in, and it&#x27;s a little hard to get it off. I almost have to leave the sink running hot while I put it in, or I won&#x27;t be able to turn it on when I&#x27;m done! Crazy as it sounds, though, it&#x27;s only my hands and not at all my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is honestly the best, most reliable hair product I&#x27;ve ever used, in every way. It&#x27;s clean and natural looking, and it holds ALL day, pretty much no matter what. I highly recommend this to anybody, especially those who&#x27;ve had wretched luck with hair products and never gotten anything to hold their hair.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this every day, still looks quite good when the motorcycle helmet comes off&lt;br /&gt;I mix this with Sebastian clay and use it after washing my hair</li>
            <li> One of the more helpful products to give texture to hair-- non intrusive and makes your hair stay where you put it and also shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, not sticky and works well. It also rinses out of the hair easily without the need for a washing. It was recommended to me by my stylist. Better than any hair gel or putty out there and all you need is a tiny bit of product when using.</li>
            <li> SO GREAT AND SO IS  THE  PRICE FOR THIS STUFF. best hair product around!!!1 I know you will love it as much as i did</li>
            <li> After finding a hair style that suits me perfectly, I needed to find a styling product that could amp it up. I would describe my hair as thick and somewhat course. When I was using gel it would give my hair shape but not volume, depth, and texture. With the Microweb Fiber, it gave me all that without the stiffness of gel. I&#x27;d consider my hair style to be a mellowed out faux hawk so the top is more evenly cut and have a somewhat thick layer of hair with the sides and back really short. I wanted my hair to feel soft and Sebastian delivers it. The way I use it it makes my hair sticky, but not in the sense of glue sticky. It&#x27;s hard to describe but it feels more like a hair that hasn&#x27;t been shampooed in a few days. Poor description but my point is it makes my hair feel soft. Whereas gel or mousse or hair spray  would allow people to see my scalp through my hair, Sebastian creates a puffiness that produces volume and fills in voids between clumps/strands of my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product - have tried other brands but no where near the pliable texture that can be rearranged</li>
            <li> I simply cannot go out the house without using this product.  Absolutely FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!  Price even better.  Thanks a Million!!!!!!!  Happy in Folsom.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years and even with the upgrading and changing by Sebastian I still find it is the best for my fine, frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years and continue to love it.  It is great for a lightweight styling and eliminating frizz</li>
            <li> My hairdresser first used this on my hair a year or say back. I love it. Don&#x27;t use too much. I have very thick coarse hair and only use a pea size amount and that works just fine.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great, if your going for that messy hair look and you need a product that is very easy to apply. slightly damp hair and dime sized amount &#x3D; win</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I was looking for a spider web like effect.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Love Amazon for ease of ordering!  Delivery was very quick.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product when you want your hair to separate your hair strands and show off your hair.  I use it on the ends of my hair when I have an &amp;#34;up-do&amp;#34;.....it makes the ends spread out and look very striking!</li>
            <li> Great for sculpting the hair without the stickiness. It isn&#x27;t for spiking your hair up but for giving it definition.</li>
            <li> I have tested more gels/pastes than I care to admit.  Let&#x27;s face it, our appearance is important because it is the first thing people see.  It is part of the all important first impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t harden (i.e. no helmet), it doesn&#x27;t flake (no need to explain that &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have dandruff, it&#x27;s the gel&amp;#34;), and it is not greasy.  Additionally, you need minimal amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price.  Fast shipping, well packaged.</li>
            <li> I use this product to separate my long layers to give my hair movement.  Start out with a very small amount, rub between fingers to warm, then comb fingers through the areas desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I stopped using this product, although it&#x27;s still in my cabinet with a bunch of other products I probably won&#x27;t use again.  Even using tiny amount, it&#x27;s too tacky/sticky.</li>
            <li> I have very short, spiky hair and have grown tired of the \\&quot;thickening glue\\&quot; hair product that I have been using. Just too sticky. My hairstylist tried this on me at my last appt and I could not believe how nice and spiky, but not hard or sticky my hair was. I went right out and bought some and could not be more pleased. This stuff is the best hair product I have ever used. I will continue to buy it. It is well worth the price. So happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It keeps one&#x27;s hair neat and in place without being too stiff or too greasy.  Really great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I took a risk in ordering this product online. I was after the salon quality, Sebastian has a department store line and this unfortunately came from that without me having any way to know until it arrived. Kept it anyway and gave it a shot, works satisfactorily,</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a male with 2-3 inch long hair. i bought one bottle and loved it, but the amount i loved it wasn&#x27;t worth spending 4-5X what i normally do. it worked like it said (hold without the grease or crunchiness). it washed out easily and went in fairly easily, although it&#x27;s kind of hard to work in to dry hair as the product is fairly dry too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i put it in my hair every day and went through the bottle in about 1-1&amp;1/2 months with about a dime to nickle size amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i had more money to spend on it, i would gladly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair style is short and spiky and this gel spikes it perfectly and lasts all day. You only need to use a little dab in your palm. Have used this brand for several years now and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...a little pricey, but only takes small amount.  Prefer Sebastian Threads but this one works well.  Great for textured styles but only use a little bit!!!</li>
            <li> A web like stylisher product! Easy to use, practical results, amazing look! That&#x27;s a great idea to have one of this at home! Enjoy it!</li>
            <li> It,s a very good product  and I,ll be looking for it whenever I can. Very good seller.</li>
            <li> Insanely expensive hair product that your well groomed child will be convinced is the only product that will adequately give the necessary firmness to his do.</li>
            <li> The texture is not the same as the one I bought in the store. It does not have web-like tendencies. It just feels like cream.</li>
            <li> Great product  holds just right not to stiff and great for longer hair. After all the women run their fingers through my hair it doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I got my haircut and the woman told me to get this it is great, she told me only to use a pea-sized amount or it gives you a wet looking hair and to only use when your hair is fully dry. Perfect item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product several times and love it.  The most recent bottle I received was different.  It&#x27;s not as thick as the prior bottles.  I might try it another order when I run out of this, but becuase of the cost, verdict is still out.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Trying to find a replacement fore Pureology Texture Twist. This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> great price for a quality product</li>
            <li> Speaking from experiece many items are sold being pass due date. Just imagine contacting every seller asking who&#x27;s got new authentic product - good luck! Just go buy it from a beauty supply. Guaranteed to get great product.&lt;br /&gt;As of the product itself I&#x27;ve been using it for years to get my crazy waives under control. Like the product,</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li> not sure how it helps :?</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, short, processed hair! After washing my hair and towel drying. I use about a dime size of this product applied all over my hair. It adds volume and control to my hair. Now on top of this I use a little mousse and texturizer by same company and dry my hair with a diffuser. I hardly have to do anything else! I hope they will keep this product! PLEASE!!! Prior to this I was using Sebastian Threads which discontinued!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product at a salon, and while getting it here is cheaper it is a bit expensive for what it does. The great thing is that unlike gels and other products, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; at the end of the day, but you can still tell there has been product put in it. Overall it&#x27;s nice, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll continue using it due to the price.</li>
            <li> perfect for my husbands strong hair</li>
            <li> I can purchase this from my beautician but I would pay more for it there.  I have used this product got a while so I knew I would be satisfied when purchasing it.</li>
            <li> If you have short hair that you need to style without it being a rock, this is your product. My hair is cut almost identical to pink and miley cyrus. I use a curling iron and then use this to push it up with a little hairspray and it lasts all day! when I wear it flat ironed and down I use very very little of it and pull pieces ! It&#x27;s a very good product!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It takes a tiny amount warmed up between my fingers to give a piece-y look to my shoulder length hair. The fragrance is very light and pleasant. It takes such a small amount for me this will last me for a long time. This is a good value and I will buy again when I finally run out!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced it to me, and I like the effect it produced.  I found it to be much less expensive online than in the&lt;br /&gt;salon.</li>
