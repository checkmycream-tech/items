            <li>my teeth were notacebly whiter :)</li>
            <li>ok However  the Syringe  is almost imposible to push and the  product leaks out the top</li>
            <li>I took my mouth pieces and put them over the top of the bleach.</li>
            <li>If you do this part the way I did, make sure that you have cleaned all of the gel out and washed/dried both plates.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>so be sure to wipe excess off your gums.</li>
            <li>Nothing at all to push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced great discomfort with the trays even though I was careful not to overload them.</li>
            <li>DO NOT leave them in there more than 3 or 4 secs</li>
            <li>this product was okay</li>
            <li>I will be updating once I use it more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about the free refills!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal which includes fast shipping.</li>
            <li>he finds it easier to use and has had much better results.  </li>
            <li>(tip - make sure to trim the dental trays to the length of your teeth - this is what protects your gums from exposure)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I ended up leaving the top try unformed and just clipped it instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad I did</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better one.</li>
            <li>Comes with 2 tubes of solution, top and bottom trays and a whitening brush pen.</li>
            <li>whitening works for a person is mostly genetic, my fiance had never tried it before</li>
            <li>I love this product and the free refills are an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>and man am I glad.  </li>
            <li>but for me it was just ok...</li>
            <li>, the customer service provided by the company is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>While I am sure the gel in this works wonders, the dental trays are a pain.</li>
            <li>I get gingivitis quite often and I was able to use this product with no problems.</li>
            <li>so glad i was given the opportunity to test this teeth whitening kit for free for testing and review purposes!</li>
            <li>but mine was slightly more noticible than my spouses.</li>
            <li>It works I will be using it 2 or 3 times a week until I get the desired results and then as a touch up after too many colas.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find another product with a better price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product.  </li>
            <li>could be packaged better but the product works.</li>
            <li>just wish it came in a better packaging for storing everything that would fit nicely into your bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>So Simple to use and works great!</li>
            <li>When I have a more noticeable difference I will upload before and after pics.</li>

            <li>I received a discount for this to provide my honest and unbiased opinion on this, and in my opinion it&#x27;s a quality product that you&#x27;ll only have to buy once and can use for years to come.</li>

            <li>You will not only get amazing results with this product, you will also get them fast!  </li>
            <li>This most likely played a part in my whitening effect or lack thereof because I was only able to stand it for a good ten minutes</li>

            <li>Great product, my teeth are starting to get white!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I can definitely tell a difference but not as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>The unlimited refills excites me; however the gel I received appears that it will last a long time, but its still nice to know I can use this indefinitely and not have to purchase more gel.</li>
            <li>Whitened my teeth very fast.  </li>
            <li>then it said i would, and it was very reasonable with price.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I am a smoker and couldn&#x27;t believe it provided very fast results.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend,shipping was fast and free refills you cant beat that.</li>
            <li>It comes with upper and lower tray, two large tubes of whitening gel, a color card to keep track of how your teeth color is changing, and an easy applicator brush!</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried a product like this.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their smile, believe me it is a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>It came exactly as described</li>
            <li>Many of them by big companies, but they all didnt work on my teeth.</li>
            <li>If you want whiter teeth, then this is absolutely your product!</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>This kit works fast!</li>
            <li>Fast results too!</li>
            <li>After just one use my teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li>tried putting the molds in hot water out of a water dispenser.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I remember using a teeth whitening kit.</li>
            <li>My teeth did look whiter when I was finished using this pen the first time.</li>
            <li>This kit really worked!</li>
            <li>After using the Teeth Whitening Kit I saw some amazingly fast results; my teeth have become noticeably whiter in just one week of use!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s affordable and fast, yippee!</li>
            <li>gum was the first to follow when using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>question is, what price are you willing to pay for whiter teeth?</li>
            <li>Well after a few clean-ups from the local dentist and using this kit, I can sincerely say that my teeth look just as good as they did before I started smoking.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I have used the first dose of this teeth whitening system.</li>
            <li>so I would make sure I was using it on the same set of teeth each time.</li>
            <li>Next you can not order more then 1 tube at a time and must pay shipping for each tube.</li>
            <li>I was only able to keep the tray in for ages minutes.</li>
            <li>I had people notice my teeth within the first week.</li>
            <li>So I checked with my dentist first about the ingredients used in this kit.</li>
            <li>I waited for it to thaw out and used the first application.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Please be AWARE, do not take the manufacturer&#x27;s warning about not getting the gel on gums, mucus mebranes of the mouth etc</li>
            <li>and I was only able to keep the gel on for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>also fast results!</li>
            <li>I used it and on the first day I could see the difference.</li>
            <li>First off the tray did not mold to my teeth</li>
            <li>So many different ones on the market</li>
            <li>Just be carefull when putting the tray in the hot water I kinda messed mine up</li>
            <li>I used yesterday when it arrived, and after 2 hours with it, I already can see some difference on the first usage.</li>
            <li>If one is willing to leave in for a longer period of time,  it does work gradually.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t argue with the price of this product, especially since it comes with free refills!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeng more results upon regular use.</li>
            <li>Much better than white strips</li>
            <li>Repeat for the 2nd tray then place on the top, pressing with your fingers while you cinch your teeth together.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed how fast this product works!</li>
            <li>Works well, for someone who drinks coffee daily it helps for sure</li>
            <li>On my first try using the kit, I found wearing the trays caused my jaw to hurt and made me drool a ton.</li>
            <li>When making the trays, make sure the water is boiling and not over the burner - dip the tray holding onto the tab for 3 seconds, remove and immediately put in your mouth and press down with your fingers for the first tray to form fit the bottom tray around your teeth.  </li>
            <li>about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tray is very tricky to mold right.</li>
            <li>Deep whitening, fast results, and super easy so stop searching and save money and time by clicking the link below:  </li>
            <li>Works great, but it can make your teeth a little sensitive.</li>
            <li>This kit seems expensive, but the fact that the refills are free makes it a very worthwhile buy!</li>
            <li>After I opened the package and read the instructions in the pamphlet, I was really happy to see that they were only a few steps rather than a full page of instructions and warnings like I had seen before.</li>
            <li>I have used several different products trying to whiten my teeth after having braces for 2 years but none has really been successful.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen was easy to apply, has a slight mint flavor, and easily sticks to the teeth.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t diligent about using it every day after the first 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say for certain.</li>
            <li>There is no better feeling, than to have a great white smile!</li>
            <li>The positive reviews are from the seller.  </li>
            <li>roommate got a free professionally done kit when he switched to a new local dentist, and the comparison is striking.  </li>
            <li>My results were fast - and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I found 2 giant 10ml 36% carbamide for only $11.00 with free shipping over 25 bucks http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00608KP6A/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;m&#x3D;AEGCJ1I7IRYME which sounds like a much much better deal</li>
            <li>It was shipped fast and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The white strips that others offer generally do not fit my bite pattern very well; the trays on this are totally customizable (instructions included), and I am looking forward to using this product more in the future to keep my smile looking great!</li>
            <li>This product really has amazing results, compared to any other product of its kind, this is what you need to get hand&#x27;s down.</li>
            <li>Everything was in the sealed pouch and the instructions are simple and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>I had no problems working the syringes but the trays work too well when you put them in water to make a form to your teeth, making the trays less effective if you can believe it.</li>
            <li>and I am willing to give this product a couple of more tries before I just give up on it altogether.</li>
            <li>My teeth are 10x as white as before and their not dull colored any more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a whole lot of other stuff, a lot of it has been a lot more expensive, and this has provided the best and fastest results.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it for everyone who wants white and healthy teeth...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The refills are a huge plus, I&#x27;ll be using the product to do maintenance on my smile for a long time!</li>
            <li>The pen is easy to use and it is much easier to ensure the product is only on the teeth and does not irritate the gumline.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simple to use, fast, easy, everything is already put together for you.</li>
            <li>My teeth are really healthy looking, white but look very natural .</li>
            <li>Good Product was a little weary due to some of the negative reviews but purchased anyway and was amazingly suprised !!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the color of my teeth with using these trays, that could be because a lot of the product floated to the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing but make my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works</li>
            <li>The item was shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li>The results were more than I&#x27;d expected.  </li>
            <li>The whitening pen is really convenient too.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>This is a product I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast too.</li>
            <li>I had fast results with this teeth whitening product.</li>
            <li>I am very picky and germ-o-phobic when it comes to things like that.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>And fast results.</li>
            <li>I noticed really fast results</li>
            <li>Also it was shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li>I will give this product as a whole 3 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone that wants whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>This is kit includes everything you needed to whiten my teeth at a very affordable and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li>The fast results made me hooked</li>
            <li>If anyone has ordered the refill please comment and let me know if you can, thanks.</li>
            <li>I got fast results in a matter of days.</li>
            <li>also it was shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different whiteners and this is one that ges great results fast.  </li>
            <li>This teeth whitening formula worked FAST.</li>
            <li>I got this product extremely fast and it also produced fast results.</li>
            <li>I found that the teeth whitening kit really helped my teeth</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It’s really working for me after five treatments, my front teeth have already started to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But the peroxide didn’t affect the taste much, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Along with that you will get a link to a video that walks you through each step of the process to get everything ready to use the kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li>So really concentrate on that step.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice a scent at all</li>
            <li>but I did not see much improvement.</li>
            <li>Very worrisome.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and was just as described.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li>The rubber mold that&#x27;s supposed to adapt to your mouth shape doesn&#x27;t work very well-</li>
            <li>This teeth whitening kit really helped that out.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast in the mail also.  </li>
            <li>when using this product after a week really notice the change.</li>
            <li>really recommend</li>
            <li>With that said, it worked much faster than strips and lasted longer too, just a pain in the butt using the trays</li>
            <li>My teeth are much much whiter....</li>
            <li>I really like this solution it has been a week</li>
            <li>, I used to much</li>
            <li>it arrived so fast</li>
            <li>It was shipped fast and as described.  </li>
            <li>My mouth didn&#x27;t really stop burning until Saturday.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li>It comes with everything you need - upper and lower trays that can be molded to fit your teeth,  </li>
            <li>This kit was delivered really fast.</li>
            <li>Last night I tried it with the light.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li>Used it once and can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>First off I was surprised at how this product was shipped fast and as described!</li>
            <li>This product is really good, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the free refills that come with it.</li>
            <li>, the last ten minuites were me squirming around trying to not choke on my own saliva (that felt like battery acid)</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and so far it has not left my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other kit I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have tried other teeth whitening products and I prefer this one better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other whiteners and find this to be the fastest and lasts the longest.</li>
            <li>Better than other whitening products.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about it at first but the results I saw from this product were great.</li>
            <li>They mainly cover getting the mouth pieces ready and forming them to your mouth.</li>
            <li>The tray does not fit to each tooth individually but it will fit more snug to your whole roll of teeth.</li>
            <li>My daughter has been bugging me to get her those white strips you purchase at a pharmacy or department store, and when I saw these being offered during a promotion I knew I had to take advantage of the special being offered.</li>
            <li>Ready to have super white teeth at a fraction of the cost of store brands and Dental Whitening systems</li>
            <li>Simple to use, easy instruction, complete kit to get started.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in sales, and looking clean is more or less a prerequisite when dealing with the public.</li>
            <li>(Glad to say they don&#x27;t glow in the dark).  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I hold the syringe and force the pencil down on the counter top.  </li>
            <li>I drink a lot of coffee and if I cut down I probably would have seen more severe differences but did start to see them after a week.</li>
            <li>I am going to give this two stars for right now, because I barely noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>Just Super white teeth.</li>
            <li>The product works exactly as described and has such fast results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many similar products such as Crest and Aquafreshs strips, as well as OTC bleaching products and they either dont work or dont list.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product was shocked by how much whiter my teeth looked after one application</li>
            <li>To start off you are to put a dab of gel in each tooth impression if you were lucky enough to get them.</li>
            <li>For instance, if you are pregnant, exposed roots, or recent surgery in the mouth/jaw area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Much better than any other I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>On the other hand if you have sensitive gums be prepared to feel like someone has struck a torch up in your mouth and throwing gasoline on top of it.</li>
            <li>For the price it is you would think it would be a little better</li>
            <li>so far my teeth have got a shader whiteeer !!</li>
            <li>really easy to use too, no funny taste or smell either.</li>
            <li>It is not too expensive, and has great results.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I bought this whitening product but its a great deal that includes the whitening pen.</li>
            <li>I have not used the full kit and only the brush on gel so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s as good as going to the dentist to have it done, I might try that next.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that we have the trays so its not as messy.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this item and, though I just began using it, I have very positive things to say.  </li>
            <li>I felt like a new person and had my smile back.</li>
            <li>I tried this product due to the high rating plus it says free refills</li>
            <li>Not only that I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products that you have to leave in for a long times so that was nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different products from CVS and nothing seems to get rid of the yellow tint from smoking but after trying this I went from yellow to a BRIGHT white.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, they sent a new one.</li>
            <li>, it includes everything you need to professionally whiten your teeth at home,  one of friends has used it last month, and recommended it highly, it is worth a try</li>
            <li>Although it is nice you only have to use it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>but my teeth were very sensitive after it</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive front teeth</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>, I will continue to order this in the future as i am an avid coffee drinker.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Within a week I noticed my teeth are so pretty and white.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still excited to use the kit, especially because it has personal shape conforming trays AND a whitening pen.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and better than any product I&#x27;ve tried in the past or bought at a drug store.</li>
            <li>Ive used many teeth whiting products and I have never ever ever achieved my teeth to become whiter in a matter of a few days!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The price was better than I have paid in the past.</li>
            <li>the taste is not bad - just like a bitter candy.</li>
            <li>I personally used higher end kits that didn&#x27;t really fit on my teeth correctly, which left my teeth white only in certain spots.</li>
            <li>Molding the tray to fit my mouth was probably the easiest and less discomforting part of this whitening kit.</li>
            <li>so let&#x27;s say that is not enough, they also offer a full money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>I was super wary of this product because of how cheap it is - but the positive reviews convinced me</li>
            <li>I was nervous at first when I saw the multiple different tubes of product but appreciated the mouth piece.</li>
            <li>So on my third time I placed the mouth piece in the boiling water for 30 seconds and then quickly to my mouth in the same manner.</li>
            <li>It had super fast results and you can&#x27;t go wrong for the deal and with free refills</li>
            <li>Pure white teeth</li>
            <li>I found that I was having a hard time keeping my lips from touching my teeth</li>
            <li>Other whitening products are awfully expensive, this kit was the right price and worked amazingly!</li>
            <li>My pen had a clear cap, and you twist the bottom to move the product into the pen.</li>
            <li>I especially like how there&#x27;s fast results.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really ever put in my mouth besides my braces was a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Before using this kit, I used to be so self conscious about my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a product offer such fast results.  </li>
            <li>If you want white teeth fast</li>
            <li>I could only leave it on for 10 minutes (think I put to much product in tray)</li>
            <li>Ive tried many different tooth whitening products before only for my teeth to return back yellow after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I had no teeth sensitivity, just fast results and white teeth!</li>
            <li>Not only did I get fast results, I also saved quite a bit of money.</li>
            <li>I got white teeth fast for an interview</li>
            <li>The results I received were fast and definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Not to mention I had an issue with packaging and the seller (Market-Ology Group Inc) immediately fixed the matter.</li>
            <li>I also have fairly sensitive teeth, and I was surprised to see that they didn&#x27;t cause a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li>Instead, I use a brush, apply the gel directly to my teeth and then place the forms in my mouth to prevent the gel from getting all over my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>but I did not see much improvement and am not a big fan Of the taste in my mouth</li>
            <li>I receive a lot of compliments when I use it, and I use it frequently as I drink coffee and tea and it stains my teeth.</li>
            <li>I was a smoker so naturally my teeth were stained from it.</li>
            <li>I had such fast results using the whitening pen.  </li>
            <li>The company even offers &amp;#34;free refills&amp;#34;, but you must pay a shipping cost.</li>
            <li>MY bottom row of gums are completely messed up now.</li>
            <li>I just started using it, and i like it so far.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>whitens but my mouth must be really sensitive to this</li>
            <li>Not only do you come out of this with an amazingly white smile</li>
            <li>Get you sparkling smile back again in only seven days!</li>
            <li>I ordered a (free!) refill; a few days later I received an email from the company, apologizing for the delay and refunding me the cost of S&amp;H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the quality of the product and the customer service</li>
            <li>Since my teeth are only at about a 3 in the chart I decided to only test the whitening pen for right</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used mouth-guards and such for sports, it&#x27;s exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to never find a whitening product that actually worked let alone that gave me such fast results!</li>
            <li>difference is profound-</li>
            <li>I am using this in conjunction with the Colgate Optic White toothpaste and because I have fairly white teeth in the first place</li>
            <li>When I got the product it came with 2 mouth pieces, a pen teeth whitener, and 2 of the gel, I&#x27;ve only used the gel to this day but you can easily see the difference in as little as 2 days.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple way to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li>The mold they did is much thinner (easier to use, less gagging), and really molds precisely to his teeth, meaning very little leakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is possible that part of the problem relates to the lack of concrete directions and the cheapness of the whitening trays.</li>
            <li>long as you really take your time with the trays I think you&#x27;ll be find.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a smoker and is trying to get back to their white smile.</li>
            <li>My girl loves the new look and so do my future ones</li>
            <li>I have a history of sensitivity that makes me unable to use most products, which is a bummer because I drink black coffee and red wine, like many people have stated.  </li>
            <li>As someone who is self-conscious about the color of their teeth, I needed a fast and simple solution to whiten my teeth in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different teeth whitening products with limited success.  </li>
            <li>The results were alot faster than expected, and were really noticeable.</li>
            <li>My teeth are definitely extra sensitive while having the gel on, and the amount of drool is unreal.</li>
            <li>Some of my family members actually asked if I got my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I have used the carbamide twice and the pen twice so far and my teeth are probably several shades lighter.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking to whiten their teeth without the hassle or cost of having to go to the dentist and have it done professionally.</li>
            <li>I expected too much from this product.</li>
            <li>I followed all the directions and so far I haven&#x27;t had any gum pain or sensitivity, my teeth look amazingly white!</li>
            <li>end result is as good as if not better than other more expensive products that I have tried!</li>
            <li>I even tried the whitening pen the next day, and while that was LESS of a MESS, that burned even MORE</li>
            <li>It works VERY quickly and very well at the same time, other kits I&#x27;ve tried in the past took literally about 4-5 times as long to start taking effect.</li>
            <li>The whitening pen instructions are clearly for a different model whitening pen - they describe a blue cap and pushing a silver tip to dispense.</li>
            <li>I recently got a crown on my back molar and though it didn&#x27;t have direct contact with the gel there was no sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I thought the pen was broken at first since I had to click and hold about 60 times before the first bit of gel came out.</li>
            <li>Also, this kit was much cheaper than the other brands, but uses the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The time to whiten is not long at all.</li>
            <li>I had a spot of trouble with the website the first time I went to order the refill.</li>
            <li>After using this teeth whitening kit, I saw positive results within a few days.</li>
            <li>There was some gel that accumulated in the back of my throat with this method also but it didn&#x27;t seem like there was as much, maybe because less gel is used when using this pen versus the inserts.</li>
            <li>This time there was only a slight sign of a couple of teeth in the whole tray.</li>
            <li>Fast results without the long wait of other whiteners.</li>

            <li> but many others have expressed their discontent with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> and i love it.</li>

            <li> But overall great product!</li>
            <li> Just started using the product, so not yet sure it will work.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get a free refill!</li>
            <li> The Teeth Whitening Kit took away all the stains, and the free refills are an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> and they tend to be more pricey).  </li>
            <li> A great product and at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product in just 1 use</li>
            <li> my teeth were notacebly whiter :)</li>
            <li> ok However  the Syringe  is almost imposible to push and the  product leaks out the top</li>
            <li> I took my mouth pieces and put them over the top of the bleach.</li>
            <li> If you do this part the way I did, make sure that you have cleaned all of the gel out and washed/dried both plates.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> so be sure to wipe excess off your gums.</li>
            <li> Nothing at all to push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced great discomfort with the trays even though I was careful not to overload them.</li>
            <li> DO NOT leave them in there more than 3 or 4 secs</li>
            <li> this product was okay</li>
            <li> I will be updating once I use it more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about the free refills!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal which includes fast shipping.</li>
            <li> he finds it easier to use and has had much better results.  </li>
            <li> (tip - make sure to trim the dental trays to the length of your teeth - this is what protects your gums from exposure)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I ended up leaving the top try unformed and just clipped it instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> glad I did</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better one.</li>
            <li> Comes with 2 tubes of solution, top and bottom trays and a whitening brush pen.</li>
            <li> whitening works for a person is mostly genetic, my fiance had never tried it before</li>
            <li> I love this product and the free refills are an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> and man am I glad.  </li>
            <li> but for me it was just ok...</li>
            <li> , the customer service provided by the company is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> While I am sure the gel in this works wonders, the dental trays are a pain.</li>
            <li> I get gingivitis quite often and I was able to use this product with no problems.</li>
            <li> so glad i was given the opportunity to test this teeth whitening kit for free for testing and review purposes!</li>
            <li> but mine was slightly more noticible than my spouses.</li>
            <li> It works I will be using it 2 or 3 times a week until I get the desired results and then as a touch up after too many colas.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find another product with a better price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.  </li>
            <li> could be packaged better but the product works.</li>
            <li> just wish it came in a better packaging for storing everything that would fit nicely into your bathroom vanity.</li>

            <li> So i quickly swished water in my mouth and that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> got here so quick</li>
            <li> They worked fast and were very effective, shipped fast and the value is amazing compared to other methods.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying it out you should be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> You see a huge difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in the free refill offer...</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see how white my teeth are now.</li>
            <li> personally like this better than the strips as I think it is thorough and more powerful.  </li>
            <li> and the free refills just make it that much easier!</li>
            <li> First off, this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I will be interested to see how the free refills go when I get to that point</li>
            <li> Worked immediately and saw fantastic results in the first week.</li>
            <li> It conveniently comes in large syringes that you easily apply in the trays.  </li>
            <li> Directions were easy to follow, and the whole process was really quick.</li>
            <li> I have been using it less than a week and can tell a great difference.</li>
            <li> Taste isn&#x27;t super but worth the results.</li>
            <li> The pens make it easy to dispense the gel to not get to much, Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, and really works.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly that!</li>
            <li> The set up for the mouth trays was very easy and it reminded me of breaking in any other mouth guard, except this one fit comfortably in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I actually have the confidence to smile freely now!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain about the fast and free shipping.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain about the fast and free shipping.</li>
            <li> The free refills of whitener really sealed the deal for me.</li>
            <li> amazing results in a short time  worth every penny</li>
            <li> I think she will enjoy the product as much as I did.</li>
            <li> and I still have a nice white smile.</li>
            <li> The result i got were phenomenal and with a year of free refills how can you not have an amazingly white smile?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many teeth whitening systems, but this is by far a standout.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this to provide my honest and unbiased opinion on this, and in my opinion it&#x27;s a quality product that you&#x27;ll only have to buy once and can use for years to come.</li>
            <li> People commented on how my smile has improved.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nice if the product came with one or two extra trays.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> and then you feel like you are wasting your time or leaving them on forever, or too powerful</li>
            <li> Change the world one smile at a time.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I was asked to review this, because it really is working, and I am glad I finally found something that is!</li>
            <li> definitely worth using..</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> Love it so far</li>
            <li> The instructions are super easy to follow, and if you actually boil and cut the trays to fit your teeth</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this was included but have been enjoying it very much.  </li>
            <li> price is right too...</li>
            <li> so I purchased this for him as the price was right for a test.  </li>
            <li> You will not only get amazing results with this product, you will also get them fast!  </li>
            <li> This most likely played a part in my whitening effect or lack thereof because I was only able to stand it for a good ten minutes</li>
            <li> If only I had read the honest (1-star) reviews first, I would have saved a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone looking for fantastic results.</li>
            <li> After just a few applications I am seeing amazing results!</li>
            <li> have found baking soda is more effective than this product for whitening, but I believe the efficacy of this product will be different for each individual.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with this product, it works very well and isn&#x27;t harsh at all, I was able to see amazing results in a short amount of time, and what could make it better than the free refills!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and is worth the money!</li>
            <li> and the company delivers super fast.</li>
            <li> I really disliked my yellow teeth, now I can look my best at all times!</li>
            <li> I really like the quick results i had</li>
            <li> It arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> Great product, my teeth are starting to get white!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I can definitely tell a difference but not as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> The unlimited refills excites me; however the gel I received appears that it will last a long time, but its still nice to know I can use this indefinitely and not have to purchase more gel.</li>
            <li> Whitened my teeth very fast.  </li>
            <li> then it said i would, and it was very reasonable with price.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a smoker and couldn&#x27;t believe it provided very fast results.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend,shipping was fast and free refills you cant beat that.</li>
            <li> It comes with upper and lower tray, two large tubes of whitening gel, a color card to keep track of how your teeth color is changing, and an easy applicator brush!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried a product like this.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their smile, believe me it is a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> It came exactly as described</li>
            <li> Many of them by big companies, but they all didnt work on my teeth.</li>
            <li> If you want whiter teeth, then this is absolutely your product!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> This kit works fast!</li>
            <li> Fast results too!</li>
            <li> After just one use my teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li> tried putting the molds in hot water out of a water dispenser.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I remember using a teeth whitening kit.</li>
            <li> My teeth did look whiter when I was finished using this pen the first time.</li>
            <li> This kit really worked!</li>
            <li> After using the Teeth Whitening Kit I saw some amazingly fast results; my teeth have become noticeably whiter in just one week of use!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s affordable and fast, yippee!</li>
            <li> gum was the first to follow when using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> question is, what price are you willing to pay for whiter teeth?</li>
            <li> Well after a few clean-ups from the local dentist and using this kit, I can sincerely say that my teeth look just as good as they did before I started smoking.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I have used the first dose of this teeth whitening system.</li>
            <li> so I would make sure I was using it on the same set of teeth each time.</li>
            <li> Next you can not order more then 1 tube at a time and must pay shipping for each tube.</li>
            <li> I was only able to keep the tray in for ages minutes.</li>
            <li> I had people notice my teeth within the first week.</li>
            <li> So I checked with my dentist first about the ingredients used in this kit.</li>
            <li> I waited for it to thaw out and used the first application.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Please be AWARE, do not take the manufacturer&#x27;s warning about not getting the gel on gums, mucus mebranes of the mouth etc</li>
            <li> and I was only able to keep the gel on for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> also fast results!</li>
            <li> I used it and on the first day I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> First off the tray did not mold to my teeth</li>
            <li> So many different ones on the market</li>
            <li> Just be carefull when putting the tray in the hot water I kinda messed mine up</li>
            <li> I used yesterday when it arrived, and after 2 hours with it, I already can see some difference on the first usage.</li>
            <li> If one is willing to leave in for a longer period of time,  it does work gradually.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t argue with the price of this product, especially since it comes with free refills!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeng more results upon regular use.</li>
            <li> Much better than white strips</li>
            <li> Repeat for the 2nd tray then place on the top, pressing with your fingers while you cinch your teeth together.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed how fast this product works!</li>
            <li> Works well, for someone who drinks coffee daily it helps for sure</li>
            <li> On my first try using the kit, I found wearing the trays caused my jaw to hurt and made me drool a ton.</li>
            <li> When making the trays, make sure the water is boiling and not over the burner - dip the tray holding onto the tab for 3 seconds, remove and immediately put in your mouth and press down with your fingers for the first tray to form fit the bottom tray around your teeth.  </li>
            <li> about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tray is very tricky to mold right.</li>
            <li> Deep whitening, fast results, and super easy so stop searching and save money and time by clicking the link below:  </li>
            <li> Works great, but it can make your teeth a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> This kit seems expensive, but the fact that the refills are free makes it a very worthwhile buy!</li>
            <li> After I opened the package and read the instructions in the pamphlet, I was really happy to see that they were only a few steps rather than a full page of instructions and warnings like I had seen before.</li>
            <li> I have used several different products trying to whiten my teeth after having braces for 2 years but none has really been successful.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen was easy to apply, has a slight mint flavor, and easily sticks to the teeth.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t diligent about using it every day after the first 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say for certain.</li>
            <li> There is no better feeling, than to have a great white smile!</li>
            <li> The positive reviews are from the seller.  </li>
            <li> roommate got a free professionally done kit when he switched to a new local dentist, and the comparison is striking.  </li>
            <li> My results were fast - and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I found 2 giant 10ml 36% carbamide for only $11.00 with free shipping over 25 bucks http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00608KP6A/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;m&#x3D;AEGCJ1I7IRYME which sounds like a much much better deal</li>
            <li> It was shipped fast and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The white strips that others offer generally do not fit my bite pattern very well; the trays on this are totally customizable (instructions included), and I am looking forward to using this product more in the future to keep my smile looking great!</li>
            <li> This product really has amazing results, compared to any other product of its kind, this is what you need to get hand&#x27;s down.</li>
            <li> Everything was in the sealed pouch and the instructions are simple and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I had no problems working the syringes but the trays work too well when you put them in water to make a form to your teeth, making the trays less effective if you can believe it.</li>
            <li> and I am willing to give this product a couple of more tries before I just give up on it altogether.</li>
            <li> My teeth are 10x as white as before and their not dull colored any more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a whole lot of other stuff, a lot of it has been a lot more expensive, and this has provided the best and fastest results.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it for everyone who wants white and healthy teeth...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The refills are a huge plus, I&#x27;ll be using the product to do maintenance on my smile for a long time!</li>
            <li> The pen is easy to use and it is much easier to ensure the product is only on the teeth and does not irritate the gumline.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple to use, fast, easy, everything is already put together for you.</li>
            <li> My teeth are really healthy looking, white but look very natural .</li>
            <li> Good Product was a little weary due to some of the negative reviews but purchased anyway and was amazingly suprised !!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the color of my teeth with using these trays, that could be because a lot of the product floated to the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing but make my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works</li>
            <li> The item was shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li> The results were more than I&#x27;d expected.  </li>
            <li> The whitening pen is really convenient too.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> This is a product I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast too.</li>
            <li> I had fast results with this teeth whitening product.</li>
            <li> I am very picky and germ-o-phobic when it comes to things like that.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> And fast results.</li>
            <li> I noticed really fast results</li>
            <li> Also it was shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li> I will give this product as a whole 3 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone that wants whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This is kit includes everything you needed to whiten my teeth at a very affordable and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> The fast results made me hooked</li>
            <li> If anyone has ordered the refill please comment and let me know if you can, thanks.</li>
            <li> I got fast results in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> also it was shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different whiteners and this is one that ges great results fast.  </li>
            <li> This teeth whitening formula worked FAST.</li>
            <li> I got this product extremely fast and it also produced fast results.</li>
            <li> I found that the teeth whitening kit really helped my teeth</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It’s really working for me after five treatments, my front teeth have already started to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But the peroxide didn’t affect the taste much, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Along with that you will get a link to a video that walks you through each step of the process to get everything ready to use the kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> So really concentrate on that step.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice a scent at all</li>
            <li> but I did not see much improvement.</li>
            <li> Very worrisome.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and was just as described.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li> The rubber mold that&#x27;s supposed to adapt to your mouth shape doesn&#x27;t work very well-</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening kit really helped that out.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast in the mail also.  </li>
            <li> when using this product after a week really notice the change.</li>
            <li> really recommend</li>
            <li> With that said, it worked much faster than strips and lasted longer too, just a pain in the butt using the trays</li>
            <li> My teeth are much much whiter....</li>
            <li> I really like this solution it has been a week</li>
            <li> , I used to much</li>
            <li> it arrived so fast</li>
            <li> It was shipped fast and as described.  </li>
            <li> My mouth didn&#x27;t really stop burning until Saturday.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li> It comes with everything you need - upper and lower trays that can be molded to fit your teeth,  </li>
            <li> This kit was delivered really fast.</li>
            <li> Last night I tried it with the light.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> Used it once and can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> First off I was surprised at how this product was shipped fast and as described!</li>
            <li> This product is really good, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the free refills that come with it.</li>
            <li> , the last ten minuites were me squirming around trying to not choke on my own saliva (that felt like battery acid)</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and so far it has not left my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other kit I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried other teeth whitening products and I prefer this one better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other whiteners and find this to be the fastest and lasts the longest.</li>
            <li> Better than other whitening products.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it at first but the results I saw from this product were great.</li>
            <li> They mainly cover getting the mouth pieces ready and forming them to your mouth.</li>
            <li> The tray does not fit to each tooth individually but it will fit more snug to your whole roll of teeth.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been bugging me to get her those white strips you purchase at a pharmacy or department store, and when I saw these being offered during a promotion I knew I had to take advantage of the special being offered.</li>
            <li> Ready to have super white teeth at a fraction of the cost of store brands and Dental Whitening systems</li>
            <li> Simple to use, easy instruction, complete kit to get started.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in sales, and looking clean is more or less a prerequisite when dealing with the public.</li>
            <li> (Glad to say they don&#x27;t glow in the dark).  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I hold the syringe and force the pencil down on the counter top.  </li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and if I cut down I probably would have seen more severe differences but did start to see them after a week.</li>
            <li> I am going to give this two stars for right now, because I barely noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Just Super white teeth.</li>
            <li> The product works exactly as described and has such fast results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many similar products such as Crest and Aquafreshs strips, as well as OTC bleaching products and they either dont work or dont list.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product was shocked by how much whiter my teeth looked after one application</li>
            <li> To start off you are to put a dab of gel in each tooth impression if you were lucky enough to get them.</li>
            <li> For instance, if you are pregnant, exposed roots, or recent surgery in the mouth/jaw area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than any other I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> On the other hand if you have sensitive gums be prepared to feel like someone has struck a torch up in your mouth and throwing gasoline on top of it.</li>
            <li> For the price it is you would think it would be a little better</li>
            <li> so far my teeth have got a shader whiteeer !!</li>
            <li> really easy to use too, no funny taste or smell either.</li>
            <li> It is not too expensive, and has great results.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this whitening product but its a great deal that includes the whitening pen.</li>
            <li> I have not used the full kit and only the brush on gel so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s as good as going to the dentist to have it done, I might try that next.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that we have the trays so its not as messy.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and, though I just began using it, I have very positive things to say.  </li>
            <li> I felt like a new person and had my smile back.</li>
            <li> I tried this product due to the high rating plus it says free refills</li>
            <li> Not only that I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that you have to leave in for a long times so that was nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products from CVS and nothing seems to get rid of the yellow tint from smoking but after trying this I went from yellow to a BRIGHT white.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, they sent a new one.</li>
            <li> , it includes everything you need to professionally whiten your teeth at home,  one of friends has used it last month, and recommended it highly, it is worth a try</li>
            <li> Although it is nice you only have to use it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but my teeth were very sensitive after it</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive front teeth</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> , I will continue to order this in the future as i am an avid coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed my teeth are so pretty and white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still excited to use the kit, especially because it has personal shape conforming trays AND a whitening pen.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and better than any product I&#x27;ve tried in the past or bought at a drug store.</li>
            <li> Ive used many teeth whiting products and I have never ever ever achieved my teeth to become whiter in a matter of a few days!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The price was better than I have paid in the past.</li>
            <li> the taste is not bad - just like a bitter candy.</li>
            <li> I personally used higher end kits that didn&#x27;t really fit on my teeth correctly, which left my teeth white only in certain spots.</li>
            <li> Molding the tray to fit my mouth was probably the easiest and less discomforting part of this whitening kit.</li>
            <li> so let&#x27;s say that is not enough, they also offer a full money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I was super wary of this product because of how cheap it is - but the positive reviews convinced me</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first when I saw the multiple different tubes of product but appreciated the mouth piece.</li>
            <li> So on my third time I placed the mouth piece in the boiling water for 30 seconds and then quickly to my mouth in the same manner.</li>
            <li> It had super fast results and you can&#x27;t go wrong for the deal and with free refills</li>
            <li> Pure white teeth</li>
            <li> I found that I was having a hard time keeping my lips from touching my teeth</li>
            <li> Other whitening products are awfully expensive, this kit was the right price and worked amazingly!</li>
            <li> My pen had a clear cap, and you twist the bottom to move the product into the pen.</li>
            <li> I especially like how there&#x27;s fast results.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really ever put in my mouth besides my braces was a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Before using this kit, I used to be so self conscious about my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a product offer such fast results.  </li>
            <li> If you want white teeth fast</li>
            <li> I could only leave it on for 10 minutes (think I put to much product in tray)</li>
            <li> Ive tried many different tooth whitening products before only for my teeth to return back yellow after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I had no teeth sensitivity, just fast results and white teeth!</li>
            <li> Not only did I get fast results, I also saved quite a bit of money.</li>
            <li> I got white teeth fast for an interview</li>
            <li> The results I received were fast and definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Not to mention I had an issue with packaging and the seller (Market-Ology Group Inc) immediately fixed the matter.</li>
            <li> I also have fairly sensitive teeth, and I was surprised to see that they didn&#x27;t cause a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li> Instead, I use a brush, apply the gel directly to my teeth and then place the forms in my mouth to prevent the gel from getting all over my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> but I did not see much improvement and am not a big fan Of the taste in my mouth</li>
            <li> I receive a lot of compliments when I use it, and I use it frequently as I drink coffee and tea and it stains my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was a smoker so naturally my teeth were stained from it.</li>
            <li> I had such fast results using the whitening pen.  </li>
            <li> The company even offers &amp;#34;free refills&amp;#34;, but you must pay a shipping cost.</li>
            <li> MY bottom row of gums are completely messed up now.</li>
            <li> I just started using it, and i like it so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> whitens but my mouth must be really sensitive to this</li>
            <li> Not only do you come out of this with an amazingly white smile</li>
            <li> Get you sparkling smile back again in only seven days!</li>
            <li> I ordered a (free!) refill; a few days later I received an email from the company, apologizing for the delay and refunding me the cost of S&amp;H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the quality of the product and the customer service</li>
            <li> Since my teeth are only at about a 3 in the chart I decided to only test the whitening pen for right</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used mouth-guards and such for sports, it&#x27;s exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to never find a whitening product that actually worked let alone that gave me such fast results!</li>
            <li> difference is profound-</li>
            <li> I am using this in conjunction with the Colgate Optic White toothpaste and because I have fairly white teeth in the first place</li>
            <li> When I got the product it came with 2 mouth pieces, a pen teeth whitener, and 2 of the gel, I&#x27;ve only used the gel to this day but you can easily see the difference in as little as 2 days.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple way to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> The mold they did is much thinner (easier to use, less gagging), and really molds precisely to his teeth, meaning very little leakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is possible that part of the problem relates to the lack of concrete directions and the cheapness of the whitening trays.</li>
            <li> long as you really take your time with the trays I think you&#x27;ll be find.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a smoker and is trying to get back to their white smile.</li>
            <li> My girl loves the new look and so do my future ones</li>
            <li> I have a history of sensitivity that makes me unable to use most products, which is a bummer because I drink black coffee and red wine, like many people have stated.  </li>
            <li> As someone who is self-conscious about the color of their teeth, I needed a fast and simple solution to whiten my teeth in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different teeth whitening products with limited success.  </li>
            <li> The results were alot faster than expected, and were really noticeable.</li>
            <li> My teeth are definitely extra sensitive while having the gel on, and the amount of drool is unreal.</li>
            <li> Some of my family members actually asked if I got my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I have used the carbamide twice and the pen twice so far and my teeth are probably several shades lighter.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking to whiten their teeth without the hassle or cost of having to go to the dentist and have it done professionally.</li>
            <li> I expected too much from this product.</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions and so far I haven&#x27;t had any gum pain or sensitivity, my teeth look amazingly white!</li>
            <li> end result is as good as if not better than other more expensive products that I have tried!</li>
            <li> I even tried the whitening pen the next day, and while that was LESS of a MESS, that burned even MORE</li>
            <li> It works VERY quickly and very well at the same time, other kits I&#x27;ve tried in the past took literally about 4-5 times as long to start taking effect.</li>
            <li> The whitening pen instructions are clearly for a different model whitening pen - they describe a blue cap and pushing a silver tip to dispense.</li>
            <li> I recently got a crown on my back molar and though it didn&#x27;t have direct contact with the gel there was no sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I thought the pen was broken at first since I had to click and hold about 60 times before the first bit of gel came out.</li>
            <li> Also, this kit was much cheaper than the other brands, but uses the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The time to whiten is not long at all.</li>
            <li> I had a spot of trouble with the website the first time I went to order the refill.</li>
            <li> After using this teeth whitening kit, I saw positive results within a few days.</li>
            <li> There was some gel that accumulated in the back of my throat with this method also but it didn&#x27;t seem like there was as much, maybe because less gel is used when using this pen versus the inserts.</li>
            <li> This time there was only a slight sign of a couple of teeth in the whole tray.</li>
            <li> Fast results without the long wait of other whiteners.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only in my 20&#x27;s but multiple cups of coffee a day and being a regular smoker have already done some serious work on my smile.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t not have any problems squeezing the product out of the syringe like other reviews said, perhaps they fixed the packaging from that time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products, but they made my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> They would whiten a little then they would go back to normal within a couple days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first seeing the list price and all but the product is real whitening gel and not some scam.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put the upper tray back in my mouth because it was already messed up from me boiling it too long</li>
            <li> and it really really really burns if you get it on your gums, but that is almost IMPOSSIBLE (not to get it on your gums or in your mouth) to avoid even when you do boil the mouth guards and mold them to fit your mouth.</li>
            <li> Have tried others products in the past but this one really worked.  </li>
            <li> I boiled the upper tray too long and one side of it melted.</li>
            <li> All I did was heat it to the recommended temperature and set it in my mouth’s natural position, then bite down for a minute or two.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt last long!</li>
            <li> I never really had problems with my teeth not been white, but coffee over the years made them yellow.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few days and like so far!</li>
            <li> I really do not know of any other company that offers this.</li>
            <li> The plunger is a little hard to push but other than that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of review about the tray being a little hard to mold and although true I think it is thicker to withstand the use of time.</li>
            <li> I does make my teeth a little sensitive</li>
            <li> Teeth whitening products are tricky to get right as they are either too weak</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time to get used to the tray, but it works....and you can&#x27;t go wrong with free refills.</li>
            <li> I marked the bottom plate of mine with a small cut at the back of the molar area</li>
            <li> I saw some minor improvement.</li>
            <li> It will also bleach flesh if in contact with skin too long.  </li>
            <li> I have not yet used a long time.</li>
            <li> , I know I will be doing business with them and recommending them for a long time.</li>
            <li> Until last week I never used anything other than a toothpaste for my teeth, but after my g/f&#x27;s suggestion I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of other products that you find at the local stores.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not interested in the different tubes I would not suggest this product.</li>
            <li> The other suggestion is to cut back on the time that it is in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I put the product on my teeth and not even a minute later it started burning which i knew it would because other reviews said it would.</li>
            <li> My bad habits of smoking and coffee drinking had really affected my smile.</li>
            <li> You have to dry the teeth then apply the bleach to your teeth.</li>
            <li> My parents had something similar to this a few years back</li>
            <li> The product works and my teeth are noticeably whiter even though I was unable to complete the whole treatment.</li>
            <li> I was just a little disappointed because I was expected SO much because of how most everyone RAVED about it...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because now that I&#x27;m single</li>
            <li> I am sure I don&#x27;t HAVE to use these trays and could replace them easily enough, but I was very disappointed since that is one of the main features of this teeth whitening kit.</li>
            <li> but I might have had a slight color change because I did not put enough product.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a slight improvement on my bottom teeth will be coming back for refills</li>
            <li> As noted in previous review, however, it was difficult to leave an accurate teeth</li>
            <li> Ive only used it once with little results.</li>
            <li> Ive only used it once with little results so,far.</li>
            <li> I just quit smoking a few months back and have gotten some dental work done that was long over due</li>
            <li> Even when it&#x27;s gotten on my gums the irritation only lasts a few hours and doesn&#x27;t do any permanent damage or bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For all the trouble, go buy some white strips and call it a day.</li>
            <li> The trays can be tricky but I expected that.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to leave the plastic mouth pieces in the boiling water any longer than directed.  </li>
            <li> Will still use once I can get trays, but just be careful if you have an overbite as well, so you are prepared.</li>
            <li> ive only been using this just a few days now</li>
            <li> You can see the difference in color in just a few days and it isn&#x27;t too harsh on sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This works great seen results right away the trays are uncomfortable and the whitening gel taste nasty but it does work!!</li>
            <li> Within days you can see the changes, I would definitely recommend this product to people looking to whiten their teeth for less!</li>
            <li> I have tried other teeth whitening products before with not much luck.</li>
            <li> i took it off and the bottom of my gums where completely raw and white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products and they worked but didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> that any other kit, and it comes with the whitening pen.  </li>
            <li> You will need to be one or the other to get the whitener out of the syringe.  </li>
            <li> The other tray I got out in time before it melted.</li>
            <li> but I can already tell a drastic difference in the color of my teeth compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any tooth sensitivity or gum soreness as I have with other products.</li>
            <li> I had used other treatments like this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making trays due to sports for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the trays are a little uncomfortable but hey its worth</li>
            <li> Easy to do, didn&#x27;t have any bad side effects</li>
            <li> (Also seeing all the people saying all the positive reviews are fake, some may be, but mine isn&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps the water was not hot enough or the mold was too thick.</li>
            <li> They charge you 8 dollars shipping which is a bit ridiculous, but I was curious as to what you actually get because I couldn&#x27;t find that anywhere.</li>
            <li> This deal was simply too hard to pass up.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time trying to find an affordable kit that actually worked!</li>
            <li> Moved to Canada and everyone&#x27;s teeth seem to glow in the dark,</li>
            <li> My gums returned to normal after about an hour, but during the 10 minutes I could stand with the plate in and the hour after my gums were numb and white.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive teeth/gums and was scared this product would make it worse</li>
            <li> I felt the plunger splinter into my thumb as I tried to force it down.  </li>
            <li> Now I use a wood pencil to jam down into the syringe.  </li>
            <li> I cut the trays down to the size of my gum line, so I could try to avoid getting the gel on my gums.</li>
            <li> I cut down the size of the mold as the package said because I did not want to get any of the product on my gums.</li>
            <li> that was coming down on my tongue.  </li>
            <li> I mean a constant stream of spit pouring out of my mind.</li>
            <li> The gel - sometime when a thick substance comes in a syringe you have to release the pressure by pulling back on the syringe just a little bit then push forward and you won&#x27;t get a thumb imprint or have to struggle to get the gel out.  </li>
            <li> I noticed results in less than a week.</li>
            <li> for the whitening I did notice a slight bit of color change in my mouth, maybe half a shade or so</li>
            <li> You have to be patient with the mouth piece for a half hour without talking or eating.</li>
            <li> You have to be patient with the mouth piece for a half hour.</li>
            <li> Seriously in boiling water ONLY 3 SECONDS</li>
            <li> This product seems to have a slight effect.</li>
            <li> I followed the direction to the &#x27;t&#x27; and, since I have a slight overbite, ended up with leakage no matter what I do every time I use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and have seen slight results.  </li>
            <li> but it sort of made a mess in my mouth and some of it looked like it was getting on my gums, which is not supposed to happen because this product does not help the gums.</li>
            <li> If you looking for a teeth whiting kit, go for it and do not waste your money on other expensive products.</li>
            <li> Used once, I got a little gel on my gums and it started to burn</li>
            <li> I got some on my lip and it did burn/tingle a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well after a little bit i couldn&#x27;t handle the burning anymore</li>
            <li> My teeth are a little whiter already.</li>
            <li> Do not overload the area because it is not very healthy for the gel to set on the gums for extended time.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference on my teeth within a few days.</li>
            <li> I order a few things off Amazon</li>
            <li> boyfriend noticed after a few sessions that my teeth were whiter without me saying anything, which feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My product directions include a note not to use this product if you are pregnant/nursing, have poor dental health and jaw problems, and have had recent oral surgery.</li>
            <li> My teeth were heavily stained from drinking lots of soda and coffee, so I needed to lighten the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Received within a few days of ordering Ive used it twice since i got it.</li>
            <li> After 1 week of using this teeth whitening product everyday I am already seeing results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker, and I needed a teeth whitening kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this system a few times now and can see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to notice immediate results, but you start to see an improvement after a few applications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the gel does work within a few applications.  </li>
            <li> I have used this a few times now</li>
            <li> I am not a huge reviewer, but I wrote the review solely because of their customer service as the title of the review indicates.</li>
            <li> I started out slow with this product and use every other day and have not had any issues with teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried about the molding process if the trays because I have had bad luck in the past with them.</li>
            <li> directions are a little confusing - step 2 involves removing the tray, rinsing, and brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> Being a chronic coffee drinking for the past 20 years I was in the market for some teeth whitening help.</li>
            <li> No better item on the market.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how that process goes.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that includes just the gel for the inserts, or if it includes gel for the touch up pen, also.  </li>
            <li> I did notice when I got a small amount on my gums that it burned like all hell, don&#x27;t recommend that.</li>
            <li> It is not a sexy time.</li>
            <li> To start with they charge a penny, that makes it not free!</li>
            <li> Packaging is small, neat, and product was undamaged when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks if there&#x27;s a difference!</li>
            <li> I have been using a few days and it has made a difference to my teeth!</li>
            <li> The process is long and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have a hard time understanding how to use the trays</li>
            <li> The product is hard to use.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to use and messy.</li>
            <li> noticed someone complained about my review.</li>
            <li> at least two shades whiter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To start off with the 2 mouth pieces: they are a fairly thick, so heating them for 3 or 4 seconds for me did not get the job done.</li>
            <li> I would agree with other posts, the 5 star reviews were probably questionable.</li>
            <li> Try this product before you waste your money at the dentist&#x27;s office!!</li>
            <li> what do you mean Unlimited refills of soultion how does that work ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a few friends!!</li>
            <li> However, because of the fact that it is expensive and the refills are not really free I gave this a 3.5 stars, it is in between</li>
            <li> The trays are quite thick as some people have said, so if you have a small mouth it might be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was used to the strips that you buy at drug stores, they work also but they are so expensive this kit works and its less pricey!</li>
            <li> Even with cutting down the size there are parts of my gums that are in the same area of my teeth, so I thought it would be impossible not to get the gel on my gums.  </li>
            <li> The gel does taste terrible, so try not to use too much!</li>
            <li> The tray was a little awkward as I am not a fan of putting trays and things like that in my mouth.</li>
            <li> However, I remember the liquid smelled worse.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t notice a rank smell.</li>
            <li> With all that said, I am going to give it another try as I have not experienced any tooth sensitivty.  </li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to push the plunger down on the syringe.  </li>
            <li> Tried it myself, it didnt work, then I read all the bad reviews and realized what I just wasted my money on.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m weird about putting things on my teeth, but this product was no problem at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had gel from the dentist that caused horrible pain over the next day, but there wasn&#x27;t any discomfort or side effects with this.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t  feel uncomfortable wearing it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to have whitening done at dentist&#x27;s office - it&#x27;s just too expensive.</li>
            <li> I am happier to pay something that is not as expensive as what you get from the dentists office.</li>
            <li> I notice that there&#x27;s alot of fake reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> I did have to change the method of application, as I found it difficult to not get the product on my gums when I applied the gel to the inside of the forms.</li>
            <li> Was given a discount to review product and it works but scary looking</li>
            <li> Because your mouth will salivate like crazy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the packaging (everything comes in a plastic bag).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical until I went out on a limb and gave it try!</li>
            <li> If you get any on the gums (almost impossible not to) it burns like crazy.</li>
            <li> The reason I give the product a 3/5 stars is that from what I could see, the product does help with whitening; however, its just an unpleasant experience.</li>
            <li> It comes in a plastic bag, which I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed from the picture, and was very skeptical of the quality, but handed it over to the man anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how bad my anxiety is over it.</li>
            <li> The shipping cost isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> The gel does not have a bad taste which makes the process easier.  </li>
            <li> This product is extremely painful.</li>
            <li> Trust me, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate the trays.</li>
            <li> If youre like me and sick of all the horrible products on the market then give this a try!</li>
            <li> I always hated smiling because I felt like everyone would stare at my teeth.</li>
            <li> There are a million of these kits sold out there, but with this one you cannot go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> My teeth were disgusting and stained when my braces came off...</li>
            <li> The instructions manual so is horribly written.&lt;br /&gt;Leave</li>
            <li> but I think all teeth whitening gel tastes terrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing but make my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> I saw some minor improvement. I would say the product is okay.</li>
            <li> Love love love it . Saw a change within the 2 time of using it .</li>
            <li> This stuff really works</li>
            <li> Works pretty good and was easy to apply</li>
            <li> Works great, but it can make your teeth a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> I will say this has amazing results and very fast results, Its a great deal that includes the whitening pen, and the free refills are an amazing deal! The item was shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried a product like this.  Moved to Canada and everyone&#x27;s teeth seem to glow in the dark, lol.  The results were more than I&#x27;d expected.  My teeth are really healthy looking, white but look very natural . (Glad to say they don&#x27;t glow in the dark).  It was also shipped very fast and was as described and better.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I ordered Teeth Whitening and used it together to improve out teeth before going to job interviews. We both agree that we got amazing results from the formula.  Additionally we feel that we got a good deal and are pleased that we will be a little more prepared for the job interviews.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their smile, believe me it is a noticeable difference.  After seeing the difference I wish I had ordered earlier!</li>
            <li> This product works great. f you need to get your teeth white without paying 200 dollars this product, at a good price is the one for you. I read an ad on here that everyone&#x27;s ad was the same. Well if you need validation here it is. Buy this product and next week you will be smiling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for great deal before buying on internet. I can tell you, this great deal that includes the whitening pen, is the best I found around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products and they worked but didn&#x27;t work well and the better whiteners were just too expensive.  I tried this Teeth Whitening Kit and I am amazed at the results.  The price is already great and the free refills are an added plus. The whitening pen is really convenient too.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a ton of teeth whitening gels,kits,and so on but the fact that this one has free refills is an amazing deal! My girl loves the new look and so do my future ones haha. Jokes aside a great product!</li>
            <li> This product is a scam.  The positive reviews are from the seller.  Tried it myself, it didnt work, then I read all the bad reviews and realized what I just wasted my money on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my boyfriend who had just quit smoking. When he stopped his teeth had a yellow color to them. Honestly, after using this product, his teeth looked so Amazing! I would totally recomend this product to anyone. It works wonderfully and fast. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It is not too expensive, and has great results.  There are also free refills, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say that this is an great product - but it really is just a teeth whitening kit. It does what it claims to - it whitens your teeth! therefore - it&#x27;s a great product, in my eyes. My results were fast - and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. If you want your teeth white and you want it quickly - this product is for you.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! The results were alot faster than expected, and were really noticeable. Also, this kit was much cheaper than the other brands, but uses the same ingredients. I don&#x27;t know why anybody would use anything else.</li>
            <li> Awesome teeth whitening gel! Easy to use.  Love the fact they give free refills!</li>
            <li> Not the best for the price and it kinda looks splotchy like the gel doesn&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> This works great seen results right away the trays are uncomfortable and the whitening gel taste nasty but it does work!!</li>
            <li> Considering all of the other over rated products out there, Teeth Whitening is a great deal and has amazing results. For such a low price it is a great deal and the free refills are an amazing deal. Recommended.</li>
            <li> They work amazing!!!!!!!! Best I&#x27;ve used :)</li>
            <li> This is a great teeth whitening kit. I am loving it. I especially like how there&#x27;s fast results. I&#x27;ve used a whole lot of other stuff, a lot of it has been a lot more expensive, and this has provided the best and fastest results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad using this product. I can see the difference on my teeth within a few days. The result is fast and amazing. Even my dentist was amazed. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It ships quickly and it comes with everything you need to get beautiful white teeth. I&#x27;m much more confident about my smile now.</li>
            <li> First off I was surprised at how this product was shipped fast and as described! I also liked how it came with everything that was included in the description. As someone who is self-conscious about the color of their teeth, I needed a fast and simple solution to whiten my teeth in a short amount of time. Teeth Whitening Kit was great and had amazing results! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple way to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> A great deal and price that includes the whitening pen as well as the other items in the kit. And the free refills are such a good deal. Can&#x27;t complain about the fast and free shipping.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product! It was delivered to me super fast and the results have been amazing. It comes with a whitening pen that you can carry with you anywhere. Refills are free- whats better than that?</li>
            <li> Recommend this product as it works great and was shipped extremely fast. Great product that is economical and works as described.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it at first but the results I saw from this product were great. Not only that I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with my teeth being yellowish. This product worked fast and with amazing results. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I tried the teeth whitening kit just three weeks ago and I got amazing results. This is a product I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have pretty sensitive teeth so I&#x27;m weird about putting things on my teeth, but this product was no problem at all. I&#x27;ve had gel from the dentist that caused horrible pain over the next day, but there wasn&#x27;t any discomfort or side effects with this. Just Super white teeth. It also doesn&#x27;t have the huge price tag like the dentist. You get the whitener, plus a pen, and free refills. It shipped really fast too. I ordered on a Thursday and got it that Monday. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> very effective, fast results, it includes everything you need to professionally whiten your teeth at home,  one of friends has used it last month, and recommended it highly, it is worth a try</li>
            <li> I order a few things off Amazon but when this arrived I was very surprised at what good quality it was and how fast it shipped. It came exactly as described and I was very pleased with the results of the product.</li>
            <li> My bad habits of smoking and coffee drinking had really affected my smile. I bought this product because now that I&#x27;m single I wanted to look by best. I&#x27;m very happy to report that this product is amazing and this review is my way of saying thanks!</li>
            <li> I had fast results with this teeth whitening product. Being a chronic coffee drinking for the past 20 years I was in the market for some teeth whitening help. Fast shipping to boot, I am all around pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products from CVS and nothing seems to get rid of the yellow tint from smoking but after trying this I went from yellow to a BRIGHT white. This is an amazing product, the results are fast and I got it 3 days after I ordered. I&#x27;M IN LOVE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product 2 shades whiter already ! Got this for a promo price thank you</li>
            <li> This product is very good. It gives amazing results and they include the whitening pen. It really works for me and whiten my teeth in a few weeks. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to get my teeth to a whiter shade but nothing seemed to work. I received this as a gift and was blown away at how fast the results came, and how effective it really was. I highly recommend to anyone looking for fantastic results.</li>
            <li> Teeth whitening has never been easier! After using this teeth whitening kit, I saw positive results within a few days. To make this deal even sweeter, you get free refills...what a deal! This was by far one of my best purchases of the year. I look and fell so much better.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, shows excellent results and really fast whitens teeth! Much better than any other I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Whitened my teeth very fast.  this was a better deal that any other kit, and it comes with the whitening pen.  Even better deal, and even better product.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Until last week I never used anything other than a toothpaste for my teeth, but after my g/f&#x27;s suggestion I bought this product. Within a week I could see the result. The result was absolutely amazing. If you looking for a teeth whiting kit, go for it and do not waste your money on other expensive products.</li>
            <li> The tray was a little awkward as I am not a fan of putting trays and things like that in my mouth. The only thing I really ever put in my mouth besides my braces was a toothbrush. I am very picky and germ-o-phobic when it comes to things like that. I have to change my toothbrush once every week or two that&#x27;s how bad my anxiety is over it. The stuff was nasty, but the pen was excellent! Loved it, it definitely lightened my teeth with just one shot, I can&#x27;t wait to see what more it can do if I can get the free refills.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of other products that you find at the local stores. Many of them by big companies, but they all didnt work on my teeth. They would whiten a little then they would go back to normal within a couple days. Kinda like they painted my teeth and it wore off. I tried this stuff and it works great. Fast results without the long wait of other whiteners. The shipping was pretty awesome too. 3 months later and I still have a nice white smile. Thanks</li>
            <li> Purchased this on a whim and was quite pleased with the results. Instructions are easy to read, and product is easy to use and end result is as good as if not better than other more expensive products that I have tried!</li>
            <li> I just got this product this morning and I&#x27;ve used it once and I already can see a big difference. I will defiantly be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> great stuff cant wait to use again</li>
            <li> Love that this company offers free whitening after you purchase this kit! Whitens teeth great!</li>
            <li> If you want whiter teeth, then this is absolutely your product! I received mine three days earlier then it said i would, and it was very reasonable with price. The result i got were phenomenal and with a year of free refills how can you not have an amazingly white smile? If i could rate this 10 stars i would!</li>
            <li> not used yet, but expecting the good results.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well. Custom fitting trays, unlimited refills, and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many teeth whitening systems, but this is by far a standout. This kit works fast! I noticed results in less than a week. This is a great deal that includes the whitening pen.</li>
            <li> Before using this kit, I used to be so self conscious about my teeth. I always hated smiling because I felt like everyone would stare at my teeth. This product has changed everything! I love my smile now and I am always getting compliments on how great my smile is. The product works exactly as described and has such fast results! If you want beautiful white teeth, you defiantly need this product!</li>
            <li> Wow this product has really good results. And fast results.A great deal that includes the whitening pen. And free refills are an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> I noticed really fast results I love this stuff my teeth look amazing.  Also it was shipped fast and as described.</li>
            <li> I was a smoker for several years and since i quit I also wanted to improve my personal apperance starting with whitening my teeth, I didn&#x27;t want to spend lots of money at the dentist so I read about a lot of different teeth whitening products and decided on this one kit.  It was the best choice, the results are amazing, and fast!</li>
            <li> AMAZING results!!! Fast results too! my teeth were so yellow from years of smoking and within just a short time my teeth are 50% whiter and brighter! This is an amazing buy :)</li>
            <li> Wow! Just follow the directions and poww your teeth are a couple shades whiter! Great product!</li>
            <li> A great deal and price that includes the whitening pen as well as the other items in the kit. And the free refills are such a good deal. Can&#x27;t complain about the fast and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I was super wary of this product because of how cheap it is - but the positive reviews convinced me so I&#x27;m here to add mine! (Also seeing all the people saying all the positive reviews are fake, some may be, but mine isn&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only in my 20&#x27;s but multiple cups of coffee a day and being a regular smoker have already done some serious work on my smile. I&#x27;ve always had sensitive teeth/gums and was scared this product would make it worse but it didn&#x27;t! The instructions are super easy to follow, and if you actually boil and cut the trays to fit your teeth (I traced my gum line onto the mouth guard while wearing it then used an exacto knife)when the gel gets on your gums it&#x27;s simple to wipe away. Even when it&#x27;s gotten on my gums the irritation only lasts a few hours and doesn&#x27;t do any permanent damage or bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend noticed after a few sessions that my teeth were whiter without me saying anything, which feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refills are a huge plus, I&#x27;ll be using the product to do maintenance on my smile for a long time! I love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have tried many teeth whitening products but none have delivered the amazing results this teeth whitening kit has. Plus you get free refills!!! WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product. Well worth the money and the company delivers super fast. You cannot beat it :)</li>
            <li> thank you for teeth whitening kit. This helps whiten my teeth. great product</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with the fast results I got with this product. It definitely made my teeth whiter and brighter in a very short time. I will continue to use it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow! After just one use my teeth are so much whiter! I does make my teeth a little sensitive but I have never used a teeth whitener that doesn&#x27;t. This works great!</li>
            <li> This was a fairly easy whitening kit to use.  You just use the whitening pen that comes with the kit and just apply it to the places you need to on your teeth.  I still get the whole tooth anyway to make sure it is applied evenly.  It shipped to me very quickly.</li>
            <li> I must say this was quite amazing! The shipping was fast as described, the results were fast, everything is wonderful about this product. My teeth look better than ever with this kit and it will be very interesting to find out who will notice first about my new smile.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try it yet but I have opened it and seen what the product looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried putting the molds in hot water out of a water dispenser. Perhaps the water was not hot enough or the mold was too thick. I&#x27;m not too sure which one it was. My parents had something similar to this a few years back but it was thinner. However, I remember the liquid smelled worse. This teeth whitening substance smells like Chinese medicinal ointment. Personally, I am used to the smell but many others have expressed their discontent with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update once I have the opportunity to use it for a week or two.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful.  I have never seen a product offer such fast results.  I would recommend this product to any one who wants good results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Whites brightens my teeth , easy to use, and unlimited free refills!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deal since it comes with the lifetime refills. Everything was in the sealed pouch and the instructions are simple and easy to follow. I received a discount for this to provide my honest and unbiased opinion on this, and in my opinion it&#x27;s a quality product that you&#x27;ll only have to buy once and can use for years to come. The pen is nice to have when traveling and for accurate application.</li>
            <li> this product so good and i love it. it is verf effective</li>
            <li> I have not used the full kit and only the brush on gel so far. I think my orthodontist was overzealous and took pride in the fact that none of his brackets could ever come off. The downside to that is that I was left with bracket marks on my teeth despite excellent oral hygiene. This is appearing to help. I will try the full kit soon.</li>
            <li> Whitens teeth has never been easier. Free refills are an amazing deal. No better item on the market. Try it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to bodybuilders and mechanical engineers.  You will need to be one or the other to get the whitener out of the syringe.  It is nearly impossible to push the plunger down on the syringe.  I felt the plunger splinter into my thumb as I tried to force it down.  Now I use a wood pencil to jam down into the syringe.  I hold the syringe and force the pencil down on the counter top.  I think I may die of exhaustion.  But I can still use the product.  If you are interested in the free refill offer... take a moment to look online.  There is a fee with each order that is equivalent to a purchase.  The whitener does seem to whiten.  It will also bleach flesh if in contact with skin too long.  (That is an observation and not a criticism.  The rest were criticisms.)  Its not a bad product if you don&#x27;t die trying to get it into the mouth guard.  I would probably try something else.  I would agree with other posts, the 5 star reviews were probably questionable.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I remember using a teeth whitening kit. I thought I would be sticking the thermoforming trays (jaw inserts) into my mouth as they were but after reading the instructions I learned that I would need to boil them in water for 3-4 seconds then put them in my mouth to cause them to mold to my teeth size. I boiled the upper tray too long and one side of it melted. The other tray I got out in time before it melted. I cut the trays down to the size of my gum line, so I could try to avoid getting the gel on my gums. Even with cutting down the size there are parts of my gums that are in the same area of my teeth, so I thought it would be impossible not to get the gel on my gums.  I tried putting the upper tray in my mouth with the whitening gel already on it but it sort of made a mess in my mouth and some of it looked like it was getting on my gums, which is not supposed to happen because this product does not help the gums. I didn&#x27;t put the upper tray back in my mouth because it was already messed up from me boiling it too long and it wasn&#x27;t fitting right in my mouth. I put the lower tray in my mouth for the time indicated. There was a lot of gel that accumulated in the back of my throat so I had to get that out of my mouth while the product was supposed to be working. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the color of my teeth with using these trays, that could be because a lot of the product floated to the back of my mouth.  About 4 days later I decided to try the teeth whitening pen on my front and lower teeth that are exposed when smiling. After the gel reached the brush I just painted it on my teeth (after wiping them per the instructions), wiped away any excess gel that I saw with tissue, and left it on for about 15 minutes. There was some gel that accumulated in the back of my throat with this method also but it didn&#x27;t seem like there was as much, maybe because less gel is used when using this pen versus the inserts. My teeth did look whiter when I was finished using this pen the first time. I noticed an immediate difference. This is the method I will probably use instead of the trays if I use this product again. There are supposed to be free teeth whitening refills for life with this kit. I haven&#x27;t ordered any so I am not sure how that process goes. I am not sure if that includes just the gel for the inserts, or if it includes gel for the touch up pen, also.  My product directions include a note not to use this product if you are pregnant/nursing, have poor dental health and jaw problems, and have had recent oral surgery. There is also a note that at home treatments have risks involved (please read this on the insert in case they change/add information to this section). People should consult their dentist about using this product (to see if it is safe for them I think).  I give the teeth whitening trays a 2 and the teeth whitening pen a 4, so I will give this product as a whole 3 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Kit includes mold-able trays, 2 syringes of teeth whitening gel, tooth color chart to mark whitening improvement, and a portable whitening pen. Since my teeth are only at about a 3 in the chart I decided to only test the whitening pen for right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen was easy to apply, has a slight mint flavor, and easily sticks to the teeth. I did notice when I got a small amount on my gums that it burned like all hell, don&#x27;t recommend that. Whitening time is 15-20 minutes tops. My teeth are definitely extra sensitive while having the gel on, and the amount of drool is unreal. Final results: I went up a level in whiteness with just the whitening pen! Can&#x27;t wait to use the trays for movie star white teeth.</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening kit works great noticed results with my first treatment the trays are a little uncomfortable but hey its worth it make sure you trim your trays to cover just your teeth so the whitening gel does not get on your gums you will see amazing results I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It did lighten my teeth a bit and I will continue to use it as needed.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for such an outstanding product!</li>
            <li> My teeth were disgusting and stained when my braces came off...this product turned everything around! They worked fast and were very effective, shipped fast and the value is amazing compared to other methods. I am so impressed by the way my smile looks. Some of my family members actually asked if I got my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I am one of these people who is known for having a great smile. However, when I looked in the mirror, I found myself wondering how people could say that about me. My teeth weren&#x27;t all that white.   I ordered the teeth whitening kit and received it quickly. This product delivers amazing results. Within weeks, my teeth were noticeably whiter. People commented on how my smile has improved. This whitening kit works well for whitening teeth. I recommend this product for anyone that wants whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> This kit really worked! It&#x27;s a great deal and includes a whitening pen. Very fast shipping. I really disliked my yellow teeth, now I can look my best at all times! Thank you so much. Free refills are an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> If you want white teeth fast then I definitely suggest buying this product.  I love this product and my teeth have never been whiter. Its an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> If You are looking to make your smile shine, this product delivers amazing results fast! I am very impressed by the ease of use, and the whitening power of this kit. The free refills of whitener really sealed the deal for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome results with this at home dental whitening kit!! And the price beats what you&#x27;d pay at the dentist or even on drugstore kits, so this is a great deal that includes the whitening pen!!!!</li>
            <li> This is kit includes everything you needed to whiten my teeth at a very affordable and reasonable price. I&#x27;m very impressed with the fast results.</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first when I saw the multiple different tubes of product but appreciated the mouth piece. It was the perfect size and I didn&#x27;t  feel uncomfortable wearing it. I drink a lot of coffee and if I cut down I probably would have seen more severe differences but did start to see them after a week. If you&#x27;re not interested in the different tubes I would not suggest this product.</li>
            <li> Love this teeth whitening product! I have been using it less than a week and can tell a great difference. This is by far the best teeth whitening product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend,shipping was fast and free refills you cant beat that. Ive been using this for about a month and my teeth are 10x whiter</li>
            <li> What sold me about this product was the fact that the free refills are an amazing deal, plus the shipping was free, so I figured I had nothing to lose.  I have a history of sensitivity that makes me unable to use most products, which is a bummer because I drink black coffee and red wine, like many people have stated.  I just got them today (super-fast shipping btw), and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying them!</li>
            <li> Used once, I got a little gel on my gums and it started to burn so I stopped after about 8 min, But my teeth where noticably whitter after the one use. Will try gain tomorrow. good directions and you definitely should look at them I know it helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal, Unlimited whitening solution! You really can&#x27;t beat that. My daughter has been bugging me to get her those white strips you purchase at a pharmacy or department store, and when I saw these being offered during a promotion I knew I had to take advantage of the special being offered. I am happy to say that the product came with a bottom and top mouth piece to use as well as two cylinders of the whitening solution. It also came with a whitening pen, which will fit perfectly in any purse or bag. I am pleased with the product so far. Just after one use, I can notice her teeth are shinier and that this stuff is working. We are both looking forward to the results as the weeks pass. Did I mention it&#x27;s unlimited whitening solution?</li>
            <li> After using the Teeth Whitening Kit I saw some amazingly fast results; my teeth have become noticeably whiter in just one week of use! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal that includes the whitening pen.With the whitening pen you can take it with you and whiten your teeth anywhere.</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening kit had AMAZING RESULTS! I&#x27;m so happy with it. I ordered to freshen up before my wedding and it worked wonderfully with little sensitivity. Thanks for a great job!!</li>
            <li> I could only leave it on for 10 minutes (think I put to much product in tray) but I do have to say that my teeth did get a shade whiter! I am excited to try the pen out.</li>
            <li> I was excited and amazed to see this teeth whitening kit worked. The fast results made me hooked and I love this product. I recommend it to everyone. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars, you can pay a one time low fee and get the same results.</li>
            <li> After reading the astounding reviews, I decided to order this. Although I haven&#x27;t achieved the results I wanted yet, the  product does seem to be working. I have used the carbamide twice and the pen twice so far and my teeth are probably several shades lighter. Even though I don&#x27;t have one of those shade gauges, I can tell they are a bit brighter.  It is possible that part of the problem relates to the lack of concrete directions and the cheapness of the whitening trays. If you&#x27;ve used mouth-guards and such for sports, it&#x27;s exactly the same. However, it&#x27;s been many years since my high-school football haha. The trays are quite thick as some people have said, so if you have a small mouth it might be uncomfortable. Keeping the trays in for 30 minutes while it&#x27;s difficult to swallow is challenging, but doable.  My one question was about the \\&quot;free\\&quot; refill. They charge you 8 dollars shipping which is a bit ridiculous, but I was curious as to what you actually get because I couldn&#x27;t find that anywhere. I found 2 giant 10ml 36% carbamide for only $11.00 with free shipping over 25 bucks http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00608KP6A/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;m&#x3D;AEGCJ1I7IRYME which sounds like a much much better deal but I&#x27;d still like to know if the refill sends you another whitening pen and trays, but probably not.  I messed up on my bottom tray because I was worried about it being too hot lol. Surprisingly, it sheds the boiling water instantaneously and I&#x27;d say three seconds is the sweet spot. I did four both times and I felt like they were shriveling up too quickly. It&#x27;d be nice if the product came with one or two extra trays.  If anyone has ordered the refill please comment and let me know if you can, thanks.</li>
            <li> This really provides a good whitening teeth solution with amazing results. I am a smoker and couldn&#x27;t believe it provided very fast results.  I would recommend this to everybody coz it makes you feel fresh and very amazing in front of anybody even closer.</li>
            <li> This is a great teeth whitening kit. I got fast results in a matter of days. I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> amazing product with fast results works fast , i recommend it, its also agreat deal that includes the whitening pen and free refills are an amazing deal  also it was shipped fast and as described. just a great customer service</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. It was easy to use and really liked my results. I think it comes at a great price and I got a great deal that includes the whitening pen. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. You must try it yourself.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get my teeth whiter they have always been a light yellow color I started using Teeth Whitening and started seeing results my teeth are getting whiter and the free refills are an amazing deal</li>
            <li> amazing results in a short time  worth every penny</li>
            <li> Pure white teeth&lt;br /&gt;Many people will want to&lt;br /&gt;I did not like to use risk</li>
            <li> I read a lot of review about the tray being a little hard to mold and although true I think it is thicker to withstand the use of time. The tray does not fit to each tooth individually but it will fit more snug to your whole roll of teeth. I cut down the size of the mold as the package said because I did not want to get any of the product on my gums. I didn&#x27;t not have any problems squeezing the product out of the syringe like other reviews said, perhaps they fixed the packaging from that time. The smell of the product is not too chemical like and is kind of minty. I got some on my lip and it did burn/tingle a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the whitening I did notice a slight bit of color change in my mouth, maybe half a shade or so and i left it for about 30 minutes but I might have had a slight color change because I did not put enough product. However, because of the fact that it is expensive and the refills are not really free I gave this a 3.5 stars, it is in between it&#x27;s okay and I liked it.</li>
            <li> This kit is so awesome and the price cannot be beat! After just a few applications I am seeing amazing results! It was shipped quickly after my order was placed, I will continue to order this in the future as i am an avid coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> Product was great. The results were amazing.  My teeth look great and the results were fast.  For the price, it was a great deal including the pen.  I like that there are free refills.  It was shipped quickly just like it said!</li>
            <li> nice kit and syringes of solution and it comes with a brush too. If you get any on the gums (almost impossible not to) it burns like crazy. Ive only used it once with little results. You have to be patient with the mouth piece for a half hour without talking or eating. I do it while watching TV. theres plenty of gel and you can get more free. the price was the best around!</li>
            <li> You will not only get amazing results with this product, you will also get them fast!  The free refills is just as amazing.  Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> As a coffee and tea drinker, stains are always a problem. I can&#x27;t afford to have whitening done at dentist&#x27;s office - it&#x27;s just too expensive. This kit does the trick and it&#x27;s affordable and fast, yippee! The whitening pen is my favorite, and it&#x27;s so easy to use. Love it!</li>
            <li> Well, I love this stuff. I have not done any whitening before and I think all of my years drinking coffee has had an effect on my tooth color. I started using the trays at night and the pen after lunch and in a week I (and others) can see a notice-able difference. I love it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice kit and syringes of solution and it comes with a brush too. Ive only used it once with little results so,far. Hope my teeth will get whiter after I try more times. You have to be patient with the mouth piece for a half hour.</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening kit worked so well I can&#x27;t believe it! It had super fast results and you can&#x27;t go wrong for the deal and with free refills it&#x27;s a no brainer. Works better than any other kit I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different whiteners and this is one that ges great results fast.  It is also a pretty good deal that you get the whitening pen along with the kit.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It was shipped fast and was exactly as described.  After using, it  has fast results that are absolutely amazing.  You will love this product.</li>
            <li> its ok but my teeth were very sensitive after it</li>
            <li> My teeth whitening is becoming more and more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gum was the first to follow when using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance is very good</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening formula worked FAST. Other whitening products are awfully expensive, this kit was the right price and worked amazingly! My teeth were noticeably whiter in DAYS!5 stars</li>
            <li> Great product, I received the kit quickly and tried it immediately. Directions were easy to follow, and the whole process was really quick. The results look great, and I am definitely going to keep using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the store bought teeth whiteners before but I&#x27;ve never had the amazing results this kit has delivered. I am so glad I ordered this kit, it was shipped fast and as described. Look no further if your looking for a whitening kit.</li>
            <li> This product is really good, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the free refills that come with it. I still can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to obtain more refills of such a great product.</li>
            <li> My teeth were heavily stained from drinking lots of soda and coffee, so I needed to lighten the color of my teeth. This product seems to do what I wanted in a teeth whitening product. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the great results, and it shipped very quickly, I was pleasantly surprised by that.</li>
            <li> Received within a few days of ordering Ive used it twice since i got it. I think its works fairly well, i could see a difference after the first try. My only problem was the trays dont form to your teeth that well. I followed the instructions and it just didnt grip to my teeth like it should have. But overall great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with this: The actual tooth whitening works. My teeth are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;The question is, what price are you willing to pay for whiter teeth? This product is extremely painful. It is not humanly possible to have the whitening gel not touch your gums once in the tray. When it does touch your gums, which it will, it causing this searing pain and bleaches your gums. It also causes them to recede so when you take the tray out, your mouth looks like it&#x27;s decaying. My gums returned to normal after about an hour, but during the 10 minutes I could stand with the plate in and the hour after my gums were numb and white. Also, I have to stand over my sink for the duration of the time the trays are in my mouth. Why you may ask? Because your mouth will salivate like crazy. I mean a constant stream of spit pouring out of my mind. It is not a sexy time. For all the trouble, go buy some white strips and call it a day.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many different tooth whitening products before only for my teeth to return back yellow after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;This product surpasses the others in the fact that it actually works and the results last longer. Highly recommend trying it out you should be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this whitening kit both to improve my overall look and to impress my girlfriend, and wow, this kit is great! It works VERY quickly and very well at the same time, other kits I&#x27;ve tried in the past took literally about 4-5 times as long to start taking effect. I&#x27;m an ex-smoker, so you can imagine how yellow my teeth were before. Well after a few clean-ups from the local dentist and using this kit, I can sincerely say that my teeth look just as good as they did before I started smoking. Thanks for the great product, I love it and really appreciate it!</li>
            <li> This great deal that INCLUDES the whitening pen gave me fast results and was shipped fast and as described. I was more than pleased with how fast and affective this product is. And to top it off, how could you not go for the free refills? Definitely buy this product.</li>
            <li> Just started using the product, so not yet sure it will work. The customer service is good and responsive. I messed up with the tray, and I asked them some questions. Thankfully, they sent a new one. I didn&#x27;t totally ruined the tray this time, but even after several attempts to leave the teeth impression on the tray, it doesn&#x27;t work well. I even watched some YouTube videos before trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/8/13&lt;br /&gt;I noticed someone complained about my review. I guess I should have been clearer on the purpose of the review. I am not a huge reviewer, but I wrote the review solely because of their customer service as the title of the review indicates. As noted in previous review, however, it was difficult to leave an accurate teeth impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found baking soda is more effective than this product for whitening, but I believe the efficacy of this product will be different for each individual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with whitening my teeth and have tried many products. This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried. It gives amazing results. I had no teeth sensitivity, just fast results and white teeth! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A teeth whitening kit that provides amazing results, guaranteed to brighten and whiten anyones teeth up. Receive this great deal that includes the whitening pen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many similar products such as Crest and Aquafreshs strips, as well as OTC bleaching products and they either dont work or dont list.  This product had amazing results and they were produced extremely quickly.  Well worth the purchase! If youre like me and sick of all the horrible products on the market then give this a try!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  After 1 week of using this teeth whitening product everyday I am already seeing results.  My teeth are whiter!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different teeth whitening products with limited success.  I must say this is the best my teeth have looked in years!  Amazing results!</li>
            <li> I got this product extremely fast and it also produced fast results. I was very pleased to see how white my teeth are now. I personally used higher end kits that didn&#x27;t really fit on my teeth correctly, which left my teeth white only in certain spots. I personally always use this product and so does my family.</li>
            <li> it is a very good product, i used it and gives amazing results....i highly recommend it for everyone who wants white and healthy teeth...it is amazing, you would love it, for sure</li>
            <li> Try this product before you waste your money at the dentist&#x27;s office!! Trust me, you will not be disappointed.  I was skeptical until I went out on a limb and gave it try! Not only did I get fast results, I also saved quite a bit of money.</li>
            <li> I got white teeth fast for an interview I had last week. I really Love the whitening pen! Shipped on time. Good for the price. Can&#x27;t wait to get a free refill! Seems like a good deal.</li>
            <li> Good Product was a little weary due to some of the negative reviews but purchased anyway and was amazingly suprised !! This product really works! my teeth are beautiful I cant stop smiling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker, and I needed a teeth whitening kit. I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products, but they made my teeth sensitive. The Teeth Whitening Kit took away all the stains, and the free refills are an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for teeth whitening. i have noticed a huge difference since i started it. It provides amazing results!It was shipped fast and as described! perfect</li>
            <li> I have used several different products trying to whiten my teeth after having braces for 2 years but none has really been successful. I have only used this product once but I can already tell a drastic difference in the color of my teeth compared to other products. My teeth are now a beautiful white because of this product. If you teeth are starting to yellow this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Awesome product was shocked by how much whiter my teeth looked after one application</li>
            <li> I have used the first dose of this teeth whitening system. Ive already noticed quite a difference. Good for the price. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s as good as going to the dentist to have it done, I might try that next. Easy to do, didn&#x27;t have any bad side effects</li>
            <li> When I ordered this we got a link to the video which was very useful, and make a great addition in addition to the instructions.  Teeth whitening products are tricky to get right as they are either too weak and then you feel like you are wasting your time or leaving them on forever, or too powerful and you feel like you are handling toxic material (and they tend to be more pricey).  I like the balance in this porduct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like this better than the strips as I think it is thorough and more powerful.  I am happier to pay something that is not as expensive as what you get from the dentists office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it has been awhile. Decided to give it another try. Great results.</li>
            <li> I use this kit and I no longer need to visit my dentist !   I have amazing results and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> All I can say is \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;. The results I received were fast and definitely noticeable. For the price it&#x27;s a great steal. I used to purchase the crest white strips which are basically 50$ and I have switched to this. A great product and at a reasonable price it&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this system a few times now and can see a noticeable difference. I&#x27;ve taken up drinking coffee and noticed my teeth started getting getting a tint to them. Only two treatments in I was back to my non-coffee drinking state! I didn&#x27;t experience any pain or sensitivity. I recently got a crown on my back molar and though it didn&#x27;t have direct contact with the gel there was no sensitivity. I love this stuff and would recommend it to anyone! Not to mention I had an issue with packaging and the seller (Market-Ology Group Inc) immediately fixed the matter.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many product to whiten my teeth due to smoking and this is the best product i have used so far.  I really like the quick results i had but more so the fact that It has free refills, which is just an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> Like I&#x27;ve always said, if it&#x27;s free then it&#x27;s for me. Not only do you come out of this with an amazingly white smile, it&#x27;s easy to use and works amazingly fast, but you get free refills!  I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to arrive so fast either, which was great because I needed to use this before an important interview. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in sales, and looking clean is more or less a prerequisite when dealing with the public. After using this product, I have noticed a difference in my teeth. You&#x27;re not going to notice immediate results, but you start to see an improvement after a few applications. I also have fairly sensitive teeth, and I was surprised to see that they didn&#x27;t cause a lot of irritation. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking to whiten their teeth without the hassle or cost of having to go to the dentist and have it done professionally.</li>
            <li> Wow! I couldn&#x27;t believe how white my teeth became after using this product. I will definitely keep using it. Especially the free refills are an amazing deal that shouldn&#x27;t be missed.</li>
            <li> The teeth whitener is simply AMAZING! I love it,and I am so happy that I made the decision to buy it. I get amazing results. If I were to make the decision to buy it again, i&#x27;d do it in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> I found that the teeth whitening kit really helped my teeth and I like using it.  When I was first checking out this product, I thought that the price and what you got were a good deal, but then I found out I got free unlimited refills of whitening solution!! How could you not try it?  Free refills are an amazing deal! I was surprised that this was included but have been enjoying it very much.  So glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I have already reviewed but here is another. I love this product in just 1 use my teeth were notacebly whiter :)</li>
            <li> Used it a couple of times and it is pretty good. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have not yet used a long time. However, this seems to be some teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> I notice that there&#x27;s alot of fake reviews on this product. But despite of review scams, this product works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I notice the lighter shade with just one use, however, I did leave it on for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tray is very tricky to mold right. The instructions manual so is horribly written.&lt;br /&gt;Leave your tray in the boiling water for ONLY 7-9 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Then IMMEDIATELY place it on your teeth.</li>
            <li> ordered a month ago and have used  a total of six times .Whitens ok However  the Syringe  is almost imposible to push and the  product leaks out the top my guess is it is faulty .Which brings me to my next question ?  what do you mean Unlimited refills of soultion how does that work ..This was not such a great deal after all depends on customer service at this point  will leave an update</li>
            <li> As a sensitive tooth person, I have to be careful with whitening products that I purchase. I started out slow with this product and use every other day and have not had any issues with teeth sensitivity. I did have to change the method of application, as I found it difficult to not get the product on my gums when I applied the gel to the inside of the forms. Instead, I use a brush, apply the gel directly to my teeth and then place the forms in my mouth to prevent the gel from getting all over my mouth. No issues since. The unlimited refills excites me; however the gel I received appears that it will last a long time, but its still nice to know I can use this indefinitely and not have to purchase more gel.</li>
            <li> The kit works nicely and is fairly easy to use. I have definitely noticed that my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> It’s really working for me after five treatments, my front teeth have already started to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;I like the whitening pen. It’s handy and easy to apply. I can control the amount I want to brush on each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;The time to whiten is not long at all. I can increase or decrease the length of time and I don’t have to worry if I run out because there is still a good amount left on the pen.&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t experience skin rash or teeth sensitivity while I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;For me the taste is not bad - just like a bitter candy. But the peroxide didn’t affect the taste much, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the whitening pen over the tray.</li>
            <li> When ordering this you get an instuction manual, 2 tubes of gel, 2 mouth pieces, and 1 tube of bleach. Along with that you will get a link to a video that walks you through each step of the process to get everything ready to use the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off with the 2 mouth pieces: they are a fairly thick, so heating them for 3 or 4 seconds for me did not get the job done. I tried the 4 seconds and I had zero impressions from my teeth. So I decided to leave it in for about 10 seconds and then quickly stuck it in my mouth and did the suction part. Again, not 1 tooth impression. So on my third time I placed the mouth piece in the boiling water for 30 seconds and then quickly to my mouth in the same manner. This time there was only a slight sign of a couple of teeth in the whole tray. I did not dare go any longer then that though since it burned my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next step for this is using the tubes included in the package. To start off you are to put a dab of gel in each tooth impression if you were lucky enough to get them. Do not overload the area because it is not very healthy for the gel to set on the gums for extended time. Now that you have the gel on it, you place the mouth pieces into your mouth for 15 to 30 minutes. I marked the bottom plate of mine with a small cut at the back of the molar area so I would make sure I was using it on the same set of teeth each time. I also took the tabs off of the from of the mouth pieces once I had them formed up. This keeps you from drooling all over yourself while the pieces are in. Now once the gel part is done you can move to bleaching your teeth. This requires some work. You have to dry the teeth then apply the bleach to your teeth. From there not closing your mouth or rubbing off the bleach in any manner. I found that I was having a hard time keeping my lips from touching my teeth so I put the bleach on my teeth and them I took my mouth pieces and put them over the top of the bleach. If you do this part the way I did, make sure that you have cleaned all of the gel out and washed/dried both plates. From there it keeps the bleach in place for me. After the bleaching is one you can rinse your mouth out well and you have completed one treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you experience any discomfort from the gel or bleaching it says to stop the bleaching process for 2 to 4 days. The other suggestion is to cut back on the time that it is in your mouth. I did experience a lot of discomfort from this kit. There is a reason they claim that it is the fastest working kit on the market. Now the gel does not smell the best, but most cleaning products I have ever come across never smelled all that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual and video are a great addition to this process because other wise I would not have known even where to start. They mainly cover getting the mouth pieces ready and forming them to your mouth. The manual does go into details about when not to use this home treatment. For instance, if you are pregnant, exposed roots, or recent surgery in the mouth/jaw area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all the product did as it claims. It did help with whitening my teeth. Now the important part: do not get sucked in on this free gel refills. For starters that is only part of the kit, that does not include the bleach tubes which does the majority of the whitening. To start with they charge a penny, that makes it not free! Next you can not order more then 1 tube at a time and must pay shipping for each tube. This is where they have their costs covered for the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a teeth whitening kit and do not have any sensitive gum issues this kit would work great for you. On the other hand if you have sensitive gums be prepared to feel like someone has struck a torch up in your mouth and throwing gasoline on top of it. I would like to thank Advanta Supplements for sending me this teeth whitening kit to try and leave my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

            <li> I love this.  Its easy to do and understand.  I thought I would have a hard time understanding how to use the trays but I didnt.  I didnt notice immediate results but I saw improvement and I will continue to use.  I have sensitive teeth and I didnt experience overly sensitivity after using this; which is a plus!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> This whitening kit gel works great but it&#x27;s really strong so be sure to wipe excess off your gums. The trays. I hate the trays. I never did get them to fit correctly.Seriously in boiling water ONLY 3 SECONDS or you&#x27;ll have problems.So really concentrate on that step. I do have a custom made set from my dentist so I&#x27;ve been using it instead. Within a week I noticed my teeth are so pretty and white. Even though I&#x27;m a huge coffee drinker.  There is a whitening pen included with this set which is great for keeping in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Someone commented on the smell. I personally don&#x27;t notice a rank smell. I really don&#x27;t notice a scent at all actually.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you really take your time with the trays I think you&#x27;ll be find. You&#x27;ll be happy with the whitening power of this kit!</li>
            <li> Used this kit according to its instructions but I did not see much improvement and am not a big fan Of the taste in my mouth In the three days that I have been using it. I will update my review after I have used longer</li>
            <li> The product works and my teeth are noticeably whiter even though I was unable to complete the whole treatment. Packaging is small, neat, and product was undamaged when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are a little confusing - step 2 involves removing the tray, rinsing, and brushing teeth. Step 3 instructs you to leave the trays in for 15-30 min? I think it was just out of order. The whitening pen instructions are clearly for a different model whitening pen - they describe a blue cap and pushing a silver tip to dispense. My pen had a clear cap, and you twist the bottom to move the product into the pen. Nothing at all to push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced great discomfort with the trays even though I was careful not to overload them. I was only able to keep the tray in for ages minutes. The pen is easy to use and it is much easier to ensure the product is only on the teeth and does not irritate the gumline. I will continue to use the pen, because my teeth are indeed white. The product has a pleasant taste and it is easy to save the excess product for use at another time.</li>
            <li> Twas a good purchase, if striking a beautiful smile fancies you, this product will perform. Change the world one smile at a time.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get the teeth whitening kit, but when I read the instructions and warnings it mentions that you cannot use while pregnant or nursing! I am 6 months along, so it will be a while before I have the chance to use the kit. I checked the details and it did not say anything about pregnancy warnings online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still excited to use the kit, especially because it has personal shape conforming trays AND a whitening pen. It&#x27;s nice to have 2 options for whitening depending on how my teeth respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got the Snagshout discount for the review. I wish I&#x27;d known about the pregnancy limitations before making my order, though.</li>
            <li> It is what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> My son has always wanted whiter teeth...he has been very happy...and we have noticed results</li>
            <li> The product is hard to use. After I put the mouthpiece on my mouth it started to sting and my gums felt like burning so I took it off, I probably will not use it again.</li>
            <li> I received this at a promotional price and it works great! My teeth are 10x as white as before and their not dull colored any more I am very impressed with the results</li>
            <li> Hopefully this works well. The trays can be tricky but I expected that. I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks if there&#x27;s a difference!</li>
            <li> Ready to have super white teeth at a fraction of the cost of store brands and Dental Whitening systems</li>
            <li> Used this kit according to its instructions but I did not see much improvement. I even cut out coffee and soda to reduce the staining on my teeth. I expected too much from this product.</li>
            <li> I had people notice my teeth within the first week. Just make sure when you put the trays in the hot water DO NOT leave them in there more than 3 or 4 secs</li>
            <li> No packaging of any sort. Looks like the contents were stolen from a dentist office and sealed in plastic. Very worrisome. Was given a discount to review product and it works but scary looking</li>
            <li> this product was okay</li>
            <li> This product seems to have a slight effect. It&#x27;s not immediately like &amp;#34;WOAH&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s there. I will be updating once I use it more. The gel does taste terrible, so try not to use too much! Overall I&#x27;m pleased, great product for a great price.  **PLEASE NOTE I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE TO REVIEW HONESTLY**</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t diligent about using it every day after the first 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say for certain. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> GREAT whitening product! I&#x27;m excited about the free refills!!</li>
            <li> I have tried other teeth whitening products and I prefer this one better.  Not because of the free unlimited refills (WINNING) but also because it works.  Easy to apply. Easy to use.  Easy to see results sooner.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for results.</li>
            <li> $5.00 is far and beyond a great deal that includes the whitening pen and free refills for a year. This deal was simply too hard to pass up. It shipped fast and was just as described.</li>
            <li> In love this teeth whitening kit! I never really had problems with my teeth not been white, but coffee over the years made them yellow. I got this kit for Christmas and now I get so many people asking me who is my dentist! I told them about this kit. This has amazing results!</li>
            <li> I had a very important interview coming up and I wanted to look my best. WOW! this worked excellent! I went to the interview with confidence in myself! and the free refills just make it that much easier!</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to never find a whitening product that actually worked let alone that gave me such fast results! Being a smoker it&#x27;s is an ongoing process to whitening my teeth so this is a great deal with great deal that includes the whitening pen and it&#x27;s shipped fast and as described. I actually have the confidence to smile freely now!!</li>
            <li> Yes! This is a great product. It delivers on all points. The results are amazing and fast. You get free refills. You can&#x27;t beat that! It&#x27;s a great deal which includes fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other whiteners and find this to be the fastest and lasts the longest. I receive a lot of compliments when I use it, and I use it frequently as I drink coffee and tea and it stains my teeth. (p.s. the whitening pen is awesome!)</li>
            <li> This kit seems expensive, but the fact that the refills are free makes it a very worthwhile buy! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> The rubber mold that&#x27;s supposed to adapt to your mouth shape doesn&#x27;t work very well- the shape doesn&#x27;t adjust sufficiently, which means that the bleach mixture tends to leak out.  I always found that after just 2-3 minutes of the thing in my mouth I started gagging from the bleach and had to spit it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roommate got a free professionally done kit when he switched to a new local dentist, and the comparison is striking.  The mold they did is much thinner (easier to use, less gagging), and really molds precisely to his teeth, meaning very little leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is profound- he finds it easier to use and has had much better results.  I&#x27;m chucking the leftovers of this kit and switching to his dentist.</li>
            <li> I was a smoker so naturally my teeth were stained from it. This teeth whitening kit really helped that out. These amazing results were super fast. I felt like a new person and had my smile back.</li>
            <li> Amazing results and a great deal with the free whitening pen! I am so happy I bought this product it is absolutley amazing and I use it all the time! Absolutley exceptional I would reccomend it to all my friends and family! My teeth look like a movie stars&#x27;</li>
            <li> good whitening action. Arrived fast in the mail also.  Good value for the money, for sure.</li>
            <li> when using this product after a week really notice the change. at least two shades whiter. and is very easy to use. really recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to whiten my teeth, obviously. When I got the product it came with 2 mouth pieces, a pen teeth whitener, and 2 of the gel, I&#x27;ve only used the gel to this day but you can easily see the difference in as little as 2 days. Highly recommended and is worth the money!</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening kit works well.  Be careful not to leave the plastic mouth pieces in the boiling water any longer than directed.  No problems with gum pain from the product.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try tooth whitening products but was worried about the ingredients used might do more harm than good. So I checked with my dentist first about the ingredients used in this kit. He gave me the go ahead and so I tried it. I was surprised at the results and the fact that the refills are free make it an amazingly good deal.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with this product, it works very well and isn&#x27;t harsh at all, I was able to see amazing results in a short amount of time, and what could make it better than the free refills!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week and can already tell that my lowers are whiter (my uppers are &amp;#34;Hollywood-white&amp;#34; crowns, and so bringing the lowers in-line is a constant struggle). I am really glad I was asked to review this, because it really is working, and I am glad I finally found something that is! The white strips that others offer generally do not fit my bite pattern very well; the trays on this are totally customizable (instructions included), and I am looking forward to using this product more in the future to keep my smile looking great! Thanks for making it available!</li>
            <li> First off, this is a fantastic product. I never knew my teeth could be so white! Especially without any damage to the enamel or gums (tip - make sure to trim the dental trays to the length of your teeth - this is what protects your gums from exposure)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it&#x27;s a great value. Inexpensive and better than any product I&#x27;ve tried in the past or bought at a drug store. Plus free refills? It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the customer service was excellent. I had a spot of trouble with the website the first time I went to order the refill. Kevin at teethwhiteningrefill.com contacted me and exceeded my expectations. I love good customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about what product to buy, you needn&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s safe, works better than other products, ships fast, is unbelievably cheap and backed by great customer service. Enjoy!</li>

            <li> The Teeth Whitening Kit came in the mail when it was freezing outside so the gel inside the tubes was frozen. I waited for it to thaw out and used the first application. I noticed a small change in color on the first go. I waited a bit before using the second tube just for the sake of giving my teeth a break. Noticeably whiter. Happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first seeing the list price and all but the product is real whitening gel and not some scam. I thought the pen was broken at first since I had to click and hold about 60 times before the first bit of gel came out. I had no problems working the syringes but the trays work too well when you put them in water to make a form to your teeth, making the trays less effective if you can believe it. I ended up leaving the top try unformed and just clipped it instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike whitening strips this gel is as concentrated as they make it, and it *will* hurt the inside of your mouth and your gums if it comes in contact. With that said, it worked much faster than strips and lasted longer too, just a pain in the butt using the trays</li>
            <li> My teeth are much much whiter....I researched for a while and ended up with this..glad I did..price is right too...</li>
            <li> Works great. Taste isn&#x27;t super but worth the results. I&#x27;m going to buy some for my mom I think she will enjoy the product as much as I did. Very easy to use</li>
            <li> I really like this solution it has been a week and I have seen a slight improvement on my bottom teeth will be coming back for refills</li>
            <li> Ive used many teeth whiting products and I have never ever ever achieved my teeth to become whiter in a matter of a few days! I was very impressed! I was able to receive this item for my own opinion and it proved itself to work. It arrived super fast. I love the fact that we have the trays so its not as messy. The pens make it easy to dispense the gel to not get to much, Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product, my teeth are starting to get white!! It burns a bit if you get it on your gums but it doesnt last long!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get a tooth whitening kit for awhile now and I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better one. I drink a lot of coffee and smoke so my teeth don&#x27;t look the best. I also have very sensitive front teeth and I&#x27;m happy to say it didn&#x27;t bother them to apply the product. Comes with 2 tubes of solution, top and bottom trays and a whitening brush pen. Saw a different after one use. Please follow directions, I used to much and it doesn&#x27;t taste the best. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Whether or not teeth whitening works for a person is mostly genetic, my fiance had never tried it before so I purchased this for him as the price was right for a test.  It comes in a plastic bag, which I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed from the picture, and was very skeptical of the quality, but handed it over to the man anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said the instructions were easy to follow, you actually form the trays to your own teeth which is cool.  And after 2 uses he has noticed 2 levels of improvement (he gauged this using the level indicator insert included with the package). He did not experience any sensitivity. If the unlimited refills is true, then I would say this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product and quality! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this product and the free refills are an amazing deal. its just plain awesome. and i also love the fast results.</li>
            <li> I had such fast results using the whitening pen.  WHen I decided to order the kit i could not wait 4 it 2 get here...it arrived so fast and I was able to start whitening right away.  The unlimited refills on whitening solution for a year is what made me realize what a good deal this was.</li>
            <li> If you have ever thought about using a teeth whitening product.  Look no further.  This is the one you have been looking for.  I tried several products recommended by my dentist.  But none of them worked.  I was talking to a co worker and he suggested I try it and man am I glad.  It was shipped fast and as described.  I will definitly use this product again.</li>
            <li> I am going to give this two stars for right now, because I barely noticed any difference. However, I will say that I just did one treatment Thursday night, so maybe i will do another one and then update with my results. Please be AWARE, do not take the manufacturer&#x27;s warning about not getting the gel on gums, mucus mebranes of the mouth etc...LIGHTLY!  This stuff is really strong. It&#x27;s the kind they use in a professional whitening at the dentist&#x27;s office and it really really really burns if you get it on your gums, but that is almost IMPOSSIBLE (not to get it on your gums or in your mouth) to avoid even when you do boil the mouth guards and mold them to fit your mouth. My mouth didn&#x27;t really stop burning until Saturday. This most likely played a part in my whitening effect or lack thereof because I was only able to stand it for a good ten minutes, the last ten minuites were me squirming around trying to not choke on my own saliva (that felt like battery acid) that was coming down on my tongue.  I even tried the whitening pen the next day, and while that was LESS of a MESS, that burned even MORE and I was only able to keep the gel on for about 5 minutes. With all that said, I am going to give it another try as I have not experienced any tooth sensitivty.  I am using this in conjunction with the Colgate Optic White toothpaste and because I have fairly white teeth in the first place, I can wait to see some signifigant results and I am willing to give this product a couple of more tries before I just give up on it altogether. I was just a little disappointed because I was expected SO much because of how most everyone RAVED about it...but for me it was just ok...it did make my time BRIGHTER...but BRIGHTER and WHITER are two different things...</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and, though I just began using it, I have very positive things to say.  First, it is very easy to use.  I had no problem setting the molds and they have been working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the customer service provided by the company is outstanding.  I ordered a (free!) refill; a few days later I received an email from the company, apologizing for the delay and refunding me the cost of S&amp;H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the quality of the product and the customer service, I know I will be doing business with them and recommending them for a long time.</li>
            <li> Im a smoker and have been for some time now. As a result my teeth are kinda stained a yellow color. I tried the Teeth Whitening kit and have been amazed by the results. It didnt happen overnight but my teeth are started to look whiter. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a smoker and is trying to get back to their white smile.</li>
            <li> Wow!  What an amazing difference this product made.  Getting ready for my wedding in a few months and I will definitely be smiling bright.  5 stars recommended!</li>
            <li> This product really has amazing results, compared to any other product of its kind, this is what you need to get hand&#x27;s down. This is probably the best teeth whitening kit I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I was seek a good whitening product for a while. This kit is fantastic!! It shipped fast and as described. Use as directed and you will get amazing and fast results!! I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a few friends!!</li>
            <li> This product has given me some amazing results! also fast results! its truly a great deal especially with the whitening pen. Really quick shipping, i would order again!</li>
            <li> Have tried others products in the past but this one really worked.  I was also happy it shipped fast and was a great deal that includes the whitening pen.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I was amazed by the results! This works wonders! Thank you for this! I used it and on the first day I could see the difference. And within a week I saw that my teeth were whiter than they&#x27;ve ever been!</li>
            <li> This product worked really good. It&#x27;s a great deal that includes the whitening pen to help with the application.  Better than other whitening products.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this whitening product but its a great deal that includes the whitening pen. In addition, amazing results were evident after about a week! This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the packaging (everything comes in a plastic bag). For the price it is you would think it would be a little better presented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see some results after the third use. It is a little difficult to use and messy. Although it is nice you only have to use it for a few minutes. I&#x27;ve tried other products that you have to leave in for a long times so that was nice.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Works just after one use. Everything needed in this kit. Will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> While I am sure the gel in this works wonders, the dental trays are a pain. I followed the direction to the &#x27;t&#x27; and, since I have a slight overbite, ended up with leakage no matter what I do every time I use them. I am sure I don&#x27;t HAVE to use these trays and could replace them easily enough, but I was very disappointed since that is one of the main features of this teeth whitening kit. Will still use once I can get trays, but just be careful if you have an overbite as well, so you are prepared.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried about the molding process if the trays because I have had bad luck in the past with them. This product had a video and great instructions so no problem at all. The amount of gel they give you will last forever!! The free refills is a great promo but don&#x27;t think I will ever need it!</li>
            <li> When I received my order, I was excited to see it came with two trays and syringes of teeth whitening product. Just having it in this form gave me confidence that it would actually work in comparison to whitening strips. You can see the difference in color in just a few days and it isn&#x27;t too harsh on sensitive teeth. I get gingivitis quite often and I was able to use this product with no problems. You do not have to use very much of the product for one application so there are many applications in this package. At this price, it is unbeatable. The company even offers &amp;#34;free refills&amp;#34;, but you must pay a shipping cost. The shipping cost isn&#x27;t too bad so I think this is one of the most affordable and effective ways to whiten your teeth out there. It is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> this is an awesome kit! everything you need! ive only been using this just a few days now and i have great results! my teeth are whiter! i really love how this kit comes with everything you need, trays, gel and a whitening pen for on the go! perfect!! i think the best part is the refills for life! how can that be beat! really easy to use too, no funny taste or smell either. so glad i was given the opportunity to test this teeth whitening kit for free for testing and review purposes!</li>
            <li> You can see the difference right away! Works really good!</li>
            <li> This whitening product works great! I&#x27;m so glad that I was able to get such good results without having to spend hundreds of dollars at the dentists office. This product is easy to use, and really works.</li>
            <li> works good. great product</li>
            <li> I tried this product due to the high rating plus it says free refills so i thought it was a great deal. First off the tray did not mold to my teeth what so ever. I put the product on my teeth and not even a minute later it started burning which i knew it would because other reviews said it would. Well after a little bit i couldn&#x27;t handle the burning anymore i took it off and the bottom of my gums where completely raw and white. So i quickly swished water in my mouth and that didn&#x27;t help. MY bottom row of gums are completely messed up now. I will never ever use a whitening kit again!!! Do not buy this product not worth it.</li>
            <li> Just started using this kit and so far so good.  The gel does not have a bad taste which makes the process easier.  Comes with 2 gel syringes, the teeth tray and a gel pen.  Also like that it comes with a color chart that you can mark when you begin and then your progress through each application.  Easy instructions also included.</li>
            <li> I received this kit this week.  It comes with everything you need - upper and lower trays that can be molded to fit your teeth,  2 very large tubes of whitening gel, a color card to keep track of how your teeth color is changing, and an easy applicator to brush gel on your teeth that is already filled as well!  I just started using it, and noticed a difference in color after 3 uses.  I think this is a great product and the results are noticeable quickly!</li>
            <li> I loveee this product i got this product for a promotional price for an honest opinion so far my teeth have got a shader whiteeer !! 2days</li>
            <li> I love it! I have tried other teeth whitening products before with not much luck. This one was easy to apply. I followed all the directions and so far I haven&#x27;t had any gum pain or sensitivity, my teeth look amazingly white!</li>
            <li> Ive used this product several times over the course of a week and notice a difference. The plunger is a little hard to push but other than that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like it... definitely worth using.. So many different ones on the market but this one works for me!</li>
            <li> great working item&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are brighter then before.&lt;br /&gt;love the item</li>
            <li> This kit was delivered really fast. It comes with upper and lower tray, two large tubes of whitening gel, a color card to keep track of how your teeth color is changing, and an easy applicator brush! I just started using it, and i like it so far. I think this is a good product!</li>
            <li> only used twice but seems to be doing its job. My teeth are a little whiter already. Just be carefull when putting the tray in the hot water I kinda messed mine up but it still works. I will be interested to see how the free refills go when I get to that point but so far I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I wish there&#x27;s been pictures on the page before I bought it. Very cheaply made and haven&#x27;t seen any difference except my gums hurt! The moldable trays do not mold to your mouth at all! Plus the whitening brush does not even dispense the whitener. Very cheap</li>
            <li> I saw this on amazon and read the reviews. I ordered it and it arrived a day early. Last night I tried it with the light. My spouse tried it with out the light. after 45 minutes and one use there was a visible whitening of our teeth but mine was slightly more noticible than my spouses. It works I will be using it 2 or 3 times a week until I get the desired results and then as a touch up after too many colas. The price was better than I have paid in the past. Good company to shop with.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use!</li>
            <li> So far so good,  doesn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt and the pen is awesome.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I used yesterday when it arrived, and after 2 hours with it, I already can see some difference on the first usage. I &#x60;ll continue and keep this updated.</li>
            <li> If only I had read the honest (1-star) reviews first, I would have saved a lot of money.  The product had NO effect after four weeks!</li>
            <li> After one week use at 30 mins per time, I have noticed about 2 shades lighter only. The instructions say only leave in 15 to 20 mins.  But at that rate I don&#x27;t think that a difference would be noticed for a month and using it every day, as the actual peroxide breakdown in the chemical does not occur until after 15 mins.  If one is willing to leave in for a longer period of time,  it does work gradually.  I don&#x27;t feel any tooth sensitivity or gum soreness as I have with other products.</li>
            <li> Really excited to try this product!</li>
            <li> Product was great as promised. Couldn&#x27;t find another product with a better price. Worked immediately and saw fantastic results in the first week. Would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t argue with the price of this product, especially since it comes with free refills!  Ends up being a LOT cheaper than the strips or kits at big box stores!  The trays are very easy to use and form to your teeth, and the solution works great.  It conveniently comes in large syringes that you easily apply in the trays.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i loev thsi teeth whiting kit. its works and is also easy to use</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.  I would definitely recommend. It really works!!!! I can&#x27;t wait to have my husband use it too.</li>
            <li> Wow this is great product.... would recommend it.</li>
            <li> got here so quick and I will use tomorrow. I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t get sensitivity. it looks like it&#x27;s gonna work! will update soon</li>
            <li> I received my teeth whitening kit last week.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and have seen slight results.  The mouth guard doesn&#x27;t fit me very well, but that&#x27;s ok, I just use extra product to make up for it.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeng more results upon regular use.</li>
            <li> I dont see way difference before and after try it several times. The process is long and uncomfortable. I&#x27;m still trying it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this multiple times. The product works wonderful.  You see a huge difference within the first week. No gum pain at all. Worth the price</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time trying to find an affordable kit that actually worked! Best choice I&#x27;ve made when it comes to my teeth whitening! After I opened the package and read the instructions in the pamphlet, I was really happy to see that they were only a few steps rather than a full page of instructions and warnings like I had seen before. The set up for the mouth trays was very easy and it reminded me of breaking in any other mouth guard, except this one fit comfortably in my mouth. All I did was heat it to the recommended temperature and set it in my mouth’s natural position, then bite down for a minute or two. It could not have been easier. I had used other treatments like this and I always felt as though I was going to gag after keeping it in my mouth for the required thirty minutes a day. My teeth look amazing; this kit provides all the necessary ingredients needed to make me feel confident speaking in front of my clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes</li>
            <li> could be packaged better but the product works. which is what matters! Much better than white strips</li>
            <li> I personally had no problems with trays or gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When making the trays, make sure the water is boiling and not over the burner - dip the tray holding onto the tab for 3 seconds, remove and immediately put in your mouth and press down with your fingers for the first tray to form fit the bottom tray around your teeth.  Repeat for the 2nd tray then place on the top, pressing with your fingers while you cinch your teeth together.  I&#x27;ve been making trays due to sports for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The gel - sometime when a thick substance comes in a syringe you have to release the pressure by pulling back on the syringe just a little bit then push forward and you won&#x27;t get a thumb imprint or have to struggle to get the gel out.  I make jello shooters in clean syringes and have learned you have to do this to get the jello out !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the gel does work within a few applications.  The pen is for touch-up and where your tray might not be form fitted to correctly.  I like that you can get more gel for free for buying their teeth whitening system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it came in a better packaging for storing everything that would fit nicely into your bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> What a great product! So Simple to use and works great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I just quit smoking a few months back and have gotten some dental work done that was long over due and I wanted to find a cost effective way to whiten my teeth now that they are fixed. This skit works wonderfully, I saw results in a matter of a few applications!</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times now and I can definitely tell a difference but not as much as I would have liked. I&#x27;m still hoping that when I&#x27;m done with the kit, my teeth will be the shade I&#x27;m looking for. It&#x27;s very simple to use, fast, easy, everything is already put together for you. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how fast this product works! After 1 treatment I could see a big difference in the color of my teeth!! It is very easy to use and so far it has not left my teeth sensitive.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, especially for the price. The only dislike I have is that it takes a lot longer to notice a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Simple to use, easy instruction, complete kit to get started. No bad taste or after taste. Guards are washable. Everything is labeled and easy to read. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have been using a few days and it has made a difference to my teeth! When I have a more noticeable difference I will upload before and after pics. The only problem is the taste of the stuff but I think all teeth whitening gel tastes terrible so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to taste good!</li>
            <li> whitens but my mouth must be really sensitive to this</li>
            <li> There is no better feeling, than to have a great white smile! This product does exactly that! Within days you can see the changes, I would definitely recommend this product to people looking to whiten their teeth for less! I was used to the strips that you buy at drug stores, they work also but they are so expensive this kit works and its less pricey!</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few days and like so far! Also came with a whitening pen which I also used and liked!</li>
            <li> Works well, for someone who drinks coffee daily it helps for sure but you have to stay on top of it!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome deal!!! Free lifetime refills? I really do not know of any other company that offers this. O.K. so let&#x27;s say that is not enough, they also offer a full money back guarantee. The trays are cool, keeps the gel in place where it needs to be, to do the job. The pens are just an added bonus, lets you whiten on the go, at work, in your car, anywhere. There are a million of these kits sold out there, but with this one you cannot go wrong!!! So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> After trying whitening strips before, I figured that I would give this a try. Molding the tray to fit my mouth was probably the easiest and less discomforting part of this whitening kit. On my first try using the kit, I found wearing the trays caused my jaw to hurt and made me drool a ton. I then tried it again the next day; however, this time I managed to get some of the whitening solution on my gums. I didn&#x27;t have the trays in no longer than two minutes when I found part of my gums burning. I took the tray off and saw that it had bleached that portion of my gums. The reason I give the product a 3/5 stars is that from what I could see, the product does help with whitening; however, its just an unpleasant experience. I definitely will be sticking to whitening strips.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time to get used to the tray, but it works....and you can&#x27;t go wrong with free refills.</li>
            <li> I got this product at discounted price. I love it so far. Used it once and can really see a difference. Love it so far</li>
