            <li>I had used the lotion and wasn&#x27;t impressed</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed by it either.</li>
            <li>Being that it is being put on just below my nose, this leaves me with a wonderful feeling of being on an island.  </li>
            <li>Best chap stick I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is great!  </li>

            <li>I wish I had bought more of these!</li>
            <li>Very glad I tried Alba&#x27;s lip balms, they&#x27;re very soothing &amp; I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>The Passion Fruit version has the nicest fruity scent, but the pineapple and coconut are nice, too.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the great price for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>This is the best lip balm I have ever used by far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun--natural lip balms, Chapstick, Vaseline, and for many years, my own homemade chapstick (lanolin, beeswax, and oil).</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I think that it is the scent that I love the most.  </li>
            <li>My kids love it too.  </li>
            <li>Tried this lip balm and it tastes ok</li>
            <li>The Passion Fruit Nectar is my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li>i love it .</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I still LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I tried this based on reviews, and we love it.  </li>
            <li>was much better than Burt&#x27;s Bees, which was one of my deciding factors in ordering this.  </li>
            <li>sure if it&#x27;s the plastic wrap or</li>
            <li>It feels nice and smooth without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Love both scents and love the way the lip balm keeps my lips so moist.</li>
            <li>I love that this lip balm moisturises without shine or oiliness</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients, and it has a great flavor to it, but I did not like how easily it would get soft/melt in the summertime.</li>
            <li>My children love it, and it has a very pleasant smell and slight &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>Best lip balm ever - will not use any other brand!  </li>
            <li>This one is fine</li>
            <li>I like a lip balm that goes on smooth and stays with me throw the night.</li>
            <li>probably when i was looking for gluten free lip balms...didnt catch on with me so gave it to her</li>
            <li>The product is still great and works the same!</li>
            <li>Not waxy, gritty or sticky like many others, and my lips feel more healthy since I&#x27;ve exclusively been using these.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and feels very smooth on your lips.</li>
            <li>I love the Alba brand lip balms because they have high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I love how the chapstick never loses it&#x27;s aroma</li>
            <li>This has a really nice smell/flavor, and works better than other flavored chapsticks.  </li>
            <li>BE AWARE that in warm weather and/or in your pocket, it can get soft.</li>
            <li>Have very sensitive lips, was glad when I found this, the stores don&#x27;t seem to carry anything but pineapple</li>
            <li>Not only do I love that they&#x27;re natural, but they don&#x27;t contain parabens, which makes them even better!</li>
            <li>Toolbilly added a nice little note to my order :-)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not waxy and I love that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m down to my last one and feel like I&#x27;m going to lose a good friend if I don&#x27;t get more!</li>
            <li>This is a great daily lip balm that adds a slight sheen to your lips without being sticky or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>So if you have had previous experience with any of the ones I&#x27;ve listed, you should have a good experience with Alba.</li>
            <li>I am getting older and find that I need to use lip balm much more frequently.</li>
            <li>I have used these continuously ever since I first tried them about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Alba Botanical Hawaiian lip balm</li>
            <li>go somewhere else to get these, this seller had super old ones that had gone rancid.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re available at the local health shop at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>I had tried SO MANY different lip balms and other remedies for improving dry, peeling, chapped lips with nothing being successful, until I started using this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It also has a greasy feel to it which I don&#x27;t really like either.</li>
            <li>but Passion Fruit is what was available locally</li>
            <li>so I may try it when I can find one tube at a reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the container.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re turning the whole tube rather than just the very bottom.</li>
            <li>I saw this and thought that with the reasonable price, why not try it.  </li>
            <li>is gentle and comforting.</li>
            <li>This product is just what my wife was looking for, and did the job just like it was supposed to--and reasonably priced in the bargain.</li>
            <li>I have heard from a few people that it was effective in reducing or stopping peeling.</li>
            <li>I was trying to move away from burts bees (i use the classic one) since they lacked in quality nowadays.</li>
            <li>My main concerns are no SPF and no mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never seen this in any of our local stores, so I will only be able to buy it here online, so</li>
            <li>So - high recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely gentle, and it is clear (in case anyone wondered if the cap represents a color of the balm).&lt;br /&gt;The price</li>
            <li>I wanted to find something that was natural since my daughter see&#x27;s me putting it on and wants some too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, I think they are all pretty much the same except for the purity of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>live without it..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thick and has a kind of strong flavor, but if you have very chapped lips, the improvements this balm will make to your lips are well worth the slight imperfections.</li>
            <li>This is one of the very few lip balms I am able to use.</li>
            <li>The flavor is pretty subtle which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products</li>
            <li>I chose this Lip Balm for being natural, enriching, no SPF...and the reviews&lt;br</li>
            <li>i got a faulty product, but I am surprised at such high reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>Not to the point where it melts (unless you leave it in the sun, I guess) but soft enough that I only &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; it on.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It also stays on your lips and keeps them hydrated for a really long time, which will likely prolong how long the tube lasts!</li>
            <li> And it turns the opposite direction of every other tube such as deodorant, tube facial sunscreen, other chapstick, etc.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel chapped &amp; dry after I&#x27;ve licked it off.</li>
            <li> Others, Burt&#x27;s Bees for example, have minerals in them that dry out my lips and sometimes even leave me feeling burnt&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Alba</li>
            <li> After applying in the morning, my lips were dry after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> came when it was expected to come by.</li>
            <li> Had trouble finding it locally</li>
            <li> The Alba botanica Hawaiian lip balm arrived in expected time.</li>
            <li> The other two lip balms that work for me are the Bath &amp; Body works</li>
            <li> I have a lip balm that I have used over the past several years that I like a lot</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work any miracles, it still wore off eventually, and it felt just slightly sticky.</li>
            <li> Sometimes lip glosses or lip sticks bother me because they are sticky or if you get a little in your mouth they can be iritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to chapstick, and I used to use Chapstick brand or Softlips, but I always had chapped lips and had to reapply constantly throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will go away after a few uses...</li>
            <li> so I am not sure what possessed me to buy the lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea why this was so hard to find, because nothing comes close to it in terms of protection and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> being the silly Mom that i am..purchased her the 6 pack ..for which she will be forever greatful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had used the lotion and wasn&#x27;t impressed so I am not sure what possessed me to buy the lip balm.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed by it either. I like a lip balm that goes on smooth and stays with me throw the night.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. I think that it is the scent that I love the most.  Being that it is being put on just below my nose, this leaves me with a wonderful feeling of being on an island.  My kids love it too.  BE AWARE that in warm weather and/or in your pocket, it can get soft. Not to the point where it melts (unless you leave it in the sun, I guess) but soft enough that I only &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; it on.  If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up with hunks on your lips.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  The smell, taste, and how well it works.  The other two lip balms that work for me are the Bath &amp; Body works CO Bigelow Mentha and the Aveda.  This bundle made this a cheaper alternative and it&#x27;s one that works just as good.  I know everyone loves the Burts Bees but that stuff dries my lips.  So if you have had previous experience with any of the ones I&#x27;ve listed, you should have a good experience with Alba.</li>
            <li> I have used these continuously ever since I first tried them about 4 years ago. Not only do I love that they&#x27;re natural, but they don&#x27;t contain parabens, which makes them even better! I&#x27;m addicted to chapstick, and I used to use Chapstick brand or Softlips, but I always had chapped lips and had to reapply constantly throughout the day. With this one, I only have to reapply after I wipe it off, like when I eat. This is the ONLY lip product I will use.</li>
            <li> I was trying to move away from burts bees (i use the classic one) since they lacked in quality nowadays. Tried this lip balm and it tastes ok but i dont see any lasting effect. I prefer to apply only once a day. After applying in the morning, my lips were dry after only a few hours. Might be i got a faulty product, but I am surprised at such high reviews for this product. The moisturizer doesnt work.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm ever - will not use any other brand!  Great experience shopping with this vendor.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients, and it has a great flavor to it, but I did not like how easily it would get soft/melt in the summertime. Sometimes even in my pocket from body heat. It also has a greasy feel to it which I don&#x27;t really like either. For me the cons outmatch the pros for this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Alba brand lip balms because they have high quality ingredients. The Passion Fruit Nectar is my favorite flavor. It is very moisturizing and feels very smooth on your lips. Sometimes lip glosses or lip sticks bother me because they are sticky or if you get a little in your mouth they can be iritating. This is a great daily lip balm that adds a slight sheen to your lips without being sticky or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I buy the Alba Hawaiian lib balm over and over, because it is the only lip balm that has ever worked on my super-dry lips that tend to crack all year around (not just winter).  I have tried everything under the sun, including minty balms and medicated balms.  The Passion Fruit version has the nicest fruity scent, but the pineapple and coconut are nice, too.</li>
            <li> i love it . came when it was expected to come by. I would def purchase again from this buyer!</li>
            <li> Very glad I tried Alba&#x27;s lip balms, they&#x27;re very soothing &amp; I&#x27;m very happy. Not waxy, gritty or sticky like many others, and my lips feel more healthy since I&#x27;ve exclusively been using these. They don&#x27;t feel chapped &amp; dry after I&#x27;ve licked it off. So - high recommended.</li>
            <li> i had one extra that i had bough for me...probably when i was looking for gluten free lip balms...didnt catch on with me so gave it to her&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she ADORES it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;couldnt live without it..so *grin* being the silly Mom that i am..purchased her the 6 pack ..for which she will be forever greatful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good PRICE!!</li>
            <li> I prefer natural products but I am not totally committed to it. I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun--natural lip balms, Chapstick, Vaseline, and for many years, my own homemade chapstick (lanolin, beeswax, and oil). I wanted to try the coconut version but Passion Fruit is what was available locally so I could just try one tube. My main concerns are no SPF and no mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I think they are all pretty much the same except for the purity of the ingredients. This one is fine but it didn&#x27;t work any miracles, it still wore off eventually, and it felt just slightly sticky. The flavor is pretty subtle which is fine by me. Some people say the coconut is smoother so I may try it when I can find one tube at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I really don&#x27;t like the container. The white section just below the cap is what you turn to make the balm come up. And it turns the opposite direction of every other tube such as deodorant, tube facial sunscreen, other chapstick, etc. Why on earth would they do that??? Almost every time, I have to turn it twice to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I invariably accidentally twist the mechanism when I pull off the cap so that adds to the fun.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I finally got the hang of the twist mechanism. If you grasp the upper part and twist the tube it turns in the same direction as all the others. You&#x27;re turning the whole tube rather than just the very bottom.</li>
            <li> Love Alba products! I&#x27;ve had the chapsticks before so I knew what to expect when purchasing! Love it and I love how the chapstick never loses it&#x27;s aroma it gives off! The only reason why they are on sale is because it is the \\&quot;old\\&quot; look rather than the \\&quot;new\\&quot; look. WHO CARES! The product is still great and works the same! LOVE Alba!</li>
            <li> I have a lip balm that I have used over the past several years that I like a lot but it has become quite costly.  I have been trying different balms that have never compared.  I saw this and thought that with the reasonable price, why not try it.  Well, it is a WINNER!  Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees for years, because of the all-natural ingredients.  I still LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I tried this based on reviews, and we love it.  My children love it, and it has a very pleasant smell and slight &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s extremely gentle, and it is clear (in case anyone wondered if the cap represents a color of the balm).&lt;br /&gt;The price was much better than Burt&#x27;s Bees, which was one of my deciding factors in ordering this.  I have never seen this in any of our local stores, so I will only be able to buy it here online, so I hope they continue to carry it!  Great product</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast! Toolbilly added a nice little note to my order :-)&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, not greasy. The only downside I noticed is it does have a bit of a chemical smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s the plastic wrap or what. Maybe it will go away after a few uses...</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few lip balms I am able to use. Others, Burt&#x27;s Bees for example, have minerals in them that dry out my lips and sometimes even leave me feeling burnt&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Alba is gentle and comforting.</li>
            <li> This product is just what my wife was looking for, and did the job just like it was supposed to--and reasonably priced in the bargain.</li>
            <li> go somewhere else to get these, this seller had super old ones that had gone rancid.  big disappointment since i love these.  will try someone else.</li>
            <li> Best chap stick I have ever used. It smells really nice when I first put it on. It feels nice and smooth without being greasy. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie. This stuff lasts longer than anything I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great!  I wanted to find something that was natural since my daughter see&#x27;s me putting it on and wants some too.  Amazon had it listed for a great price and the product was as described.</li>
            <li> I had tried SO MANY different lip balms and other remedies for improving dry, peeling, chapped lips with nothing being successful, until I started using this lip balm. It&#x27;s a little thick and has a kind of strong flavor, but if you have very chapped lips, the improvements this balm will make to your lips are well worth the slight imperfections. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, and my lips have improved drastically. It also stays on your lips and keeps them hydrated for a really long time, which will likely prolong how long the tube lasts!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used by far! Had trouble finding it locally so I was happy to see it on Amazon. Bought an obscene amount of it (coconut flavor as well) and put it in the refrigerator. I have no idea why this was so hard to find, because nothing comes close to it in terms of protection and moisturizing. I am getting older and find that I need to use lip balm much more frequently. Some people who have peeling lips should try this. I have heard from a few people that it was effective in reducing or stopping peeling.</li>
            <li> This has a really nice smell/flavor, and works better than other flavored chapsticks.  It&#x27;s not waxy and I love that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great Lip Balm! I&#x27;ve tried both the coconut and passion fruit scents. Love both scents and love the way the lip balm keeps my lips so moist. Also, the boyfriend likes the way it smells..can&#x27;t complain about that. Ordered from seller: Toolbilly...fast shipping and good service.</li>
            <li> I used this in a basket gift for my son&#x27;s teachers.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the great price for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought more of these! They&#x27;re available at the local health shop at a much higher price. I love that this lip balm moisturises without shine or oiliness (the lip gloss is good for that). The scent is wonderful (although a bit feminine), and the ingredients good for the body. I&#x27;m down to my last one and feel like I&#x27;m going to lose a good friend if I don&#x27;t get more!</li>
            <li> Have very sensitive lips, was glad when I found this, the stores don&#x27;t seem to carry anything but pineapple so getting this online is great.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Alba Botanical Hawaiian lip balm and it&#x27;s very nice. Non-greasy, and the texture does take some time to get used to, especially if you are used to using lip balm with petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> I chose this Lip Balm for being natural, enriching, no SPF...and the reviews&lt;br /&gt;were best for the Passion Fruit. Coconut Oil absorbs and just feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;I also loved that the reseller was so upbeat!</li>
            <li> Great product. I would  buy again. The Alba botanica Hawaiian lip balm arrived in expected time. I am very pleased.</li>
