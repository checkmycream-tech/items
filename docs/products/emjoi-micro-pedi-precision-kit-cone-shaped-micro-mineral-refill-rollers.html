            <li>AND I AM SO VERY HAPPY</li>
            <li>But the Mani Pedi Callus Remover works great.</li>
            <li>Thank you from both of us for a great product..</li>
            <li>Emjoi products are a great investment and these are so great for using around the toes.</li>
            <li>Before that I thought it was great</li>
            <li>These are great.  </li>
            <li>They are great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;very good material</li>
            <li>Good for summer feet that get abused.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good purchase</li>
            <li>Perfect fit for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi; Allows easy use between toes; great pricing and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li>Great for getting between the toes and on the top and sides.  </li>
            <li>This tool is the greatest ever and these components are such a great way to get into the toe areas and keep your feet in great shape.</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Emjoi allows you to do your own pedi / manicures.  </li>
            <li>Emjoi is a great product, and I also have used &amp; love their hair epilator for many years.</li>
            <li>But they are still pretty great.</li>
            <li>I love this micro</li>
            <li>This is so great , now my manicurist wants to buy it.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about the Emjoi and the cones</li>
            <li>just make it work that much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this accessory as I do all the micro pedi accessories.  </li>
            <li>This precision kit expanded my micro-pedi and made it work even better for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I find I use it more than the roller type.  </li>
            <li>I love these cones.</li>
            <li>These cone rollers are interesting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 2 micro pedis at Costco, mainly because they come with 3 rollers and therefore are a great deal.</li>
            <li>is a great product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, they might design a slimmer roller that fits between the toes more easily as the manufacturers improve the product.</li>
            <li>The machine itself is brilliant and I reviewed the machine earlier.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, like the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>Easy to snap on and off.</li>
            <li>However, the set up is easy and I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put in.  </li>
            <li>I didnt realize the points were smooth, i intended on using them for precision work.</li>
            <li>The precision kit really makes the micro pedi more versatile and able to get to all areas of the feet where needed.</li>
            <li>, It was quick (huge plus), it was easy (for him) and not painful for me  </li>
            <li>Great product and the product description is just as I expected.</li>
            <li>This item is a much needed accessory to the em-joy and I am glad I purchased it when I did.</li>
            <li>Great little tool that helps fine tune your pedi.</li>
            <li>Micro-pedi is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my calloused feet - I&#x27;ve tried many things over the years, various sanders, scrapers, even razor blades (I know that&#x27;s totally not recommended) and nothing has really worked, or if it removed callus, it made my feet sore.  </li>
            <li>Worthy purchase in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Emjoi is a quality brand and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>And the cones are the best for tight areas to get rid of dry skin, etc like between the toes.</li>
            <li>Very helpful when caring for your feet!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>They did the job, though I had to frequently stop and clean them off.</li>
            <li>They wear down pretty quickly so after a couple of uses, I&#x27;m having to buy more.</li>
            <li>These are great for callouses on the ends of your toes or the tough skin around your toe nails.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>The shape really does allow you to get closer to your skin on the sides of your toes.</li>
            <li>but I found you really don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li>Goes very well with the Callus Remover for between the toes.</li>
            <li>These are great for those callouses behind the toes.  </li>
            <li>THESE CONES REALLY DO THE JOB</li>
            <li>but I found the cones a little too wide and therefore not as easy to manipulate as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Nice for use around delicate areas like toes</li>
            <li>The cones work great to get around your toes so your not clipping any cuticle areas and those pesky little corns on little toes.</li>
            <li>I would caution not to be too aggressive when using these on delicate feet. :)</li>
            <li>It saves so much money in the long run over professional pedicures.</li>
            <li>If you are just starting to use the Micro Pedi, get used to useing it first then decide if you think these are necessary.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these in addition to the regular rollers.</li>
            <li>Since I do not have any in-between toe issues at this time, I expect they will last me longer than normal.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great little tool that helps fine tune your pedi.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the cones yet But the Mani Pedi Callus Remover works great. I am unable to bend my knees enough to take care of my feet anymore , I got this product to make it easier for my husband to remove my callus&#x27;s  He was terrible with the hand held sander and hated doing it because he was constantly jabbing me.  He loves this callus remover my feet were in really bad shape, It was quick (huge plus), it was easy (for him) and not painful for me  We like it so well I ordered one for my Sister. Thank you from both of us for a great product..</li>
            <li> I love this accessory as I do all the micro pedi accessories.  I am now doing my spouse&#x27;s feet and can get in to the nooks and crannys where some of the tough caluses are.  His feet are now like a baby&#x27;s bum, Lol !!!</li>

            <li> Nice for use around delicate areas like toes I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Emjoi allows you to do your own pedi / manicures.  Saves hundreds of dollars by doing yourself.  Emjoi is the best brand out there</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. I had no problems with this order and no complaints from the recipient.</li>
            <li> The machine itself is brilliant and I reviewed the machine earlier.  These cone shaped rollers are my additional order once I had established that the machine itself works.  It&#x27;s a good purchase but I found the cones a little too wide and therefore not as easy to manipulate as I would have liked.  However, the set up is easy and I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.  Hopefully, they might design a slimmer roller that fits between the toes more easily as the manufacturers improve the product.</li>

            <li> Got this for my electric Emjoi.  Easy to put in.  I find I use it more than the roller type.  You can get to smaller areas that have hard skin.</li>
            <li> The shape really does allow you to get closer to your skin on the sides of your toes. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works well as an adjunct to the Emjoi Callus remover.</li>
            <li> Great product and the product description is just as I expected.</li>
            <li> These work but I found you really don&#x27;t need them. If you are just starting to use the Micro Pedi, get used to useing it first then decide if you think these are necessary.</li>
            <li> I had my emjoi for a year and it stopped rotating. My use was very light - just one person so very disappointed. Before that I thought it was great but i probably only used it 10-15 times tops. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Goes very well with the Callus Remover for between the toes.</li>
            <li> Micro-pedi is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my calloused feet - I&#x27;ve tried many things over the years, various sanders, scrapers, even razor blades (I know that&#x27;s totally not recommended) and nothing has really worked, or if it removed callus, it made my feet sore.

            <li> These are great for those callouses behind the toes.  Sounds gross, but it does the trick.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> They did the job, though I had to frequently stop and clean them off. They wear down pretty quickly so after a couple of uses, I&#x27;m having to buy more. My feet were not that rough and I only got these just to soften up around the toes.</li>
            <li> I love these cones. I use them to get between my toes.</li>
            <li> Cones too big for target areas.</li>
            <li> These are great.  They get in all the hard to get to places, and work just like the bigger rollers. My feet went from thick, cracked, ugly messes, to pink baby soft feet with this and the regular Emjoi roller for the larger areas. Emjoi is a great product, and I also have used &amp; love their hair epilator for many years.</li>
            <li> This item is a much needed accessory to the em-joy and I am glad I purchased it when I did.</li>
            <li> A must have if you have a Emoji Micro Pedi Kit! A Must have!! I would order two!!!Brilliant product. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> THESE CONES REALLY DO THE JOB AND I AM SO VERY HAPPY AND SO ARE MY FEET</li>
            <li> These cone rollers are interesting. You use them for in-between your toes. Since I do not have any in-between toe issues at this time, I expect they will last me longer than normal. I would caution not to be too aggressive when using these on delicate feet. :)</li>
            <li> This tool is the greatest ever and these components are such a great way to get into the toe areas and keep your feet in great shape. Would not without these.</li>
            <li> the corns were gone in seconds.  what a relieve on my feet.</li>
            <li> I keep reordering these attachments for the Emjoi.  They are great.</li>
