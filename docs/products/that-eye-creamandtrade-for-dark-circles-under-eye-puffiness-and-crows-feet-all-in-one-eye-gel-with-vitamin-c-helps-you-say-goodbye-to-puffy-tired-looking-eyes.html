            <li>All in all, an excellent eye gel with amazing customer service and I am glad that I was able to get the opportunity to try it.</li>

            <li>I  love how smoothly it goes on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>She told me that she noticed my skin looked very even and thought I was wearing some really good foundation, until she tried to wipe it off and saw I wasn&#x27;t wearing any.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice texture and so far, has not ended up burning my eyes, which can be a problem for me and eye creams...  </li>
            <li>IT JUST MAKES MY EYE BAGS FEEL COOL!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very light cream that absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>It helped my puffy under eyes the first night applying, that&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Feels cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Softens the look of fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, glides on easily</li>
            <li>No change in fine lines just yet</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and is more of a gel texture -</li>
            <li>It is so light and airy.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;That Eye Cream\\&quot; serum goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>This product helps with puffiness, it goes on smoothly, and it feels super light.</li>
            <li>not oily and so far am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Gel texture, light weight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I was previously using a thicker eye cream that worked great to keep away fine lines</li>
            <li>That Eye Cream by Radiant Health Naturals has become a fast favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>eye cream is not greasy at all, but light and quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>and my skin had a nice soft feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Not bad product</li>
            <li>THAT absorbs quickly and still makes my eyes look</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I just received this eye gel and honestly couldn&#x27;t say whether I like it or not because the pump BARELY works.</li>
            <li>recommend THAT Eye Cream as a part of your daily regimen...such an easy thing to do for great and lasting results.</li>
            <li>So far I have been pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving the results I have seen in the short time I have been using it!  </li>
            <li>so you feel like you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Love that it has natural ingredients and has no parabens.</li>
            <li>The dark circles under my eyes look much better and my skin around my eyes looks brighter giving me a more youthful look.  </li>
            <li>I feel better knowing THAT does not contain those potentially harmful</li>
            <li>First off.  </li>
            <li>and that is exactly what it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time trying this product, I found a coupon from this site, give it a try you might like it.http://www.thateyecream.com/video-viewers-discount-code/</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth without tugging at sensitive under eye skin.</li>
            <li>Really like this eye gel!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when this bottle runs</li>
            <li>I love using this and will look forward to using it in the future!</li>
            <li>I like that this eye cream is light and absorb quickly so that I can apply it alone or add extra moisturizer if needed.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream as a gift for my niece and it proved to be the right purchase; she told me how much it helped her deflate the puffiness and restore the freshness of her skin.</li>
            <li>, My face  feels so soft after using this and the darkness under my eyes are a little lighter than before, I am sure with more time, I may have a teens eyes .</li>
            <li>the results in the morning have been quite positive...</li>
            <li>Just start using it, hope I can get a better result after I use it for a long time</li>
            <li>I have tried many different eye gels or creams and none of them have really done much of anything.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But what I was real impressed with was how after a few applications, the area under my eyes looked brighter and the dark circles seemed to decrease.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can say I literally started using this less than a week ago.</li>
            <li>I received the new bottle right away and began using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned black woman and dark circles are easily seen, puffy eyes too.  </li>
            <li>goes on nicely...just dont notice much of a difference...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really helps with my under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and find it works really well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever really had a problem with puffiness or wrinkles</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really speak on that part.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much for it to work.</li>
            <li>I really like that it is a pump.  </li>
            <li>It feels very cooling.  </li>
            <li>that I expected and I love the packaging.  </li>
            <li>And I feel that looking good by using skin and eye care products gives me that extra advantage in my professional and personal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are also several peptides which are essential ingredients in any effective eye cream according to my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>After writing my review, I was pretty much immediately contacted by customer service to let me know that they were shipping me a new bottle since mine was not working.</li>
            <li>Because I use it in combination with a moisturizing and firming eye cream as well, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars - it&#x27;s not exactly an &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; solution for my aging skin, more of an addition to what I&#x27;m already doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Less is definitely more with this product as too much will leave the skin tacky feeling however, it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much...not even a full pump, so it should last a while.  </li>
            <li>It feels very refreshing and does not sting at all like some other facial products I have used.</li>
            <li>after all decent product.</li>
            <li>I have had this for a few months now and don&#x27;t really notice a difference, I think it is ok.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in a week of using it I highly recommend it .I</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>I went to my esthetician today who normally arches my eyebrows for me every two weeks.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is a bit too thin, but it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>(I live in Arizona,</li>
            <li>So far I am extremely pleased and expect to use this serum for a long time in order to keep those fine lines at bay as well as prevent dark circles and that general \\&quot;tired look\\&quot; that I see in so many women of a certain age!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much so it should last a while.</li>
            <li>This bottle will go a LONG ways, making it worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far this is working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so I expect this bottle to last a good while.</li>
            <li>The only problem was trying to get the wrap off the bottle as it has a tight plastic seal -- it won&#x27;t leak in transport for sure.</li>
            <li>also discovered my old eye cream contained parabens, which is why I started looking for skin care alternatives.  </li>
            <li>So far I have seen no problems at all.</li>
            <li>Too early to say any antiaging effects.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen anything about this eye cream that seems to make any difference.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t burn or sting my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>the results I have had so far.</li>
            <li>It sinks right in when applied and works well with makeup.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, no strong smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am leery about cosmetics near my eyes because I tend to tear (cry) due to certain chemicals or fragrances.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way , fast absorbing , non greasy !   </li>
            <li>Would purchase again - dark circles under my eyes are much lighter!  </li>
            <li>i love the smell and it feels a little tight</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive, so I have a hard time finding products that work, and don&#x27;t leave a greasy, grimy finish to my skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure what to right??</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t hold much hope for products to make any difference in how my eyes look, but this has made the darkness less and has soothed them with it&#x27;s cooling effect.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely purchase a new bottle when this one runs out, but it looks like I won&#x27;t have to worry about that for at least 2 more months since a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice texture and so far, has not ended up burning my eyes, which can be a problem for me and eye creams...  </li>
            <li> IT JUST MAKES MY EYE BAGS FEEL COOL!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very light cream that absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> It helped my puffy under eyes the first night applying, that&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Feels cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Softens the look of fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, glides on easily</li>
            <li> No change in fine lines just yet</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and is more of a gel texture -</li>
            <li> It is so light and airy.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;That Eye Cream\\&quot; serum goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This product helps with puffiness, it goes on smoothly, and it feels super light.</li>
            <li> not oily and so far am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Gel texture, light weight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a thicker eye cream that worked great to keep away fine lines</li>
            <li> That Eye Cream by Radiant Health Naturals has become a fast favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and I love the packaging.</li>
            <li> eye cream is not greasy at all, but light and quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> and my skin had a nice soft feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Not bad product</li>
            <li> THAT absorbs quickly and still makes my eyes look</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I just received this eye gel and honestly couldn&#x27;t say whether I like it or not because the pump BARELY works.</li>
            <li> recommend THAT Eye Cream as a part of your daily regimen...such an easy thing to do for great and lasting results.</li>
            <li> So far I have been pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving the results I have seen in the short time I have been using it!  </li>
            <li> so you feel like you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Love that it has natural ingredients and has no parabens.</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes look much better and my skin around my eyes looks brighter giving me a more youthful look.  </li>
            <li> I feel better knowing THAT does not contain those potentially harmful</li>
            <li> First off.  </li>
            <li> and that is exactly what it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time trying this product, I found a coupon from this site, give it a try you might like it.http://www.thateyecream.com/video-viewers-discount-code/</li>
            <li> It glides on smooth without tugging at sensitive under eye skin.</li>
            <li> Really like this eye gel!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more when this bottle runs</li>
            <li> I love using this and will look forward to using it in the future!</li>
            <li> I like that this eye cream is light and absorb quickly so that I can apply it alone or add extra moisturizer if needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream as a gift for my niece and it proved to be the right purchase; she told me how much it helped her deflate the puffiness and restore the freshness of her skin.</li>
            <li> , My face  feels so soft after using this and the darkness under my eyes are a little lighter than before, I am sure with more time, I may have a teens eyes .</li>
            <li> the results in the morning have been quite positive...</li>
            <li> Just start using it, hope I can get a better result after I use it for a long time</li>
            <li> I have tried many different eye gels or creams and none of them have really done much of anything.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But what I was real impressed with was how after a few applications, the area under my eyes looked brighter and the dark circles seemed to decrease.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can say I literally started using this less than a week ago.</li>
            <li> I received the new bottle right away and began using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned black woman and dark circles are easily seen, puffy eyes too.  </li>
            <li> goes on nicely...just dont notice much of a difference...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really helps with my under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and find it works really well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever really had a problem with puffiness or wrinkles</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really speak on that part.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much for it to work.</li>
            <li> I really like that it is a pump.  </li>
            <li> It feels very cooling.  </li>
            <li> that I expected and I love the packaging.  </li>
            <li> And I feel that looking good by using skin and eye care products gives me that extra advantage in my professional and personal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are also several peptides which are essential ingredients in any effective eye cream according to my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> After writing my review, I was pretty much immediately contacted by customer service to let me know that they were shipping me a new bottle since mine was not working.</li>
            <li> Because I use it in combination with a moisturizing and firming eye cream as well, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars - it&#x27;s not exactly an &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; solution for my aging skin, more of an addition to what I&#x27;m already doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Less is definitely more with this product as too much will leave the skin tacky feeling however, it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much...not even a full pump, so it should last a while.  </li>
            <li> It feels very refreshing and does not sting at all like some other facial products I have used.</li>
            <li> after all decent product.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months now and don&#x27;t really notice a difference, I think it is ok.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in a week of using it I highly recommend it .I</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> I went to my esthetician today who normally arches my eyebrows for me every two weeks.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is a bit too thin, but it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li> (I live in Arizona,</li>
            <li> So far I am extremely pleased and expect to use this serum for a long time in order to keep those fine lines at bay as well as prevent dark circles and that general \\&quot;tired look\\&quot; that I see in so many women of a certain age!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> This bottle will go a LONG ways, making it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So far this is working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I expect this bottle to last a good while.</li>
            <li> The only problem was trying to get the wrap off the bottle as it has a tight plastic seal -- it won&#x27;t leak in transport for sure.</li>
            <li> also discovered my old eye cream contained parabens, which is why I started looking for skin care alternatives.  </li>
            <li> So far I have seen no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Too early to say any antiaging effects.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen anything about this eye cream that seems to make any difference.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t burn or sting my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> the results I have had so far.</li>
            <li> It sinks right in when applied and works well with makeup.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, no strong smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am leery about cosmetics near my eyes because I tend to tear (cry) due to certain chemicals or fragrances.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way , fast absorbing , non greasy !   </li>
            <li> Would purchase again - dark circles under my eyes are much lighter!  </li>
            <li> i love the smell and it feels a little tight</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive, so I have a hard time finding products that work, and don&#x27;t leave a greasy, grimy finish to my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to right??</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t hold much hope for products to make any difference in how my eyes look, but this has made the darkness less and has soothed them with it&#x27;s cooling effect.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely purchase a new bottle when this one runs out, but it looks like I won&#x27;t have to worry about that for at least 2 more months since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (so you don&#x27;t damage the fragile skin around your eyes) and really seems to work in terms of making my dark circles less apparent and softening my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know the long term benefits as yet.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it is too dry.</li>
            <li> After applying daily for an extended period of time, I see no reduction or change to the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> but I think it actually works with my dark circle.</li>
            <li> I had been using concealer under my eyes for a while now to get rid of the dark circles, but even for the last couple of days there has been no need for me to use it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes...and have had a hard time finding eye cream that does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tighter and I have only been using it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> It helps with the dark circles and dry skin underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this eye gel.</li>
            <li> Because of viscosity one small drop is enough for both eyes.</li>
            <li> my genetic dark circles are not completely gone, but they have faded a bit and there is little to no puffiness.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty diluted but doesn&#x27;t mean it is not good.</li>
            <li> Alot of money spent with little results.</li>
            <li> She says that it reduces the wrinkles and the dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting up there in age and started noticing dark circles under my eye.  </li>
            <li> For me not worth the money would not buy again</li>
            <li> I notice my dark circle become lighter and lighter.</li>
            <li> a lot and caused severe dark circles that would not go away.  </li>
            <li> but it has diminished my dark circles by about 50%, which is a lot for me because mine are really dark.</li>
            <li> My eyes don&#x27;t look as puffy and dark when I use this twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend That Eye Cream to anyone who has dark circles or puffiness around their eye area.</li>
            <li> does wonders with dark circles under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> My puffiness is down and it appears to be helping with the dark circles.</li>
            <li> lines look less noticeable...</li>
            <li> Have noticed less puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I can see the little lines around my eyes diminish....</li>
            <li> I did just a little research and found that the green tea extract is an anti-inflammatory, the sodium hyaluronate is for moisturizing and healing, and the vitamin C is an antioxidant.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> noticible difference in just a few fews.</li>
            <li> Either they feel too heavy</li>
            <li> What a waste.    </li>
            <li> LOOK REFRESHED EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or stiff feel.  </li>
            <li> Little miracle in a bottle, this stuff!</li>
            <li> I usually stay away from eye creams because nothing works on me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it helps with that.</li>
            <li> and it would be to late now.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or thick at all.  </li>
            <li> I recommend anyone to at least try it!  </li>
            <li> and/or end up irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for approximately three weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was ill rubbed my eyes</li>
            <li> but that is not to say it is bad...</li>

            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING NOW FOR THREE WEEKS AND I SEE NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL! IT JUST MAKES MY EYE BAGS FEEL COOL!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. No visible difference in my appearance</li>
            <li> Excellent eye cream....lines look less noticeable...skin feels tightened..</li>
            <li> Almost 3 weeks ago I changed up my morning skin care routine to include THAT eye serum and I am glad I did.  I was previously using a thicker eye cream that worked great to keep away fine lines but it left a sticky feel that was noticeable when I put on my makeup.  THAT absorbs quickly and still makes my eyes look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also discovered my old eye cream contained parabens, which is why I started looking for skin care alternatives.  I feel better knowing THAT does not contain those potentially harmful toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase a new bottle when this one runs out, but it looks like I won&#x27;t have to worry about that for at least 2 more months since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to right?? The pump BROKE in TWO days. I CANNOT even use the darn thing and want my money back. PLEASE HELP.</li>
            <li> I love the light weight feel to the serum!  So far I have been pleased with this product. I will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> noticible difference in just a few fews. Would definately recommend</li>
            <li> honestly..I have no problems with it....goes on nicely...just dont notice much of a difference...but that is not to say it is bad...will keep using it !</li>
            <li> After applying daily for an extended period of time, I see no reduction or change to the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.  Have noticed less puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty diluted but doesn&#x27;t mean it is not good. Because of viscosity one small drop is enough for both eyes. So far I have seen no problems at all. Too early to say any antiaging effects. after all decent product. Great pump.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product each morning and evening as my eye cream...  It&#x27;s a very nice texture and so far, has not ended up burning my eyes, which can be a problem for me and eye creams...  Very nice texture and I&#x27;m loving the results I have seen in the short time I have been using it!  Will buy again...</li>
            <li> That Eye Cream by Radiant Health Naturals has become a fast favorite of mine. I  love how smoothly it goes on and I can see the little lines around my eyes diminish....I recommend anyone to at least try it!  I know you will like it!</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it every day and night I noticed a difference in a week of using it I highly recommend it .I am an estetician  and trust me its great .</li>
            <li> I usually stay away from eye creams because nothing works on me. Either they feel too heavy and/or end up irritating my eyes. This product helps with puffiness, it goes on smoothly, and it feels super light. No irritation or heaviness whatsoever.</li>
            <li> i love the smell and it feels a little tight but i use a collagen lotion with it i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Works great, doesn&#x27;t break my eyes out like most products. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen anything about this eye cream that seems to make any difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 month now.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother in law. She has been using this product for a while and she loves it. She says that it reduces the wrinkles and the dark circles under the eyes. I contacted the seller and they have A+ customer service. Good job seller, this is how you do business!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is not greasy and goes on nicely!! I will buy it again</li>
            <li> It is so light and airy. it feels great on my skin and so refreshing . I use eye cream every day and most get in my eye and make my eye burn for hours, NOT this eye gel !  so run, run, run and get you some ! I enjoyed it and my puffiness is gone too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and already notice the circles getting lighter and puffiness not as noticeable.  I like the texture...not oily and so far am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way , fast absorbing , non greasy !   I received the product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review</li>
            <li> Would not purchase this again. No noticeable effects. You could get this from a $10 Body Shop gel. I canno recommend.</li>
            <li> First off.  I&#x27;m a guy that uses these product because I care about taking care of myself.  I&#x27;m getting up there in age and started noticing dark circles under my eye.  And I feel that looking good by using skin and eye care products gives me that extra advantage in my professional and personal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good eye serum. However, I&#x27;ve found that it works best when I apply a heavier moisturizer on top - it gives better results than just using eye cream on its own. This is what I do at night and the results in the morning have been quite positive... my genetic dark circles are not completely gone, but they have faded a bit and there is little to no puffiness. So far this is working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Definitely a keeper. Because I use it in combination with a moisturizing and firming eye cream as well, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars - it&#x27;s not exactly an &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; solution for my aging skin, more of an addition to what I&#x27;m already doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps the ladies and the men out there.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is a bit too thin, but it works fairly well.  I just prefer a more condensed (thicker) product.</li>
            <li> Not bad product but I am finding that most of these products for the eyes don&amp;#34;t do as they say. Alot of money spent with little results.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive, so I have a hard time finding products that work, and don&#x27;t leave a greasy, grimy finish to my skin. This one doesn&#x27;t! THAT eye cream is refreshing (I live in Arizona, so that&#x27;s a BIG plus!) and effective. Best of all, you don&#x27;t need a lot to get results. This bottle will go a LONG ways, making it worth every penny. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months now and don&#x27;t really notice a difference, I think it is ok. I would of sent it back but just forgot and it would be to late now.</li>
            <li> Oh goodness, I love this product all in one and that is exactly what it is. Smooth, no strong smell, My face  feels so soft after using this and the darkness under my eyes are a little lighter than before, I am sure with more time, I may have a teens eyes . Great product.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is great! It shipped fast and I love the packaging. It has Vitamin C in it. It soaks into the skin and there is no residue noted. My skin feels tighter and Iooks brighter.  It&#x27;s lightweight yet very effective. You don&#x27;t need very much so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes...and have had a hard time finding eye cream that does not irritate my eyes. I have find this eye cream gentle and refreshing, and really works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I wanted a eye de-puff item this did not do that. For me not worth the money would not buy again</li>
            <li> I totally love this product.  I&#x27;m a fair skinned black woman and dark circles are easily seen, puffy eyes too.  Since using this cream I can truly the see the difference.  I&#x27;ve been using the cream almost a month now.  I told my sister and friends about it!  Thanks for this wonderful eye cream</li>
            <li> I like this cream and I can already see results after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> love the light weight and refreshing feeling on my face. love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love  this cream is really good.I been using for about a two week and my skin look wonderful</li>
            <li> IT HELPS MY EYES LOOK WELL LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye gel for about a mouth. Gel texture, light weight and absorbs quickly. Really helps with my under eye puffiness. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles around my eyes I am not sure if it helps with that. It&#x27;s my first time trying this product, I found a coupon from this site, give it a try you might like it.http://www.thateyecream.com/video-viewers-discount-code/</li>
            <li> I love that this is a gel and not a cream. It glides on smooth without tugging at sensitive under eye skin. There is no smell. A little goes a long way with this eye gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and find it works really well. I am 68 and just starting to get puffy skin under my eyes and wanted to take care of it asap. I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I just received this eye gel and honestly couldn&#x27;t say whether I like it or not because the pump BARELY works. 6 or 7 pumps and I get a miniscule amount. What a waste.    *** UPDATE ***    After writing my review, I was pretty much immediately contacted by customer service to let me know that they were shipping me a new bottle since mine was not working. I received the new bottle right away and began using it. I love the weightless feel of the gel. Less is definitely more with this product as too much will leave the skin tacky feeling however, it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done. The darkness under my eyes is doing much better. I haven&#x27;t ever really had a problem with puffiness or wrinkles so I can&#x27;t really speak on that part. All in all, an excellent eye gel with amazing customer service and I am glad that I was able to get the opportunity to try it.</li>
            <li> Softens the look of fine lines. Feels cool and refreshing. Absorbs quickly. I would recommend buying this eye cream!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this eye cream after reading the ingredient list. I did just a little research and found that the green tea extract is an anti-inflammatory, the sodium hyaluronate is for moisturizing and healing, and the vitamin C is an antioxidant. There are also several peptides which are essential ingredients in any effective eye cream according to my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream is not greasy at all, but light and quickly absorbed. It feels very refreshing and does not sting at all like some other facial products I have used. A little goes a long way, so I expect this bottle to last a good while. I have been using it twice a day, at night before I go to bed and in the morning under my make up. So far I am extremely pleased and expect to use this serum for a long time in order to keep those fine lines at bay as well as prevent dark circles and that general \\&quot;tired look\\&quot; that I see in so many women of a certain age!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend THAT Eye Cream as a part of your daily regimen...such an easy thing to do for great and lasting results.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST EYE CREAM EVER I LOVE HOW I CAN STAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT AND LOOK REFRESHED EVERYDAY THANK YOU</li>
            <li> This is a great eye gel. It sinks right in when applied and works well with makeup.  It&#x27;s also great for sensitive eyes. It doesn&#x27;t cause me any itching and burning.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;That Eye Cream\\&quot; serum goes on easily and dries quickly. After using it for several days, I can definitely see brightening/lightening under my eyes. The tender skin under my eyes is also smoother-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am leery about cosmetics near my eyes because I tend to tear (cry) due to certain chemicals or fragrances. I am thrilled to report that I have had NO problem with \\&quot;That Eye Cream\\&quot; (serum), and I endorse this product.</li>
            <li> Would purchase again - dark circles under my eyes are much lighter!  I have only used the product a short time so I don&#x27;t know the long term benefits as yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream as a gift for my niece and it proved to be the right purchase; she told me how much it helped her deflate the puffiness and restore the freshness of her skin. I looked for something anti-aging and skin brightening for her as this is the kind of present she said would make her happy. I can say now That Eye Cream seems like a good way to make someone happy!</li>
            <li> goes on smooth  feel nice</li>
            <li> It helped my puffy under eyes the first night applying, that&#x27;s amazing. I notice my dark circle become lighter and lighter. I have a combination skin, and sometimes my face it too oily and sometimes it is too dry. I like that this eye cream is light and absorb quickly so that I can apply it alone or add extra moisturizer if needed.</li>
            <li> The eye gel goes on smooth and it&#x27;s great to wear under your moisturizer. It helps with the dark circles and dry skin underneath my eyes. Love this eyes gel and will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much for it to work. It will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but the eye cream fits perfectly with my skin. Just start using it, hope I can get a better result after I use it for a long time</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a week but I think it actually works with my dark circle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.  I have been using it about a month.  I bought it because I was ill rubbed my eyes a lot and caused severe dark circles that would not go away.  I used this product every night and my circles faded.  I also notice my lines are not as deep.</li>
            <li> Really like this eye gel! The ingredients are healthy, too!</li>
            <li> This eye cream is not like any of the others I have tried.  It works well under my moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or stiff feel.  I&#x27;ve been looking for one with vitamin c.  And, the bottle is good sized for the price so you feel like you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye gel about a week ago and really love it. It&#x27;s light, glides on easily (so you don&#x27;t damage the fragile skin around your eyes) and really seems to work in terms of making my dark circles less apparent and softening my crow&#x27;s feet. Love that it has natural ingredients and has no parabens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and have seen great results. No change in fine lines just yet but it has diminished my dark circles by about 50%, which is a lot for me because mine are really dark. It soaks in quickly and is more of a gel texture - it isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t burn or sting my sensitive eyes. It has no fragrance which is great. My eyes don&#x27;t look as puffy and dark when I use this twice a day. I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t have to pile on the undereye concealer anymore to not look like a zombie! I&#x27;d recommend That Eye Cream to anyone who has dark circles or puffiness around their eye area. Little miracle in a bottle, this stuff!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for approximately three weeks. My puffiness is down and it appears to be helping with the dark circles. Very light going on and takes just a drop to cover. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> That eye cream is a great eye gel</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried every eye cream out there and I keep buying more. But I will be sticking with this one for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very light cream that absorbs quickly and my skin had a nice soft feel to it.  Not greasy or thick at all.  Plus, some creams irritate the skin around my eyes and this cream felt wonderful. No irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I was real impressed with was how after a few applications, the area under my eyes looked brighter and the dark circles seemed to decrease.  I will definitely be buying more when this bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just purchased my second bottle of THAT Eye Cream. I am very happy the results I have had so far. The dark circles under my eyes look much better and my skin around my eyes looks brighter giving me a more youthful look.  I also purchased the Age-Defying Moisturizer with Matrixyl® from THAT skin care. Love it too!</li>
            <li> does wonders with dark circles under the eyes.  highly recommend</li>
            <li> I really like that it is a pump.  It feels very cooling.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I honestly can say I literally started using this less than a week ago. I went to my esthetician today who normally arches my eyebrows for me every two weeks. She told me that she noticed my skin looked very even and thought I was wearing some really good foundation, until she tried to wipe it off and saw I wasn&#x27;t wearing any. I had been using concealer under my eyes for a while now to get rid of the dark circles, but even for the last couple of days there has been no need for me to use it. I love using this and will look forward to using it in the future!</li>
            <li> Like it to apply after my eye serum</li>
            <li> This eye gel is awesome!  It shipped faster that I expected and I love the packaging.  It is great that it has Vitamin C in it also.  All the spas I have ever been to use products like this for facials.  It soaks into the skin and there is no residue noted.  My skin feels tighter and I have only been using it for a few days.  You don&#x27;t need very much...not even a full pump, so it should last a while.  I will buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I was given this product as a gift.  I have tried many different eye gels or creams and none of them have really done much of anything.  I&#x27;ve even tried the \\&quot;wonder\\&quot; eye gel and it&#x27;s like putting glue under your eyes.  This has shown an improvement in my under eye area within a week of using it.  I have an eye disease so I don&#x27;t hold much hope for products to make any difference in how my eyes look, but this has made the darkness less and has soothed them with it&#x27;s cooling effect.  Overall it has made me very happy and I will plan on purchasing another bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a baby boomer and am always on the lookout for good skincare products for aging skin. This eye gel is very soothing and after using it for a few days, helped reduce wrinkles and puffiness. The only problem was trying to get the wrap off the bottle as it has a tight plastic seal -- it won&#x27;t leak in transport for sure.</li>
