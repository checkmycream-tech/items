            <li>This color is very cute.</li>
            <li>and this is a top color!</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>Love this stunning color.  </li>
            <li>I then addded a second coat and by this point you get perfect coverage.</li>
            <li>I give each color coat 2 minutes then apply a more generous swipe of top coat which I cure for 5 minutes followed by a swipe of rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>final effect is great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shellac has really come out with a great range for this Fall</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>After two coats it had a brown hint to it when in the light.</li>
            <li>Its not too overtly obvious making this a great choice that will go from work to party!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great color, but needs an extra coat to not look brown after the process.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and easy to use.</li>
            <li>First the color is more brownish gray.</li>
            <li>It is so glamorous looking and rich.  </li>
            <li>, more dark gray, stays on good no chipping</li>
            <li>You would think that for the cost I would have gotten a product that was worth the money.</li>
            <li>but I put it on and after the top coat and the curing boy o boy was I surprised.  </li>
            <li>As usual, a great product from CND.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty color</li>
            <li>It was old and goopy, and crinkled up when I cured it in the gel light.</li>
            <li>a great bronze-taupe with a subtle glitter.</li>
            <li>It is more of a brownish than a grey</li>
            <li>Kind of dark for me.</li>
            <li>It has sparkles in the polish and it wears really well.  </li>
            <li>You will love the color if you like pretty dark, shimmery colors.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful color, dark but not as stark as a black, it comes out a deep grey with hints of brown in the light and you get a very suble hint of shimmer when you look at your nails in bright light.</li>
            <li>I ordered this thinking it would be a black with more of a gray glimmer.</li>
            <li>Color was great but product was instantly thick like old polish and this caused major wrinkling during the curing process.</li>
            <li>New.</li>
            <li>Love the color isn&#x27;t black nor red.  </li>
            <li>It looks very close to the picture just a little more dark brown and silver.</li>
            <li>It has a metallic shin to it that normally I would not like but in this dark of a color it really works well.</li>
            <li>Very classy especially for fall!</li>
            <li>really unique color, a mix of dark grey and a hint of brown together in one shade with the added benefit of a hint of shimmer!&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is truly a black color at first</li>
            <li>I am a nail tech, and used this on a client for the first time a few weeks ago.</li>

            <li> However do not be tempted to add more to the initial coat, as ultra thin coats are the secret to success with Shellac.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very didappointed that I wasted my money on this!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on long either</li>
            <li> The color that is depicted is not what it looks like on your nails, it is very much a dark grey and you can&#x27;t see any of the shimmer.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I expected it to be..</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently wearing this for halloween and will admit, given the dark shade, its a little trickier to apply.</li>
            <li> Not light grey</li>
            <li> Came in less than a week.</li>
            <li> to go dark on finger nails!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I did one coat of base for 2 minutes, then the first coat of this goes in rather patchy and quite thin to the point its somewhat transparent.</li>
            <li> Should have sent it back !! :(</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I was incredibly unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> I hate this color.</li>

            <li> good color and product</li>
            <li> I hate this color. It&#x27;s brown and dulll not sparkly at all it clumped up and I had to redo my nails with another color! I&#x27;m very didappointed that I wasted my money on this! I will never use it</li>
            <li> New. Came in less than a week. Matches the color of my Jeep.</li>
            <li> Color was great but product was instantly thick like old polish and this caused major wrinkling during the curing process. Should have sent it back !! :(</li>

            <li> I ordered this thinking it would be a black with more of a gray glimmer. After two coats it had a brown hint to it when in the light. It is a pretty color but I myself am not big on brown. I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will love the color if you like pretty dark, shimmery colors. The color stay on until you take it off!</li>
            <li> We loved this color for the holidays- a great bronze-taupe with a subtle glitter. The CND Shellac products are always good quality, and this color doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>

However do not be tempted to add more to the initial coat, as ultra thin coats are the secret to success with Shellac.  I then addded a second coat and by this point you get perfect coverage. This is your chance to fill in those streaks and I found two coats just enought. I give each color coat 2 minutes then apply a more generous swipe of top coat which I cure for 5 minutes followed by a swipe of rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final effect is great!

            <li> This color is very cute. It looks very close to the picture just a little more dark brown and silver. I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Great color, but needs an extra coat to not look brown after the process. Still is what it is and worked great!</li>
            <li> Not light grey, more dark gray, stays on good no chipping</li>
            <li> First the color is more brownish gray. But that&#x27;s not my issue. The issue is it was goopy and after going under the lights wrinkled up. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love the color isn&#x27;t black nor red.  The shade has a hint of brown, hint of gray.  Great color for fall and winter.  Great toe color for those timid to go dark on finger nails!</li>
            <li> Very pretty and easy to use.</li>
            <li> this is truly a black color at first I was skeptical but I put it on and after the top coat and the curing boy o boy was I surprised.  It is so glamorous looking and rich.  It has sparkles in the polish and it wears really well.  I got a lot of compliments on this color</li>
            <li> Gorgeous fall color. It is more of a brownish than a grey</li>
