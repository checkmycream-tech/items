            <li>My legs look so nice!  </li>
            <li>Then, I discovered Sally Hansen&#x27;s Airbrush Legs and have absolutely loved this product.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product &amp; will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It was just the right amout of coverage and it looked great!  </li>
            <li>Everything was perfect thank you very much .&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Salley Hansen Airbrush Legs Light Glow is a great product - it covers unsightly veins &amp; a rash</li>
            <li>light glow is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Have a mirror handy to ensure even coverage on backs of legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is nice for summer.</li>
            <li>The makeup stays put and did not rub off on my husbands tux or my own dress.    </li>
            <li>This product makes my older legs look great!  </li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs is a wonderful product for those of us who live in the south and need to go without stockings in the summer.</li>
            <li>However, the Light Glow color is no longer for fair skin.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very light color</li>
            <li>It makes your legs look very smooth and a kinda glow like you are wearing pantyhose.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for more coverage.</li>
            <li>so I can wear shorts, dresses and skirts with more confidence.</li>
            <li>I feel so confident when I have this on.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Just to be safe</li>
            <li>/&gt;You are best dealer will not hesitate next time to buy from you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went for it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you use something more like a Scrub &#x27;n Sponge.  </li>
            <li>Their customer service is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I did get the non-spray tube from Walgreens and that one has no glitter in it, which I like better.</li>
            <li>The coverage seems pretty good if you had a darker skin tone...</li>
            <li>It is so easy, and more importantly there is NO smell.</li>
            <li>It is easily removed with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>It does come off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>And as for \\&quot;removes easily with soap, water, and a washcloth\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>It actually covers a permanent \\&quot;stain\\&quot; on my shin just beautifully.</li>
            <li>I am very, very pale and this is probably the best shade they offer for very light skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This color has changed to a darker, more golden color that I can no longer use.</li>
            <li>B00192QCRI Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs Light Glow 4.4 oz.</li>
            <li>I use the light glow</li>
            <li>I spray it directly on my legs and rub it in really good.  </li>
            <li>For my pale skin, the Light Glow is perfect, but in summer I also use Medium Glow and it doesn&#x27;t look unnatural at all.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product; it really does just what it states it does...gives your skin a clear, smooth, silky look as if you were wearing stockings.  </li>
            <li>I burn easily and don&#x27;t really tan.  </li>
            <li>It simply makes whatever color legs you have look almost flawless, tight, smooth and even-colored.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve told several friends about it and they are loving it also.</li>
            <li>The cover up part was fine -- it did a decent job of covering my leg veins, but it looked rediculous.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is and how much I appreciate the person who developed it!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old and have some brown spots and light spider veins on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I rushed the process and would allow myself more time next</li>
            <li>Apply product in the bathroom---not over carpet and have a couple of dark colored towels you don&#x27;t care about handy.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a whitey white girl like me, and need to cover up your imperfections, pay a little more and get the Air Stocking brand -- it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>However, once it dried and in the natural light it looked much better than it did in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will not cover up very visible veins</li>
            <li>I am very well versed in self tanners and they just don&#x27;t work as well as this for legs.  </li>
            <li>, I USE THE LIGHT SHADE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER AND USE THE MEDIUM LATER IN THE SUMMER.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON FOR HELPING TO MARKET THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It makes it much easier to spread</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants the look of wearing stockings without really doing so.</li>
            <li>It comes out really orange.</li>
            <li>Product is easy to apply and dried quickly.</li>
            <li>So much better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Just as the title says, this product covers just a little bit, evens out, and makes my ultra-white legs suitable for daytime viewing.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the most life-saving beauty product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>(Older label stated \\&quot;Perfection\\&quot; instead of Air Brush Legs.)</li>
            <li>I had realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend to anyone who wears pantyhose but prefers not to.</li>
            <li>This looks wonderful and does not have a bad smell.  </li>
            <li>The shimmer reflects light and spider veins are much harder to spot!</li>
            <li>There were enough positive reviews to encourage the purchase.  </li>
            <li>The color is also natural looking....</li>
            <li>I have always been self conscious wearing shorts</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen so much shimmer on a human body part in my life!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spray it directly in your legs.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and covers well.</li>
            <li>and it is natural looking with just a hint of shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to cover darker veins completely</li>
            <li>Now I have to stay out of the sun completely because I&#x27;m allergic to it.  </li>
            <li>I was never able to feel comfortable showing my legs.  </li>
            <li>put lotion on your legs first and then spray on the Leg Makeup and rub it in while your legs are still wet with lotion.  </li>
            <li>It was worth a shot but the colour is awful on my very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I mean, I would&#x27;ve gotten it in stores or online from an authorized retailer, but nobody had Light Glow in stock except here.</li>
            <li>I have very bad spider veins in my legs &amp; this does a great job of covering them, so they&#x27;re not hardly noticeable.</li>

            <li> I mean, I would&#x27;ve gotten it in stores or online from an authorized retailer, but nobody had Light Glow in stock except here.</li>
            <li> I have very bad spider veins in my legs &amp; this does a great job of covering them, so they&#x27;re not hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris, visible green veins, and minor hyper pigmentation on my legs, so I was really hoping that this product would work.</li>
            <li> It was much more subtle than some of the negative reviews led me to believe.</li>
            <li> This product only covered them slightly, like a very sheer stocking.  </li>
            <li> so you are used to the application process and how long it takes for it to dry on your skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to try airbrush legs!</li>
            <li> The only reservation I have about this spray is that it has glitter in it (which I don&#x27;t remember anyone mentioning in other reviews) which I didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> Give this product ample time to dry before getting dressed and use caution when you do.</li>
            <li> And let it dry for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, it offered absolutely zero coverage.</li>
            <li> Be careful when spraying it, if i gets on clothes when it is still wet , it stains.</li>
            <li> like I read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, I was skeptical based on other reviews that say it comes out too orange, doesn&#x27;t cover veins or with too much glitter.  </li>
            <li> but it does make them much less noticable.  </li>
            <li> Shower, shave and exfoliate dead skin</li>
            <li> I almost feel like crying..</li>
            <li> ---I am as pale as people can be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle, yes, but any darker and it would be too obvious.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I had a baby shower this past weekend and wore a dress.  </li>
            <li> a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> I got this because it was the lightest color they have, and I have very pale legs.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and have tried every self tanner there is.</li>
            <li> I, too, am a very pale skin tone.  </li>
            <li> After applying this tanning spray, skin on my legs look dull and if my skin was powdered.</li>
            <li> that may seem like common sense</li>
            <li> Indoors, I noticed some subtle shimmer, but outdoors in the sunlight, it was like SHIMMER CITY.</li>
            <li> It also gives my legs a nice color, since I hate sunbathing (boring).</li>
            <li> It always made my skin a little orange and smelled terrible.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks ago, a girlfriend of mine suggest Sally Hansen&#x27;s Leg Make-Up, and it is a game changer!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever!</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> It was horrible product!</li>

            <li> I laid in sun for 10 years using baby oil, and no sunblock. As a result, I have zillions of moles, and have had over a dozen removed. For last several years I have been spray tanning and using various self tanning products. Two weeks ago, a girlfriend of mine suggest Sally Hansen&#x27;s Leg Make-Up, and it is a game changer!! It is amazing! I have never written a review before, but felt compelled to spread the word! It is so easy, and more importantly there is NO smell. It only comes off with soap and water. This means, that you can go in the pool, the ocean, the rain, and still look amazing! Please, please try this!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old and have some brown spots and light spider veins on my legs.  This product only covered them slightly, like a very sheer stocking.  I was hoping for more coverage.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs is a wonderful product for those of us who live in the south and need to go without stockings in the summer. It actually covers a permanent \\&quot;stain\\&quot; on my shin just beautifully. However, the Light Glow color is no longer for fair skin. This color has changed to a darker, more golden color that I can no longer use. (Older label stated \\&quot;Perfection\\&quot; instead of Air Brush Legs.)</li>
            <li> The color of this stuff is not human; human beings don&#x27;t turn this color. I got this because it was the lightest color they have, and I have very pale legs. The cover up part was fine -- it did a decent job of covering my leg veins, but it looked rediculous. If you&#x27;re a whitey white girl like me, and need to cover up your imperfections, pay a little more and get the Air Stocking brand -- it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> So much better than I expected! I am very, very pale and this is probably the best shade they offer for very light skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was skeptical based on other reviews that say it comes out too orange, doesn&#x27;t cover veins or with too much glitter.  There were enough positive reviews to encourage the purchase.  I had realistic expectations.  Short of several trips to the doctor, nothing will get rid of veins once they are there--but this product worked to even out skin tone.  The shimmer reflects light and spider veins are much harder to spot! It was much more subtle than some of the negative reviews led me to believe. I only put one layer of the product on after showering &amp; shaving my legs. The color took a minute to get used to---I am as pale as people can be.  However, once it dried and in the natural light it looked much better than it did in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips that may seem like common sense but I will share anyhow:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Test this out before an event so you are used to the application process and how long it takes for it to dry on your skin. *I rushed the process and would allow myself more time next application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Shower, shave and exfoliate dead skin first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you moisturize allow plenty of time for your lotion/cream/oil to absorb first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply product in the bathroom---not over carpet and have a couple of dark colored towels you don&#x27;t care about handy.  Put one towel on the floor underneath where you are spraying/applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Follow the instructions on bottle for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Have a mirror handy to ensure even coverage on backs of legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Give this product ample time to dry before getting dressed and use caution when you do. *I did get some shimmer on the inside waist band of my shorts as I was pulling them on too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy to discover that it worked for my skin tone.  This will be a \\&quot;must have on hand\\&quot; product for me during spring andsummer so I can wear shorts, dresses and skirts with more confidence.</li>
            <li> Salley Hansen Airbrush Legs Light Glow is a great product - it covers unsightly veins &amp; a rash I have.  The color is nice for summer. I wait about 2 minutes after applying it to my legs before dressing &amp; it has not rubbed off on my clothes. It is easily removed with soap and water.  I am very pleased with this product &amp; will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00192QCRI Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs Light Glow 4.4 oz. # 3703-01]]    This is a great product.  I have some scars on my legs and I do not like to wear skirts and shorts because of it.  I used this product when I went to a wedding and wore a short dress.  It was just the right amout of coverage and it looked great!  The makeup stays put and did not rub off on my husbands tux or my own dress.    It gave me a ton of confidence and I did not have to worry about my legs!  The color is also natural looking....I did not look orange or have any streaks.  My husband said that my legs looked great....what more could I want!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and have tried every self tanner there is. It always made my skin a little orange and smelled terrible.  This looks wonderful and does not have a bad smell.  I spray it directly on my legs and rub it in really good.  It will not come off with water so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting caught in the rain. It does come off easily with soap and water. I have always been self conscious wearing shorts but now I look forward to wearing them.  It will not cover up very visible veins but it does make them much less noticable.  I love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever! I have keratosis pilaris, visible green veins, and minor hyper pigmentation on my legs, so I was really hoping that this product would work. But it doesn&#x27;t. In fact, it&#x27;s terrible. It was so runny and watery and the nozzle kept coming off, I&#x27;m thinking that someone might&#x27;ve diluted it with water. Worse yet, it offered absolutely zero coverage. Indoors, I noticed some subtle shimmer, but outdoors in the sunlight, it was like SHIMMER CITY. I haven&#x27;t seen so much shimmer on a human body part in my life!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still questioning the authenticity of this...I mean, I would&#x27;ve gotten it in stores or online from an authorized retailer, but nobody had Light Glow in stock except here.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to try airbrush legs! This is hands down the most life-saving beauty product I&#x27;ve ever used. Because of my ghostly white, reddish and veiny legs, I haven&#x27;t worn shorts in YEARS. This isn&#x27;t like the self-tanners I&#x27;ve used.. it&#x27;s a very light color but that&#x27;s not the point of this product. It simply makes whatever color legs you have look almost flawless, tight, smooth and even-colored. With this stuff I don&#x27;t feel like I even need to go any darker. I never thought I&#x27;d ever be happy with my legs.. EVER.. I almost feel like crying.. HA!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing!  Where has this been all of my melanin challenged life?!  I went out and bought shorts today.  I am very well versed in self tanners and they just don&#x27;t work as well as this for legs.  My legs look so nice!  I feel so confident when I have this on.  Also, I have white sheets and this did not rub off last night at all.  My legs looked great this morning and so did my sheets!  Love it!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR WOMEN THAT DO NOT TAN OR GET ANY SUN. IT MAKES MY LEGS LOOK GREAT, I USE THE LIGHT SHADE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER AND USE THE MEDIUM LATER IN THE SUMMER. I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO WEAR PANTYHOSE OR STOCKING IN THE SUMMER IF I USE THIS. THANKS AMAZON FOR HELPING TO MARKET THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Airbrush legs light glow is a great product.  It makes your legs look very smooth and a kinda glow like you are wearing pantyhose.  It did not come off on my clothes or my sheets or anything.  I sprayed on leg smoothed it out with hand and waited till it dryed.  Will buy again and I would highly recommend to anyone who wears pantyhose but prefers not to.</li>
            <li> Great coverage.. Let it dry!only comes off with soap and h20. You can shower and not scrub legs and it stll lasts for 2 days.  Be careful when spraying it, if i gets on clothes when it is still wet , it stains.</li>
            <li> Love it. I like the color, it&#x27;s not orange like I read in other reviews. You have to follow the instructions. Don&#x27;t spray it directly in your legs. And let it dry for about 2 minutes. Just to be safe</li>
            <li> I have very white legs with spider veins AND I&#x27;m allergic to the self tanning products.  I was never able to feel comfortable showing my legs.  Then, I discovered Sally Hansen&#x27;s Airbrush Legs and have absolutely loved this product.  I now wear skirts, dresses, and capris without nylons.  It looks natural and covers well. I really can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is and how much I appreciate the person who developed it!!!  I&#x27;ve told several friends about it and they are loving it also.</li>
            <li> It was horrible product! Smell can&#x27;t even stand! Don&#x27;t waste your money! Don&#x27;t buy don&#x27;t buy don&#x27;t buy don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect thank you very much .&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks&lt;br /&gt;You are best dealer will not hesitate next time to buy from you.</li>
            <li> No streaks, no orange, nothing but perfection!  Your legs will look as though you&#x27;re 18 again.  Tip: put lotion on your legs first and then spray on the Leg Makeup and rub it in while your legs are still wet with lotion.  It makes it much easier to spread and you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job covering up but lord it makes my legs look like I came out of twilight.  This stuff is packed with glitter and do not let the sun hit it because it will seem like I covered myself with glitter all over</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! Your legs look beautiful, as if you wore the finest stockings. It&#x27;s transfer resistant and it covers any imperfection of the skin. For my pale skin, the Light Glow is perfect, but in summer I also use Medium Glow and it doesn&#x27;t look unnatural at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for two years and have always received compliments for my perfect skin. I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product makes my older legs look great!  I use the light glow and it is natural looking with just a hint of shimmer.  Don&#x27;t expect it to cover darker veins completely but it minimizes imperfections and evens out skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was up in the air when deciding if I should give this product a try or not.  I&#x27;m so glad I went for it.  I had a baby shower this past weekend and wore a dress.  I sprayed this on my legs and got lots of compliments!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product; it really does just what it states it does...gives your skin a clear, smooth, silky look as if you were wearing stockings.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants the look of wearing stockings without really doing so.</li>
            <li> It was worth a shot but the colour is awful on my very fair skin. It comes out really orange. The coverage seems pretty good if you had a darker skin tone... but then why would you need this?</li>
            <li> I have very bad spider veins in my legs &amp; this does a great job of covering them, so they&#x27;re not hardly noticeable. It also gives my legs a nice color, since I hate sunbathing (boring).</li>
            <li> I have never seen ANYone with legs this color!  No, I take that back.  I remember eons ago when someone (Coppertone?) had put out a \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; lotion that you spread onto your skin and waited for it to turn \\&quot;tan\\&quot;.  Except that you didn&#x27;t turn tan - you turned orange.  That&#x27;s what this reminds me of.  It&#x27;s horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I shook it and then sprayed it into the palm of my hand and applied it to my leg.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the color I ended up being!  And as for \\&quot;removes easily with soap, water, and a washcloth\\&quot;....yeah.  Maybe if you use something more like a Scrub &#x27;n Sponge.  Or one of those wadded up net thingies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money!  Wish I could get a refund!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  I, too, am a very pale skin tone.  I burn easily and don&#x27;t really tan.  Or rather, I used to.  Now I have to stay out of the sun completely because I&#x27;m allergic to it.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to wear pantyhose to disguise my varicose veins after all since this krap doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Just as the title says, this product covers just a little bit, evens out, and makes my ultra-white legs suitable for daytime viewing. It&#x27;s very subtle, yes, but any darker and it would be too obvious.</li>
            <li> After applying this tanning spray, skin on my legs look dull and if my skin was powdered. I don&#x27;t like the look at all. Two starts for coverage.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to order from Cosmetic Solutions. Their customer service is outstanding. Love this product.  Stays on till you use soap and water to wash it off.  Covers flaws beautifully.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to apply and dried quickly. Color was good and matched my own tan perfectly. The only reservation I have about this spray is that it has glitter in it (which I don&#x27;t remember anyone mentioning in other reviews) which I didn&#x27;t care for. I did get the non-spray tube from Walgreens and that one has no glitter in it, which I like better.</li>
