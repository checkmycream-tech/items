            <li>Murad Essential-C is a remarkable product for my combination/dry skin.</li>
            <li>so glad I did; this moisture cream is wonderful!</li>
            <li>pleasant feel/weight.  </li>
            <li>Skin tone appears bright and even.</li>
            <li>This product is great; it makes my skin feel and look amazing.</li>
            <li>The moisture is good dewy moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the rest of the Murad line is also a good value.</li>
            <li>While at Sephora I was given a sample and loved it.</li>
            <li>Somewhat greasy residue, but it smells good and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a good brand.</li>
            <li>good price for this product</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it really does a great job on my face/neck.  </li>
            <li>I love this product !</li>
            <li>My birthday starter kit lasted about a month, and the results were so incredible that I decided to purchase the full size of each item and continue to use them.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love the stuff!</li>
            <li>Got as a sample sand love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer with SPF 30, gives a rosy glow!</li>
            <li>I would stick with the Oil Matfifier 15spf for oily skin which is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>My skin drinks this stuff and it works well, smells nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice smell to it but too pricey</li>
            <li>IT HAS A NICE FINISH ON MY SKIN</li>
            <li>Smells nice and not oily.</li>
            <li>And then your skin feels just so nice to touch)</li>
            <li>This is a nice daytime moisturizer with an in-part titanium dioxide sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>so I am not olive complected which would be nice</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a moisturizer with a high SPF that was not oily and did not break me out, and this has worked great!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found to use during the day.</li>
            <li>but if I did I still think this would be a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>Love it-- works perfectly for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very light and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>It is very light, non-greasy and leaves the skin feeling tingling.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I used about a quarter teaspoon day and night, as it looked like using more would just give a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>best facial sunblock!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure you all get my point now.</li>
            <li>which is why it&#x27;s in the end ruining the reputation for the company and Amazon as well.products for no God given reason, and then shipping it in their own cheap plastic wrapper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure you all get my point now.</li>
            <li>Love it  </li>
            <li>I have been using Murad products for many years -  they are recommended by my aesthetician.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice light and refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love their primer</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t love my face being any shinier in the summer than it already has to be.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel smooth and moisturized!  </li>
            <li>so I could use my points and also get a better price.</li>
            <li>Much better prices here than retail.</li>
            <li>I love this prouduct.</li>
            <li>I love everthing about Murad Essential-C Day Moisturizer but the price.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this stuff</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is great for your skin and this really Helped my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it and the price</li>
            <li>love murad products and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love how lightweight it is:)</li>
            <li>Well, before i bought this brand i&#x27;ve seen it a lot at many spas and beauty salons.</li>
            <li>Simply the best morning and night face cream I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I love the day cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love Murad products and am pleased with this one also.</li>
            <li>if you know of a matte one, please loop me in :-)</li>
            <li>No Animal Testing, That sold me  : )</li>
            <li>I am so glad I have this product; it is very rich and i feel protected when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizer; it helps a lot with fine lines and wrinkles especially if you use the Murad Environmental Shield serum.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry skin and are out in the sun, then this is the best moisture SPF on the market.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, it covers well, and it&#x27;s got the added bonus of making my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I have an original Murad Essential-C, purchased at Sephora; and the product seems to be better.</li>
            <li>Received item as described and very quick.</li>
            <li>I love the light citrus smell (which doesn&#x27;t linger) and it makes my face feel so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy so you can easily put make-up over it.</li>
            <li>Think it&#x27;s especially effective if layered over the Murad&#x27;s &#x27;Active Radiance Serum&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes beautifully, whether it is a balmy 100 degrees or a cool 40.</li>
            <li>And while vitamin c is supposed to be a potent antioxidant (increasing collagen production, reducing skin discolorations, etc.), it didn&#x27;t do anything special for my skin or anything beyond sunscreen protection.  </li>
            <li>The discounted rate simply is not worth the sacrifice of the wonderful product that is Murad Essential-C.</li>
            <li>Will purchase the full size for sure as I originally bought the sample kit.</li>
            <li>Great overall moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s virtually weightless, and it leaves my skin feeling fantastic.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and leaves my face with a non-greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, just don&#x27;t get that into your eyes)</li>
            <li>The cream is light, not oily, and feels reach and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>Lightly scented (no chemical smell) and</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I hesitate to say it&#x27;s the absolute best, but it has SPF and antioxidants and doesn&#x27;t make me too oily, especially if I use the day serum also.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product when i got it directly from Murad and was excited to get it cheaper from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I think this is an ok moisturizer and maybe good for those with not too dry but not too oily skin.</li>
            <li>This time I received the moisturizer and it was not in it&#x27;s original sealed packaging.  </li>
            <li>When compared to the original product, the smell of vitamin C and the texture of the product just don&#x27;t add up.  </li>
            <li>Item came in original box and sealed.</li>
            <li>Plus, i didn&#x27;t see the results that I was getting from the original product from Murad.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product at the salon i go to for facials and found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing the full size product.</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly and promptly.  </li>
            <li>Distribution companies do this because they can create a larger quantity of the product by mixing it all together and selling more --&gt; more money for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect moisturizer to wear under your makeup......only need a dime size amount to moisturizer entire face; keeps my face moisturized the entire day......great product.</li>
            <li>The lotion blends into my quickly.</li>
            <li>The essential C liquid cleanser is great but the sunscreen really stings if it gets into my eyes after sweating or rubbing.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the Day Moisture because of the Broad Spectrum.  </li>
            <li>So many people have said \\&quot;you look like you are glowing!\\&quot; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>Love light citrus fragrance, very natural, not a strong perfumy scent, love that it has 30 SPF and love the smooth way it covers without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Never again will I pay the higher price!</li>
            <li>and i feel OK for the rest of the day.(I have skin type just more on the dry side</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT product, the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because for the amount you get, the price is pretty high.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this day cream, smells nice, not too heavy</li>
            <li>The only thing I like is that it absorbs into my skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed and does not leave the face greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every dime ladies.</li>
            <li>I believe that it truly is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great daily moisturizer with a soft scent.</li>
            <li>If you have ultra sensitive skin, you may not be able to tolerate the inclusion of the fragrance chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No break outs, absorbed well.</li>
            <li>Item is the original, and at a very reduced price.</li>
            <li>Received the replacement product right on time.  </li>
            <li>I love the high SPF rating for this moisturizer, which is they main reason I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and the bottle lasts me a reasonable amount of time even with daily use.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin can&#x27;t tolerate avobenzone sunscreens and most titanium dioxide based creams leave somewhat of a white cast, so I was pleased that this product is light enough that it disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>The price is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24 April 2013: I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now, and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Murad Rapid Age Spot Serum first, then afterward purchased the moisture cream -  </li>
            <li>Skin care places sell this product at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li>I love all murad products and this is one of my must-haves on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I receieved this product on time the first time I ordered it from Omni Solutions</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s a 3, not a 5, because the first time I wore it, I got it too close to my eyes</li>
            <li>Since then, I put on my eye cream first, and apply the Essential-C day moisturizer afterwards, using my orbital bones as the boundary, i.e., I don&#x27;t go inside the bones surrounding my eyes.</li>
            <li>and this is an easy way to protect skin daily.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Murad Essential-C moisturizer in my BeautyBar mystery box (large box B) in October 2014.</li>
            <li>I am not one of those women that likes to shop, so my sister was kind enough to inquire at some beauty store about the dark spots on my face (mostly scaring from picking at acne) and the fact that I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Adding this moisturizer to my routine has transformed my skin from dull and tired-looking to looking bright and  rested.</li>
            <li>really like this cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for all skin types!</li>
            <li>really like it --</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Price was much cheaper here than in the stores or salons.  </li>
            <li>The company is going to shut down in a few years because of how much time it must be wasting unsealing products for no God given reason, and then shipping it in their own cheap plastic wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in NZ with really intense sun</li>
            <li>There is a slight citrus smell to the product which is quite refreshing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, more to the point about this product specifically:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the others, this is most definitely a fake.</li>
            <li>/&gt;EVEN IF this product weren&#x27;t a \\&quot;fake\\&quot;, my main question to the world selling these products is WHO IN THE WORLD IS UNSEALING THESE LOTIONS AND CLEANSERS AND COLOGNES??</li>
            <li>The Murad site is outrageously expensive, so I was happy to find the items on Amazon for a much cheaper price.    </li>
            <li>i would say)So i would continue with the brand and this particular one as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure if I called up Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Estee Lauder, Philosophy, and all the other big name brands out there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure if I called up Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Estee Lauder, Philosophy, and all the other big name brands out there</li>
            <li>I tried the cleanser with a bit of an old zinc based sunscreen that I had stopped using because it was too oily but was gentle and did not sting my eyes.  </li>
            <li>love murad products only using a few months worth the money does wath it says</li>
            <li>Not even close to the normal consistency.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel soft and not dry, so it must be doing something right.  </li>
            <li>The product I ordered is new.  </li>
            <li>I love that its really moisturizing and I was looking for a product with an SPF of at least 30 that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I was amazed to fine that Amazon&#x27;s price was HALF of what is charged at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Iam not sure yet, I have had it 1 week, I love the Murad products, but just cannot say at this time.</li>
            <li>As well, antioxidants break down with exposure to light and this comes in a clear tube</li>
            <li>It comes in a clear container so you can tell when you are going to run out to allow for timely re-ordering.</li>
            <li>Old marks have faded, pores are smaller and I&#x27;m not breaking out as much.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily skin and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li>The Murad products are some of my favorites and the essential C are the ones I really go to - started with the serum to help sun spots</li>
            <li>I use the complete set of this line</li>
            <li>With Having sensitive skin I&#x27;m not having any issues.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and after trying many different moisturizers during my life time this is one of the few that I purchased again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now, and I can say that my skin looks healthy and firm, as well as properly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Too expensive but good product.</li>
            <li>No longer need the heavy foundation &amp; powder, just concealer, a real bonus!!!.</li>
            <li>You can smell, feel, and do what you want with the product to see if it&#x27;s real or fake, but the real indicator that it&#x27;s going to be true quality and authentic is to keep it</li>

            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure this product is really doing that much more for my skin than less expensive moisturizers, but I do like it better than any moisurtizer I&#x27;ve used in the past and will likely purchase it again when this one is gone.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended by a beauty consultant in a major department store.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it was significantly less expensive</li>
            <li>My regular Cetaphil daily moisturizer does the same and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C line to anyone with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In other words, it&#x27;s mixed and diluted with say some no name brand sunscreen/lotion, or heck even water and oil just to make it \\&quot;appear\\&quot; like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Ever since I have started using Murad products, my skin is so much brighter, less acne, and youthful.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, aging, and dry skin, and I&#x27;m in southwest Florida.  </li>
            <li>It did not have a citrus scent as is normal, and was extremely runny.</li>
            <li>only gave it three stars, however, because this product is indicated for normal to dry skin, yet I didn&#x27;t find it emollient enough for my dry skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> pleasant feel/weight.  </li>
            <li> Skin tone appears bright and even.</li>
            <li> This product is great; it makes my skin feel and look amazing.</li>
            <li> The moisture is good dewy moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the rest of the Murad line is also a good value.</li>
            <li> While at Sephora I was given a sample and loved it.</li>
            <li> Somewhat greasy residue, but it smells good and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a good brand.</li>
            <li> good price for this product</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it really does a great job on my face/neck.  </li>
            <li> I love this product !</li>
            <li> My birthday starter kit lasted about a month, and the results were so incredible that I decided to purchase the full size of each item and continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the stuff!</li>
            <li> Got as a sample sand love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer with SPF 30, gives a rosy glow!</li>
            <li> I would stick with the Oil Matfifier 15spf for oily skin which is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks this stuff and it works well, smells nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice smell to it but too pricey</li>
            <li> IT HAS A NICE FINISH ON MY SKIN</li>
            <li> Smells nice and not oily.</li>
            <li> And then your skin feels just so nice to touch)</li>
            <li> This is a nice daytime moisturizer with an in-part titanium dioxide sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> so I am not olive complected which would be nice</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a moisturizer with a high SPF that was not oily and did not break me out, and this has worked great!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found to use during the day.</li>
            <li> but if I did I still think this would be a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> Love it-- works perfectly for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very light and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> It is very light, non-greasy and leaves the skin feeling tingling.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I used about a quarter teaspoon day and night, as it looked like using more would just give a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> best facial sunblock!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you all get my point now.</li>
            <li> which is why it&#x27;s in the end ruining the reputation for the company and Amazon as well.products for no God given reason, and then shipping it in their own cheap plastic wrapper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you all get my point now.</li>
            <li> Love it  </li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for many years -  they are recommended by my aesthetician.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice light and refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love their primer</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t love my face being any shinier in the summer than it already has to be.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth and moisturized!  </li>
            <li> so I could use my points and also get a better price.</li>
            <li> Much better prices here than retail.</li>
            <li> I love this prouduct.</li>
            <li> I love everthing about Murad Essential-C Day Moisturizer but the price.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is great for your skin and this really Helped my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love it and the price</li>
            <li> love murad products and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love how lightweight it is:)</li>
            <li> Well, before i bought this brand i&#x27;ve seen it a lot at many spas and beauty salons.</li>
            <li> Simply the best morning and night face cream I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I love the day cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love Murad products and am pleased with this one also.</li>
            <li> if you know of a matte one, please loop me in :-)</li>
            <li> No Animal Testing, That sold me  : )</li>
            <li> I am so glad I have this product; it is very rich and i feel protected when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer; it helps a lot with fine lines and wrinkles especially if you use the Murad Environmental Shield serum.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin and are out in the sun, then this is the best moisture SPF on the market.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light, it covers well, and it&#x27;s got the added bonus of making my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I have an original Murad Essential-C, purchased at Sephora; and the product seems to be better.</li>
            <li> Received item as described and very quick.</li>
            <li> I love the light citrus smell (which doesn&#x27;t linger) and it makes my face feel so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy so you can easily put make-up over it.</li>
            <li> Think it&#x27;s especially effective if layered over the Murad&#x27;s &#x27;Active Radiance Serum&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes beautifully, whether it is a balmy 100 degrees or a cool 40.</li>
            <li> And while vitamin c is supposed to be a potent antioxidant (increasing collagen production, reducing skin discolorations, etc.), it didn&#x27;t do anything special for my skin or anything beyond sunscreen protection.  </li>
            <li> The discounted rate simply is not worth the sacrifice of the wonderful product that is Murad Essential-C.</li>
            <li> Will purchase the full size for sure as I originally bought the sample kit.</li>
            <li> Great overall moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s virtually weightless, and it leaves my skin feeling fantastic.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and leaves my face with a non-greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, just don&#x27;t get that into your eyes)</li>
            <li> The cream is light, not oily, and feels reach and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> Lightly scented (no chemical smell) and</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to say it&#x27;s the absolute best, but it has SPF and antioxidants and doesn&#x27;t make me too oily, especially if I use the day serum also.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product when i got it directly from Murad and was excited to get it cheaper from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I think this is an ok moisturizer and maybe good for those with not too dry but not too oily skin.</li>
            <li> This time I received the moisturizer and it was not in it&#x27;s original sealed packaging.  </li>
            <li> When compared to the original product, the smell of vitamin C and the texture of the product just don&#x27;t add up.  </li>
            <li> Item came in original box and sealed.</li>
            <li> Plus, i didn&#x27;t see the results that I was getting from the original product from Murad.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at the salon i go to for facials and found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing the full size product.</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and promptly.  </li>
            <li> Distribution companies do this because they can create a larger quantity of the product by mixing it all together and selling more --&gt; more money for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizer to wear under your makeup......only need a dime size amount to moisturizer entire face; keeps my face moisturized the entire day......great product.</li>
            <li> The lotion blends into my quickly.</li>
            <li> The essential C liquid cleanser is great but the sunscreen really stings if it gets into my eyes after sweating or rubbing.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the Day Moisture because of the Broad Spectrum.  </li>
            <li> So many people have said \\&quot;you look like you are glowing!\\&quot; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Love light citrus fragrance, very natural, not a strong perfumy scent, love that it has 30 SPF and love the smooth way it covers without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> Never again will I pay the higher price!</li>
            <li> and i feel OK for the rest of the day.(I have skin type just more on the dry side</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product, the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because for the amount you get, the price is pretty high.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this day cream, smells nice, not too heavy</li>
            <li> The only thing I like is that it absorbs into my skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed and does not leave the face greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every dime ladies.</li>
            <li> I believe that it truly is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great daily moisturizer with a soft scent.</li>
            <li> If you have ultra sensitive skin, you may not be able to tolerate the inclusion of the fragrance chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No break outs, absorbed well.</li>
            <li> Item is the original, and at a very reduced price.</li>
            <li> Received the replacement product right on time.  </li>
            <li> I love the high SPF rating for this moisturizer, which is they main reason I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and the bottle lasts me a reasonable amount of time even with daily use.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin can&#x27;t tolerate avobenzone sunscreens and most titanium dioxide based creams leave somewhat of a white cast, so I was pleased that this product is light enough that it disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> The price is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24 April 2013: I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now, and I still love it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Murad Rapid Age Spot Serum first, then afterward purchased the moisture cream -  </li>
            <li> Skin care places sell this product at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li> I love all murad products and this is one of my must-haves on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I receieved this product on time the first time I ordered it from Omni Solutions</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s a 3, not a 5, because the first time I wore it, I got it too close to my eyes</li>
            <li> Since then, I put on my eye cream first, and apply the Essential-C day moisturizer afterwards, using my orbital bones as the boundary, i.e., I don&#x27;t go inside the bones surrounding my eyes.</li>
            <li> and this is an easy way to protect skin daily.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Murad Essential-C moisturizer in my BeautyBar mystery box (large box B) in October 2014.</li>
            <li> I am not one of those women that likes to shop, so my sister was kind enough to inquire at some beauty store about the dark spots on my face (mostly scaring from picking at acne) and the fact that I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Adding this moisturizer to my routine has transformed my skin from dull and tired-looking to looking bright and  rested.</li>
            <li> really like this cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for all skin types!</li>
            <li> really like it --</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Price was much cheaper here than in the stores or salons.  </li>
            <li> The company is going to shut down in a few years because of how much time it must be wasting unsealing products for no God given reason, and then shipping it in their own cheap plastic wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in NZ with really intense sun</li>
            <li> There is a slight citrus smell to the product which is quite refreshing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, more to the point about this product specifically:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the others, this is most definitely a fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;EVEN IF this product weren&#x27;t a \\&quot;fake\\&quot;, my main question to the world selling these products is WHO IN THE WORLD IS UNSEALING THESE LOTIONS AND CLEANSERS AND COLOGNES??</li>
            <li> The Murad site is outrageously expensive, so I was happy to find the items on Amazon for a much cheaper price.    </li>
            <li> i would say)So i would continue with the brand and this particular one as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure if I called up Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Estee Lauder, Philosophy, and all the other big name brands out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure if I called up Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Estee Lauder, Philosophy, and all the other big name brands out there</li>
            <li> I tried the cleanser with a bit of an old zinc based sunscreen that I had stopped using because it was too oily but was gentle and did not sting my eyes.  </li>
            <li> love murad products only using a few months worth the money does wath it says</li>
            <li> Not even close to the normal consistency.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel soft and not dry, so it must be doing something right.  </li>
            <li> The product I ordered is new.  </li>
            <li> I love that its really moisturizing and I was looking for a product with an SPF of at least 30 that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I was amazed to fine that Amazon&#x27;s price was HALF of what is charged at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Iam not sure yet, I have had it 1 week, I love the Murad products, but just cannot say at this time.</li>
            <li> As well, antioxidants break down with exposure to light and this comes in a clear tube</li>
            <li> It comes in a clear container so you can tell when you are going to run out to allow for timely re-ordering.</li>
            <li> Old marks have faded, pores are smaller and I&#x27;m not breaking out as much.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily skin and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> The Murad products are some of my favorites and the essential C are the ones I really go to - started with the serum to help sun spots</li>
            <li> I use the complete set of this line</li>
            <li> With Having sensitive skin I&#x27;m not having any issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and after trying many different moisturizers during my life time this is one of the few that I purchased again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now, and I can say that my skin looks healthy and firm, as well as properly moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive but good product.</li>
            <li> No longer need the heavy foundation &amp; powder, just concealer, a real bonus!!!.</li>
            <li> You can smell, feel, and do what you want with the product to see if it&#x27;s real or fake, but the real indicator that it&#x27;s going to be true quality and authentic is to keep it</li>

            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure this product is really doing that much more for my skin than less expensive moisturizers, but I do like it better than any moisurtizer I&#x27;ve used in the past and will likely purchase it again when this one is gone.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a beauty consultant in a major department store.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, it was significantly less expensive</li>
            <li> My regular Cetaphil daily moisturizer does the same and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C line to anyone with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In other words, it&#x27;s mixed and diluted with say some no name brand sunscreen/lotion, or heck even water and oil just to make it \\&quot;appear\\&quot; like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Ever since I have started using Murad products, my skin is so much brighter, less acne, and youthful.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, aging, and dry skin, and I&#x27;m in southwest Florida.  </li>
            <li> It did not have a citrus scent as is normal, and was extremely runny.</li>
            <li> only gave it three stars, however, because this product is indicated for normal to dry skin, yet I didn&#x27;t find it emollient enough for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed a couple of new dark spots.</li>
            <li> Not heavy and probably due to the vitamin c serum in it.</li>
            <li> so some intermediary is unsealing the products and clearly fiddling with it which ruins the end game: a quality product which is promised from the original companies--&gt;</li>

            <li> You really just need a small amount of lotion to spread over your face and neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that when such a renowned company like Murad (or any other high-grade cosmetic/beauty brand for that matter) has a great and loyal fan base and a large amount of users, and when one receives a fake or \\&quot;mixed/diluted\\&quot; product from some other local distribution company, that the true brand and reputation of the real company (i.e. Murad) is hindered.</li>
            <li> In less than a week, I noticed a lot of my spots were fading and that some were completely *gone</li>
            <li> Although I am half Italian, I seem to have a mix of skin from my mother&#x27;s side *(Northern European) and my father&#x27;s (Southern Italian)</li>
            <li> Now someone please tell me why, if my lotion should come from a distributing company which buys its products directly from Murad and other brands (and the products are all sealed!!)</li>
            <li> Have used it a long time.  </li>
            <li> Have used it a long time.</li>
            <li> My order came earlier then expected and was as the picture showed.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician told me the vitamin C promotes cell turnover, which gets rid of older, dull cells faster, giving your skin a healthier appearance.  </li>
            <li> and I have an oily t-zone but otherwise dry face and found that it wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it might be an irregular or knock-off, but it turned out to be the real deal, and at a price so much cheaper than at the Spa.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to using other skincare products!</li>
            <li> It left my skin oily and a got a small red rash after using it.</li>
            <li> This was my second buy, it didn&#x27;t seem the same as the moisturizer I&#x27;ve had in the past, I do wonder what the defect is because of this.</li>
            <li> So much so that I usually just wash my face with plain water as the majority of cleansers irritate and/or burn my skin.    </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get used to using the correct amount of product--you only need about a pea-sized amount for your face AND neck after toning.  </li>
            <li> But never really tried it before.</li>
            <li> so I had to be careful to keep it away from sunlight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough to help with my dry winter skin but not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, it does have a sunscreeny smell but unlike usual sunscreen, when I apply it to my very deep skin tone, it doesn&#x27;t create this &#x27;purple&#x27; tinted look.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and you only have to use a small amount</li>
            <li> The product I purchased on Amazon, I believe has been diluted with some other type of cream.  </li>
            <li> I will NEVER purchase this product or any other from this site.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a step up from the usual drugstore products.</li>
            <li> - I have residual pigmentation changes after my pregnancy and this has cleared a lot of it up including sun spots and other pigment issues in other places.  </li>
            <li> Other moisturizers tend to leave my oily areas even oilier and do little to relieve dryness in the dry areas.  </li>
            <li> I love murad products but this is the worst by far.</li>
            <li> It smelled and looked like watered down sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The company is clearly playing some fishy business and mixing products and creating artificial low quality products..</li>
            <li> I checked Amazon and found it for nearly half the department store price.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight fragrance, but I found it to be quite pleasing and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to really get annoyed of the amount of fake beauty/hygienic products I&#x27;ve been receiving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for little over a month</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well but leaves skin a little greasy.</li>
            <li> But the lotion i ordered was a little runny and took longer to blend in.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup my skin gets a little greasy after a few hours, but I do still like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Even though my wallet sighs heavily when I do say that.  </li>
            <li> After a few months of use, this moisturizer has grown on me.  </li>
            <li> Purchased through &amp;#34;sharp global trade&amp;#34; and got a fake.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this in the past with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I believe the product I got in the second sealed box was fake and that is why the color, smell and my face broke out.  </li>
            <li> When we mean fake, we mean it&#x27;s not the same quality of the \\&quot;real\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li> and it made my eyes sting and water really badly until I completely removed it.</li>
            <li> but I do get pigmentation changes like is common with some mediterranean women.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fake&#x27;s packaging did not come in a box (not the hugest deal), and the printed words on it seemed a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; or blurry.</li>
            <li> (I have always used this product) and my face starting breaking out so bad</li>
            <li> Product seal was broken and there was no seal on the tube.</li>
            <li> No good!  </li>
            <li> I wonder if I got a fake?</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not alone, I read thousands of fake product</li>
            <li> Once I opened the product I could tell that it was fake.</li>
            <li> There is a distinctive citrus smell with this lotion and although there was a faint smell of citrus</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was sold a fake bottle of moisturizer and received an expensive lesson not to trust some of the dealers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it was the wrong product in the sealed box.  </li>
            <li> were wrong.  </li>
            <li> He then asked if I was wearing makeup, which I never wear as it irritates my skin really bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the high SPF rating for this moisturizer, which is they main reason I purchased this.  My skin does feel soft and not dry, so it must be doing something right.  The only thing I don;t like is my eyes water, and sometimes the moisturizer will get in my eyes and burn.  It comes in a clear container so you can tell when you are going to run out to allow for timely re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Love it. My skin drinks this stuff and it works well, smells nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. The moisture is good dewy moisture. Loooove it!!</li>
            <li> Great price. Product came with factory seal.</li>
            <li> Great day moisturizer with spy!</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell but other than that I like it. I have combination-to-oily skin, occasional hormonal breakouts. If I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup my skin gets a little greasy after a few hours, but I do still like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for little over a month and I don&#x27;t see any noticeable results. The Vitamin C that is supposed to make skin brighter has not done that for my skin. I&#x27;ve even noticed a couple of new dark spots. I wonder if I got a fake? The only thing I like is that it absorbs into my skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy. Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> love murad products only using a few months worth the money does wath it says</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Murad Essential-C moisturizer in my BeautyBar mystery box (large box B) in October 2014. The sample was 0.33oz and enough for me to use the product for 2 weeks. I used about a quarter teaspoon day and night, as it looked like using more would just give a greasy feeling. I applied to both my face and neck and did not break out over the two weeks. As others have stated, it does have a sunscreeny smell but unlike usual sunscreen, when I apply it to my very deep skin tone, it doesn&#x27;t create this &#x27;purple&#x27; tinted look. I think this is an ok moisturizer and maybe good for those with not too dry but not too oily skin. I used it during the winter and I have an oily t-zone but otherwise dry face and found that it wasn&#x27;t greasy. For the price, I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing the full size product. My regular Cetaphil daily moisturizer does the same and is much cheaper. I am in my mid 20s.</li>
            <li> best facial sunblock!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found to use during the day. My skin stays moist and glows.  I do like that this contains vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and promptly.  I will order again  from this seller.  The product I ordered is new.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I USE IT EVERY DAY. IT WORKS WONDERS ON YOUR SKIN!</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it might be an irregular or knock-off, but it turned out to be the real deal, and at a price so much cheaper than at the Spa.  I&#x27;m hoping the rest of the Murad line is also a good value.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin type is different and this product just didn&#x27;t work for me. It left my skin oily and a got a small red rash after using it.</li>
            <li> I love murad products but this is the worst by far. I would stick with the Oil Matfifier 15spf for oily skin which is an amazing product. I tried this product and returned it the next day. I was also sweating outside and one or two got into my eyes and it felt just like suntan lotion. Horrible. I will say though that the vitamin c cleanser and serum are very good products which are suppose to reduce sun damamge. We all need that. Just stay away from the Murad Essential C-Day Moisture SPF 30.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that when such a renowned company like Murad (or any other high-grade cosmetic/beauty brand for that matter) has a great and loyal fan base and a large amount of users, and when one receives a fake or \\&quot;mixed/diluted\\&quot; product from some other local distribution company, that the true brand and reputation of the real company (i.e. Murad) is hindered. Not to mention Amazon as well. I&#x27;m starting to really get annoyed of the amount of fake beauty/hygienic products I&#x27;ve been receiving. And I&#x27;m not alone, I read thousands of fake product reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, more to the point about this product specifically:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the others, this is most definitely a fake. When we mean fake, we mean it&#x27;s not the same quality of the \\&quot;real\\&quot; version. In other words, it&#x27;s mixed and diluted with say some no name brand sunscreen/lotion, or heck even water and oil just to make it \\&quot;appear\\&quot; like the real thing. Distribution companies do this because they can create a larger quantity of the product by mixing it all together and selling more --&gt; more money for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVEN IF this product weren&#x27;t a \\&quot;fake\\&quot;, my main question to the world selling these products is WHO IN THE WORLD IS UNSEALING THESE LOTIONS AND CLEANSERS AND COLOGNES?? I did call Murad&#x27;s headquarters and they thoroughly told me that EACH AND EVERY individual Murad product in manufacturing is sealed (and yes its boxed, but we&#x27;re talking about sealing the spout/tip from which the lotion/etc. comes out). Now someone please tell me why, if my lotion should come from a distributing company which buys its products directly from Murad and other brands (and the products are all sealed!!), why is my product unsealed?? It should NOT be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, either 1. The company is clearly playing some fishy business and mixing products and creating artificial low quality products..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or 2. The company is going to shut down in a few years because of how much time it must be wasting unsealing products for no God given reason, and then shipping it in their own cheap plastic wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you all get my point now. You can smell, feel, and do what you want with the product to see if it&#x27;s real or fake, but the real indicator that it&#x27;s going to be true quality and authentic is to keep it sealed!&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m pretty sure if I called up Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Estee Lauder, Philosophy, and all the other big name brands out there, I promise you they will say no beauty product leaves unsealed.. so some intermediary is unsealing the products and clearly fiddling with it which ruins the end game: a quality product which is promised from the original companies--&gt; which is why it&#x27;s in the end ruining the reputation for the company and Amazon as well.products for no God given reason, and then shipping it in their own cheap plastic wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you all get my point now.

            <li> I love this product !</li>
            <li> Have used it a long time.  Love it  Have used it a long time.</li>
            <li> This was my second buy, it didn&#x27;t seem the same as the moisturizer I&#x27;ve had in the past, I do wonder what the defect is because of this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for many years -  they are recommended by my aesthetician.  I was amazed to fine that Amazon&#x27;s price was HALF of what is charged at the salon.  It looks and feels the same so I assume it IS the same.  Never again will I pay the higher price!</li>
            <li> Iam not sure yet, I have had it 1 week, I love the Murad products, but just cannot say at this time.</li>
            <li> Purchased through &amp;#34;sharp global trade&amp;#34; and got a fake. I have owned several tubes of this product, and consider it to be a 4/5 stars product or better.&lt;br /&gt;The fake&#x27;s packaging did not come in a box (not the hugest deal), and the printed words on it seemed a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; or blurry. Once I opened the product I could tell that it was fake. It did not have a citrus scent as is normal, and was extremely runny. Not even close to the normal consistency. It smelled and looked like watered down sunscreen. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product seal was broken and there was no seal on the tube. I had read reviews that this had happened to others, but I decided to take my chances. No good!  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this in the past with no problems.  This time I received the moisturizer and it was not in it&#x27;s original sealed packaging.  I compared it to the Murad I had at home and it wasn&#x27;t the same.  There is a distinctive citrus smell with this lotion and although there was a faint smell of citrus it was not the same as what I already have.  I have been using this product for years and the one from amazon was bogus.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I have this product; it is very rich and i feel protected when I wear it. It is quickly absorbed and does not leave the face greasy.</li>
            <li> I really liked the Day Moisture because of the Broad Spectrum.  It is not sticky and you only have to use a small amount</li>
            <li> One of the best moisturizers with sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.  Does not leave face greasy.  Has a nice light and refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Ever since I have started using Murad products, my skin is so much brighter, less acne, and youthful.</li>
            <li> It was a very good product.</li>
            <li> I am not one of those women that likes to shop, so my sister was kind enough to inquire at some beauty store about the dark spots on my face (mostly scaring from picking at acne) and the fact that I have extremely sensitive skin. So much so that I usually just wash my face with plain water as the majority of cleansers irritate and/or burn my skin.    The store recommended the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C line. My sister gave me the starter kit for my birthday.    I was skeptical, but figured I would give it a try. None of the products burned or irritated my skin in the following days, so I kept using the products. In less than a week, I noticed a lot of my spots were fading and that some were completely *gone*!    My husband actually noticed and said that I looked like I was glowing -- his word, not mine. He then asked if I was wearing makeup, which I never wear as it irritates my skin really bad. When I told him that I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup, he actually came closer to inspect my face. He said my skin looked beautiful.    My birthday starter kit lasted about a month, and the results were so incredible that I decided to purchase the full size of each item and continue to use them. The Murad site is outrageously expensive, so I was happy to find the items on Amazon for a much cheaper price.    I would definitely recommend the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C line to anyone with extremely sensitive skin. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love it! great product</li>
            <li> Love their primer so gave this a shot bc it contains vitamin c and sunscreen. Moisturizes well but leaves skin a little greasy. Not heavy and probably due to the vitamin c serum in it. Just don&#x27;t love my face being any shinier in the summer than it already has to be.</li>
            <li> Murad Essential-C is a remarkable product for my combination/dry skin. It moisturizes beautifully, whether it is a balmy 100 degrees or a cool 40. Skin tone appears bright and even. So many people have said \\&quot;you look like you are glowing!\\&quot; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Item is the original, and at a very reduced price.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  Makes my face feel smooth and moisturized!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with day moisture</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff!  I do not have sensitive skin but if I did I still think this would be a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> really like this cream.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but good product.</li>
            <li> Received item as described and very quick. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice smell to it but too pricey</li>
            <li> While at Sephora I was given a sample and loved it. I decided to order on line so I could use my points and also get a better price. I love the light citrus smell (which doesn&#x27;t linger) and it makes my face feel so silky smooth. It&#x27;s worth every dime ladies.</li>
            <li> I have an original Murad Essential-C, purchased at Sephora; and the product seems to be better. The product I purchased on Amazon, I believe has been diluted with some other type of cream.  When compared to the original product, the smell of vitamin C and the texture of the product just don&#x27;t add up.  I will NEVER purchase this product or any other from this site.  The discounted rate simply is not worth the sacrifice of the wonderful product that is Murad Essential-C.</li>
            <li> Somewhat greasy residue, but it smells good and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> Great overall moisturizer.  Much better prices here than retail.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer; it helps a lot with fine lines and wrinkles especially if you use the Murad Environmental Shield serum.  I also like that it has SPF 30 so I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting extra sunscreen on.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It isn&#x27;t greasy so you can easily put make-up over it. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent! My order came earlier then expected and was as the picture showed. Most importantly, it was significantly less expensive then I can get in the local stores. And, I save on having to drive. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product from Amazon and will definitely do it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Item came in original box and sealed.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Face feels great..</li>
            <li> This has been the best face lotion I have used to date! I have tried everything! Highly recommended for all skin types!</li>
            <li> A bit oily for my skin; however I do like the sun protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while.  It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Adding this moisturizer to my routine has transformed my skin from dull and tired-looking to looking bright and  rested. I love this prouduct.</li>
            <li> I love everthing about Murad Essential-C Day Moisturizer but the price.  It has a very pleasant, orange fragrance (what else should vitamin C smell like?), it&#x27;s virtually weightless, and it leaves my skin feeling fantastic. I was introduced to it when I was going through microdermabrasion.  My aesthetician told me the vitamin C promotes cell turnover, which gets rid of older, dull cells faster, giving your skin a healthier appearance.  To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure this product is really doing that much more for my skin than less expensive moisturizers, but I do like it better than any moisurtizer I&#x27;ve used in the past and will likely purchase it again when this one is gone.  Even though my wallet sighs heavily when I do say that.  The price is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24 April 2013: I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now, and I still love it.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. I believe that it truly is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. It helps maintain her skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Murad Rapid Age Spot Serum first, then afterward purchased the moisture cream -  so glad I did; this moisture cream is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Thank you - (--..--)</li>
            <li> I loved this product when i got it directly from Murad and was excited to get it cheaper from Amazon.  But the lotion i ordered was a little runny and took longer to blend in. Plus, i didn&#x27;t see the results that I was getting from the original product from Murad.  So, i ordered another bottle from Murad and the difference is very obvious.  I was sold a fake bottle of moisturizer and received an expensive lesson not to trust some of the dealers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great price and great product</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product, the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because for the amount you get, the price is pretty high.  Love light citrus fragrance, very natural, not a strong perfumy scent, love that it has 30 SPF and love the smooth way it covers without being greasy.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizer to wear under your makeup......only need a dime size amount to moisturizer entire face; keeps my face moisturized the entire day......great product.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A NICE FINISH ON MY SKIN AND I FEEL PROTECTED FROM THE SUN. I DO NOT HAVE ANYMORE WORDS.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and great product ! Skin care places sell this product at a much higher cost. Amazing how Amazon always has the best price.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin and are out in the sun, then this is the best moisture SPF on the market.</li>
            <li> Great moisture makes me feel beautiful and refreshed</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t return it.  I thought it was the eye C Day product.  I bought it in the middle of winter so I don&#x27;t know how well it will work during the summer.</li>
            <li> Works well with my Murad line of facial regimen.  I originally purchased this product at the salon i go to for facials and found it on Amazon. Good deal!</li>
            <li> Great product! Cheaper price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40+ with (still) acne prone skin, and have been looking for a daily moisturizer with a sunscreen included (layering products makes me break out). I&#x27;ve gone through a sample of this and really like it -- it&#x27;s light, it covers well, and it&#x27;s got the added bonus of making my skin look better. Old marks have faded, pores are smaller and I&#x27;m not breaking out as much. It has a light scent but it&#x27;s not smelly. Definitely a step up from the usual drugstore products.</li>
            <li> Great product. Vitamin C is great for your skin and this really Helped my skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is my winter time moisturizer, it&#x27;s super moisturizing for dry skin and helps hydrate against the wind and harsh dry air. Would definitely recommend and will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great for age spots.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a moisturizer with a high SPF that was not oily and did not break me out, and this has worked great! I have sensitive, oily skin and have not had any problems. It also works well under makeup. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it and the price</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, I have to keep her in supply of it at all times</li>
            <li> love murad products and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  thanks</li>
            <li> Great daily moisturizer with a soft scent. The lotion blends into my quickly.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Murad Essential C she I get facials. I started using it at home and see a difference in the brightness of my complexion. Love the stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and after trying many different moisturizers during my life time this is one of the few that I purchased again.  Very happy with the way it moisturizes my face.  It&#x27;s light and leaves my face with a non-greasy feeling.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It&#x27;s thick enough to help with my dry winter skin but not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this. Smells nice and not oily. I wear it under makeup. Seen the difference in my skin within a week of using it.</li>
            <li> Got as a sample sand love it! Very light and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a beauty consultant in a major department store.  The cost (for me) was prohibitive. I checked Amazon and found it for nearly half the department store price.  I really like this product. It is very light, non-greasy and leaves the skin feeling tingling.  There is a slight citrus smell to the product which is quite refreshing.  Other moisturizers tend to leave my oily areas even oilier and do little to relieve dryness in the dry areas.  This one seems to balance everything.  I highly recommend it.  Hope I can find it in the future on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really excellent  moisturizer with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a helpful product for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great!  And it works well too.  I live in NZ with really intense sun and this is an easy way to protect skin daily.  Highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Love how lightweight it is:)</li>
            <li> I love all murad products and this is one of my must-haves on a daily basis.  Price was much cheaper here than in the stores or salons.  Shipped on time.</li>
            <li> Well, before i bought this brand i&#x27;ve seen it a lot at many spas and beauty salons. I know it&#x27;s a good brand. But never really tried it before. I like it a lot. It&#x27;s light, just don&#x27;t get that into your eyes) You really just need a small amount of lotion to spread over your face and neck. And then your skin feels just so nice to touch) I apply it in the morning and i feel OK for the rest of the day.(I have skin type just more on the dry side i would say)So i would continue with the brand and this particular one as well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice daytime moisturizer with an in-part titanium dioxide sunscreen.  My sensitive skin can&#x27;t tolerate avobenzone sunscreens and most titanium dioxide based creams leave somewhat of a white cast, so I was pleased that this product is light enough that it disappears quickly.  It does have a slight fragrance, but I found it to be quite pleasing and non-irritating.  If you have ultra sensitive skin, you may not be able to tolerate the inclusion of the fragrance chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it three stars, however, because this product is indicated for normal to dry skin, yet I didn&#x27;t find it emollient enough for my dry skin.  And while vitamin c is supposed to be a potent antioxidant (increasing collagen production, reducing skin discolorations, etc.), it didn&#x27;t do anything special for my skin or anything beyond sunscreen protection.  As well, antioxidants break down with exposure to light and this comes in a clear tube so I had to be careful to keep it away from sunlight.</li>
            <li> I do like it but it is not as moist as it used to be.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I was introduced to it by the facialist at my local Massage Envy.  I have sensitive, aging, and dry skin, and I&#x27;m in southwest Florida.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now, and I can say that my skin looks healthy and firm, as well as properly moisturized.  It takes a little while to get used to using the correct amount of product--you only need about a pea-sized amount for your face AND neck after toning.  You grow accustomed to feeling &amp;#34;ungreasy&amp;#34; (I guess that&#x27;s the best way to put it). Also,  I don&#x27;t have all the blackheads I used to have with heavier moisturizers, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Simply the best morning and night face cream I&#x27;ve used.  The cream is light, not oily, and feels reach and luxurious.  Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin looks great!</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> Great face cream with SPF. I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> The Murad products are some of my favorites and the essential C are the ones I really go to - started with the serum to help sun spots - I have residual pigmentation changes after my pregnancy and this has cleared a lot of it up including sun spots and other pigment issues in other places.  Although I am half Italian, I seem to have a mix of skin from my mother&#x27;s side *(Northern European) and my father&#x27;s (Southern Italian) so I am not olive complected which would be nice but I do get pigmentation changes like is common with some mediterranean women. I use the complete set of this line and I think it helps.  The prices are also best through Amazon or so I have found.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a little over a week.  So far so good. With Having sensitive skin I&#x27;m not having any issues.  I love that its really moisturizing and I was looking for a product with an SPF of at least 30 that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> This product is great; it makes my skin feel and look amazing. It cleared up troubled spots and I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since using it. I will never go back to using other skincare products!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! And so happy to find it at a lower price than buying it in the salon.</li>
            <li> good price for this product</li>
            <li> I love the day cream.  It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the trial size &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34;.  The essential C liquid cleanser is great but the sunscreen really stings if it gets into my eyes after sweating or rubbing.  I tried the cleanser with a bit of an old zinc based sunscreen that I had stopped using because it was too oily but was gentle and did not sting my eyes.  My conclusion is that it was the murad sunscreen stinging my eyes.  Will repurchase cleanser but will stick to zinc based sunscreens.  Worked great except for the eye irritation.  No break outs, absorbed well.</li>
            <li> I receieved this product on time the first time I ordered it from Omni Solutions but it had come in a Murad box sealed when I took the product out of the box it was the wrong product in the sealed box.  I returned it no problem.  Received the replacement product right on time.  The problem was that I used it for 1 week (I have always used this product) and my face starting breaking out so bad I took the moisturizer to a Murad local salon and come to find out the smell and color of the product were wrong.  I believe the product I got in the second sealed box was fake and that is why the color, smell and my face broke out.  I purchased the same product from the retailer the same day and my face all of a sudden cleared up.  I will never again order from Omni Solutions.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer.  Lightly scented (no chemical smell) and pleasant feel/weight.  Best of all, it really does a great job on my face/neck.  I love Murad products and am pleased with this one also.</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. For me, it&#x27;s a 3, not a 5, because the first time I wore it, I got it too close to my eyes and it made my eyes sting and water really badly until I completely removed it. N.B. I didn&#x27;t get it IN my eyes; the &amp;#34;fumes&amp;#34; from the cream (probably the ascorbic acid) got in my eyes. Since then, I put on my eye cream first, and apply the Essential-C day moisturizer afterwards, using my orbital bones as the boundary, i.e., I don&#x27;t go inside the bones surrounding my eyes. I&#x27;ve not had a problem since.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer with SPF 30, gives a rosy glow! Think it&#x27;s especially effective if layered over the Murad&#x27;s &#x27;Active Radiance Serum&#x27;.  No longer need the heavy foundation &amp; powder, just concealer, a real bonus!!!. Will purchase the full size for sure as I originally bought the sample kit.</li>
            <li> Would not use anything else!</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, this moisturizer has grown on me.  It smells nice and the bottle lasts me a reasonable amount of time even with daily use.  I hesitate to say it&#x27;s the absolute best, but it has SPF and antioxidants and doesn&#x27;t make me too oily, especially if I use the day serum also.  Definitely not matte, though.  If I didn&#x27;t follow with foundation, I&#x27;d be super-shiny all day.  I suspect this is just a product of any SPF moisturizer.  if you know of a matte one, please loop me in :-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this day cream, smells nice, not too heavy and.....No Animal Testing, That sold me  : )</li>
            <li> Love it-- works perfectly for my very sensitive skin. And what a great deal!  It&#x27;s $60 at Sephora.</li>
