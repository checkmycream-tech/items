            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the hydration this conditioner delivered!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how amazing this conditioner is.</li>
            <li>Ugh, why is this stuff filled with junk lol</li>
            <li>but I always save it for the days I want my hair to look nice.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love it, and I have ordered it twice now.</li>
            <li>It really strengthens your hair, prevents a lot of breakage, and smells great.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every salon product out there, and I absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely helps me keep my hair at its best.</li>
            <li>I wish this stuff wasn&#x27;t filled with chemicals but it makes my hair look so nice it got added to my 10%... that being non-&amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; things I had to have, including my Amore Pacific time response moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I bought some for my oldest Grand Daughter too.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft after use, great scent.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good price.</li>
            <li>I love the way it&#x27;s dispensed too - unique</li>
            <li>But, just not as easily.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so easy to style too.  </li>
            <li>The stylist at the salon raved about this, making it sound like a miracle treatment.</li>
            <li>I happened to use this first and loved the results so much that I have postponed the treatment.</li>
            <li>and I used Keratin Complex products to keep my hair looking its best.  </li>
            <li>And it DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE IT GREASY, which is amazing because a lot of \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; shampoos/conditioners tend to do that, leaving my hair oily by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every dime.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; empty, but, you sure can&#x27;t get any more out of it.  </li>
            <li>If I continue struggling with it, however, and not feeling like I don&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth, well, I might move on.</li>
            <li>So to me it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not any more effective than other salon products at smoothing my wild, wiry gray hairs, which I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is so good on my shitzus long hair, it makes it so soft!</li>
            <li>I have thick, frizzy, wavy-ish hair and it works great for keeping it SOFT &amp; SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>This is awesome for those that have grown tired of rotating conditioners and those preserving Keratin treatments as well!</li>
            <li>It is so funny</li>
            <li>I used to have to comb my hair carefully after a shower because of the knots to avoid breakage, but with this conditioner I can easily run my comb through my hair with one quick swipe.</li>
            <li>so you pay attention and don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>Extra conditioner will collect on the inside and spread evenly to make sure it gets everywhere without having to waste a couple more globs of this pricey conditioner.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants a spa like treat for their hair.</li>
            <li>It really does protect your hair and prevent the need for as many haircuts as well like some other reviewer had said.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to tone with naturally curly hair!!</li>
            <li>Hair is smooth and shiny with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>Then when you suddenly discover you can no longer get any from the can, you realize that you have not had this for very long, and you haven&#x27;t had many uses of it.</li>
            <li>i run out of frequentlly because I use too much of it, because there is no other feeling than the way my hair feels after rinsing this conditioner off...</li>
            <li>I also purchased the complete line of Coppola&#x27;s Keratin treatment to straighten my naturally curly, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, without being too soft, and it&#x27;s shiny without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Calms and reduces frizz for my natural curly/coily hair.</li>
            <li>(too heavy for fine hair especially)</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth every dime. I have dry, damaged hair from highlights and blow drying and this conditioner moisturizes my hair like none other - highly recommend it over any other conditioner.</li>

            <li> I love this product.  I use it weekly to deep condition my hair.</li>

            <li> Leaves my hair very soft after use, great scent.</li>
            <li> I have just received my second purchase of this product. I love it. My only complaint would be that for the price, you don&#x27;t get as much as you should. It&#x27;s hard to use, or let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s awkward. Then when you suddenly discover you can no longer get any from the can, you realize that you have not had this for very long, and you haven&#x27;t had many uses of it. Disappointing! ;(  Also, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; empty, but, you sure can&#x27;t get any more out of it.  It comes out like Ready Whip Cream, know what I mean? But, just not as easily. I think the makers of this product needed another way to offer it to us. Anyway, I love it, and I have ordered it twice now. If I continue struggling with it, however, and not feeling like I don&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth, well, I might move on. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how amazing this conditioner is. I have thick, frizzy, wavy-ish hair and it works great for keeping it SOFT &amp; SMOOTH. Since I started using this, I went from 4 haircuts a year to only needing one for a trim. It really strengthens your hair, prevents a lot of breakage, and smells great. I got hooked on Aussie \\&quot;3-minute Miracle\\&quot; Conditioner, but the KeraWhip blows that one out of the water. I used to have to comb my hair carefully after a shower because of the knots to avoid breakage, but with this conditioner I can easily run my comb through my hair with one quick swipe. And it DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE IT GREASY, which is amazing because a lot of \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; shampoos/conditioners tend to do that, leaving my hair oily by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I typically use a bottle a month because I have longer, thicker hair. So what I&#x27;ve been doing is putting a small amount on my hand and throwing it on my hair in the shower, then taking a brush (that looks something like this: [...] and combing your hair.

            <li> BEST HAIR CONDITIONER EVER MADE!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  I had a Keratin Complex treatment at the salon and I used Keratin Complex products to keep my hair looking its best.  I&#x27;ve used every salon product out there, and I absolutely love this.  Replenishes the keratin in your hair.  Hair is smooth and shiny with minimal effort.  I have very thick, course hair, but no more due to my salon keratin treatment.  This product definitely helps me keep my hair at its best.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever....my hair feels like silk when I use this product....I flat iron 2-3 times a week and this makes me hair feel slippery 😁 especially when used with the Keratin Complex RX treatment (little black pump)...might be a little hard to get lift after using this conditioner as it is very moisturizing..</li>
            <li> I love this product! When I use it, I can feel the immediate difference in my hair. It&#x27;s soft, without being too soft, and it&#x27;s shiny without looking greasy. It&#x27;s the drink of water that my dry hair needs!!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair really soft and shiny. Great conditioner.  Smells good and is easy to use.  Long lasting. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product! Fast delivery, good price.</li>
            <li> Conditioner was excellent. Calms and reduces frizz for my natural curly/coily hair. Would recommend this to anyone who wants a spa like treat for their hair.</li>

            <li> I love this product! It controls my curly hair and helps define the curls.  I highly recommend it to tone with naturally curly hair!!</li>
            <li> Best product for helping your hair look healthy and shiny. Puts back nutrients that we lose in our hair. My hairdresser recommended this. Amazon had the best price. I bought some for my oldest Grand Daughter too.</li>
