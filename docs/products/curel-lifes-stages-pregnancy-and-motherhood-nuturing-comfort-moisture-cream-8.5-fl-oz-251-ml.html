            <li>My skin felt more elastic and I did not get one stretch mark!</li>
            <li>It says on the tube that it&#x27;s even safe to use on the baby!  </li>
            <li>I bought this after reading reviews that it was non-greasy and had a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it smells nice and</li>
            <li>This lotion has a nice smell</li>
            <li>and i knew i liked it.</li>
            <li>This lotion has an amazing scent &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>After my first application I knew it was a great product.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice and smooth after applying this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I made sure she was well-stocked during that time.</li>
            <li>I opened a sample of this product and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased, and I do not feel at all that this is a greasy product.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>The Walmart by my house doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore, so I bought 5 more bottles from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but as soon as I started rubbing this product on my butt as well, they got lighter &amp; I haven&#x27;t gotten any more.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this lotion many times because of how it feels- it leaves my skin with that water-resistant, waxed-car feel</li>
            <li>I am impressed with this product it makes my skin feel super soft.</li>
            <li>I used this lotion for my first child and loved it.</li>
            <li>and i can rub it easily</li>
            <li>and I quickly fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Another bonus is I don&#x27;t have itchy skin like so many pregnant women complain about.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricy, but she says it&#x27;s the best lotion ever and seems to lock in moisture longer than others.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any streachmarks even I was huge.</li>
            <li>and they got so huge that I don&#x27;t even know if the lotion would have helped me then.</li>
            <li>I wish this was still available through Curel.</li>
            <li>Who knows for sure if it prevented stretch marks, but I&#x27;m positive that it didn&#x27;t hurt either!  </li>
            <li>I thought the price was kind of high...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell original</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really rich, but not greasy</li>
            <li>This is going to be one of those products where to see the full result</li>
            <li>We have a few more weeks to go but so far so wonderful.</li>
            <li>so I feel good about using it during pregnancy, especially.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my pregnant daughter who went through one tube and requested another.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 23 weeks pregnant, I ordered Curel because i had used a sample before</li>
            <li>Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch oil for my breasts, so far so good and no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>but the lotions all three have helped w my skin issues and again no stretch marks so far...:)</li>
            <li>It is sometimes overpriced by the sellers but its worth a try.</li>
            <li>and it gets absorbed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>So I initially bought the mama mio tummy rub stretch mark oil due to awesome reviews.  </li>
            <li>I used this product when pregnant with my first baby.</li>
            <li>I received a tube of this as a gift when I first found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather have something rich and creamy-</li>
            <li>I mainly use this lotion for my arms and legs because it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li>My wife has very dry skin, and she has found that this is the best lotion for helping her through dry winter months.</li>
            <li>leaving skin soft, smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>and this was gentle on both!</li>
            <li>First, I used Palmers belly butter.  </li>
            <li>I used this throughout my first pregnancy...</li>
            <li>I also thought Palmers smelled funny.</li>
            <li>I used this all through my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I used this lotion with my first pregnancy, I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot stand strong smells especially floral scented ones.  </li>
            <li>It was hard to find this lotion in stores, so I ended up having to get it online, but was still at a good price.</li>
            <li>Now prego with my second and was very dissappointed that it wasn&#x27;t available in the store.</li>
            <li>Within one use my belly felt so much relief</li>
            <li>This really does work to keep skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasing -</li>
            <li>I am 29 weeks &amp; already need to order another 8.5 oz container which has lasted for about a month (I use it for my whole body now, not just my belly).</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>She really appreciated this product.</li>
            <li>It really helps she said and also I really really like the scent.</li>
            <li>It is really silky and it rubs in well.</li>
            <li>But on the flip side of that coin, it keeps me really well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice that it did much.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting them just as much, maybe not</li>
            <li>It happened so fast</li>
            <li>Its better than ANY other cream out there</li>
            <li>I had very very itchy dry skin while pregnant and this worked very well.</li>
            <li>However, I do live in a dry Colorado climate, so it might be better if you live somewhere humid.</li>
            <li>I am currently 29 weeks pregnant and have been using this product since I found out.  </li>
            <li>We bought a bottle when she was pregnant three years ago, and she&#x27;s been using it regularly since then.</li>
            <li>I am now pregnant with #2 and the only place I can buy it is online, I will be stocking up.</li>
            <li>I used to use Palmers when I first got pregnant, but I never really felt like it truly moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am 5 months pregnant and my belly was so dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to greasy lotions</li>
            <li>I actually found this at first on clearance at Walmart.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive nose</li>
            <li>That seemed to keep my belly moisturized but it irritated my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I rub it in completely and it leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>and I am still using now that my baby is 9 weeks old.</li>
            <li>, believe me I tried a lot of them, also the all natural ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting big fast, so</li>
            <li>I use this for my shin even though my daughter is 15 tears old now.</li>
            <li>My first trimester skin was so dry</li>
            <li>The cream is rich and thick but does penetrate skin extremely fast, you feel moisturized ALL day.     </li>
            <li>main reason I used this is because as I got bigger and farther along in my pregnancy my belly would itch and feel so stretched.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far they are slowly lightening they are the white stretchies on my tummy mostly</li>
            <li>Barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>As far as stretch marks being a thing of genetics, I personally believe will power is stronger than genetics.</li>
            <li>The marks on my hips are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Used 4 during my first pregnancy and the other 3 I&#x27;m using with my second.     </li>
            <li>I assumed I would be covered in stretch marks because my mother and grandmother had trouble with them, but thanks to this lotion I&#x27;m not!</li>

            <li> it last long.</li>
            <li> Prior to showering I would dry brush.</li>
            <li> texture is not too bad, dries pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s felt greasy and smells a little bit like bug spray but not in an overpowering way.  </li>
            <li> I used this product from begining of my pregnancy after showers and as needed if skin was too dry.</li>
            <li> my skin was not itchy or dry any longer.  </li>
            <li> It helped some with the itching but by the time I woke up in the morning I was still somewhat dry</li>
            <li> My skin still felt dry.</li>
            <li> so I use Kiehl&#x27;s Intensive Treatment and Moisture for Dry or Callused Areas.</li>
            <li> I live in Canada and believe me this product is extremely hard to find</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m down to my last one, so</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a SINGLE mark on my belly!</li>
            <li> Will update in a few weeks when the second bottle is half way gone.p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.</li>
            <li> I tried other lotions but nothing helped until I received a sample of this from a maternity shop.</li>
            <li> To me, this feels like any other Curel lotion.  </li>
            <li> All the other lotions I tried were either not specifically for pregnancy</li>
            <li> I put it on my very dry hands every night and this has truly healed the redness and dryness in less than 3 days.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is it is sticky after it is rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because it was half the price of Palmers.</li>
            <li> I had half a bottle of this from my sister that is not pregnant...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel itchy on my stretchmarks from previous pregnancies, nor do I feel like my skin is dry/irritated.  </li>
            <li> Seems a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> (My Mom and sister have heavy ones like scars).</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until i had been using it for a few weeks before i wrote my review.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday during my pregnancy</li>
            <li> I used this faithfully everyday after showering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a plain lotion smell.  </li>
            <li> In fact my belly had huge nasty flakes &amp; was so itchy &amp; dry.  </li>
            <li> I actually think its discontinued which is really sad.</li>
            <li> No matter how small an amount I use, it&#x27;ll be sticky.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> This lotion is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to resort to buying it online because it&#x27;s just too hard to find</li>
            <li> but it feels icky.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this stuff is that it&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I tried the oil, which was definitely a little oily in texture and uncomfortable after to put clothes over.  </li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I had chapped hands from the cold Chicago winter this year and nothing was working-</li>
            <li> Bio Oil isnt bad either, but too greasy.</li>
            <li> so I am a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I would then need to reapply which was annoying.  </li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell original</li>
            <li> Curel Comfort Moisture Cream for Pregnancy and Motherhood is the best body moisturizer I ever tried. I am 5 months pregnant and my belly was so dry and itchy. I tried other lotions but nothing helped until I received a sample of this from a maternity shop. Within one use my belly felt so much relief and I feel so moisturized.</li>
            <li> I used this product from begining of my pregnancy after showers and as needed if skin was too dry. I didn&#x27;t get any streachmarks even I was huge. (My Mom and sister have heavy ones like scars). The texture of the cream is reach but it penetrates skin in about 2 min. leaving skin soft, smooth and supple. Love the scent. I bought it for five bucks + tax in drugstor on sale. One tube was enough for one year.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 pregnancies and tried several different \\&quot;stretch-mark\\&quot; creams.  I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive nose and this was gentle on both! This really does work to keep skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> First, I used Palmers belly butter.  That seemed to keep my belly moisturized but it irritated my sensitive skin.  Then I switched to my regular Aveeno lotion which did not keep my belly moisturized at all.  In fact my belly had huge nasty flakes &amp; was so itchy &amp; dry.  I then bought this &amp; within 2 days my skin was not itchy or dry any longer.  It also does not irritate my skin!  The smell is very pleasing - I cannot stand strong smells especially floral scented ones.  This has a very light scent which is great.  I just wish they sold it in a larger bottle!  I am 29 weeks &amp; already need to order another 8.5 oz container which has lasted for about a month (I use it for my whole body now, not just my belly).</li>
            <li> To me, this feels like any other Curel lotion.  I don&#x27;t think its moisturizing enough for a growing belly.  However, I do live in a dry Colorado climate, so it might be better if you live somewhere humid.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my first pregnancy...it was the only pregnancy lotion that didn&#x27;t make me gag!  It works really well.  I wish this was still available through Curel.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews that it was non-greasy and had a nice scent.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice and so far it&#x27;s felt greasy and smells a little bit like bug spray but not in an overpowering way.  Seems to be moisturizing ok but it feels icky.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to greasy lotions so I am a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am currently 29 weeks pregnant and have been using this product since I found out.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing frangance and its not greasy.  My skin feels nice and smooth after applying this product.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this product it makes my skin feel super soft. I wanted to wait until i had been using it for a few weeks before i wrote my review. This is going to be one of those products where to see the full result im gonna need to buy another bottle before i see what im looking for. So far they are slowly lightening they are the white stretchies on my tummy mostly, im happy but id like to be happier. The suggested usage is going to require you to use it daily which is the hook to get you to repurchase if you kinda loved it like me. I just want them gone the stretchies, so it will motivate me to lose the five remaining pounds in my stomach area. Otherwise it smells nice and it last long. Will update in a few weeks when the second bottle is half way gone.p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. The marks are finally going away and im inlove with my body again. We have a few more weeks to go but so far so wonderful. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved using this cream during and after her pregnancies. I made sure she was well-stocked during that time. She really appreciated this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pregnant daughter who went through one tube and requested another.  It&#x27;s a little pricy, but she says it&#x27;s the best lotion ever and seems to lock in moisture longer than others.</li>
            <li> I opened a sample of this product and I absolutely love it.  I put it on my very dry hands every night and this has truly healed the redness and dryness in less than 3 days.  I had chapped hands from the cold Chicago winter this year and nothing was working- my Eucerin couldn&#x27;t keep up.  I am so pleased, and I do not feel at all that this is a greasy product.  I rub it in completely and it leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> So I initially bought the mama mio tummy rub stretch mark oil due to awesome reviews.  My first trimester skin was so dry and I was itching nonstop I couldn&#x27;t even sleep!  I tried the oil, which was definitely a little oily in texture and uncomfortable after to put clothes over.  It helped some with the itching but by the time I woke up in the morning I was still somewhat dry and I would then need to reapply which was annoying.  I read about the Curel stuff on a pregnancy board, and this stuff is awesome!  texture is not too bad, dries pretty quickly.  NO ITCHING at all!  When I wake up in the morning my skin is STILL hydrated so I only need to do one application at night.  awesome.</li>
            <li> I got this to my wife during her ongoing pregnancy. It really helps she said and also I really really like the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I used to use Palmers when I first got pregnant, but I never really felt like it truly moisturized. My skin still felt dry. I also thought Palmers smelled funny. I actually found this at first on clearance at Walmart. I bought it because it was half the price of Palmers. After my first application I knew it was a great product. It is really silky and it rubs in well. I do not feel greasy. There is no scent. My skin felt more elastic and I did not get one stretch mark! The Walmart by my house doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore, so I bought 5 more bottles from Amazon. I used it everyday during my pregnancy and I am still using now that my baby is 9 weeks old. I plan on continuing to use it because it is quality lotion and a discount price.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so hard to find. I actually think its discontinued which is really sad. I used this lotion for my first child and loved it. Now prego with my second and was very dissappointed that it wasn&#x27;t available in the store. Anyways if your thinking of getting this product dont think twice it is the best.</li>
            <li> I had half a bottle of this from my sister that is not pregnant...she gave it to me for my stomach once I found out I was expecting. I loved it. All the other lotions I tried were either not specifically for pregnancy or if they were, they didn&#x27;t have a good scent. This lotion has an amazing scent &amp; I love it. It was hard to find this lotion in stores, so I ended up having to get it online, but was still at a good price. I am currently 7 months, have been using this lotion since I was four months, and still not one stretch mark. I do recommend putting it everywhere; thighs, belly, butt, boobs. I only started putting it on my belly &amp; boobs, never my butt or thighs, now I have stretch marks on my butt but as soon as I started rubbing this product on my butt as well, they got lighter &amp; I haven&#x27;t gotten any more. If you are pregnant &amp; looking for a good lotion that works &amp; smells good as well, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I used this product when pregnant with my first baby. No stretch marks were left on my skin.  I live in Canada and believe me this product is extremely hard to find, i went to a Zellers and finally found like 7 bottles, i bought them ALL. Used 4 during my first pregnancy and the other 3 I&#x27;m using with my second.     The cream is rich and thick but does penetrate skin extremely fast, you feel moisturized ALL day.     Its better than ANY other cream out there, believe me I tried a lot of them, also the all natural ones. Nothing was as good.     Bio Oil isnt bad either, but too greasy.</li>
            <li> I still have scars after delivering baby. But I think this moisturizer work on to moisture the dryness on my skin.</li>
            <li> I received a tube of this as a gift when I first found out I was pregnant and I quickly fell in love with it.  I especially love that it does not have any parabens so I feel good about using it during pregnancy, especially. It says on the tube that it&#x27;s even safe to use on the baby!  I use it as an all over body lotion after my shower.  It&#x27;s really rich, but not greasy and I&#x27;m 37 weeks now and still do not have a stretch mark. Who knows for sure if it prevented stretch marks, but I&#x27;m positive that it didn&#x27;t hurt either!  Also, it&#x27;s moisturizing properties last all day and I don&#x27;t have to reapply later in the day like alot of other lotions and that&#x27;s saying alot because I live in a fairly dry climate.  It smells good, too.  Another bonus is I don&#x27;t have itchy skin like so many pregnant women complain about. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this stuff is that it&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores.  I&#x27;ve had to resort to buying it online because it&#x27;s just too hard to find and I think that&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it is sticky after it is rubbed in.  No matter how small an amount I use, it&#x27;ll be sticky.  But on the flip side of that coin, it keeps me really well moisturized.  I don&#x27;t feel itchy on my stretchmarks from previous pregnancies, nor do I feel like my skin is dry/irritated.  The smell is very light.  It isn&#x27;t floral or perfumey, in my opinion.  I can&#x27;t explain the smell.  It&#x27;s just a plain lotion smell.  I thought the price was kind of high...don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m paying $13 for a regular size bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice smell but I didn&#x27;t notice that it did much.  I wish I had went with something more expensive to avoid stretch marks during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 weeks pregnant, I ordered Curel because i had used a sample before and i knew i liked it. I like the smell and the feel of this lotion. I mainly use this lotion for my arms and legs because it&#x27;s smooth and i can rub it easily and it gets absorbed pretty quickly. I used Bella B Tummy Honey Butter for my belly and Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch oil for my breasts, so far so good and no stretch marks. I&#x27;m getting big fast, so i know my skin is stretching and i get itchy soem times but the lotions all three have helped w my skin issues and again no stretch marks so far...:)</li>
            <li> My wife has very dry skin, and she has found that this is the best lotion for helping her through dry winter months. It isn&#x27;t oily and isn&#x27;t too smelly, either. We bought a bottle when she was pregnant three years ago, and she&#x27;s been using it regularly since then.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this lotion many times because of how it feels- it leaves my skin with that water-resistant, waxed-car feel and I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off my hands after applying it. I&#x27;d much rather have something rich and creamy- so I use Kiehl&#x27;s Intensive Treatment and Moisture for Dry or Callused Areas.</li>
            <li> I started getting stretch marks, so I bought this, hoping it would work, and its amazing!! smells good too.  I bought it a couple times during my second pregnancy as well.</li>
            <li> I had very very itchy dry skin while pregnant and this worked very well. Smells very nice also. Wish they sold a bigger bottle though. Seems like noone sells this in stores.</li>
            <li> This cream just doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as I hoped.  Seems a little greasy.  Put it on my hands and went to the gym with workout gloves.  The dye from the gloves seeps into my pores since the cream takes a while to absorb.  It was probably about 1/2 hour after I put on the cream before I went to the gym.</li>
            <li> I used this faithfully everyday after showering. Prior to showering I would dry brush. My baby is 2 months I have no stretch marks on my stomach. However I do have some on each side. Barely noticeable. Idk what happened there. I thought I was getting them just as much, maybe not :/ My mom mother of 3 has stretch marks. however my gma mother of 3 doesn&#x27;t. She drinks alot of water as do I! As far as stretch marks being a thing of genetics, I personally believe will power is stronger than genetics. TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY INSIDE AND OUT!</li>
            <li> I used this all through my first pregnancy. I put it on my belly every day (sometimes 2-3x) and everywhere else whenever I had the energy. I didn&#x27;t get a SINGLE mark on my belly! Since I would often forget to put it on my boobs or hips I did end up with some marks there. My boobs didn&#x27;t get marks until my milk came in. It happened so fast and they got so huge that I don&#x27;t even know if the lotion would have helped me then. The marks on my hips are barely noticeable. Nobody can see them but me, even when I wear a 2-piece bathing suit. I assumed I would be covered in stretch marks because my mother and grandmother had trouble with them, but thanks to this lotion I&#x27;m not! I just found out last week that I&#x27;m expecting baby #2 and I&#x27;ve already started putting it on every day. Last time, I bought it in bulk on eBay (6 bottles, I think) and I&#x27;m down to my last one, so I&#x27;m going to have to order more!!</li>
            <li> I used this lotion with my first pregnancy, I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I used this is because as I got bigger and farther along in my pregnancy my belly would itch and feel so stretched.&lt;br /&gt;I would rub it all over my belly at night and had instant relief. I am now pregnant with #2 and the only place I can buy it is online, I will be stocking up.</li>
            <li> I use this for my shin even though my daughter is 15 tears old now. I t keep my shin supple and well nourished. It is sometimes overpriced by the sellers but its worth a try.</li>
            <li> Have been using this stuff for ever and am so happy to have found it online since they&#x27;re no longer carrying it at the store.</li>
