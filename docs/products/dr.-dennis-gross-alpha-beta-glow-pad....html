            <li>Love them&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My wife uses these on her face all winter, and everyone compliments her on the healthy &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; her face gets in this upstate NY winter.</li>
            <li>it pretty darn good</li>
            <li>these really do give your face a nice glow!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the great reviews left here.  </li>
            <li>These self tanning towels are so easy to use, give the best color and are the only tanning product I&#x27;ve used that actually leaves my skin feeling better than before I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because I have older skin</li>
            <li>Day one is nice, skin has a dewy look, but I do tend to have to blot as the &amp;#34;dew&amp;#34; can quickly turn into too much shine.</li>
            <li>This has to be the most natural looking self tanner that I&#x27;ve used, but what I most like about it is that there is no smell to it.</li>
            <li>I love that they come in individual packets, super easy and great for busy moms!</li>
            <li>No streaking, just nice color that looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and do not apply daily, as it would be too dark.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are absolutely fantastic to give your face a very natural looking tan and super easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Easy to wipe on and really does give you a glow.  </li>
            <li>great little things.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not simply that your skin starts to have more color, it&#x27;s that it really does glow with a healthy, sun-kissed look.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Arrived right away-box was damaged however I would reorder</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how it works because it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my face, it just feels clean.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly, looks natural, not streaky or orangey.</li>
            <li>but you know what I mean about looking healthy with that kind of an outdoorsy</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>really do the job for the derma peel, and the golden glow you get after is fantastic, so even and natural.</li>
            <li>my first wipe, I noticed the discoloration immediately.  </li>
            <li>I love using all of Dr. Gross&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>They give your face a nice little glow.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the pads were too small to cover that much area effectively  </li>
            <li>Real.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really genius.</li>
            <li>so I probably don&#x27;t get as much wear out of one application.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I tried it this morning to see how much of a tan I would get.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise it worked.</li>
            <li>Very unnatural color for my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>recommend skipping the saved $ for a much nicer glow and health of your skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, especially during this time of year when every one is looking so pale.</li>
            <li>Works, but so do many other product that are 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin &amp; often look pale, this just perks up my whole face!</li>
            <li>and I think a lot of makeup can end up be more aging and unflattering and truly less</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>Too orange for my fair skin and didn&#x27;t use it long enough to reap any benefits from the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>They turn a little darker as you smooth them over your face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage.</li>
            <li>I ordered them, and I was really pleasantly surprised with the results when I tried them at home.</li>
            <li>Also, I work in even circles and go over my whole face with the same pad twice, to ensure that I haven&#x27;t missed any areas.</li>
            <li>Still the same white pad without the funny smell.  </li>
            <li>Very Very Orange colored skin after 2 uses  - leaves a sticky feeling for a while, and long lasting &amp;#34;fake tanner&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Gives just the right color,not too dark.</li>
            <li>I researched and found different soaps and creams to use...and so far it has worked.</li>
            <li>I have rather pale skin and dark hair and have tried many types of tanning lotions and pads.</li>
            <li>now find I can use little or not foundation or blush when I get ready to go out.</li>

            <li> They have usually ended up looking too orange or too fake, and worse of all, splotchy if you don&#x27;t apply them completely evenly all over which as many of you know is not as easy as it sounds</li>
            <li> However, as one of the other reviewers commented, it was not the same product.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s simply not worth the extra cash to me.</li>

            <li> Did not like color and the smell is like every other self tanner.  </li>
            <li> Other than the coloring - the product itself</li>
            <li> I assumed it had to do with weather and the dry air of winter, but after continued use, the condition of my skin only got worse.  </li>
            <li> I looked past that and after using these for a week, my skin became dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I cut them in half to avoid over-doing it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not super pale.</li>
            <li> I use these year round and have for a few years.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t get my cosmetics advice from a magazine but for some reason these caught my eye when they were described as adding glow to one&#x27;s skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wipes were not white (but sort of a yellow/beige color) and they had a weird smell.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it does have a fake tan smell</li>
            <li> By day two the shine/dew is gone and color is just subtle.</li>
            <li> I conserve by cutting the pads in half or even into three or four pieces.</li>
            <li> The cloth though can be difficult to maneuver, as it rolls up as you use it, which causes you to miss areas, but since you can&#x27;t see the color, you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li> but I have been disappointed in the way they look on my face.</li>

            <li> I have rather pale skin and dark hair and have tried many types of tanning lotions and pads. They&#x27;ve all done an okay job on my legs and arms but I have been disappointed in the way they look on my face. They have usually ended up looking too orange or too fake, and worse of all, splotchy if you don&#x27;t apply them completely evenly all over which as many of you know is not as easy as it sounds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these pads because I read about them in a magazine like Us or People or something like that.  I usually don&#x27;t get my cosmetics advice from a magazine but for some reason these caught my eye when they were described as adding glow to one&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered them, and I was really pleasantly surprised with the results when I tried them at home. The pads themselves are quite small and are very white in color. They turn a little darker as you smooth them over your face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage. At first I thought the pads were too small to cover that much area effectively  but it was no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the difference seemingly within minutes, and more so as the day went on. It&#x27;s not simply that your skin starts to have more color, it&#x27;s that it really does glow with a healthy, sun-kissed look. (I know that tanning isn&#x27;t good for your skin but you know what I mean about looking healthy with that kind of an outdoorsy glow.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really happy and I do plan on adding them to my morning routine. Or maybe I should clarify and say every other morning - these do get you quite tan so for me, I find that I get the look that I want by using them every other day. Note that you can use these at night or in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now find I can use little or not foundation or blush when I get ready to go out. It&#x27;s nice because I have older skin and I think a lot of makeup can end up be more aging and unflattering and truly less is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Love these glow pads!  They provide just the right color for a healthy glow!!</li>
            <li> Love these! Exfoliate great and give me just the right amount of color!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Real. Blends in well.  Good product. Try it. You will like it. But expensive and worth it.</li>
            <li> Too orange for my fair skin and didn&#x27;t use it long enough to reap any benefits from the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunless tanning product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Works, but so do many other product that are 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase.  I bought some of these a while ago and they were great.  Recently, I purchased them again.  However, as one of the other reviewers commented, it was not the same product.  The wipes were not white (but sort of a yellow/beige color) and they had a weird smell.  I wondered if Dr. Dennis Gross changed the product, so I went to Sephora and bought some.  Nope!  Still the same white pad without the funny smell.  Don&#x27;t try to save a few bucks and get the real thing from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I got these because the lovely Caroline Hirons recommended them. They are amazing! It chemically exfoliates the skin AND gives beautiful color! I have fair skin but I&#x27;m not super pale. I cannot use these every day because I would be TOO tan! I use them at night, about twice a week, and I wake up with a gorgeous glow. I use it all over my face and d&amp;eacute;colletage. I don&#x27;t really know how it works because it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my face, it just feels clean. It&#x27;s really genius. The only complaint I have is that it does have a fake tan smell but it&#x27;s worth it to me. The tan lasts for several days. I love that they come in individual packets, super easy and great for busy moms!</li>
            <li> I keep a supply of these pads,they are perfect for that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; of a sunkissed look.</li>
            <li> I like these pads. They give your face a nice little glow. But, use sparingly. If you over apply, the color looks funky. I cut them in half to avoid over-doing it.</li>
            <li> Gives just the right color,not too dark.</li>
            <li> Did not like color and the smell is like every other self tanner.  wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> These are absolutely fantastic to give your face a very natural looking tan and super easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you wash hands well after application.</li>
            <li> great value, suer fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is the only self tanner I will use on my face. It looks natural...not orange. I conserve by cutting the pads in half or even into three or four pieces. I put the unused pieces in tin foil. I don&#x27;t need an entire pad for my face by any means. These are great! I also have Rosacea...that was never controlled by creams/meds from the dermatologist. I researched and found different soaps and creams to use...and so far it has worked. This doesn&#x27;t cause my face to redden or get irritated at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to wipe on and really does give you a glow.  Tan was even, but too orange for my super-pale-with-pink-undertones complexion.</li>
            <li> great little things. really do the job for the derma peel, and the golden glow you get after is fantastic, so even and natural. love this product</li>
            <li> Very Very Orange colored skin after 2 uses  - leaves a sticky feeling for a while, and long lasting &amp;#34;fake tanner&amp;#34; smell.  Had to buy the regular ones without the glow.  Other than the coloring - the product itself it pretty darn good</li>
            <li> I use these year round and have for a few years. No streaking, just nice color that looks natural. I scrub my face daily with a face brush so I probably don&#x27;t get as much wear out of one application. Day one is nice, skin has a dewy look, but I do tend to have to blot as the &amp;#34;dew&amp;#34; can quickly turn into too much shine. By day two the shine/dew is gone and color is just subtle. I have fair skin and do not apply daily, as it would be too dark.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend that when applying make sure that you go all the way to the hairline, do your eyelids, ears, neck, and any exposed chest areas, otherwise your tone won&#x27;t match. Also, I work in even circles and go over my whole face with the same pad twice, to ensure that I haven&#x27;t missed any areas. I also use the body pads, but not as often during the fall and winter.</li>
            <li> these really do give your face a nice glow! easy travel packets too!</li>
            <li> It really works. I tried it this morning to see how much of a tan I would get. I applied it to my thighs just in case it didn&#x27;t work out no one would see it. Much to my surprise it worked. When compared to the lower part of my legs (below the knees) I was able to see the difference. The tan was lighter than I would have wanted. But glad so see it worked. The instructions are to reapply 2 or 3 times a week depending how tan you want to get. I took a shower and glad to see it didn&#x27;t wash the tan away. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Turned orange and left streaks. Very unnatural color for my skin.</li>
            <li> This has to be the most natural looking self tanner that I&#x27;ve used, but what I most like about it is that there is no smell to it.</li>
            <li> These self tanning towels are so easy to use, give the best color and are the only tanning product I&#x27;ve used that actually leaves my skin feeling better than before I use it. This stuff is amazing. Great color, and it lasts a good couple days. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is great, especially during this time of year when every one is looking so pale.You can go subtle, or super tan.I have very light skin &amp; often look pale, this just perks up my whole face! It dries very quickly, looks natural, not streaky or orangey.</li>
            <li> Arrived right away-box was damaged however I would reorder</li>
            <li> I have purchased these before.  This is one of the best prices I have gotten them for.  They are a great product.  Gives your face a nice glow without the harmful effects of the sun!  Love them&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I like it very much. The cloth though can be difficult to maneuver, as it rolls up as you use it, which causes you to miss areas, but since you can&#x27;t see the color, you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the great reviews left here.  They&#x27;re probably reviewing the actual product, which this is not.  I have been purchasing these wipes from Sephora for over six months.  When I noticed it cheaper here, I figured why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening my first wipe, I noticed the discoloration immediately.  Instead of white, they were already the beige color they appear after the product has been applied to your skin.  I looked past that and after using these for a week, my skin became dry and irritated.  I assumed it had to do with weather and the dry air of winter, but after continued use, the condition of my skin only got worse.  When I switched back to the purchased packs from Sephora, my skin went back to it&#x27;s normal condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend skipping the saved $ for a much nicer glow and health of your skin.  That&#x27;s simply not worth the extra cash to me.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these on her face all winter, and everyone compliments her on the healthy &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; her face gets in this upstate NY winter.</li>
            <li> These are great. I love using all of Dr. Gross&#x27;s products.</li>
