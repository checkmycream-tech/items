            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with them.</li>

            <li>love using these in my car.</li>
            <li>:))))</li>
            <li>They sure make your car diffuser work like a charm.</li>

            <li>Easy to use with the plug in diffuser.</li>
            <li>Order was handled and processed very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>You can stand them right next to the air-intake which works out perfect.</li>
            <li>Natural solution to allergies, sleepless nights, adhd, and so many more!</li>
            <li>The car smells lovely and I love that I am breathing in good smells that are good FOR you or at the very least, not harmful.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t like how much oil you have to apply to these to make them effective.</li>
            <li>I am rating these pads 5 stars because they are and work as the original ones.  </li>
            <li>so, i was SO excited to find this and the &amp;#</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, Dries to fast.</li>
            <li>then I will return for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughters Vicks cool mist humidifier.</li>
            <li>very nice works as expected</li>
            <li>I received them quickly and they are just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Only last for 2 days at best</li>
            <li>Quick shipping product as advertised</li>
            <li>Smell real good but don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these in my car with my essential oils and I am loving every moment of it.</li>
            <li>and if I can get enough oil on them to make them effective.</li>
            <li>I liked the refill pads for car diffuser, except I had to cut them down to fit the unit.</li>
            <li>The refill pads fit perfectly in my car essential oil diffusor and last a long time.</li>
            <li>mEssentials seems to be a very responsible business</li>
            <li>It get dray very fast</li>
            <li>This is just what I wanted, thanks!</li>
            <li>love to use these in the car diffuser, in the scentcy animals, and sometimes just to stick in any area with some essential oil on it</li>
            <li>love to bring my essential oils with me in the car and these do the trick!</li>
            <li>I have not been able to locate the pads locally.</li>
            <li>Well, these are exactly that.</li>
            <li>THanks!</li>
            <li>They can hold up up to 5 applications of oil and work like its the first time.</li>
            <li>They are pads sure but not high quality.</li>
            <li>The pads are bit smaller than I anticipated but work fine in my Tribest - Humio 2 Humidifier...  </li>
            <li>Fast ship.</li>
            <li>It would be much easier to give it a rating if the diffuser worked.</li>
            <li>do still use it, just not as much as i would like.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, the Item was just as described.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper when using as a aromatherapy device.</li>
            <li>These are much shorter than the Scent ball pads.</li>
            <li>AND they come with a nice small metal stand to hold the diffuser pads.</li>
            <li>Go through them pretty frequently, so I&#x27;d like to see them at a lower cost.</li>
            <li>A little smaller than anticipated, but still good product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Can reuse.</li>
            <li>The pads don&#x27;t hold the aroma of the oil for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>product was not what I expected, pads get dried really quick, only last for a couple minutes, not so happy.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately cotton balls work better and actually hold the EO scent much better than these.</li>
            <li>so important with little ones and a dog that travels.</li>
            <li>They are just soft cardboard pieces.</li>
            <li>But I can only smell anything when I first apply the essential oil.</li>
            <li>we have long road trips, we really use it.  </li>
            <li>They are all different sizes, just by like 0.1cm, but when you are trying to squeeze the larger one into the diffuser, that 0.1cm makes a large difference.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and timely shipment!</li>
            <li>As expected and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I wanted to place them next to my CPAP air intake vent but without a stand Iâ€™ve had to lay them on a tablecloth near by the air vent.</li>
            <li>so I have only had to use one of the refills so far (for 2 months now).  </li>
            <li>My only other dream wish is that you could control how much is diffused, the smell can be overpowering at times.</li>
            <li>These pads are a little over priced, but they really work well in the diffuser.  </li>

            <li> These pads are a little over priced, but they really work well in the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> that smell did not last long at all</li>
            <li> They do dry out but can be re-saturated (with the same oil)</li>
            <li> These will last a LONG LONG time</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these Carscenter Diffuser pads from mEssentials DO NOT come with any kind of a stand or at least some thing to prop them up with, so you&#x27;re left with just laying them around.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly enough but are only half the size of the diffuser pad that came with the diffuser bulb.  </li>
            <li> The pads I have for my scent ball are longer, these are short, I can use them in the car diffuser but no the room diffuser due to size</li>
            <li> Far less expensive than competitions but mostly for a small room</li>
            <li> They will work, but not sure how long they will last</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Pad are thick and well made to replace old ones.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving them a 4 instead of 5 star, is that the cutting is very erratic.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I can use them in my previously purchased car oil scent warmer.</li>
            <li> The car can smell a little iffy.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> a few times before you need to dispose of them.</li>
            <li> a few times on each side.</li>
            <li> These mEssentials Carscenter Diffuser Pads do not fit the Pur-Sleep stand</li>
            <li> put a few drops on the pad and put it in there and voila!&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li> It includes small round diffuser pads</li>
            <li> Since the diffuser doesn&#x27;t work well, I&#x27;m not sure how to rate these pads</li>
            <li> It arrive on time but now I am stuck with the product due to the car scenter diffuser is broken.</li>
            <li> However, I have not worked that looked that hard either.</li>
            <li> This was the least costly pads I could find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worthless and has turned out to be a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I only wish it could continue the aroma effects without the car on, but of course that is impossible.  </li>
            <li> but they are difficult to use in the plug in because they are small.</li>
            <li> It is bulkier than I had expected, and almost impossible to put the drops in without getting one or two on your skin, clothes, car, etc.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY USELESS...</li>
            <li> I guess I bought the wrong size.  </li>
            <li> I already had the humidifier and all I have to do is cut off a small piece of the pad apply oils and viola!!!!</li>
            <li> so at this point their pads are worthless.</li>

            <li> Just what I&#x27;d been looking for.</li>
            <li> it fits into car diffuser but diffuser dis not work at all</li>
            <li> Shipped right away, works great, was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am rating these pads 5 stars because they are and work as the original ones.  I recommend them to all Scent Ball users.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast ship. Great price</li>
            <li> Unfortunately cotton balls work better and actually hold the EO scent much better than these. But great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> These pads are a little over priced, but they really work well in the diffuser.  I can get a great smelling house quickly!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I&#x27;ve been using these in my car with my essential oils and I am loving every moment of it.</li>
            <li> U can use these refill pads with any fragrance oils and put it in the car diffuser and smells great.</li>
            <li> I received them quickly and they are just what I needed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, Dries to fast.</li>
            <li> very nice works as expected</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I can use them in my previously purchased car oil scent warmer. I use essential oil blends to make the car smell fresher and to stay away from synthetic fragrance car fresheners which include all sorts of toxic ingredients. These are great: I saturate them with the oil of my choice and the car smells lovely. They do dry out but can be re-saturated (with the same oil) a few times before you need to dispose of them. The car smells lovely and I love that I am breathing in good smells that are good FOR you or at the very least, not harmful.</li>
            <li> As expected and fast shipping. Noo problems here! :)</li>
            <li> We have diffusers in all our vehicles and needed these.  Best car air freshener around!</li>
            <li> I liked the refill pads for car diffuser, except I had to cut them down to fit the unit.</li>
            <li> Does the job! only problem is they are tiny and i lose them before i can put them in the car. They are just soft cardboard pieces. and you can use them (with the same oils, or different i guess) a few times on each side.</li>
            <li> These work great, and fit, for the most part.  The only reason I am giving them a 4 instead of 5 star, is that the cutting is very erratic.  They are all different sizes, just by like 0.1cm, but when you are trying to squeeze the larger one into the diffuser, that 0.1cm makes a large difference.</li>
            <li> get the work done&lt;br /&gt;Car Scenter Diffuser / Scent Ball Diffuser refill pads . God to use. Good to Use.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted, thanks!</li>
            <li> love to use these in the car diffuser, in the scentcy animals, and sometimes just to stick in any area with some essential oil on it</li>
            <li> TOTALLY USELESS...Unfortunately these Carscenter Diffuser pads from mEssentials DO NOT come with any kind of a stand or at least some thing to prop them up with, so you&#x27;re left with just laying them around. I wanted to place them next to my CPAP air intake vent but without a stand Iâ€™ve had to lay them on a tablecloth near by the air vent. It&#x27;s worthless and has turned out to be a complete waste of money. Iâ€™ve been using the Pur-Sleep CPAP Aromatherapy. It includes small round diffuser pads AND they come with a nice small metal stand to hold the diffuser pads. You can stand them right next to the air-intake which works out perfect. These mEssentials Carscenter Diffuser Pads do not fit the Pur-Sleep stand so at this point their pads are worthless. If mEssentials CAN NOT provide a stand or an ez fix then I will return for a full refund. mEssentials seems to be a very responsible business so I hope they will come through for me. BUT I will keep everybody posted and let you know what kind of customer service the mEssentials Customer Service Team provide.</li>
            <li> These are okay.  Smell real good but don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Works perfectly in my ScentBall.</li>
            <li> It would be much easier to give it a rating if the diffuser worked. But I can only smell anything when I first apply the essential oil.</li>
            <li> The refill pads fit perfectly in my car essential oil diffusor and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love my car diffuser.  These work as well as the one I received with my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Since the diffuser doesn&#x27;t work well, I&#x27;m not sure how to rate these pads</li>
            <li> The pads don&#x27;t hold the aroma of the oil for more than a few hours. They are pads sure but not high quality.</li>
            <li> Gives out NO scent of the oils.</li>
            <li> so, i was SO excited to find this and the &amp;#34;Car Diffuser Aromatherapy&amp;#34;.  A nice alternative to synthetic scents.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, the oil may last 15-20 minutes, then it&#x27;s gone.  So, just know that going into the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;When we have long road trips, we really use it.  The car can smell a little iffy.&lt;br /&gt;You put a few drops on the pad and put it in there and voila!&lt;br /&gt;we do still use it, just not as much as i would like.</li>
            <li> I guess I bought the wrong size.  I bought this for my Body Shop diffuser, but they were too short in length.</li>
            <li> As expected. Go through them pretty frequently, so I&#x27;d like to see them at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> The pads I have for my scent ball are longer, these are short, I can use them in the car diffuser but no the room diffuser due to size</li>
            <li> product was not what I expected, pads get dried really quick, only last for a couple minutes, not so happy.</li>
            <li> Pads work good. Easy to use with the plug in diffuser. I can reuse the pad multiple times before it needs changed.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the diffuser in my car.  I don&#x27;t like the car trees so these worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> love to bring my essential oils with me in the car and these do the trick! Would highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Can reuse.</li>
            <li> Everything came in as promised. Love the product</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, the Item was just as described.</li>
            <li> The pads are bit smaller than I anticipated but work fine in my Tribest - Humio 2 Humidifier...  I have not been able to locate the pads locally. However, I have not worked that looked that hard either.</li>
            <li> These are a must have to use with the car scenter diffuser! Put a drop or three of your favorite essential oil and smell the good vibes!</li>
            <li> Fair price but they are difficult to use in the plug in because they are small.</li>
            <li> Great, fits perfectly, quick ship!</li>
            <li> I got these to go with the cigarette lighter aromatherapy scents , I also got them for my friend , they work great , I love it !</li>
            <li> Great value. The inserts fit my scentball perfectly, don&#x27;t add a &amp;#34;cardboard-y&amp;#34; smell, and they seem to hold up well to repeated use.</li>
            <li> As described.....smile</li>
            <li> Great product, performs as they should...</li>
            <li> Perfect, exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Order was handled and processed very quickly.  Looking forward to testing them out.</li>
            <li> I loved this product for my car...I only wish it could continue the aroma effects without the car on, but of course that is impossible.  Overall it get&#x27;s the job done of filling my car with a scented aroma from my essential oil of my choice.</li>
            <li> They do what they are suppose to do. Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Hold the oil well and I&#x27;m pleased with them. Thank you</li>
            <li> These are really nice.</li>
            <li> I like the car diffuser a lot I commute 1.5 hours a day and this allows me to have oils with me</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters Vicks cool mist humidifier. I already had the humidifier and all I have to do is cut off a small piece of the pad apply oils and viola!!!! Natural solution to allergies, sleepless nights, adhd, and so many more!</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  Only last for 2 days at best</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my order for the pads for the car diffuser. I use them every day.</li>
            <li> Lots of pads, can use both sides.</li>
            <li> Everything came working wonderfully and nicely package</li>
            <li> It is bulkier than I had expected, and almost impossible to put the drops in without getting one or two on your skin, clothes, car, etc. It works great one plugged in, except that it gets very hot to the touch after about 45 minutes of use (which scares me since I commute). The car smells lovely though. My only other dream wish is that you could control how much is diffused, the smell can be overpowering at times.</li>
            <li> It arrive on time but now I am stuck with the product due to the car scenter diffuser is broken.</li>
            <li> Seems good.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped.  Makes it more expensive.  Do like the scent in my car.</li>
            <li> One pad will last about five uses or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to change when you are switching fragrances or when the pad itself appears to be overused/heavily stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only needs about three droplets.</li>
            <li> I got them, they are good, :)</li>
            <li> Great refill for car diffuser.</li>
            <li> Pad are thick and well made to replace old ones. I was told that they should be good for 5-10 uses.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for...fit diffuser perfectly!  Very Satisfied!!!!</li>
            <li> You need replacement pads for your car diffuser? Well, these are exactly that. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and timely shipment!</li>
            <li> These will last a LONG LONG time</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly enough but are only half the size of the diffuser pad that came with the diffuser bulb.  They will work, but not sure how long they will last and if I can get enough oil on them to make them effective.</li>
            <li> love using these in my car.</li>
            <li> I guess refill pads are refill pads.  I have reused my pad over and over so I have only had to use one of the refills so far (for 2 months now).  This was the least costly pads I could find.</li>
            <li> So wonderful, worth the price and being able to use the oils in my car is perfect.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great price, and fully functional item. THanks!</li>
            <li> that smell did not last long at all</li>
            <li> Great Transaction.  A little smaller than anticipated, but still good product.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping product as advertised</li>
            <li> Refill pads fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> Just right, work well in my diffuser and a good price.</li>
            <li> Found some for a fraction of this cost after ordered it. But they are a quality item.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. .quick delivery</li>
            <li> Far less expensive than competitions but mostly for a small room</li>
            <li> product as described.  fast delivery.  very pleased!</li>
            <li> Works for intended purpose.</li>
            <li> It get dray very fast</li>
            <li> Bought it for my Vicks Humidifier and I didn&#x27;t have to trim it at all. Much cheaper when using as a aromatherapy device. :))))</li>
            <li> My car finally smells good, despite all the spills from the grandkids!</li>
            <li> They sure make your car diffuser work like a charm. They can hold up up to 5 applications of oil and work like its the first time. No prime delivery service though.</li>
            <li> These are much shorter than the Scent ball pads.</li>
            <li> They are what is described; refill pads for my carscenter diffuser. They are of good quality.</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  Just don&#x27;t like how much oil you have to apply to these to make them effective.</li>
            <li> Love these for the car...so important with little ones and a dog that travels.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t opened them since diffuser doesn&#x27;t work diffuse.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast delivery.</li>
