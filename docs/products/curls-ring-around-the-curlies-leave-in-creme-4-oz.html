            <li>It has a nice smell too.</li>
            <li>It does smell good, but I find it kind of a strong fragrance for a product that supposes to be for babies.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and curly and kind of a puff ball on its own.  </li>
            <li>No need to use more product.</li>
            <li>so I would suggest this product is more for a toddler rather than a baby.</li>
            <li>For a more defined curly look I use the Itsy Bitsy Sprials moisturizer for her hair.</li>
            <li>We have been using it in her hair since she was about 3 months, and we love the look and texture of her hair after using this leave in cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to just rub the excess into my hands like lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying all sorts of conditioners to keep his hair tangle free and his curls curly, and this is by FAR the best leave in product.</li>

            <li>Not only is it a great detangler, but is smells good too.</li>
            <li>I love that is</li>
            <li>but wish it was a bit milder or even had a slightly more vanilla/sweet scent or something</li>
            <li>but it is ok</li>
            <li>I think the smell could be better</li>
            <li>(it is not awful) and</li>
            <li>also b/c I wish it did hold slightly better</li>
            <li>My daughter was using it on my grandson when he was first born, I tried it and love it!  </li>
            <li>Her curls were nice and pretty.</li>
            <li>Her curls end up with a very soft defined look to them that stays looking good for the day.</li>
            <li>I liked so much I purchased it for a friend her son is a year.</li>

            <li>Scented just right for kids.</li>
            <li>Sometime I&#x27;ll run a comb through her curls right after I put this product in.</li>
            <li>This product is great for curly hair and only a dime size works to keep curls on the back of my child&#x27;s head moisturized.</li>
            <li>I put it on his hair in the morning while he&#x27;s in the jumperoo (this product needs time to set and dry before laying the baby down and the jumperoo or a walker etc. is perfect for that).</li>
            <li>At first I did not thought nothing of it, but now, I know that it is the fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have seen a reaction like this on her since she has been born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The scent is a little strong</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft and maintains my natural waves &amp; curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stick with the ultra gentle stuff until baby is old enough to use stronger products.  </li>

            <li>He no longer has breakage and his hair is soft and moisturized with defined curls.</li>

            <li>old son (AA) with hair that was getting curlier and coarser by the week.</li>
            <li>I wanted to help keep his curls in tact and work with his natural hair pattern but didn&#x27;t want to put anything with mineral oil</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 4 month old son.</li>
            <li>The next day my 6-month old daughter&#x27;s precious little head was itching, red, she had rash all around the back of her neck, head, chest.  </li>
            <li>I wear a very short &#x27;natural&#x27; haircut.</li>

            <li> I wear a very short &#x27;natural&#x27; haircut.</li>
            <li> Works very well with my sons curls, without weighing his hair down</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a shot if you are searching for something for thick, dry, curly baby heads that need some TLC!</li>
            <li> It also leaves his hair soft, not stiff or hard</li>
            <li> but his hair was dry and breaking and all over the place looking nuts even with coconut oil and other all natural products; so I gave this one a try.</li>
            <li> But I have notice it dry the back of her hair a lot quicker than just using shea butter and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount, then I can carefully untangle his hair and he&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> The curl cream requires a slightly larger dab but not very much.</li>
            <li> This product has none of that icky stuff and seems gentle.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s lasted a long while.</li>
            <li> Tries the mixed chicks line</li>
            <li> I apply it to wet hair after a bath or to dry and works just the same.</li>
            <li> For the conditioner he only needs a tiny little dab</li>
            <li> My baby is very healthy and she never been sick yet, plus she is a breastfeed baby; I never experiment any other baby product that had make her sneeze.</li>
            <li> but they dry out the scalp.</li>
            <li> I simply put about a half tablespoon of this product in my hands, rub my hands together once and then run my fingers/hands through her hair.</li>
            <li> (like you find in baby oil), sulfates, parabens etc on his tiny little head and skin.</li>
            <li> and his hair get frizzed up, all I have to do is wet it a bit and the product reactivates.</li>
            <li> I apply this while hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely curly and course hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter is mixed and it&#x27;s been hard finding something that will moisturize her hair without weighing the curls down.</li>
            <li> Do not weigh the hair down and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot heavier than usual leave in products, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it tends to look messy after a few hours; but that could be my daughter hair.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for what seems like a small bottle, but I use so little at a time that it should last for months.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t make her hair hard</li>
            <li> It is very expensive for such a small bottle though!!!</li>
            <li> The product has a smell but it isn&#x27;t a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I felt completely terrible and that it was all my fault for trying to use something new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely disappointed in this product!!!  </li>
            <li> nothing terrible</li>
            <li> but then again I suppose I might get some of those nasty things in the product I don&#x27;t want to begin with.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product and I love it! My son is Hispanic and African American. His hair changed from straight to wirey at about two months. He has sensitive skin so I was worried about using products but his hair was dry and breaking and all over the place looking nuts even with coconut oil and other all natural products; so I gave this one a try. It works great. I use the conditioner and the leave in curl cream. He no longer has breakage and his hair is soft and moisturized with defined curls. It also leaves his hair soft, not stiff or hard and there&#x27;s no residue. For the conditioner he only needs a tiny little dab so it&#x27;s lasted a long while. The curl cream requires a slightly larger dab but not very much. I put it on his hair in the morning while he&#x27;s in the jumperoo (this product needs time to set and dry before laying the baby down and the jumperoo or a walker etc. is perfect for that). His curls usually last all day even through nap time. Even when he has a particularly wild nap and his hair get frizzed up, all I have to do is wet it a bit and the product reactivates. No need to use more product.</li>
            <li> Enhanced my baby&#x27;s curl. Do not weigh the hair down and is not greasy. Very lightweight. Scented just right for kids.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely curly and course hair. This product is perfect for her. It really defines her curls and removes the frizz. The scent is a little strong so I would suggest this product is more for a toddler rather than a baby. The scent is pleasant though.</li>
            <li> I wear a very short &#x27;natural&#x27; haircut. I apply this while hair is still wet. Makes my hair very soft and maintains my natural waves &amp; curls. My daughter was using it on my grandson when he was first born, I tried it and love it!  It is very expensive for such a small bottle though!!!</li>
            <li> Learning how to do my new baby&#x27;s hair has been a challenge. A friend gave me this product and it has made all the difference. It not only detangles his hair but also helps hold the curl intact all day, even through naps.</li>
            <li> I use the Curls products on both my dauther&#x27;s hair. My youngest daughter(2yrs old) has a mixture of soft curly and somewhat meduium curly hair(biracial). I simply put about a half tablespoon of this product in my hands, rub my hands together once and then run my fingers/hands through her hair. Sometime I&#x27;ll run a comb through her curls right after I put this product in. That is it!. Her curls end up with a very soft defined look to them that stays looking good for the day. The curls usually stay put for another whole day without me having to add more product to her hair. For a more defined curly look I use the Itsy Bitsy Sprials moisturizer for her hair. Itsy Bitsy Spirals is made by the same company.</li>
            <li> It works very well in my 15 months old baby&#x27;s hair. However, I have been noticing that every time I put the cr&amp;egrave;me on her hair, she will start sneezing.  At first I did not thought nothing of it, but now, I know that it is the fragrance. It does smell good, but I find it kind of a strong fragrance for a product that supposes to be for babies. I think that they should improve that, God knows what side effect this might be causing babies. My baby is very healthy and she never been sick yet, plus she is a breastfeed baby; I never experiment any other baby product that had make her sneeze.</li>
            <li> Smells great! No chemicals.  Makes my daughter curly hair shine!! She is white, not mixed and it still works great!  I&#x27;m only saying that because I noticed a lot of curly baby hair products were for ethnic babies.</li>
            <li> Works great for my infant. We have been using it in her hair since she was about 3 months, and we love the look and texture of her hair after using this leave in cream. I only wish you could buy it in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Works well on my biracial baby&#x27;s hair.smells nice.</li>
            <li> We are in a hot and humid place and this makes it easy to handle my kids curly, thick hair. Tries the mixed chicks line but they dry out the scalp. So we&#x27;re staying with this line for now.</li>
            <li> I used this product in addition to the entire product line for It&#x27;s a Curl!  The next day my 6-month old daughter&#x27;s precious little head was itching, red, she had rash all around the back of her neck, head, chest.  I felt completely terrible and that it was all my fault for trying to use something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will go away, I had to get a prescription for hydrocordisone, 2.5% to help with the itch and to reduce the redness and bumps.  This is the first time that I have seen a reaction like this on her since she has been born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the ultra gentle stuff until baby is old enough to use stronger products.  I&#x27;m completely disappointed in this product!!!  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake that I made!</li>
            <li> Best stuff for infants with curly hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and curly and kind of a puff ball on its own.  This defines the curls and smooths it out.  I debated even using any product on her, but the ingredients here are all natural and it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t make her hair hard or crunchy- I&#x27;m able to just rub the excess into my hands like lotion.  A little expensive for what seems like a small bottle, but I use so little at a time that it should last for months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great when you apply it. Makes my LO curls very soft and bouncy. But I have notice it dry the back of her hair a lot quicker than just using shea butter and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> SMALL bottle but effective product</li>
            <li> My son has really curly blond hair, that gets matted when he sleeps and rubs it on his bed. I have been trying all sorts of conditioners to keep his hair tangle free and his curls curly, and this is by FAR the best leave in product. It only takes a small amount, then I can carefully untangle his hair and he&#x27;s ready to go. It&#x27;s a lot heavier than usual leave in products, so a little goes a long way. It has a nice smell too.</li>
            <li> This product is great for curly hair and only a dime size works to keep curls on the back of my child&#x27;s head moisturized.</li>
            <li> i was hoping its a curl would define my 6 month old son curls but gives his a nice scent</li>
            <li> I have this as well as the itsy bitsy spirals. I use both when I do her hair. The product has a smell but it isn&#x27;t a bad smell. Often when she is being held they love the smell of her hair. She did sneeze when I first used the product but she doesn&#x27;t anymore. She is six months and I have been using it for about two months. I liked so much I purchased it for a friend her son is a year. Her hair looks healthy and moisturized. My daughter is African American with curly hair if that helps.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff! My daughter is mixed and it&#x27;s been hard finding something that will moisturize her hair without weighing the curls down.</li>
            <li> Works very well with my sons curls, without weighing his hair down</li>
            <li> I love the product curls looks more healthy. I only wish that the effects last a bit longer. it tends to look messy after a few hours; but that could be my daughter hair. I still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner for her hair. It made her hair soft and not greasy at all. Her curls were nice and pretty. Will continue to support their brand for babies.</li>
            <li> I use this for my daughter, who is bi-racial. Not only is it a great detangler, but is smells good too.</li>
            <li> I searched and searched for something to use on my 4mo. old son (AA) with hair that was getting curlier and coarser by the week. I wanted to help keep his curls in tact and work with his natural hair pattern but didn&#x27;t want to put anything with mineral oil (like you find in baby oil), sulfates, parabens etc on his tiny little head and skin. This product has none of that icky stuff and seems gentle. I love that is is non-greasy and just gets soaked up by his hair to keep it curly and shiny and keep frizz at bay that occurs throughout the day. I apply it to wet hair after a bath or to dry and works just the same. A pea size amt is good. Sometimes I even apply it twice a day depending on our nap situation and his hair gets fluffed right back to his beautiful Afro. The smell is alright- nothing terrible but wish it was a bit milder or even had a slightly more vanilla/sweet scent or something but it is ok and I don&#x27;t find it overpowering. Definitely worth a shot if you are searching for something for thick, dry, curly baby heads that need some TLC! I only gave it four stars b/c I think the smell could be better (it is not awful) and also b/c I wish it did hold slightly better but then again I suppose I might get some of those nasty things in the product I don&#x27;t want to begin with.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without the greasy feeling. Really defines the curls and smell wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Purchased for my 4 month old son.</li>
