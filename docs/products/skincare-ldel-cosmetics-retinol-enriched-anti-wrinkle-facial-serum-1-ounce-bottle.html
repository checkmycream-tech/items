            <li>In fact we just ordered some more of this product to give to a friend.  </li>
            <li>and I have the skin of a baby now! :)</li>
            <li>It said it was going to make my skin look more youthful.</li>
            <li>I tried it last night and it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost out of this product and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>And I feel it has done the best of all products I have used for my wrinkles around my eyes especially.</li>
            <li>Allergic to this product and haven&#x27;t been able to reach the seller to see if I can return and get a refund.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>- Love it</li>
            <li>and I feel more confident.</li>
            <li>The best price on this product is at Sally Beauty supply, especially if you are a Sally discount card holder. AAAA+++++++</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Great product really works ...</li>
            <li>but I dont think I&#x27;ll be able to use this anymore.</li>
            <li>My mom has used it for years, and she looks phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I have used retinol products that seemed more concentrated.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Sure wish they&#x27;d make a hypo-allergenic version.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>you feel like something gave your face a lovely DAY AT THE SPA.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>it REALLY WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months &amp; am extremely happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced no issues and keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I have some fine lines</li>
            <li>all these months of using it, I can say that it also diminished the fine lines in the eye area and naso labial</li>
            <li>and i will continue using this fine product.....</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and fine wrinkles do disappear.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to see after a couple of weeks reduced wrinkles, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This product has retinol, an important ingredient I believe is the way to go when trying to diminish wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I am not wrinkled, but my skin is plumped up and smooth.</li>
            <li>This Retinol serum is so luxurious and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>Better spen more $$$ but on real product.</li>
            <li>this product is super light</li>
            <li>And as I said, now I have a face full of zits after 3 days of using.</li>
            <li>Light and absorbent, it really does &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; light lines and seems to rejuvenate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works great, but it doesn&#x27;t last a whole month.  </li>
            <li>received quickly and as described</li>
            <li>but, for my age, my face is still pretty wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $30</li>
            <li>I know you ladies have spent money to look young and vibrant and don&#x27;t we all want the best?</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>skin is soft and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are almost invisible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is gentle, with results!</li>
            <li>Love the feel of it on my face daily.</li>
            <li>I know some people only use retinol at night, but I feel confident in wearing this throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have oily, menopausal skin and have tried SO many different products, but this serum is Da Bomb.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and with a little added cream with sunblock on top, I&#x27;m ready to go out shopping or add makeup for a night out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more than one bottle of this serum and over long term, there is a visible difference.  </li>
            <li>My skin does look brighter and smoother, though I have experienced a few blackheads/pimples that I suspect are related to the use of retinol on my face.  </li>
            <li>I definitely have noticed a huge improvement in my skin</li>
            <li>I have yet to see any real results from any \\&quot;retin-a\\&quot; type products.  </li>
            <li>I used it morning and night, and my skin looks much healthier</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all, and I have not not noticed much of a scent at all.  </li>
            <li>This is my #1 &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; beauty product because it really works and is affordable.</li>
            <li>It has become a permanent part of my skin care, and is very beneficial to my skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>Way too much perfume.  </li>
            <li>i really couldnt believe it....</li>
            <li>be very damaging to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any change, after using whole bottle....</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so smooth the next day</li>
            <li>I live in the hot dry&lt;</li>
            <li>I will be using this line as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>It only take a couple of drops, absorbs quickly and is non greasy and provides immediate results.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to pay high prices for a product that doesn&#x27;t work - this product has 500,000 iu&#x27;s of Vitamin A.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product no matter what your age.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>researched other retinol products and finally bit the bullet to buy Dr. Brandt ($85 for 1 oz.), which has the highest retinol content for over-the-counter cream, supposedly, and honestly can&#x27;t say I am seeing a difference at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i love using it in the morning instead of a heavy lotion.</li>
            <li>The difference is discernible within a few weeks and while it is not a miracle in a bottle (nothing is, folks--we all age and wrinkle if we&#x27;re lucky), but is well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>It provides a great base for mineral makeup and gives my 58-year-old skin a smooth and dewy effect.</li>
            <li>I definitely felt my skin tighten almost immediately after the first application</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel softer and has reduced fine lines slightly</li>
            <li>I definitely see a positive difference on my face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate.</li>
            <li>I use with their night cream and skin is soft and hydrated afterwards.</li>
            <li>I also use the cleanser, day and night cream, which complete the line.</li>
            <li>Keep soft my face and neck skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minimal, though, and worth it for the skin improvements.  </li>
            <li>Non irritating and effective.</li>
            <li>I wished it had more product in the bottle and not so thick.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t realize was how dull my skin was until using this product and now my skin is full of life!</li>
            <li>first it dried out my skin a little, but after three days of use it completely cleared up my minor blemishes and gave me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>have used previously and think well worth the investment</li>
            <li>any major changes.</li>
            <li>I started using this product in the mornings to help keep my skin young and dewy considering my entire career is based on my youth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to any other wrinkle/moisturizing facial products, since this is the first one I&#x27;ve used, but I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>It certainly leaves my skin soft and clear, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is having an effect on the wrinkles on my neck (which is what I&#x27;d like).</li>
            <li>I use it every other night and highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> The difference is discernible within a few weeks and while it is not a miracle in a bottle (nothing is, folks--we all age and wrinkle if we&#x27;re lucky), but is well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> It provides a great base for mineral makeup and gives my 58-year-old skin a smooth and dewy effect.</li>
            <li> I definitely felt my skin tighten almost immediately after the first application</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel softer and has reduced fine lines slightly</li>
            <li> I definitely see a positive difference on my face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate.</li>
            <li> I use with their night cream and skin is soft and hydrated afterwards.</li>
            <li> I also use the cleanser, day and night cream, which complete the line.</li>
            <li> Keep soft my face and neck skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minimal, though, and worth it for the skin improvements.  </li>
            <li> Non irritating and effective.</li>
            <li> I wished it had more product in the bottle and not so thick.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t realize was how dull my skin was until using this product and now my skin is full of life!</li>
            <li> first it dried out my skin a little, but after three days of use it completely cleared up my minor blemishes and gave me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> have used previously and think well worth the investment</li>
            <li> any major changes.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in the mornings to help keep my skin young and dewy considering my entire career is based on my youth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to any other wrinkle/moisturizing facial products, since this is the first one I&#x27;ve used, but I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> It certainly leaves my skin soft and clear, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is having an effect on the wrinkles on my neck (which is what I&#x27;d like).</li>
            <li> I use it every other night and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> True retin-a disturbed my skin so bad that it took weeks for it to look anywhere near normal again.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times and it seems to do a pretty god job without irritating skin.</li>
            <li> I use very little moisturizer for the SPF as I live in Florida and the sun&lt;br /&gt;can</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pass, and go back to other product.</li>
            <li> my skin is dry</li>
            <li> Would never go back to the previous skin creams that I  was using before.</li>
            <li> I used it daily until it was gone and it seemed to work a little.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> This little bottle has become an essential part of my beauty regimen.  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money for this product</li>
            <li> A few drops covers your entire face.</li>
            <li> I feel i only wasted money.</li>
            <li> I really am not a person who likes to brag about beauty products.</li>
            <li> I have literally spent hundreds on &amp;#34;anti-wrinkle&amp;#34; creams, lotions, gels, etc.</li>
            <li> I am half italian/ half spanish and I am not prone to getting acne.</li>
            <li> And these other \\&quot;retinol\\&quot; products don&#x27;t deliver so for me</li>
            <li> Needs to be used with their other product line as well.</li>
            <li> I chose every other night as I didn&#x27;t want to risk redness, irritation or photo-sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The dark bottle keeps the liquid viable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on board now, but I only use it once a day because I am a delicate flower.</li>
            <li> And it has slowly diminished some wrinkles on the sides of my upper jaw that were beginning to appear.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin, but this product hasn&#x27;t been irritating at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like this serum, it absorbs quickly, is not greasy and moisturizers do well over this product.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and have been using this product, along with all other products under this brand for the past year.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive so not surprising</li>
            <li> I cant afford to waste money.</li>
            <li> For a few dollars I think this helps keep the wrinkles away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this stuff is heavily scented with some synthetic fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for a few months now - before bed and as a moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li> I will use the entire bottle and see if it was worth enduring the awful smell.</li>
            <li> It has the highest retinol of any product I have used and the over the counter have basically very little.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pointless to keep trying them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works yet, but I will take a look and see what the results are after two months use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure if I would reorder.</li>
            <li> They all have their hidden secret.</li>
            <li> Some have complained of the scent.  </li>
            <li> Give it at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Buyer be warned, this will make you sick if used for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> , This is the secret.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what the base of the product is.</li>
            <li> That is why people are getting sick after using the product.  </li>
            <li> However the side effects were terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product gives to my skin a velvet touch.I use it every night per 4 months during  the year and the and the results are very good.The quality is very good and the price is ok.</li>
            <li> Light and absorbent, it really does &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; light lines and seems to rejuvenate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it under my regular moisturizer and see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money for this product and I do not see any change - will not buy it again</li>
            <li> I used it daily until it was gone and it seemed to work a little. At times my face seemed greasy. Not sure if I would recommend this product. I myself won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It has some Retinol in the product. any major changes. NO!</li>
            <li> In fact we just ordered some more of this product to give to a friend.  Wife says this is a very fine cosmetic.</li>
            <li> I use this serum both in the morning and at night.  It leaves my skin smooth and fine wrinkles do disappear.  There is no dryness. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am 23, I am a full-time model and I am always looking for wonderful, preventative, anti-aging products. I am half italian/ half spanish and I am not prone to getting acne. I started using this product in the mornings to help keep my skin young and dewy considering my entire career is based on my youth. What I didn&#x27;t realize was how dull my skin was until using this product and now my skin is full of life! It came with a sample of the night cream and I have to be totally honest, that stuff is even better! It goes on like velvet and I have the skin of a baby now! :)</li>
            <li> It said it was going to make my skin look more youthful. Well if zits are youthful then it worked. I haven&#x27;t had pimples since I was a teenager! I like the way it made my skin feel, but the smell is gross. Smells like a placenta facial from years ago...disgusting. And as I said, now I have a face full of zits after 3 days of using.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see any real results from any \\&quot;retin-a\\&quot; type products.  True retin-a disturbed my skin so bad that it took weeks for it to look anywhere near normal again.  And these other \\&quot;retinol\\&quot; products don&#x27;t deliver so for me it&#x27;s pointless to keep trying them.  Might work for others...</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local Sally Beauty store. I was happy to see after a couple of weeks reduced wrinkles, especially around my eyes. It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs easily. I used it morning and night, and my skin looks much healthier (I&#x27;m 42). I&#x27;ve tried all the drug store brands and they don&#x27;t work or make my skin break out. This product is gentle, with results!</li>
            <li> I purchased this yesterday from Sally Beauty Supply.  I tried it last night and it worked wonderfully.  My skin is almost as it was when I was a child.  However the side effects were terrible.  I got a headache and upset stomach almost immediately.  Upon further review I discovered 500,000 IU of Vitamin A is toxic to the body.  That is why people are getting sick after using the product.  Buyer be warned, this will make you sick if used for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> The smell is offensive which is why I will not purchase again. I have been using it twice a day for a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any change. I will use the entire bottle and see if it was worth enduring the awful smell.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of it on my face daily.</li>
            <li> This product has retinol, an important ingredient I believe is the way to go when trying to diminish wrinkles. It goes on smoothly and with a little added cream with sunblock on top, I&#x27;m ready to go out shopping or add makeup for a night out. A few drops covers your entire face. I know some people only use retinol at night, but I feel confident in wearing this throughout the day. And it has slowly diminished some wrinkles on the sides of my upper jaw that were beginning to appear. I&#x27;m almost out of this product and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> Best retinol lotion available</li>
            <li> I started using this product a year ago. And I feel it has done the best of all products I have used for my wrinkles around my eyes especially. Will continute to use it with day and night moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Allergic to this product and haven&#x27;t been able to reach the seller to see if I can return and get a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works yet, but I will take a look and see what the results are after two months use.  It certainly leaves my skin soft and clear, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is having an effect on the wrinkles on my neck (which is what I&#x27;d like).</li>
            <li> I love it.  It works great, but it doesn&#x27;t last a whole month.  I wish the bottle was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference this stuff makes in my skin! - Love it</li>
            <li> I am 44.  I have minimal wrinkles, but I have developed that crepe-y look under my eyes.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how retinol would work on that, but it works great!  I try to remember to use it under my eyes every night and sometimes in the morning, and I use it on the rest of my face, too, on occasion.  My skin does look brighter and smoother, though I have experienced a few blackheads/pimples that I suspect are related to the use of retinol on my face.  It&#x27;s minimal, though, and worth it for the skin improvements.  Some have complained of the scent.  My skin is not sensitive so not surprising it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all, and I have not not noticed much of a scent at all.  I can&#x27;t compare it to any other wrinkle/moisturizing facial products, since this is the first one I&#x27;ve used, but I like it a lot.  I know I look younger and I feel more confident.</li>
            <li> I notice nothing from using this all week. I am considering returning it. I cant afford to waste money. (TjMaxx has a bunch of this brand I believe...never moves off shelf)</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. The dark bottle keeps the liquid viable. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> This is my #1 &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; beauty product because it really works and is affordable. I have oily, menopausal skin and have tried SO many different products, but this serum is Da Bomb. It only take a couple of drops, absorbs quickly and is non greasy and provides immediate results. It provides a great base for mineral makeup and gives my 58-year-old skin a smooth and dewy effect. I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate. I like to apply it on damp skin because it is easier to apply and I also use it on my neck and décolletage and the tops of my hands. The best price on this product is at Sally Beauty supply, especially if you are a Sally discount card holder. AAAA+++++++</li>
            <li> It has retinil palmitate, not retinol! So of course stuff doesnt work! I feel i only wasted money. Dont buy it. Better spen more $$$ but on real product.</li>
            <li> have used previously and think well worth the investment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! Non irritating and effective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in botox and don&#x27;t plan on cosmetic surgery.  For a few dollars I think this helps keep the wrinkles away.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use face creams, sunscreens, or avoid the sun.  Basically i do not take good care of my skin. However, i started using this about a year ago and I would say that there&#x27;s a good chance this product is doing something.  I have some fine lines but, for my age, my face is still pretty wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, not greasy, makes my face feel wonderful, this is my second bottle, I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This little bottle has become an essential part of my beauty regimen.  I use this in the morning and at night.  It has become a permanent part of my skin care, and is very beneficial to my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to pay high prices for a product that doesn&#x27;t work - this product has 500,000 iu&#x27;s of Vitamin A.  It works - I love it and I really love the under $30 price!!!</li>
            <li> Good product. It makes the skin glow and it hydrates. I wished it had more product in the bottle and not so thick.</li>
            <li> Great product really works ...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it but this stuff is heavily scented with some synthetic fragrance.  I really wanted this to work but it makes me so nauseous to put on even the smallest amount. I definitely felt my skin tighten almost immediately after the first application but I dont think I&#x27;ll be able to use this anymore.</li>
            <li> Easy to use cosmetic, works great as anti-wrinkle, my wife uses this brand for a couple of years and approved it.</li>
            <li> Its Betty DuPre and I find the product to be very good for what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Very good and it works. Lines disappear</li>
            <li> I bought this serum some months ago on amazon.de.&lt;br /&gt;at first it dried out my skin a little, but after three days of use it completely cleared up my minor blemishes and gave me a healthy glow. after a while your skin gets used to the product, and it will no longer give you dryness. the experience of dryness is also proof that the product works. you can apply a moisturizer over it and in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;after all these months of using it, I can say that it also diminished the fine lines in the eye area and naso labial fold.&lt;br /&gt;this is an intensive care serum meaning that it works within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year. I definitely see a positive difference on my face. I am not wrinkled, but my skin is plumped up and smooth.</li>
            <li> My mom has used it for years, and she looks phenomenal.  I&#x27;m on board now, but I only use it once a day because I am a delicate flower.</li>
            <li> Item was not SEALED! Who knows it could be anything in the bottle.  There was no saftey buying an item and the item not being sealed (for my protection)</li>
            <li> REALY GREAT SEE CHANGE IN 4 WEEKS</li>
            <li> It smells like Jergens moisturizer so I&#x27;m not sure what the base of the product is. I have used retinol products that seemed more concentrated. I&#x27;m just not sure if I would reorder.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times and it seems to do a pretty god job without irritating skin. I use with their night cream and skin is soft and hydrated afterwards. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I can already see a difference since I bought the product. Would never go back to the previous skin creams that I  was using before.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I am now 71 and have been using this product for almost 2 years.  Everyone comments on my skin and I am amazed by this.  It has the highest retinol of any product I have used and the over the counter have basically very little.  Needs to be used with their other product line as well.</li>
            <li> It helps with wrinkles and tone</li>
            <li> Way too much perfume.  I now have swollen eyelids b/c I am allergic.  No, I didn&#x27;t put it on my eyelids, but the proximity to my forehead was enough.  Sure wish they&#x27;d make a hypo-allergenic version.</li>
            <li> i have used creams with retinol and know it is an excellent product...i tried  the serum combined with the skin brightener and face cream which gave immediate results.......i also use this routine on my hands and much to my pleasant surprise my age spots started to fade...i really couldnt believe it....my skin is dry so i dont know how it would work on oily skin....but on my skin it worked wonders.....my skin hasnt looked this good in many years and i will continue using this fine product.....if i could only have one of the three mentioned products i would choose the retinol enriched anti wrinkle facial serum....</li>
            <li> Excellent product with visible results!</li>
            <li> I like this serum, it absorbs quickly, is not greasy and moisturizers do well over this product. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> My sister  in law introduced me to this serum 3 years ago.  I was using a facial serum by a well known cosmetic company and&lt;br /&gt;I was paying over $100 for the same size bottle as Retinol.  I found no difference in the way the serum worked.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are almost invisible.&lt;br /&gt;I also have saved money on a daily moisturizer.  I use very little moisturizer for the SPF as I live in Florida and the sun&lt;br /&gt;can be very damaging to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product no matter what your age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more than one bottle of this serum and over long term, there is a visible difference.  Lines do diminish and face appears tighter.  I also use the cleanser, day and night cream, which complete the line.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It definitely works!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any change, after using whole bottle....I&#x27;ll pass, and go back to other product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, this product line is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second bottle and have noticed a difference.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and have recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> This Retinol serum is so luxurious and smooth on the skin. you feel like something gave your face a lovely DAY AT THE SPA.  Leaves skin so smooth the next day you just can&#x27;t believe it. Very hydrating and refreshing!!! I live in the hot dry&lt;br /&gt;desert. I have used this serum for over a month and I swear......it REALLY WORKS!!!! It&#x27;s worth the $30 I know you ladies have spent money to look young and vibrant and don&#x27;t we all want the best? Well I&#x27;m telling you like you are my mom, This is the secret. don&#x27;t forget to drink lots of water and eat well. I did all that and found this amazing magical beauty serum that will take care of it all. I really am not a person who likes to brag about beauty products. They all have their hidden secret. this is one to trust. Give it at least a couple of weeks. That&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
            <li> I have this on auto delivery. Love it</li>
            <li> Keep soft my face and neck skin.  It has been a good finding for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months &amp; am extremely happy with the results so far. My completion has improved enormously &amp; I will definitely continue to use this.</li>
            <li> this product is super light and i love using it in the morning instead of a heavy lotion. I definitely have noticed a huge improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and have been using this product, along with all other products under this brand for the past year.  Almost everyone has commented on how beautiful my skin looks, and that I look like I&#x27;m in my mid-30s.  I will be using this line as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I have literally spent hundreds on &amp;#34;anti-wrinkle&amp;#34; creams, lotions, gels, etc. and nothing can compare to this product. The difference is discernible within a few weeks and while it is not a miracle in a bottle (nothing is, folks--we all age and wrinkle if we&#x27;re lucky), but is well worth the purchase price. I use it every other night and highly recommend it. I chose every other night as I didn&#x27;t want to risk redness, irritation or photo-sensitivity. I&#x27;ve experienced no issues and keep coming back for more. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this serum, goes on really nice. I think it makes my face looker brighter too!</li>
            <li> It works but you have to use it with regularity to see lasting results.  Goes on very nicely and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation.</li>
            <li> This serum rules. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for a few months now - before bed and as a moisturizer in the morning. I&#x27;m very picky about moisturizers (don&#x27;t like them greasy or \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;) and this serum is perfect. It makes my skin feel softer and has reduced fine lines slightly (I&#x27;m 24 and am targeting my forehead wrinkles). I have fairly sensitive skin, but this product hasn&#x27;t been irritating at all.&lt;br /&gt;I researched other retinol products and finally bit the bullet to buy Dr. Brandt ($85 for 1 oz.), which has the highest retinol content for over-the-counter cream, supposedly, and honestly can&#x27;t say I am seeing a difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sticking with this serum instead.</li>
            <li> received quickly and as described</li>
    </ol>
