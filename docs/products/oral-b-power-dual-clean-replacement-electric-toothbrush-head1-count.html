            <li>Excellent service</li>
            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Excellent.....and good price, too!</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>It works great for tartar control and massages your gums as you brush.</li>
            <li>Remarkable.</li>
            <li>It feels really good on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using these, my dentist&#x27;s office has been delighted.</li>
            <li>It was a good find</li>
            <li>am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The brush I use this with has been a great purchase and so far I like this head the best.</li>
            <li>I love this one!</li>
            <li>Exact replacement for my Braun Oral B battery toothbrush (which btw- is probably the best value ever in electric toothbrushes).</li>
            <li>This is for my husband&#x27;s toothbrush, these are cheap and they are great.</li>
            <li>nice brush works well</li>
            <li>Great deal ,  I liked it very much!</li>
            <li>however that the return process was VERY EASY, VERY QUICK &amp; PAINLESS!  </li>
            <li>Best replacement head so far.  </li>
            <li>Fits my Triumph Professional Series perfectly.</li>
            <li>I really like these brush heads for three reasons: they are good for teeth, good for gums, and are long-lived.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Comparing it to the precision head that came with my toothbrush (the top circular part of this brush head alone), I would prefer the precision one over this brush as this feels bulky in my mouth.</li>
            <li>A smaller version of this would be great!</li>
            <li>It wore out, I went to buy more but saw this one.</li>
            <li>I think it cleans OK, but probably will replace it soon.</li>
            <li>so I dont know if that one is any better).</li>
            <li>Buy 1 try it, if you love it buy more.</li>
            <li>The top one rotates and the bottom one moves as well.</li>
            <li>Much better than the one you receive with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It cleans teeth somehow quicker and better maybe.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this toothbrush, does the job!</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my gums around my teeth</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Better than the original ones that came with the toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The circular part is good for precision and the bottom part is good for extra brushing going around your teeth.</li>
            <li>My original brush head that came with purchase was much better.</li>
            <li>It attaches to shower head, so it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Get the most clean feel after use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another fine product from Oral-B.</li>
            <li>the item was as described and is a genuine product from braun.</li>
            <li>It is the only one I have tried with my new Oral-B toothbrush, but it is awesome.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done though and my teeth still feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>I never felt like my teeth were getting really clean.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and it was the right one!</li>
            <li>It feels like this does twice the work in the same time, which makes it more appealing, and I found it comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>But it works just great and isn&#x27;t too big and feels like it does a more thorough job of cleaning (and it covers a larger area).</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning as did the previous head.</li>
            <li>This was the first head I purchased to replace the original on my electronic brush.</li>
            <li>The double head works great for cleaning -- so much better than the single head.</li>
            <li>I prefer the floss action head better.</li>
            <li>These feel noticeably more hard/firm that my soft manual toothbrush, and I regret not being smarter about switching over to electric.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel good, plaque was much less at cleaning appt.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Unusual dual brush head, really get teeth and gums clean, also polishes teeth,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more a a personal preference that a design issue.</li>
            <li>I thought that the dual head would give me a better cleaning, but somehow it was the opposite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be aware-</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on my basic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When I found this larger head, I immediately felt like it was doing a better job.  </li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>The head works fine, the only problem is that the head is very large.</li>
            <li>(The only decent replacement head is the Precision Clean &amp; the Dual Clean).</li>
            <li>I like the size, its more the size of a conventional brush, covers more teeth at the same time</li>
            <li>How much can one say about a purely functional necessity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>very effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had better expectations,the fitting is poor and I didn&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
            <li>You might want to try the Oral B Cross Action for a more thorough cleaning</li>
            <li>This one is bigger but doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well.</li>
            <li>I have a big mouth and it still takes up a good portion of my mouth, I&#x27;ll just stick with the smaller heads next time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have a particularly &amp;#34;big mouth.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>As the naysayer said &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t fit in your mouth as well as the Single piece brushes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li>and I think it is worth the extra money to buy it again.  </li>
            <li>There may be other models it doesn&#x27;t fit as well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the &amp;#34;Oral-B Professional Floss Action&amp;#34; brush instead.  </li>
            <li>I may return to my original head due to the size of this one.</li>
            <li>They seem to last a decent amount of time, while cleaning really well.</li>
            <li>I could not angle the brush to hit my gums properly, because the head was so large.</li>
            <li>Better than those little tiny heads.  </li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t used the floss action brush head yet</li>
            <li>While it says \\&quot;Fits all Oral B Power Toothbrushes except CrossAction Power.\\&quot;, it also does not work with Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li>I usually use the regular heads but saw this and thought it sounded interesting.</li>
            <li>Was a little disappointed with the quality of the head but works great and even better than the standard head!</li>
            <li>I will try new heads in the future but this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have basic Oral-B professional toothbrushes and my husband likes the head for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>My husband felt like it was big at first, but I, with my smaller mouth than his, never felt like it was too big.  </li>
            <li>and it definitely beats the precission brush head by far</li>
            <li>I had much less bleeding at cleaning too, only at back, and I think the irrigator is responsible for that.</li>

            <li> Maybe if you have a big huge mouth it works well, but for the average person it&#x27;s very hard to navigate the insides of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> You do notice, however, how cleaner your mouth feels then with a single brush head.  </li>
            <li> However, I recently stopped because my dentist noticed gum recession (not good) and mentioned that a lot of electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t have soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> Who likes little tiny heads?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like little tiny heads.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it might be too big for my mouth</li>
            <li> At first I was afraid to open the packaging because of all those reports about brush heads having no repacement ring, having an oral-B insignia with a grey background, and made in Germany are counterfiet.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> While it is big, once you&#x27;ve had it for few days, you don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have a big mouth this may not fit.</li>
            <li> If someone has a smaller than average mouth then, or if you&#x27;re one of those people who was used to small brush heads back in the day (when you used conventional brushes), then this brush head is not for you.</li>
            <li> It may run the battery down a little faster, but that doesn&#x27;t matter when you charge regularly.</li>
            <li> The duel clean gets dirty in between the two brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Previously we had the smaller round brush head on our toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this brush head because of all the reviews that said it was big i.e hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it to people with mouths with average or &amp;#62;</li>
            <li> average size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to cancel my return request for Order #111-4959302-478203, wuith no success.  </li>
            <li> I have a big mouth and it is tough to navigate occasionaly</li>
            <li> A few times a week I go to town with this brush head.</li>
            <li> My brush head still has its shape maintained, isn&#x27;t too hard and hasn&#x27;t done anything funky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already on my second head and it is getting dirty too.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had serious issues.</li>
            <li> This is by far, the worst Oral-B replacement brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> But, eventually I opened the package, and nothing is wrong with the brush head.</li>
            <li> All those pieces of information are either false, or just one time bad experiences.</li>
            <li> It has been very difficult to find them in stores.  </li>

            <li> Works as advertised.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I love this one! It feels really good on my teeth. I use my OralB religiously, twice a day. My teeth feel good, plaque was much less at cleaning appt. I am not going to use nitrous oxide at next appt. The head I was using has an octagon shape. It wore out, I went to buy more but saw this one. I also use an irrigator called Shower Breeze. You might want to check it out. It attaches to shower head, so it is easy to use. I had much less bleeding at cleaning too, only at back, and I think the irrigator is responsible for that.</li>
            <li> Great deal ,  I liked it very much!</li>
            <li> I had a Oral-B sonic vitality before and I think it is worth the extra money to buy it again.  The duel clean gets dirty in between the two brush heads.  I&#x27;m already on my second head and it is getting dirty too.  I think it cleans OK, but probably will replace it soon.</li>
            <li> Best replacement head so far.  (The only decent replacement head is the Precision Clean &amp; the Dual Clean).</li>
            <li> the item was as described and is a genuine product from braun. Was a little disappointed with the quality of the head but works great and even better than the standard head! would buy again</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for my Braun Oral B battery toothbrush (which btw- is probably the best value ever in electric toothbrushes). In use and working perfectly. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush head for a month or two now. At first I was afraid to open the packaging because of all those reports about brush heads having no repacement ring, having an oral-B insignia with a grey background, and made in Germany are counterfiet. But, eventually I opened the package, and nothing is wrong with the brush head. It is Not a Tongue Mutilator, nor does it have out of shape bristels, not is it a counterfeit. All those pieces of information are either false, or just one time bad experiences. My brush head still has its shape maintained, isn&#x27;t too hard and hasn&#x27;t done anything funky. I like the size, its more the size of a conventional brush, covers more teeth at the same time and I just like it. If someone has a smaller than average mouth then, or if you&#x27;re one of those people who was used to small brush heads back in the day (when you used conventional brushes), then this brush head is not for you. Otherwise its a wonderful brush head and it definitely beats the precission brush head by far (I haven&#x27;t used the floss action brush head yet so I dont know if that one is any better).</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product</li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning as did the previous head. I may return to my original head due to the size of this one. As the naysayer said &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t fit in your mouth as well as the Single piece brushes&amp;#34;. I haven&#x27;t had serious issues. It&#x27;s more a a personal preference that a design issue. It works well and I recommend it to people with mouths with average or &amp;#62; average size. Buy 1 try it, if you love it buy more. The bulk pack is way Cheaper.</li>
            <li> I prefer the floss action head better. This one is bigger but doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too big...it&#x27;s the size of a medium or full-sized toothbrush head, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Product Features\\&quot; info on this item is INCORRECT! While it says \\&quot;Fits all Oral B Power Toothbrushes except CrossAction Power.\\&quot;, it also does not work with Sonic Complete.  There may be other models it doesn&#x27;t fit as well so I suggest researching this further BEFORE buying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do note however that the return process was VERY EASY, VERY QUICK &amp; PAINLESS!  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Better than those little tiny heads.  Who likes little tiny heads?  I don&#x27;t like little tiny heads.</li>
            <li> It works very well and I have not had any cavities since I started using oral b products. Seller shipped very fast. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush recently and ordered the replacement brush head from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It has 2 parts. The top one rotates and the bottom one moves as well. Cleans teeth very effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: battery operated brush.</li>
            <li> I had better expectations,the fitting is poor and I didn&#x27;t like it that much. My original brush head that came with purchase was much better.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. You might want to try the Oral B Cross Action for a more thorough cleaning</li>
            <li> This is by far, the worst Oral-B replacement brush I have ever used.  Maybe if you have a big huge mouth it works well, but for the average person it&#x27;s very hard to navigate the insides of your teeth.  Highly recommend the &amp;#34;Oral-B Professional Floss Action&amp;#34; brush instead.  It works great for tartar control and massages your gums as you brush.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this because others found the brush part too big compared to the head that came with the handle.  I don&#x27;t find that to be the case at all I don&#x27;t think I have a particularly &amp;#34;big mouth.&amp;#34;  It feels like this does twice the work in the same time, which makes it more appealing, and I found it comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Unusual dual brush head, really get teeth and gums clean, also polishes teeth,&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and it was the right one!</li>
            <li> This was the first head I purchased to replace the original on my electronic brush. I found this head to be way to bulky. I thought that the dual head would give me a better cleaning, but somehow it was the opposite. I could not angle the brush to hit my gums properly, because the head was so large. At my cleaning after I purchased this, my dentist said I had a lot of plaque build up on my back teeth. I switched to the floss head, and am very happy.</li>
            <li> nice brush works well</li>
            <li> Excellent.....and good price, too!</li>
            <li> Much better than the one you receive with the toothbrush. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this brush head because of all the reviews that said it was big i.e hard to handle.  But I took the chance bought it.  While it is big, once you&#x27;ve had it for few days, you don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s size.  You do notice, however, how cleaner your mouth feels then with a single brush head.  You get all this at an affordable price.  Remarkable.</li>
            <li> Pros: OEM. Brush head indicates when it needs to be replaced. Excellent price point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this supplier again. Excellent service</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I like it very much. It cleans teeth somehow quicker and better maybe. I highly recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this toothbrush, does the job! Medium.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using these, my dentist&#x27;s office has been delighted.</li>
            <li> I like this head a lot! It is the only one I have tried with my new Oral-B toothbrush, but it is awesome. The circular part is good for precision and the bottom part is good for extra brushing going around your teeth. I will try new heads in the future but this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware- if you don&#x27;t have a big mouth this may not fit. I have a big mouth and it is tough to navigate occasionaly so take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> We have basic Oral-B professional toothbrushes and my husband likes the head for sensitive teeth. I usually use the regular heads but saw this and thought it sounded interesting. I was a little worried that it might be too big for my mouth and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on my basic toothbrush. But it works just great and isn&#x27;t too big and feels like it does a more thorough job of cleaning (and it covers a larger area). It may run the battery down a little faster, but that doesn&#x27;t matter when you charge regularly. We share 1 charger and I don&#x27;t charge my toothbrush except every couple of weeks.  If you are in doubt, I&#x27;d try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to cancel my return request for Order #111-4959302-478203, wuith no success.  I had received this order and there,s no need to return it.</li>
            <li> A few times a week I go to town with this brush head. After 2 minutes I feel like I just got my teeth cleaned</li>
            <li> The brush I use this with has been a great purchase and so far I like this head the best. Get the most clean feel after use.</li>
            <li> I used these for my oral electric toothbrush for over 2 years.  However, I recently stopped because my dentist noticed gum recession (not good) and mentioned that a lot of electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t have soft bristles.  These feel noticeably more hard/firm that my soft manual toothbrush, and I regret not being smarter about switching over to electric.</li>
            <li> Previously we had the smaller round brush head on our toothbrushes.  I never felt like my teeth were getting really clean.  When I found this larger head, I immediately felt like it was doing a better job.  I love how it makes my gums around my teeth feel \\&quot;massaged\\&quot;.  My husband felt like it was big at first, but I, with my smaller mouth than his, never felt like it was too big.  It was a good find</li>
            <li> I really like these brush heads for three reasons: they are good for teeth, good for gums, and are long-lived.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for.  It has been very difficult to find them in stores.  The double head works great for cleaning -- so much better than the single head.</li>
            <li> Fits my Triumph Professional Series perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Exactly what it says it is.</li>
