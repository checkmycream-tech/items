            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>5 more words are required</li>
            <li>Elemis was recommended by Las Vegas spa therapist many moons ago.</li>
            <li>My friend leads an extremely healthy life style</li>
            <li>so I can say confidently that this is a quality body soak.  </li>
            <li>One soak with Elemis and I feel revived, relaxed, and completely satisfied with the cost and how well it works.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this soak on a cruise ship.  </li>
            <li>Kind of smells like medicine but is GREAT for relieving back stress.</li>
            <li>It makes the water smooth and the aroma is most pleasing.  </li>
            <li>The scent is marvelous; however, not worth the price by any means!</li>
            <li>and he  not only gagged but banned me from ever using it in HIS bathroom again - LOL.  </li>
            <li>Also note that it does say not to use if you are pregnant or nursing.</li>
            <li>When I asked about the products used, it was recommended that I purchase Elemis Aching Muscle Super Soak.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy that true spa feeling I really believe this product would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells glorious, it relaxes your muscles and it is worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>Other products by Elemis are equally good.</li>
            <li>I had a massage for the first time while on a cruise and bought this.</li>
            <li>I should of tried it on one of the cruises first.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product after a seaweed wrap on a cruise ship.</li>
            <li>Then shower, at times hitting hot water onto knees toward the end.</li>
            <li>It really helps sooth your muscles!</li>
            <li>We found this at a spa in the Bahamas years ago and still use it in our hot tub...</li>
            <li>I suffer from tense muscles and this bath soak is great.</li>
            <li>Putting some of this in a tub of hot water is really soothing.  </li>
            <li>Keep it to 3 small capfuls and you are good.</li>
            <li>this bath soak is pure luxury.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for sore muscles.</li>
            <li>but I will also rub it straight onto muscles that are sore after I shower</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li>It really does work to sooth achy muscles</li>
            <li>This product works very well for relaxing after a days work.</li>
            <li>It really helps with aching bones.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing, recommend to anyone with muscle aches and pains.</li>
            <li>and I have really noticed a difference in how relaxed I feel 30 minutes after my shower when I get into bed.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give you much in the way of bubbles or anything</li>
            <li>Great to soak in when your muscles are tired.</li>
            <li>Smells great, bubbles well and soothes those tired and sore muscles.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if it actually soothes aching muscles... but the smell alone is worth the extremely high cost.  </li>
            <li>Arrived as expected and in original sealed box</li>
            <li>Its well worth the price and lasts quite a long time at one capful per bath.</li>
            <li>I kid you not, when I am done I am able to get back to my wheelchair with no or little pain.</li>
            <li>She fills up the bath tub and soaks in this until the water gets cold and always has great soothing results.</li>
            <li>I spent much more than Amazon&#x27;s price and money well spent.</li>
            <li>The spa attendant actually suggested rubbing it into my sorest muscles before sleep/bathing which has always worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, find it very soothing whether in the shower or in the bath.  </li>
            <li>but the product sold seemed thicker than usual and did not go into solution easily when pored into the tub water.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was so highly rated, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me - no more than a hot bath with nothing added anyway.</li>
            <li>It smells ok but not great.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a special treat for hard workout days.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it&#x27;s a special treat for hard workout days.</li>
            <li> The price of it on the cruise was ridiculous, but here on Amazon very reasonable.</li>
            <li> after all theses Moons it still is soothing for 62yr old, I mean 62yr young Muscles.</li>
            <li> Surely such an expensive product could contain higher quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> The scent was so relaxing and a little went a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the cost $$$$</li>
            <li> $12.00 less than department store.</li>
            <li> I came home stiff and extremely sore.</li>
            <li> It seemed a little watered down, too.  </li>
            <li> Also it lasts a little while.</li>
            <li> love Elemis products, but this one I really hated.  </li>
            <li> And sometimes I like to add a few drops of Elemis musclease oil.</li>
            <li> We rub a small amount on my knees</li>
            <li> (you seriously feel like you are in a spa.)  </li>
            <li> This is ridiculous to count my words.  </li>
            <li> For a hard working girl this stuff is the bomb!  </li>
            <li> Terribly expensive, but it is something I splurge on.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t send me anymore of these silly things.</li>
            <li> It was way too expensive for what I got.  </li>
            <li> My husband delivers appliances all day and is very tired when he gets home.</li>
            <li> This comes out in globs of green swamp crap and smells like swamp crap.  </li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> And I was disappointed that it contained SLS.</li>
            <li> I get terrible migraines.  </li>
            <li> the product was horrible.  </li>

            <li> This spa product is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and in original sealed box</li>
            <li> Excellent as always. Total enjoyment.</li>
            <li> I suffer from tense muscles and this bath soak is great.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! LOVE THIS! LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff and swears by it!!!!</li>
            <li> I had a massage for the first time while on a cruise and bought this. It helps me to relax and foams well in the tub. Just ordered another bottle through Amazon and glad I found it. The price of it on the cruise was ridiculous, but here on Amazon very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Discovered this product while getting a massage on a cruise.  There are no words to describe how great this product is. You can use it as a pre shower/bath lotion, a shower gel or bath soak. If you have muscles that can not get relief.... Use This Product!</li>
            <li> great product works well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It works very well for sore muscles. I use this for soaking but I will also rub it straight onto muscles that are sore after I shower and it provides a lot of relief throughout the day. This is great to rub on your backs and calfs before flying too. You really don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. Keep it to 3 small capfuls and you are good. Also note that it does say not to use if you are pregnant or nursing. I got this for my wife and myself but then realized she couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Terribly expensive, but it is something I splurge on.  It really does work to sooth achy muscles and I like the eucalyptus fragrance.</li>
            <li> This comes out in globs of green swamp crap and smells like swamp crap.  My husband came into the bathroom while I was bathing with this and he  not only gagged but banned me from ever using it in HIS bathroom again - LOL.  Like it is HIS bathroom....  As for muscle soothing - I have no idea.  I threw it out actually - it was that gross.  I will stick with my Verbana from Loccitaine.&lt;br /&gt;Usually love Elemis products, but this one I really hated.  I should of tried it on one of the cruises first.  My bad.</li>
            <li> Got this on a cruise and I love it.  The spa attendant actually suggested rubbing it into my sorest muscles before sleep/bathing which has always worked well for me.  I love the way it smells too, juniper being the strongest scent in my opinion so guys can use it without feeling like a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use after my post workout shower and it helps prevent later soreness.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for relaxing after a days work. It really helps with aching bones.Its well worth the price and lasts quite a long time at one capful per bath. I use it every evening.</li>
            <li> The aroma sets the atmosphere. While soaking you can feel your body relaxing. This is the next best thing to having a massage.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this product for bath soaks after working out.  It is an excellent product that has a great sauna smell.</li>
            <li> We use Elmis to enhance our spa.  It makes the water smooth and the aroma is most pleasing.  This product was recommended to us while on a cruise.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, find it very soothing whether in the shower or in the bath.  Very relaxing, recommend to anyone with muscle aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Great price point. $12.00 less than department store.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product except the price. Think it is way too costly  and don&#x27;t understand why. Relaxing in the tub has never been so great, nor so healing.</li>
            <li> I get terrible migraines.  Putting some of this in a tub of hot water is really soothing.  I helps relax me until the medication starts to work.</li>
            <li> I have lupus &amp; fibro and this soak is a god send for my muscles. After I recommend applying the musclease oil</li>
            <li> I love the Elemis products. They are extremely effective. I haven&#x27;t used a product that I haven&#x27;t added to my permanent selection of body care at home.</li>
            <li> This product is great both at a foot soak and as a shower wash.  It soothes and cleans and foams and feels wonderful and relaxes your muscles.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best smelling soak i&#x27;ve ever used.  (you seriously feel like you are in a spa.)  i don&#x27;t know if it actually soothes aching muscles... but the smell alone is worth the extremely high cost.  it&#x27;s a special treat for hard workout days.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were introduced to this product during our couples massage on Carnival Cruise in 2012. My husband delivers appliances all day and is very tired when he gets home. He heads for the bath and feels so relaxed and refreshed when he comes out. The aroma from the product is so relaxing. He has not went without it since the cruise. If you enjoy that true spa feeling I really believe this product would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sondra &amp; Jimmie</li>
            <li> I first used this product after a seaweed wrap on a cruise ship. The scent was so relaxing and a little went a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on my 2nd purchase at home and I have really noticed a difference in how relaxed I feel 30 minutes after my shower when I get into bed.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, easing and smells GREAT!  Looks good on bathtub.  Lovely color.  Great Bathroom accent. This is ridiculous to count my words.  Don&#x27;t send me anymore of these silly things.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  I recently purchased two of these from Timetospa...the product was horrible.  The company told me they had to change the formula on the product...I will not be buying in the future.</li>
            <li> this bath soak is pure luxury.  It soothes the muscles and relaxes the emotions.  It has a lovely scent as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was so highly rated, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me - no more than a hot bath with nothing added anyway. And I was disappointed that it contained SLS. Surely such an expensive product could contain higher quality ingredients. I get much better results putting epsom salts in my bath. And sometimes I like to add a few drops of Elemis musclease oil. Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I have osteoarthritis in both knees. I have a lot of pain getting to the shower and need help. We rub a small amount on my knees let it sit a bit. 10 min if you can. Then shower, at times hitting hot water onto knees toward the end. I kid you not, when I am done I am able to get back to my wheelchair with no or little pain. Also it lasts a little while. My knees feel cradle in warm goodness. Love it.</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like medicine but is GREAT for relieving back stress. I highly recommend.  5 more words are required</li>
            <li> Elemis was recommended by Las Vegas spa therapist many moons ago. It was great. after all theses Moons it still is soothing for 62yr old, I mean 62yr young Muscles.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love the smell and the way it relieves my aches and pains!</li>
            <li> Works well at relaxing sore muscles and the aroma relaxes my mind.  Great product!</li>
            <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.  It smells ok but not great.  Doesn&#x27;t give you much in the way of bubbles or anything but then again it&#x27;s not bubble bath.  Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my aching muscles.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> It was way too expensive for what I got.  It seemed a little watered down, too.  The scent is marvelous; however, not worth the price by any means!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and liked it but the product sold seemed thicker than usual and did not go into solution easily when pored into the tub water.</li>
            <li> This was a gift at my friend&#x27;s request.  She has had several knee surgeries and some neck problems and loves this product.  She fills up the bath tub and soaks in this until the water gets cold and always has great soothing results. My friend leads an extremely healthy life style so I can say confidently that this is a quality body soak.  It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this while away on a cruise, along with attending the Body Sculpt Boot Camp. I came home stiff and extremely sore. One soak with Elemis and I feel revived, relaxed, and completely satisfied with the cost and how well it works. I spent much more than Amazon&#x27;s price and money well spent.</li>
            <li> Great to soak in when your muscles are tired. It has a wonderful smell. I fell in love with this soak on a cruise ship.  Other products by Elemis are equally good.</li>
            <li> I had a message on a cruise.  When I asked about the products used, it was recommended that I purchase Elemis Aching Muscle Super Soak.  I purchased on board ship, used it at home and loved it.  It smells glorious, it relaxes your muscles and it is worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> For a hard working girl this stuff is the bomb!  Smells great, bubbles well and soothes those tired and sore muscles.  my only complaint is the cost $$$$</li>
            <li> I knew Amazon carried this product so I ordered a bottle for my Mother in Law who uses it in her walk -in tub! It really helps sooth your muscles!</li>
            <li> We found this at a spa in the Bahamas years ago and still use it in our hot tub...so soothing and relaxing.</li>
