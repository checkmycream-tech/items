    <ol>
            <li>This is great stuff!!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results and the ease of use.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s that good!  </li>
            <li>On top of it I got a great value in this purchase.</li>
            <li>with my hair dye and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I mix my own color and color my hair a reddish brown.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>so I figured with this &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;  on a foam coloring brand I liked (Korean)</li>
            <li>So I decided to do some research on mixing my own hair dye and came across Gray Magic as an additive for stubborn gray hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it will work better on another line.</li>
            <li>Gray Magic, the brown dye winds up a bit thinner and lighter on my roots,</li>
            <li>With Gray Magic, my hair color is much more uniform.</li>
            <li>Did not help to color my gray/white hairs any better than if I used just the color on</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t add Gray Magic , those areas need coloring after a couple shampooing.</li>
            <li>ok we&#x27;re at that age......</li>
            <li>before that gave me a nice tone and color, light cool brown</li>
            <li>Gray Magic is such a great product.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It makes you hair color cover gray better and keeps the color true.  </li>
            <li>It is awesome, better than another brand I used for yrs that was not doing much (the one that came in little ketchup like one use  pouches)..</li>
            <li>Gray Magic absolutely works for me.</li>
            <li>Now I am no longer confined to one brand and have the option of choosing whatever shade cause this thing &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34; is true to the name.</li>
            <li>This product does turn the mixture a funky orange-ish color but the end result is always normal just as I colored it before using Gray Magic, so</li>
            <li>Also liked the new concept of foam coloring and those were never as good as this unbelievable cheap Revlon</li>
            <li>Wonderful product and does exactly what it claims to do; I added it to my hair color and no more gray!</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth a try if you find that your color isn&#x27;t covering as well as you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any issues with my color turning out funny.</li>
            <li>Would not be without this product, gray hair is so stubron to holding color, that where the magic happens makes your color last longer even that tuff gray hair.</li>
            <li>It also goes a long way as there are many applications in the bottle.</li>
            <li>This did not work very well using Matrix SoColor line.</li>
            <li>Worked really well on my medium/dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>This really works to help with those grey/ white areas around the temples that just don&#x27;t take the hair color as they should.</li>
            <li>and it turned very reddish  (not orange... RED)</li>
            <li>With Grey Magic it stays true to color for at least a month!!</li>
            <li>I got compliments on my new red color..</li>
            <li>After reading the comments about this brand and seeing that you get a bottle that really lasts for several uses I wanted to give it a try.. if you follow the directions 10 drops per ounce (so count the total Ounces of the colorant and activator x10).</li>
            <li>But I hated being restricted to ash light brown from Revlon when I like to try other  shades  and brands that gave me beautiful shades and color dimensions.</li>

            <li> nothing worked on them except Revlon coloring (yes the cheapest home kit coloring) which surpassed all other more expensive brands I tried including a salon brand I used to get on line  .</li>

            <li> I gave it a 4 star rating because it is messy.</li>
            <li> I washed off after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> So perhaps keeping it longer to tackle the resistant grays was unnecessary and can turn the color to red like that ..</li>
            <li> When I decided to color my hair the next day, I kept looking at that orange in the container and was afraid to use it.  </li>
            <li> I have very few resistant wire like grays that stick out annoyingly ..</li>
            <li> Bought this based on others&#x27; feedback and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Box hair colors stopped working for me and the gray coverage is awful.  </li>

            <li> This did not work very well using Matrix SoColor line. Maybe it will work better on another line.</li>
            <li> Worked really well on my medium/dark brown hair. I&#x27;ve used it with color by eSalon, and AgeBeautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without Gray Magic, the brown dye winds up a bit thinner and lighter on my roots, so basically I always have visible (even if only to me) roots. With Gray Magic, my hair color is much more uniform.</li>
            <li> Gray Magic absolutely works for me. I purchased this at Sally Beauty after complaining about permanent color not lasting on my paper white roots. I mix my own color and color my hair a reddish brown. This product does turn the mixture a funky orange-ish color but the end result is always normal just as I colored it before using Gray Magic, so I&#x27;ve never had any issues with my color turning out funny. This is definitely worth a try if you find that your color isn&#x27;t covering as well as you&#x27;d like. You can mix this with box color if that&#x27;s your preferred method of coloring.</li>
            <li> Gray Magic is such a great product. On top of it I got a great value in this purchase. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!!  It makes you hair color cover gray better and keeps the color true.  I wouldn&#x27;t bother coloring my gray roots without it, it&#x27;s that good!  You only use 10 drops per ounce of developer, so a little bottle lasts for MONTHS!  Easy to use.  Worth the extra money.  If you color to cover gray, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on others&#x27; feedback and was disappointed.  Did not help to color my gray/white hairs any better than if I used just the color on it&#x27;s own.  Followed instructions to the tee.  Wish I could return...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gray you need this i will not dye my hair without it</li>
            <li> This really works to help with those grey/ white areas around the temples that just don&#x27;t take the hair color as they should. I add about 10 drops to my hair color mixture. I color about every 3 weeks. If I don&#x27;t add Gray Magic , those areas need coloring after a couple shampooing. I gave it a 4 star rating because it is messy. Just wear gloves.</li>
            <li> I have gray hair and the home coloring kits were not working at all.  Adding the recommended number of drops to the solution made all the difference.  I finally get the color that I wanted.  I am very happy with the results and the ease of use.  It also goes a long way as there are many applications in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Would not be without this product, gray hair is so stubron to holding color, that where the magic happens makes your color last longer even that tuff gray hair.</li>
            <li> ok we&#x27;re at that age......</li>
            <li> I tried a test sample for a few minutes but was afraid of the orange color for my light blonde color.  I washed off after a few minutes.  When I decided to color my hair the next day, I kept looking at that orange in the container and was afraid to use it.  The pre-test did nothing to the gray around my temples.  After reading some of the negative reviews of what it does with blonde color, I definitely decided against using it and believe I diverted a disaster.</li>
            <li> My hair color that I do myself or by my hairdresser will start to fade after 1 week....With Grey Magic it stays true to color for at least a month!! I use 5 drops per ounce of color mixed in the bottle. I won&#x27;t color my hair without it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and does exactly what it claims to do; I added it to my hair color and no more gray!</li>
            <li> It is awesome, better than another brand I used for yrs that was not doing much (the one that came in little ketchup like one use  pouches).. After reading the comments about this brand and seeing that you get a bottle that really lasts for several uses I wanted to give it a try.. if you follow the directions 10 drops per ounce (so count the total Ounces of the colorant and activator x10). I have very few resistant wire like grays that stick out annoyingly .. nothing worked on them except Revlon coloring (yes the cheapest home kit coloring) which surpassed all other more expensive brands I tried including a salon brand I used to get on line  . But I hated being restricted to ash light brown from Revlon when I like to try other  shades  and brands that gave me beautiful shades and color dimensions. Also liked the new concept of foam coloring and those were never as good as this unbelievable cheap Revlon ..&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I used to keep the revlon on for 1 hour.. so I figured with this &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;  on a foam coloring brand I liked (Korean) before that gave me a nice tone and color, light cool brown and it turned very reddish  (not orange... RED).. I got compliments on my new red color.. had zero grays, but still .. RED which does not work on my complexion well.. However, simple fix: add &amp;#34;UNRED&amp;#34; to your colorant and it will kill any reddish or brassy tones..  Now I am no longer confined to one brand and have the option of choosing whatever shade cause this thing &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34; is true to the name. ..Also I read that the gray color additives intensify the color and speed up the coloring process .. So perhaps keeping it longer to tackle the resistant grays was unnecessary and can turn the color to red like that .. Great product!</li>
            <li> Box hair colors stopped working for me and the gray coverage is awful.  So I decided to do some research on mixing my own hair dye and came across Gray Magic as an additive for stubborn gray hair.  I use 10 drops (very short hair) with my hair dye and the difference is amazing.  This product works.</li>
