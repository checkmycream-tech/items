            <li>Great mascara</li>
            <li>This one would&#x27;ve been great in the 80s when we had not choices.</li>
            <li>Let the supermodels keep Maybelline Great Lash.  </li>
            <li>This is a great every day mascara for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and the price here is great</li>
            <li>Toner (I use witch hazel) on a cotton pad works well for me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great, great mascara.</li>
            <li>Great mascara.</li>
            <li>Gives great definition, length, and fullness.</li>
            <li>Great waterproof mascara at a great price.</li>
            <li>I love it!!  </li>
            <li>It is better than any I&#x27;ve tried and Amazon has it for a great price!</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t worry about getting it off because it came off so nicely with a makeup remover!</li>
            <li>love it waterproof is the best.</li>
            <li>But honestly, nothing is ever has good at my Maybelline!</li>
            <li>My fave mascara (Avon SuperFull) got discontinued, so I decided to try this since it got some good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This one is so good.</li>
            <li>the color and texture looks good on me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this has good reviews, but I bought it based on the rating</li>
            <li>good mascara</li>
            <li>search for good mascara continues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as good as EL.</li>
            <li>but it still looks good.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, I love it!!</li>
            <li>Goes on beautifully, and even though it has a lot of staying power, you can remove it easily.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE this mascara!  </li>
            <li>Love this line!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>This mascara lives up to everything it promises and more!</li>
            <li>and it is great as it does not clump easily</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Well, it does feel nice on, not clumpy or waxy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>but let&#x27;s be honest; why go through the effort of curling your lashes and adding mascara if it does nothing to enhance them?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>Every time I try another brand or kind</li>
            <li>and I liked the price, but it took 2 weeks to arrive instead of the promised 4 days.  </li>
            <li>Was thrilled to see I could purchase by  a subscription service every 2 months via Amazon.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super waterproof like some mascaras still look great after being in the shower or swimming, this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Quite good for a cheap mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have allergy eyes and there are many times when any kind of fan on me makes my eyes water.</li>
            <li>The best and most natural mascara.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave clumps and is very light.</li>
            <li>This mascara is OK, it is very smooth as the name says.</li>
            <li>Currently my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Stays all day, doesn&#x27;t clump AT ALL, just all-around great,</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Most mascaras</li>
            <li>I just want to coat them so they are more visible all the way to the tip.  </li>
            <li>Most mascaras are too clumpy for my eyelashes</li>
            <li>I had to use a lot more than two or three strokes.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite ever mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve repurchased it many times.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>For enhanced and longer lashes with more definitions, that still looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t Say how many tubes of this I went through.</li>
            <li>and I love the brushy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t irritate and it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>ok, swipe, swipe, swipe again.  </li>
            <li>Let me swipe some more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Nothing&#x27;s better no matter the cost.</li>
            <li>As most women know not every mascara out there is going to work for them.</li>
            <li>So it is smudging from the top.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many mascaras over my life.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>and I love that I have it as part of my Amazon auto delivery</li>
            <li>/&gt;The waterproof aspect of this my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s worth it for how gorgeous my lashes look.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara in the world.  </li>
            <li>Spend the extra fifty cents and have a happy wife!</li>
            <li>love this brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything better.</li>
            <li>Do not recommend when there are better waterproof mascaras out there.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look fantastic!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because most of he reviews said that it didn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li>But if you get teary eyes throughout the day it is still okay.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Found this product on a product review website where it ranked in the top five mascaras ...</li>
            <li>Great for a drug store mascara, very light and natural would buy again!</li>
            <li>This mascara is unexpectedly pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best mascaras I have found in a long while.</li>
            <li>This mascara gives me beautiful, soft lashes without smudging or clumping.</li>
            <li>And, best of all, it still looked freshly applied and natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found this mascara available with subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, basic, clean mascara!  </li>
            <li>It is waterproof, easy to apply and makes my lashes thicker without looking gooey or stuck together.</li>
            <li>its easy to remove with baby oil</li>
            <li>This mascara is easy to remove and I have not had any issues with my lashes breaking or falling out.</li>
            <li>A swipe with a tissue or a napkin or even a finger will easily remove the offending smudged mascara.  </li>
            <li>comes off easily with an oil based makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Easy to layer and reapply.</li>
            <li>Comes off easy with baby oil.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s easy to wipe off.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with waterproof mascara remover (I use Almay Longwear &amp; Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover Pads).</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and stays on throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>If I accidentally get some on my eye lid, it comes off easily before it sets up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be able to wear mascara until I found Maybelline&#x27;s Full</li>
            <li>and I decided that it wasn&#x27;t worth paying the higher price when this one is just as good.  </li>
            <li>word of advice:  make sure you have a good remover like Almay pads on hand as Full &#x27;N Soft has staying power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have very oily skin, in 3-4 hours I&#x27;d probably be able to fry my face in a pan, so having waterproof and smudgeproof mascara was very important in my mascara hunt.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this mascara, and I am super pleased!</li>
            <li>The brush  smears on my eyelids (huge pet peeve)</li>
            <li>with a great application brush that covers well without fuss and multiple applications.</li>
            <li>It gives you clump free lashes every time.</li>
            <li>on smooth, no clumping&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my everyday needs.</li>
            <li>So far waterproof part seems to be good, not ine of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Soft and natural looking and perfect for summer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and I have already ordered more!</li>
            <li>The price point is excellent, especially while on sale, and works so much better than some (most, to be honest) of the higher end mascaras I typically use.</li>
            <li>I like the fluffier, more natural look of mascara compared to more trendy giant clumpy effect that seems to be popular.</li>
            <li>No other mascara at any price point has ever made my lashes look so good.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it came.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara by far for many years--</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to make a special trip, so I ordered online.  </li>
            <li>It will look very nice if you have the time apply let it dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, waterproof, but comes off easily with make-up remover, so not irritating to your eyes.</li>
            <li>Good enough.</li>
            <li>this is tried and true.  </li>
            <li>I like the wand brush, it makes my lashes look full and</li>
            <li>I like the Full</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Maybelline Full</li>
            <li>I have tried so many mascaras in my 50+ years and always go back to Great Lash or Full &#x27;n Soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Always satisfied with my soft and full eyelashes!</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara, thanks for shipping so quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to get the same results that so many who love this product do.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite mascara, it&#x27;s cheap and works well.</li>
            <li>was quick too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be loyal to this brand for years to come...</li>
            <li>The positive side is that it wipes off REALLY easily.  </li>
            <li>Full N Soft simply has everything needed; goes on nicely, stays on in water, looks nice.</li>
            <li>For lower lashes, I like their Lash Discovery for daytime or work, and use Full &#x27;N Soft for more glam at night or for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara very often, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on one, so the relatively low price of Maybelline&#x27;s Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara -- as compared to department store brands -- made this product even more attractive to me.</li>
            <li>If you have naturally long and curled lashes this would be a gorgeous mascara - just one coat lengthens</li>
            <li>even on super hot and humid summer days that include swimming!  </li>
            <li>I love getting new mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to even higher end mascaras!</li>
            <li>I have used Maybelline waterproof great lash for years and recently decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li>I recommend to people that want a more natural look and doesn&#x27;t have a super oily face.</li>
            <li>but my lashes look natural with lots of length and okay volume.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the hassle of smudging.  </li>
            <li>Have this on autoship each month to make sure I&#x27;m switching to a fresh tube frequently</li>
            <li>&#x27;N Soft better than Maybelline&#x27;s Define-A-Lash or Volum&#x27; Express.  </li>
            <li>however at the end of the day, it is smudged on the bottom of my eye, and I rarely coat the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>My lashes stay silky looking and fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>&#x27;N Soft is my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>wand is large compared to other maybelline mascaras like Great Lash.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came in brown, instead of just black and more black, but I&#x27;m very happy with the way it applies.</li>
            <li>super fast shipment!</li>
            <li>Some reviewers are right.</li>
            <li>You get nice long and tons of lashes with this product..</li>
            <li>It looks good, definitely there but in a natural way.  </li>
            <li>the waterproof version of definicils got really clumpy really quick for me).</li>
            <li>Keeps the curl in my lashes after I curl them as they are super straight.</li>
            <li>The mascara arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>This is a decent mascara if you like the more natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I like this because it has an actual brush NOT made out of plastic, like most of the newer mascaras out there.  </li>
            <li>Although everyone says their product won&#x27;t clump or flake, at 73 years of age I have tried many different brands  </li>
            <li>Needs MANY layers to get the look I desire and can get from one coat of my regular non waterproof brand.</li>
            <li>I use this mascara in regular and waterproof and I absolutely love them both.</li>
            <li>Overall this is okay for a couple hours of wearing, but if you&#x27;re looking for all day wear without the smudging and flaking</li>
            <li>just cause it was so great for thick doll lashes when I layer the mascara.</li>
            <li>It really is waterproof and lasts, even when I ran a 5K and swim with it!</li>
            <li>The regular brush style also helps make sure my lashes stay separated and not clumped together.</li>
            <li>Although I loved this at first, I started to notice fallout after a few times wearing it, to the point that my eyes started burning.</li>
            <li>definitely takes more than soap and water to remove</li>
            <li>This mascara is exactly as marketed.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mascara for the last decade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many brands in between and ALWAYS come back to this.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to wipe the wand off on the edges of the container before using it for the first week.  </li>
            <li>Of all the mascaras I have tried, and I have tried many, this is the one that I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li>But ordering it through the mail was very dissappointing!</li>
            <li>As a triathlete and avid swimmer, I need a waterproof mascara that I can rely on.</li>
            <li>I first gave it the shower test and found that it stayed put, no smearing or raccoon eyes</li>
            <li>I think it is mainly because I have a super oily face.</li>
            <li>I have to really work to take it off!  </li>
            <li>and from the second you open it, it&#x27;s the perfect texture...not super wet and clumpy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll take Full &#x27;N Soft!  </li>
            <li>and although some of the expensive ones are better, I found that this one was also just as good</li>
            <li>This Full N Soft, however, does exactly what the name says.</li>
            <li>It just gives your lashed such a nice and natural look and feel.</li>
            <li>Yes, this technically defeats the purpose of waterproof, but I really use the waterproof more to hold the curl in my lashes than purely for its waterproofness.</li>
            <li>that it gets very clumpy unless I first blot it with a tissue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cried with it many times and as long as I dab instead of wiping, it stays put.</li>
            <li>this mascara makes my lashes soft and full.</li>
            <li>After a full day or evening of wear, it usually up completely under my eyes, even if there wasn&#x27;t the slightest bit of moisture in the air</li>
            <li>It has to be the waterproof Full and Soft-</li>
            <li>Otherwise I would give Full &#x27;N Soft a 5.</li>
            <li>Co-workers always wondered how my makeup stayed perfect throughout the day (other female lifeguards would look like raccoons midway through the day), even though I was under water for a good portion of the day because I was usually on the rotation of lifeguarding in the wave pool, so I got smacked in the face with a huge wall of water every few minutes.</li>
            <li>Even though mines are very long and we&#x27;ll shaped I had to apply like 4 coats to make them look fuller and more noticeable.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara because it doesn&#x27;t flake or become dry on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>so to find a soft, waterproof mascara that really does &#x27;full out the funning&#x27;...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s short and has long bristles and does a good job of separating all of my lashes.</li>
            <li>The wand was slightly large, so the lashes would end up on my eyelids when I was applying on my lashes.</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of mascaras from pricey ones through Clinique, DHC, and Estee Lauder to really cheap ones, but I keep coming back to the Full N Soft Mascara from Maybelline.</li>
            <li>Not dramatic or super lengthening but definitely my favorite for an everyday mascara.</li>
            <li>Your lashes stay super soft but it really does need some improvement in the thickening department.</li>
            <li>I have trouble finding this line in most stores like CVS, Walgreens and Wal-Mart as I think it sells out quickly.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to wash off, yet holds very well due to being waterproof.</li>
            <li>I run the brush end under very hot water to clean it out, dry thoroughly with a tissue and then use.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the way this applies and</li>
            <li>I do have short lashes so they don&#x27;t stand out that much with this stuff, but it&#x27;s definitely a great everyday mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my go to mascara.</li>
            <li>I have stick straight lashes that will not hold a curl unless I use a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>You can really build up your lashes without it clumping</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it to you</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look much thicker.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length, straight eyelashes</li>
            <li>so this really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>No clumping, no stiffness, no flaking, no fibers, and really waterproof (not \\&quot;washable\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>For me, it comes off in the shower if I gently wash my eyes with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Products say they are waterproof but this mascara really is.</li>
            <li>since EL tends to have too much on the wand - the mouth of their bottles needs to be tighter, like this one.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really notice any added fullness to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>( Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes the product</li>
            <li>and I feel like a coat my lashes really well</li>
            <li>It is waterproof while swimming and out in intense heat.</li>
            <li>This product washes off easier than many other waterproof mascaras, but does hold up well though the day.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Full &amp; Soft line - looks natural but with the waterproof version, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.</li>
            <li>I love the other maybeline brands I&#x27;ve tried so</li>
            <li>This one is nothing particularly special but it gets the job done, has a standard brush and doesn&#x27;t smudge too much unless you rub your eyes</li>
            <li>It leaves my lashes full and feeling natural (not stiff).</li>
            <li>Also, the brushes bristles are long and sparse so frequently go between the lashes and deposit mascara on the top and bottom</li>
            <li>the right amount comes out of the bottle top (neck is sized small so &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; the wand as it exits)&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re pretty much clear, so I just want a mascara to make my lashes darker but not to thicken or lengthen.</li>
            <li>and I love the dark color</li>
            <li>The length it gives (as other reviews have stated) is very natural which is my favorite part about it.</li>
            <li>It gives a very full and natural look without looking dry or flaky.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>have always used Estee Lauder but a friend highly recommended this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Formula is smooth and easy to apply, the brush is large, but not enough to be a problem to get into the corners of small eyes.</li>
            <li>Once I get through all of these other mascaras that I have laying around (most of them were free), I&#x27;ll get back to using this one regularly when I can find it again!!!</li>
            <li>It is easy, reliable, and doesn&#x27;t clump my eye lashes together like some other brands.  </li>
            <li>This is my holy grail mascara, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it for a few years.</li>
            <li>I have tried others, as I like to try new items, but always come back to Full &amp;#34;N Soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on all the latest \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li>I have used better mascaras at this price point that do not leave splotchy black marks around my eyes (for example, sweating at the gym, not removing completely at night).</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes long, full, not clumpy and soft!</li>
            <li>I put one coat on and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes super volumizing or long</li>
            <li>I can wear it all day and if it is hot outside or the humidity is high</li>
            <li>It is almost like having a new product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in the market for a new mascara</li>
            <li>No stiff,  gobbed up lashes here!  </li>
            <li>but they are such a light blonde</li>
            <li>This mascara is for someone who wants to look natural and when I say natural like if you just didn&#x27;t even put mascara on.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my lashes look very natural and it stays all day.</li>
            <li>This a very natural looking mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking.</li>
            <li>A very natural looking mascara</li>
            <li>It has a very natural look.</li>
            <li>I have been blessed with fairly long lashes and love the dry formula of this mascara.</li>
            <li>I have occasionally tried something different and end up throwing it away and buying Full &#x27;N Soft again!!</li>
            <li>I keep coming back to this product, despite trying many other types of waterproof mascara over the years.  </li>
            <li>I curl my lashes, then apply this mascara as a first coat to hold the curl, then use a different drugstore mascara to add volume and length.</li>
            <li>Just be prepared for frequent checks in the mirror for smudging!</li>
            <li>I think I will be sticking to this mascara for quite a while, especially during this hot humid summer.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara - hard to find the waterproof version in stores - doesn&#x27;t make lashes clump and keeps them from feeling brittle</li>
            <li>I do think this mascara stays on a LITTLE better than a non-waterproof type, and it seriously comes off so easily that for me</li>
            <li>Plus, my lashes look longer and thicker while still feeling natural.  </li>
            <li>I do have to put on several coats to really see the difference, but that may be my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It darkens my lashes leaving them soft and not all clumped together.</li>
            <li>It is soft and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency, not too sticky, not too soft, doesn&#x27;t run, and no globs.  </li>
            <li>My go-to for a natural look that holds a curl.</li>
            <li>and I have extremely sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only issue with it is that the brush scoops out so much mascara</li>
            <li>It is waterproof and my lashes stayed soft.</li>
            <li>I recently cried my way through an important family event and, at the end of the day, this mascara was the only cosmetic left on my face.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>It is natural looking while adding length and volume without the crusty clumping and sticking the eyelashes together.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s why it s so soft.</li>
            <li>This mascara never clumped and it looked natural.</li>
            <li>like it&#x27;s old.</li>
            <li>This one gives me good coverage without looking too fake.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump, but better for a feather look than a thick look.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying from Amazon and it was MUCH cheaper than in the store by almost half and shipping</li>
            <li>This mascara makes my eyelashes look long, thick, and lovely!</li>
            <li>When applied the color is fine, not as bold as some of my dark mascaras, but dark enough.</li>
            <li>They look natural and usually the formula is smooth and does not clump.</li>
            <li>I TRY OTHER BRANDS AND ALWAYS COME BACK TO FULL AND SOFT.</li>
            <li>When I was wearing this, people always asked me if my eyelashes were really that long</li>
            <li>The tube is long but doesn&#x27;t seem like it contains that much product in it.</li>
            <li>My lashes are already long, so products that are lengthening usually look way over the top on me.  </li>
            <li>My lashes feel soft, they look full, and  they don&#x27;t feel hard and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this based on title &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, only the soft part delivered.  </li>
            <li>This mascara leaves lashes soooo soft and lengthens with only 1 coat, no flaking or smudging.</li>
            <li>The mascara is good but for some reason it stinks.</li>
            <li>It gives a full and natural look as the product is not too thick.</li>
            <li>The full brush gets every lash and the formula allows to for multiple coats without getting stiff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much easier compared to my other waterproofs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using up all of the other crappy mascara that I have laying around, so I haven&#x27;t been on a real hunt for this stuff...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty thin and light, so it&#x27;s got a naked feel and look to it, but it&#x27;s also thin and light, and has a naked feel to it.</li>
            <li>If you want something more dramatic this probably won&#x27;t do it for you, but for an every day look this works.</li>
            <li>It can be layered on for a more dramatic look or just a coat or two for daytime wear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a whole world of mascara now that lengthens and voluminizes with a few coats that also doesn&#x27;t irritate, smear or wear off and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>It is long lasting, it never clumps, and my lashes are left looking soft and natural.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as thick as expected.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a lot softer than other mascaras and isn&#x27;t a really liquidy formula.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have natural long eyelashes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very volumizing but provides a nice look that&#x27;s not too dramatic.</li>
            <li>I really want big lash like extensions, but I still use this one on my bottom lashes on those days, as well as all of the other days I do not have extra time to use fibers.</li>
            <li>Although the results aren&#x27;t super, super dramatic, I will be wearing this as an everyday mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara is little bit hard to take off but after trying many mascaras I am sticking to it.</li>
            <li>Thick, full, dark lashes, that are soft, not brittle!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live someplace humid like some of the other reviewers, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it running.</li>

            <li> Let the supermodels keep Maybelline Great Lash.  </li>
            <li> This is a great every day mascara for me.</li>

            <li> I love it!!  </li>
            <li> It is better than any I&#x27;ve tried and Amazon has it for a great price!</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t worry about getting it off because it came off so nicely with a makeup remover!</li>
            <li> love it waterproof is the best.</li>
            <li> But honestly, nothing is ever has good at my Maybelline!</li>
            <li> My fave mascara (Avon SuperFull) got discontinued, so I decided to try this since it got some good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This one is so good.</li>
            <li> the color and texture looks good on me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this has good reviews, but I bought it based on the rating</li>
            <li> good mascara</li>
            <li> search for good mascara continues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as good as EL.</li>
            <li> but it still looks good.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, I love it!!</li>
            <li> Goes on beautifully, and even though it has a lot of staying power, you can remove it easily.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara!  </li>
            <li> Love this line!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> This mascara lives up to everything it promises and more!</li>
            <li> and it is great as it does not clump easily</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Well, it does feel nice on, not clumpy or waxy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> but let&#x27;s be honest; why go through the effort of curling your lashes and adding mascara if it does nothing to enhance them?</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Every time I try another brand or kind</li>
            <li> and I liked the price, but it took 2 weeks to arrive instead of the promised 4 days.  </li>
            <li> Was thrilled to see I could purchase by  a subscription service every 2 months via Amazon.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t super waterproof like some mascaras still look great after being in the shower or swimming, this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Quite good for a cheap mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have allergy eyes and there are many times when any kind of fan on me makes my eyes water.</li>
            <li> The best and most natural mascara.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave clumps and is very light.</li>
            <li> This mascara is OK, it is very smooth as the name says.</li>
            <li> Currently my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Stays all day, doesn&#x27;t clump AT ALL, just all-around great,</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Most mascaras</li>
            <li> I just want to coat them so they are more visible all the way to the tip.  </li>
            <li> Most mascaras are too clumpy for my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot more than two or three strokes.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite ever mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve repurchased it many times.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> For enhanced and longer lashes with more definitions, that still looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Say how many tubes of this I went through.</li>
            <li> and I love the brushy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t irritate and it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> ok, swipe, swipe, swipe again.  </li>
            <li> Let me swipe some more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras</li>
            <li> Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Nothing&#x27;s better no matter the cost.</li>
            <li> As most women know not every mascara out there is going to work for them.</li>
            <li> So it is smudging from the top.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras over my life.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I love that I have it as part of my Amazon auto delivery</li>
            <li> /&gt;The waterproof aspect of this my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s worth it for how gorgeous my lashes look.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara in the world.  </li>
            <li> Spend the extra fifty cents and have a happy wife!</li>
            <li> love this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found anything better.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend when there are better waterproof mascaras out there.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look fantastic!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because most of he reviews said that it didn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> But if you get teary eyes throughout the day it is still okay.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Found this product on a product review website where it ranked in the top five mascaras ...</li>
            <li> Great for a drug store mascara, very light and natural would buy again!</li>
            <li> This mascara is unexpectedly pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras I have found in a long while.</li>
            <li> This mascara gives me beautiful, soft lashes without smudging or clumping.</li>
            <li> And, best of all, it still looked freshly applied and natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found this mascara available with subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, basic, clean mascara!  </li>
            <li> It is waterproof, easy to apply and makes my lashes thicker without looking gooey or stuck together.</li>
            <li> its easy to remove with baby oil</li>
            <li> This mascara is easy to remove and I have not had any issues with my lashes breaking or falling out.</li>
            <li> A swipe with a tissue or a napkin or even a finger will easily remove the offending smudged mascara.  </li>
            <li> comes off easily with an oil based makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Easy to layer and reapply.</li>
            <li> Comes off easy with baby oil.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s easy to wipe off.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with waterproof mascara remover (I use Almay Longwear &amp; Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover Pads).</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and stays on throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> If I accidentally get some on my eye lid, it comes off easily before it sets up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be able to wear mascara until I found Maybelline&#x27;s Full</li>
            <li> and I decided that it wasn&#x27;t worth paying the higher price when this one is just as good.  </li>
            <li> word of advice:  make sure you have a good remover like Almay pads on hand as Full &#x27;N Soft has staying power.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have very oily skin, in 3-4 hours I&#x27;d probably be able to fry my face in a pan, so having waterproof and smudgeproof mascara was very important in my mascara hunt.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this mascara, and I am super pleased!</li>
            <li> The brush  smears on my eyelids (huge pet peeve)</li>
            <li> with a great application brush that covers well without fuss and multiple applications.</li>
            <li> It gives you clump free lashes every time.</li>
            <li> on smooth, no clumping&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my everyday needs.</li>
            <li> So far waterproof part seems to be good, not ine of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Soft and natural looking and perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and I have already ordered more!</li>
            <li> The price point is excellent, especially while on sale, and works so much better than some (most, to be honest) of the higher end mascaras I typically use.</li>
            <li> I like the fluffier, more natural look of mascara compared to more trendy giant clumpy effect that seems to be popular.</li>
            <li> No other mascara at any price point has ever made my lashes look so good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it came.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara by far for many years--</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to make a special trip, so I ordered online.  </li>
            <li> It will look very nice if you have the time apply let it dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, waterproof, but comes off easily with make-up remover, so not irritating to your eyes.</li>
            <li> Good enough.</li>
            <li> this is tried and true.  </li>
            <li> I like the wand brush, it makes my lashes look full and</li>
            <li> I like the Full</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Full</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras in my 50+ years and always go back to Great Lash or Full &#x27;n Soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always satisfied with my soft and full eyelashes!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara, thanks for shipping so quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to get the same results that so many who love this product do.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara, it&#x27;s cheap and works well.</li>
            <li> was quick too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be loyal to this brand for years to come...</li>
            <li> The positive side is that it wipes off REALLY easily.  </li>
            <li> Full N Soft simply has everything needed; goes on nicely, stays on in water, looks nice.</li>
            <li> For lower lashes, I like their Lash Discovery for daytime or work, and use Full &#x27;N Soft for more glam at night or for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara very often, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on one, so the relatively low price of Maybelline&#x27;s Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara -- as compared to department store brands -- made this product even more attractive to me.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally long and curled lashes this would be a gorgeous mascara - just one coat lengthens</li>
            <li> even on super hot and humid summer days that include swimming!  </li>
            <li> I love getting new mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to even higher end mascaras!</li>
            <li> I have used Maybelline waterproof great lash for years and recently decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li> I recommend to people that want a more natural look and doesn&#x27;t have a super oily face.</li>
            <li> but my lashes look natural with lots of length and okay volume.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the hassle of smudging.  </li>
            <li> Have this on autoship each month to make sure I&#x27;m switching to a fresh tube frequently</li>
            <li> &#x27;N Soft better than Maybelline&#x27;s Define-A-Lash or Volum&#x27; Express.  </li>
            <li> however at the end of the day, it is smudged on the bottom of my eye, and I rarely coat the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My lashes stay silky looking and fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> &#x27;N Soft is my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> wand is large compared to other maybelline mascaras like Great Lash.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came in brown, instead of just black and more black, but I&#x27;m very happy with the way it applies.</li>
            <li> super fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Some reviewers are right.</li>
            <li> You get nice long and tons of lashes with this product..</li>
            <li> It looks good, definitely there but in a natural way.  </li>
            <li> the waterproof version of definicils got really clumpy really quick for me).</li>
            <li> Keeps the curl in my lashes after I curl them as they are super straight.</li>
            <li> The mascara arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> This is a decent mascara if you like the more natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I like this because it has an actual brush NOT made out of plastic, like most of the newer mascaras out there.  </li>
            <li> Although everyone says their product won&#x27;t clump or flake, at 73 years of age I have tried many different brands  </li>
            <li> Needs MANY layers to get the look I desire and can get from one coat of my regular non waterproof brand.</li>
            <li> I use this mascara in regular and waterproof and I absolutely love them both.</li>
            <li> Overall this is okay for a couple hours of wearing, but if you&#x27;re looking for all day wear without the smudging and flaking</li>
            <li> just cause it was so great for thick doll lashes when I layer the mascara.</li>
            <li> It really is waterproof and lasts, even when I ran a 5K and swim with it!</li>
            <li> The regular brush style also helps make sure my lashes stay separated and not clumped together.</li>
            <li> Although I loved this at first, I started to notice fallout after a few times wearing it, to the point that my eyes started burning.</li>
            <li> definitely takes more than soap and water to remove</li>
            <li> This mascara is exactly as marketed.  </li>
            <li> My favorite mascara for the last decade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many brands in between and ALWAYS come back to this.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to wipe the wand off on the edges of the container before using it for the first week.  </li>
            <li> Of all the mascaras I have tried, and I have tried many, this is the one that I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li> But ordering it through the mail was very dissappointing!</li>
            <li> As a triathlete and avid swimmer, I need a waterproof mascara that I can rely on.</li>
            <li> I first gave it the shower test and found that it stayed put, no smearing or raccoon eyes</li>
            <li> I think it is mainly because I have a super oily face.</li>
            <li> I have to really work to take it off!  </li>
            <li> and from the second you open it, it&#x27;s the perfect texture...not super wet and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take Full &#x27;N Soft!  </li>
            <li> and although some of the expensive ones are better, I found that this one was also just as good</li>
            <li> This Full N Soft, however, does exactly what the name says.</li>
            <li> It just gives your lashed such a nice and natural look and feel.</li>
            <li> Yes, this technically defeats the purpose of waterproof, but I really use the waterproof more to hold the curl in my lashes than purely for its waterproofness.</li>
            <li> that it gets very clumpy unless I first blot it with a tissue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cried with it many times and as long as I dab instead of wiping, it stays put.</li>
            <li> this mascara makes my lashes soft and full.</li>
            <li> After a full day or evening of wear, it usually up completely under my eyes, even if there wasn&#x27;t the slightest bit of moisture in the air</li>
            <li> It has to be the waterproof Full and Soft-</li>
            <li> Otherwise I would give Full &#x27;N Soft a 5.</li>
            <li> Co-workers always wondered how my makeup stayed perfect throughout the day (other female lifeguards would look like raccoons midway through the day), even though I was under water for a good portion of the day because I was usually on the rotation of lifeguarding in the wave pool, so I got smacked in the face with a huge wall of water every few minutes.</li>
            <li> Even though mines are very long and we&#x27;ll shaped I had to apply like 4 coats to make them look fuller and more noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara because it doesn&#x27;t flake or become dry on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> so to find a soft, waterproof mascara that really does &#x27;full out the funning&#x27;...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short and has long bristles and does a good job of separating all of my lashes.</li>
            <li> The wand was slightly large, so the lashes would end up on my eyelids when I was applying on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of mascaras from pricey ones through Clinique, DHC, and Estee Lauder to really cheap ones, but I keep coming back to the Full N Soft Mascara from Maybelline.</li>
            <li> Not dramatic or super lengthening but definitely my favorite for an everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> Your lashes stay super soft but it really does need some improvement in the thickening department.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this line in most stores like CVS, Walgreens and Wal-Mart as I think it sells out quickly.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to wash off, yet holds very well due to being waterproof.</li>
            <li> I run the brush end under very hot water to clean it out, dry thoroughly with a tissue and then use.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like the way this applies and</li>
            <li> I do have short lashes so they don&#x27;t stand out that much with this stuff, but it&#x27;s definitely a great everyday mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my go to mascara.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight lashes that will not hold a curl unless I use a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> You can really build up your lashes without it clumping</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it to you</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look much thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length, straight eyelashes</li>
            <li> so this really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> No clumping, no stiffness, no flaking, no fibers, and really waterproof (not \\&quot;washable\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> For me, it comes off in the shower if I gently wash my eyes with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Products say they are waterproof but this mascara really is.</li>
            <li> since EL tends to have too much on the wand - the mouth of their bottles needs to be tighter, like this one.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really notice any added fullness to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> ( Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes the product</li>
            <li> and I feel like a coat my lashes really well</li>
            <li> It is waterproof while swimming and out in intense heat.</li>
            <li> This product washes off easier than many other waterproof mascaras, but does hold up well though the day.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Full &amp; Soft line - looks natural but with the waterproof version, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.</li>
            <li> I love the other maybeline brands I&#x27;ve tried so</li>
            <li> This one is nothing particularly special but it gets the job done, has a standard brush and doesn&#x27;t smudge too much unless you rub your eyes</li>
            <li> It leaves my lashes full and feeling natural (not stiff).</li>
            <li> Also, the brushes bristles are long and sparse so frequently go between the lashes and deposit mascara on the top and bottom</li>
            <li> the right amount comes out of the bottle top (neck is sized small so &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; the wand as it exits)&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty much clear, so I just want a mascara to make my lashes darker but not to thicken or lengthen.</li>
            <li> and I love the dark color</li>
            <li> The length it gives (as other reviews have stated) is very natural which is my favorite part about it.</li>
            <li> It gives a very full and natural look without looking dry or flaky.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> have always used Estee Lauder but a friend highly recommended this.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Formula is smooth and easy to apply, the brush is large, but not enough to be a problem to get into the corners of small eyes.</li>
            <li> Once I get through all of these other mascaras that I have laying around (most of them were free), I&#x27;ll get back to using this one regularly when I can find it again!!!</li>
            <li> It is easy, reliable, and doesn&#x27;t clump my eye lashes together like some other brands.  </li>
            <li> This is my holy grail mascara, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it for a few years.</li>
            <li> I have tried others, as I like to try new items, but always come back to Full &amp;#34;N Soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on all the latest \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li> I have used better mascaras at this price point that do not leave splotchy black marks around my eyes (for example, sweating at the gym, not removing completely at night).</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes long, full, not clumpy and soft!</li>
            <li> I put one coat on and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes super volumizing or long</li>
            <li> I can wear it all day and if it is hot outside or the humidity is high</li>
            <li> It is almost like having a new product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in the market for a new mascara</li>
            <li> No stiff,  gobbed up lashes here!  </li>
            <li> but they are such a light blonde</li>
            <li> This mascara is for someone who wants to look natural and when I say natural like if you just didn&#x27;t even put mascara on.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my lashes look very natural and it stays all day.</li>
            <li> This a very natural looking mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural looking.</li>
            <li> A very natural looking mascara</li>
            <li> It has a very natural look.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with fairly long lashes and love the dry formula of this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have occasionally tried something different and end up throwing it away and buying Full &#x27;N Soft again!!</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this product, despite trying many other types of waterproof mascara over the years.  </li>
            <li> I curl my lashes, then apply this mascara as a first coat to hold the curl, then use a different drugstore mascara to add volume and length.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared for frequent checks in the mirror for smudging!</li>
            <li> I think I will be sticking to this mascara for quite a while, especially during this hot humid summer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara - hard to find the waterproof version in stores - doesn&#x27;t make lashes clump and keeps them from feeling brittle</li>
            <li> I do think this mascara stays on a LITTLE better than a non-waterproof type, and it seriously comes off so easily that for me</li>
            <li> Plus, my lashes look longer and thicker while still feeling natural.  </li>
            <li> I do have to put on several coats to really see the difference, but that may be my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It darkens my lashes leaving them soft and not all clumped together.</li>
            <li> It is soft and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency, not too sticky, not too soft, doesn&#x27;t run, and no globs.  </li>
            <li> My go-to for a natural look that holds a curl.</li>
            <li> and I have extremely sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only issue with it is that the brush scoops out so much mascara</li>
            <li> It is waterproof and my lashes stayed soft.</li>
            <li> I recently cried my way through an important family event and, at the end of the day, this mascara was the only cosmetic left on my face.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> It is natural looking while adding length and volume without the crusty clumping and sticking the eyelashes together.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s why it s so soft.</li>
            <li> This mascara never clumped and it looked natural.</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s old.</li>
            <li> This one gives me good coverage without looking too fake.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump, but better for a feather look than a thick look.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying from Amazon and it was MUCH cheaper than in the store by almost half and shipping</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes look long, thick, and lovely!</li>
            <li> When applied the color is fine, not as bold as some of my dark mascaras, but dark enough.</li>
            <li> They look natural and usually the formula is smooth and does not clump.</li>
            <li> I TRY OTHER BRANDS AND ALWAYS COME BACK TO FULL AND SOFT.</li>
            <li> When I was wearing this, people always asked me if my eyelashes were really that long</li>
            <li> The tube is long but doesn&#x27;t seem like it contains that much product in it.</li>
            <li> My lashes are already long, so products that are lengthening usually look way over the top on me.  </li>
            <li> My lashes feel soft, they look full, and  they don&#x27;t feel hard and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this based on title &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, only the soft part delivered.  </li>
            <li> This mascara leaves lashes soooo soft and lengthens with only 1 coat, no flaking or smudging.</li>
            <li> The mascara is good but for some reason it stinks.</li>
            <li> It gives a full and natural look as the product is not too thick.</li>
            <li> The full brush gets every lash and the formula allows to for multiple coats without getting stiff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much easier compared to my other waterproofs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using up all of the other crappy mascara that I have laying around, so I haven&#x27;t been on a real hunt for this stuff...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thin and light, so it&#x27;s got a naked feel and look to it, but it&#x27;s also thin and light, and has a naked feel to it.</li>
            <li> If you want something more dramatic this probably won&#x27;t do it for you, but for an every day look this works.</li>
            <li> It can be layered on for a more dramatic look or just a coat or two for daytime wear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a whole world of mascara now that lengthens and voluminizes with a few coats that also doesn&#x27;t irritate, smear or wear off and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> It is long lasting, it never clumps, and my lashes are left looking soft and natural.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as thick as expected.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a lot softer than other mascaras and isn&#x27;t a really liquidy formula.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have natural long eyelashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very volumizing but provides a nice look that&#x27;s not too dramatic.</li>
            <li> I really want big lash like extensions, but I still use this one on my bottom lashes on those days, as well as all of the other days I do not have extra time to use fibers.</li>
            <li> Although the results aren&#x27;t super, super dramatic, I will be wearing this as an everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is little bit hard to take off but after trying many mascaras I am sticking to it.</li>
            <li> Thick, full, dark lashes, that are soft, not brittle!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live someplace humid like some of the other reviewers, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it running.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to give me thick, lush lashes without the stiffness.  </li>
            <li> Especially in first applications, it&#x27;s almost hard to tell you&#x27;re wearing anything, but as the mascara starts to dry out a little after a few uses, it thickens a bit and gives the extra oomph I&#x27;m looking for with mascara without being thick and clumpy like most mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It also can start to leave the black under your eyes before I feel it should (in a normal day&#x27;s wear, not overnight use which is when I would expect it to).</li>
            <li> We all have different lash types (full, short, thin, etc) and different formulas work for different women.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any other mascara that keeps your eyelashes soft.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty hard to wash off, but I realize that comes with the territory of waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they don&#x27;t do much for my straight short lashes, and it does not hold a curl well at all.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Works well, it last really long.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is because it was 5 degrees outside when it arrived; or that it may have been an older one that was shipped to me.</li>
            <li> It clumped right away and didn&#x27;t last long before it was not good for my eyes.</li>
            <li> It goes on with few clumps even when new and makes eyelashes stand out but not in a garish way.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara but preferred the Soft Black.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know if Soft Black has been discontinued?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheap ones expensive ones</li>
            <li> Once it is set though, it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t look thick and clumpy like some mascaras apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about trying new brands/products; I can&#x27;t stand waterproof mascara that really isn&#x27;t waterproof.  </li>
            <li> I would only recommend this mascara to people who already have long, thick and naturally curled lashes.</li>
            <li> I feel like make my eyelashes crusty and dry but not this one</li>
            <li> apply let it dry</li>
            <li> No more forgetting; mascara delivered directly to my door,</li>
            <li> It feels empty and dry.</li>
            <li> I do usually use the regular, but I keep the waterproof for when I wear my contacts because I use eye drops A LOT with my contacts in and they make the regular mascara run everywhere.</li>
            <li> The brush comes out almost dry and the tube feels just like the empty one I wanted to replace.</li>
            <li> Product is very dry...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly no Dior, but for less than a third the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> My lashes look a little darker but definitely not noticeable.</li>
            <li> one thing I dislike about this mascara is that it tends to dry out in the tube faster than other mascara.</li>
            <li> they look lush without being hard and sticky.</li>
            <li> We are known as having straight thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I always wind up throwing it out after a few uses and switching back to this.</li>
            <li> Um, still not really visible.  </li>
            <li> but I expected that.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are fairly thick and I would say that this product makes them look about twice as dense as my natural lashes.  </li>
            <li> It applies as a dark black color and definitely adds length to my lashes.</li>
            <li> right up there with the expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes look thicker without really making them look scary long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is not completely waterproof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will move on to other mascaras</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the reviews here and other places.</li>
            <li> It is waterproof but can smudge during application because it seems a thinner formula than other waterproof mascaras.</li>
            <li> It feels softer to the touch than other mascaras and, to me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even feel it&#x27;s on like some other mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied and definitely regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Everything made my lashes stiff and painful, and most just pulled my lashes out.</li>
            <li> I keep trying others due to having a hard time finding it in brownish-black, and I keep throwing those out and going back to this.</li>
            <li> It does clump a little, but not much at all.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t worn make up in 5 years but wanted to enhance my old tired eyes.</li>
            <li> I did have a slight issue with burning of my eyes when I washed it off though,</li>
            <li> After couple of hours I saw black streaks under my eyes.</li>
            <li> but I had raccoon eyes after less than 3 hours at work (</li>
            <li> I have fairly long, thick lashes as it is</li>
            <li> apply let it dry, and it is not that hard to remove (with make up remover of course).</li>
            <li> The mascara also has a little flakes when applying.</li>
            <li> A little tip on what I do when this starts to happen...</li>
            <li> Not as waterproof as other Maybelline mascaras that I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Never lets me down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy an insanely expensive clear, waterproof topcoat to apply over this mascara to hopefully fix that issue.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours I got raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews that were negative</li>
            <li> I like the L&#x27;Or&#x27;eal  products they usually do what they say.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the expensive brands, thinking there might be something &amp;#34;more&amp;#34; out there, but I always come back to this.  </li>
            <li> no more forgetting.</li>
            <li> This is my usual makeup purchase at the store.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the dark brown color, but it is very hard to find anymore.  </li>
            <li> So tired of all those others with fillers and fibers that always wind up in a mess.  </li>
            <li> It does not cry hard or crunchy and doesn&#x27;t look clumpy at all.  </li>
            <li> The package came sealed but there was hardly anything in there.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; mascara is hardly waterproof, and not the least bit smudgeproof.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product since the late 90s.</li>
            <li> When they say waterproof, they MEAN waterproof...</li>
            <li> I have to put like 4-5 layers to get a subtle look on the thickness and length.</li>
            <li> Seriously my go-to mascara for years.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> no good.</li>
            <li> not sure why this one stinks...?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really do dramatic looks.</li>
            <li> I used to buy expensive name brands from department stores which are expensive</li>
            <li> I like that the mascara doesn&#x27;t have that weird odor that some waterproof mascaras have.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this mascara does smudge/flake after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> and I still was not impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li> Also, being waterproof, it&#x27;s difficult to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive mascaras and switch it up every now and</li>
            <li> and I hate how unnaturally stiff it makes my eyelashes, plus they flake off a lot.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got it at the store based on the reviews here. However, I am wondering if I got a bad mascara. It feels empty and dry. The mascara also has a little flakes when applying. I have to put like 4-5 layers to get a subtle look on the thickness and length. My lashes look a little darker but definitely not noticeable. I am as Asian. We are known as having straight thin lashes. Some reviewers are right. When removing the mascara, a couple of lashes fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will move on to other mascaras</li>
            <li> Currently my favorite mascara. Stays all day, doesn&#x27;t clump AT ALL, just all-around great, everything I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding but I won&#x27;t be wearing it. It tends to end up beneath my eyes and isn&#x27;t all that smudge-proof. It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m a bit oily and that isn&#x27;t helping, but this product didn&#x27;t impress.</li>
            <li> My fave mascara (Avon SuperFull) got discontinued, so I decided to try this since it got some good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Well, Maybelline lies - this is so NOT WATERPROOF.  It is crap.  I am sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Good enough. Haven&#x27;t worn make up in 5 years but wanted to enhance my old tired eyes. It is waterproof. Long lasting. Dors not smudge in my wrinkles so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> This mascara is unexpectedly pretty good.I won&#x27;t say it gives lots of volume but my lashes look natural with lots of length and okay volume.This mascara is little bit hard to take off but after trying many mascaras I am sticking to it.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara, thanks for shipping so quickly. I like this because it has an actual brush NOT made out of plastic, like most of the newer mascaras out there.  Never clumpy, never smudges.</li>
            <li> This mascara works well for me. Although everyone says their product won&#x27;t clump or flake, at 73 years of age I have tried many different brands  and they ALL do at some point. A little tip on what I do when this starts to happen...I run the brush end under very hot water to clean it out, dry thoroughly with a tissue and then use. It is almost like having a new product. This one gives me good coverage without looking too fake.</li>
            <li> The best Maybelline mascara out there. It is waterproof, easy to apply and makes my lashes thicker without looking gooey or stuck together.I have tried others, as I like to try new items, but always come back to Full &amp;#34;N Soft.</li>
            <li> The mascara arrived very fast. I was so excited when it came. I love getting new mascara. This one is so good. And the price is great. Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best drugstore mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous mascaras and am probably still going to keep on trying, but this mascara will probably always be a back up.  I read some other reviews that were negative but I have never had this mascara smudge on me even a bit.  I work out every day, travel to humid climates, swim in the ocean, play beach volleyball, etc, etc, and this mascara has never smeared.  Plus, my lashes look longer and thicker while still feeling natural.  I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;spider legs\\&quot; look so this is the one for me!</li>
            <li> this mascara makes my lashes soft and full. they look lush without being hard and sticky. its easy to remove with baby oil and I love the dark color</li>
            <li> I have used Maybelline waterproof great lash for years and recently decided to try something new.  I really like the way this applies and the color and texture looks good on me.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to even higher end mascaras! It gives a very full and natural look without looking dry or flaky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to get the same results that so many who love this product do. It flakes a bit and then disappears sometime during the day. It did not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Natural looking&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smudges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my lashes look very natural and it stays all day. I do have short lashes so they don&#x27;t stand out that much with this stuff, but it&#x27;s definitely a great everyday mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe about it is that it does smudge on my bottoms of my eyes, even though I don&#x27;t put any mascara on my bottom lashes. I heard that it might be because of my oily skin (oil takes off waterproof mascara), so I probably won&#x27;t be getting this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years.  I used to buy expensive name brands from department stores which are expensive so I decided to try this one to see how it compared and although some of the expensive ones are better, I found that this one was also just as good and I decided that it wasn&#x27;t worth paying the higher price when this one is just as good.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for YEARS! I love it! Makes my lashes long, full, not clumpy and soft! Most mascaras I feel like make my eyelashes crusty and dry but not this one</li>
            <li> My lashes are already long, so products that are lengthening usually look way over the top on me.  I just want to coat them so they are more visible all the way to the tip.  My lashes are fairly thick and I would say that this product makes them look about twice as dense as my natural lashes.  This product washes off easier than many other waterproof mascaras, but does hold up well though the day.  It does not cry hard or crunchy and doesn&#x27;t look clumpy at all.  I might also look for it in brown for when I want a softer look.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as thick as expected. So far waterproof part seems to be good, not ine of my favorites. Needs MANY layers to get the look I desire and can get from one coat of my regular non waterproof brand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on all the latest \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; mascaras...this is tried and true.  No gimmicks.  Just really great mascara that lasts...with a great application brush that covers well without fuss and multiple applications.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this product, despite trying many other types of waterproof mascara over the years.  Full N Soft simply has everything needed; goes on nicely, stays on in water, looks nice.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my go to mascara. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now. Nothing else compares!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. I wear this almost every day for work. I have stick straight lashes that will not hold a curl unless I use a waterproof mascara. This a very natural looking mascara. I curl my lashes, then apply this mascara as a first coat to hold the curl, then use a different drugstore mascara to add volume and length. This mascara is easy to remove and I have not had any issues with my lashes breaking or falling out. I will definitely keep repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara, it&#x27;s cheap and works well.</li>
            <li> I do have to put on several coats to really see the difference, but that may be my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I use this mascara in regular and waterproof and I absolutely love them both. I have fairly long, thick lashes as it is but they are such a light blonde they&#x27;re pretty much clear, so I just want a mascara to make my lashes darker but not to thicken or lengthen. Most mascaras are too clumpy for my eyelashes and I hate how unnaturally stiff it makes my eyelashes, plus they flake off a lot. This Full N Soft, however, does exactly what the name says. It darkens my lashes leaving them soft and not all clumped together. I do usually use the regular, but I keep the waterproof for when I wear my contacts because I use eye drops A LOT with my contacts in and they make the regular mascara run everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love cosmetics - in that respect I&#x27;m a stereotypical girl. I read some great reviews on this item and decided to give it a try. When applied the color is fine, not as bold as some of my dark mascaras, but dark enough. The length it gives (as other reviews have stated) is very natural which is my favorite part about it. It really doesn&#x27;t look thick and clumpy like some mascaras apply. The reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because even though it says waterproof I don&#x27;t think it is. It also can start to leave the black under your eyes before I feel it should (in a normal day&#x27;s wear, not overnight use which is when I would expect it to).</li>
            <li> I like the wand brush, it makes my lashes look full and I like that the mascara doesn&#x27;t have that weird odor that some waterproof mascaras have. Unfortunately this mascara does smudge/flake after a couple hours. And it&#x27;s pretty hard to wash off, but I realize that comes with the territory of waterproof mascara. Overall this is okay for a couple hours of wearing, but if you&#x27;re looking for all day wear without the smudging and flaking I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I kinda miss this mascara just cause it was so great for thick doll lashes when I layer the mascara. I did have a slight issue with burning of my eyes when I washed it off though, which is why I haven&#x27;t repurchased!</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the reviews here and other places. But this mascara smudges real bad. After couple of hours I saw black streaks under my eyes. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> The package came sealed but there was hardly anything in there. The brush comes out almost dry and the tube feels just like the empty one I wanted to replace.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this mascara, and I am super pleased! The price point is excellent, especially while on sale, and works so much better than some (most, to be honest) of the higher end mascaras I typically use. The mascara made my eyelashes fuller and longer, and the waterproof formula is one of the only ones that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Although the results aren&#x27;t super, super dramatic, I will be wearing this as an everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; mascara is hardly waterproof, and not the least bit smudgeproof.  After a full day or evening of wear, it usually up completely under my eyes, even if there wasn&#x27;t the slightest bit of moisture in the air (and I do not have oily skin either).  So why do I still wear this stuff?  Well, it does feel nice on, not clumpy or waxy or sticky.  It looks good, definitely there but in a natural way.  The positive side is that it wipes off REALLY easily.  A swipe with a tissue or a napkin or even a finger will easily remove the offending smudged mascara.  I do think this mascara stays on a LITTLE better than a non-waterproof type, and it seriously comes off so easily that for me it&#x27;s worth the hassle of smudging.  Just be prepared for frequent checks in the mirror for smudging!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on title &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, only the soft part delivered.  I do not feel it added anything to my lashes.  I had to use a lot more than two or three strokes.  I actually lost count and I still was not impressed with the results.  It did not deliver on the fullness claim.</li>
            <li> I really like the Full &amp; Soft line - looks natural but with the waterproof version, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.</li>
            <li> The best and most natural mascara. You can really build up your lashes without it clumping</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara of all time!!! You get nice long and tons of lashes with this product..</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara!  Please keep it on the market!</li>
            <li> The mascara is good but for some reason it stinks. Bad. Almost like oil or gas. Makes me gag every time I open the container. Probably won&#x27;t go with this brand again. I love the other maybeline brands I&#x27;ve tried so not sure why this one stinks...?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite ever mascara. I&#x27;ve repurchased it many times. This was my first time buying from Amazon and it was MUCH cheaper than in the store by almost half and shipping was quick too. I would definitely buy again and I recommend this to everyone I know. It just gives your lashed such a nice and natural look and feel. Not dramatic or super lengthening but definitely my favorite for an everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. Seriously my go-to mascara for years. It really is waterproof and lasts, even when I ran a 5K and swim with it! I highly recommend this mascara. I use a fiber mascara on days I really want big lash like extensions, but I still use this one on my bottom lashes on those days, as well as all of the other days I do not have extra time to use fibers.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara by far for many years-- I hope they always make it! I like the fluffier, more natural look of mascara compared to more trendy giant clumpy effect that seems to be popular. The regular brush style also helps make sure my lashes stay separated and not clumped together. Have this on autoship each month to make sure I&#x27;m switching to a fresh tube frequently</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara - hard to find the waterproof version in stores - doesn&#x27;t make lashes clump and keeps them from feeling brittle</li>
            <li> It even stays on if one cries!</li>
            <li> This mascara is OK, it is very smooth as the name says. If you don&#x27;t have natural long eyelashes I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it to you (Is like this mascara is meant to aid your eyelashes but just the way the are). Even though mines are very long and we&#x27;ll shaped I had to apply like 4 coats to make them look fuller and more noticeable. It will look very nice if you have the time apply let it dry apply let it dry apply let it dry, and it is not that hard to remove (with make up remover of course).</li>
            <li> this mascara gives me raccoon eyes after 3 hours of wear. no good.</li>
            <li> Got this on perfect time. Perfect color, &amp; GREAT mascara!! I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> For enhanced and longer lashes with more definitions, that still looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for 8 years, and every time I try something else, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Every time I try something different I always wind up throwing it out after a few uses and switching back to this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Say how many tubes of this I went through. No matter what mascara I try, I always have to go back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my HG mascara!!! I don&#x27;t have what I&#x27;ll do if maybelline discontinues this product.</li>
            <li> This is a decent mascara if you like the more natural looking lashes. It is waterproof but can smudge during application because it seems a thinner formula than other waterproof mascaras. Unfortunately they don&#x27;t do much for my straight short lashes, and it does not hold a curl well at all. If you have naturally long and curled lashes this would be a gorgeous mascara - just one coat lengthens and I&#x27;ve managed up to 2 coats without noticeable clumps. 2 coats just doesn&#x27;t cut it for these tiny Asian lashes though, so 3 stars...</li>
            <li> I like it. I don&#x27;t always want Dramatic! It is soft and does not irritate my eyes. I like the L&#x27;Or&#x27;eal  products they usually do what they say.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake and purchased this one, thinking it was waterproof. It says waterproof, anyway. Looks wonderful but I had raccoon eyes after less than 3 hours at work (and, since I don&#x27;t have a mirror, walked around like that for the entire morning before I realized it....)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found this mascara available with subscribe and save.  I like the consistency, not too sticky, not too soft, doesn&#x27;t run, and no globs.  It makes my lashes look much thicker.  It is better than any I&#x27;ve tried and Amazon has it for a great price!</li>
            <li> Great mascara and I love the brushy this is the only mascara brand I use for years.love it in waterproof and regular too. Does not clump my eyelashes at all.</li>
            <li> Maybelline makes the best mascaras. I have tried all the pricey ones from Sephora and make up counters. To me, they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Love this line!  Thick, full, dark lashes, that are soft, not brittle!  No clumps!  Amazing.  I do prefer the dark brown color, but it is very hard to find anymore.  I have tried all of the expensive brands, thinking there might be something &amp;#34;more&amp;#34; out there, but I always come back to this.  It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li> No, no, no.  I don&#x27;t know how this has good reviews, but I bought it based on the rating and I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed.  Sure, it doesn&#x27;t irritate and it stays on all day.  BUT it does nothing to enhance the length or volume and took 10-15 swipes on each eye to even be visible.  Swipe, swipe, swipe,...ok, swipe, swipe, swipe again.  Um, still not really visible.  Let me swipe some more.  Maybe if I want to set my alarm 10 minutes earlier to allow time just apply my mascara, this will work.  But I&#x27;d rather sleep.  Also, the brushes bristles are long and sparse so frequently go between the lashes and deposit mascara on the top and bottom eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a whole world of mascara now that lengthens and voluminizes with a few coats that also doesn&#x27;t irritate, smear or wear off and looks natural.  This one would&#x27;ve been great in the 80s when we had not choices.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I have used for years! It is long lasting, it never clumps, and my lashes are left looking soft and natural.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras and I always come back to this.  It&#x27;s strong, waterproof, but comes off easily with make-up remover, so not irritating to your eyes.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES IT. IT WORKS. FOR HER</li>
            <li> It clumped right away and didn&#x27;t last long before it was not good for my eyes. wouldn&#x27;t buy this product for here again. Might from the store?</li>
            <li> Goes on beautifully, and even though it has a lot of staying power, you can remove it easily. It gives you clump free lashes every time. It arrived on time and on perfect condition from this seller!  UPDATE: Although I loved this at first, I started to notice fallout after a few times wearing it, to the point that my eyes started burning. Can&#x27;t use it anymore. Lowering my star count on this to 3.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara! I have blond eyelashes &amp; it covers perfectly without clumping.</li>
            <li> Let the supermodels keep Maybelline Great Lash.  I&#x27;ll take Full &#x27;N Soft!  It doesn&#x27;t take much to give me thick, lush lashes without the stiffness.  My lashes appear to multiple without getting all clumped together or &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34; looking, and I don&#x27;t have to comb through them to lessen a severe look for daytime.  I like the Full &#x27;N Soft better than Maybelline&#x27;s Define-A-Lash or Volum&#x27; Express.  For lower lashes, I like their Lash Discovery for daytime or work, and use Full &#x27;N Soft for more glam at night or for special occasions.  I prefer waterproof in all varieties as I have allergies &amp; occasionally wear contacts.  I prefer not to have the local racoons think I&#x27;m family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only word of advice:  make sure you have a good remover like Almay pads on hand as Full &#x27;N Soft has staying power.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really do dramatic looks. This mascara makes my lashes look thicker without really making them look scary long. I wouldn&#x27;t say you can even tell you&#x27;re wearing mascara. It&#x27;s very natural looking. I will continue to buy it for forever.</li>
            <li> good mascara...happy with this purchase I would  buy this again.I shop on Amazon for everything and think they are great!</li>
            <li> When I wear this mascara I always end up with some of it under my eyes by the end of the evening. I doesn&#x27;t even have to be raining. Just sheer gravity and moisture in the air will do it. Not waterproof by any imagination.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite mascara. It does what it says! My lashes feel soft, they look full, and  they don&#x27;t feel hard and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the waterproof one because as an allergy sufferer, my eyes well up sometimes or I have an itch I must scratch and this doesn&#x27;t budge.&lt;br /&gt;It comes off easily with an oil based makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I TRY OTHER BRANDS AND ALWAYS COME BACK TO FULL AND SOFT. I HATE CLUMPY AND FLAKEY, THICK, CHUNKY STUFF, ADD THE PRICE,  AND YOU CAN BUY 2 TO 6 OF THESE FOR THE COST OF SOME FANCY NAME BRANDS THAT LEAVE ME BROKE AND DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this mascara to people who already have long, thick and naturally curled lashes. So basically, people who simply want to darken their eyelashes. While I did notice some lengthening, it did not help with volume. This will also not hold curl. I have medium length, straight eyelashes so this really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. On the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake on me. A very natural looking mascara but let&#x27;s be honest; why go through the effort of curling your lashes and adding mascara if it does nothing to enhance them?</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years.  I have occasionally tried something different and end up throwing it away and buying Full &#x27;N Soft again!!</li>
            <li> I was a longtime user of the now-discontinued Volum Express \\&quot;The Classic,\\&quot; and tried several substitutes. Everything made my lashes stiff and painful, and most just pulled my lashes out. And as a contact lens wearer, I can&#x27;t use any mascara that isn&#x27;t waterproof, flakes, or has fibers. Finally I came upon this, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. No clumping, no stiffness, no flaking, no fibers, and really waterproof (not \\&quot;washable\\&quot;). Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> My go-to for a natural look that holds a curl. Nothing&#x27;s better no matter the cost.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I can wear.  I have been using this for years and I have extremely sensitive eyes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product for years and it is still excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product in very good condition and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras I have found in a long while. As most women know not every mascara out there is going to work for them. We all have different lash types (full, short, thin, etc) and different formulas work for different women. I have been blessed with fairly long lashes and love the dry formula of this mascara. It leaves my lashes full and feeling natural (not stiff). This is a great every day mascara for me. If you want something more dramatic this probably won&#x27;t do it for you, but for an every day look this works. I have not had any problem with the waterproof formula running or leaving rings around my eyes. I have been using this for about a year and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> search for good mascara continues. definitely takes more than soap and water to remove - I have to use the eye makeup remover. however at the end of the day, it is smudged on the bottom of my eye, and I rarely coat the bottom lashes. So it is smudging from the top. I hate raccoon eyes when there is no moisture that caused it. disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras over my life. Grocery store ones, and department store ones. This one is by far my favorite. I don&#x27;t know of any other mascara that keeps your eyelashes soft.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It is the perfect consistency to apply, no clumping or feathering. It is super easy to wash off, yet holds very well due to being waterproof. I think I will be sticking to this mascara for quite a while, especially during this hot humid summer.</li>
            <li> I wanted a no flake eyeliner. It flaked. Is there an eyeliner that does not Flake or end up under your eyes?</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and the price here is great and I love that I have it as part of my Amazon auto delivery so I never run out.</li>
            <li> Quite good for a cheap mascara.  Bought this to wear during a June trip to orlando, didn&#x27;t budge while all the rest of my makeup felt like it was melting off of my face.  It&#x27;s certainly no Dior, but for less than a third the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be able to wear mascara until I found Maybelline&#x27;s Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin, in 3-4 hours I&#x27;d probably be able to fry my face in a pan, so having waterproof and smudgeproof mascara was very important in my mascara hunt. The second issue I have is that I wear glasses. Finding one that would hold curl and give volume was also essential. This mascara has everything that I want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand is large compared to other maybelline mascaras like Great Lash. It&#x27;s short and has long bristles and does a good job of separating all of my lashes. I haven&#x27;t had clumping when I put it on (I&#x27;ve had this for maybe 2 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterproof aspect of this my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t budge or move around throughout the day, and when I go to remove it it&#x27;s so much easier compared to my other waterproofs. For me, it comes off in the shower if I gently wash my eyes with a washcloth. Toner (I use witch hazel) on a cotton pad works well for me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great, great mascara. I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing another one as soon as my tube is out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about 13 years now and I keep going back to it. I&#x27;ve tried fancier mascaras, because I can afford them and why not? But honestly, nothing is ever has good at my Maybelline!</li>
            <li> Every time I try a different brand or even another option under the Maybelline name, I am instantly reminded of why I use this product and have for 10+ years. The waterproof aspect is perfect. Products say they are waterproof but this mascara really is. I have allergy eyes and there are many times when any kind of fan on me makes my eyes water. This happens a lot throughout the day and I need something that can stand up to that. The &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; aspect of the mascara is not just in the name. It feels softer to the touch than other mascaras and, to me, that means it&#x27;s gentler on my lashes. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Awesome. This has been my brand for years and don&#x27;t plan on changing.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  Every time I try another brand or kind I immediately revert back to this.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes look long, thick, and lovely! My only issue with it is that the brush scoops out so much mascara that it gets very clumpy unless I first blot it with a tissue. Also, being waterproof, it&#x27;s difficult to remove at the end of the day. However, it&#x27;s worth it for how gorgeous my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara but preferred the Soft Black. Does anyone know if Soft Black has been discontinued?</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara. Always my go-to. I&#x27;ve tried expensive mascaras and switch it up every now and then but my lashes look best with this. Easy to layer and reapply. It has to be the waterproof Full and Soft- the non waterproof isnt the same</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth, no clumping&lt;br /&gt;Just the right amount comes out of the bottle top (neck is sized small so &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; the wand as it exits)&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor flaking at the end of the day after the gym&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to remove (I&#x27;ve tried 3 different eye makeup removers) but I expected that.  It&#x27;s waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used Estee Lauder but a friend highly recommended this.  It&#x27;s almost as good as EL. I like that since EL tends to have too much on the wand - the mouth of their bottles needs to be tighter, like this one.  For 1/5 of the price of EL it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS forget mascara when I&#x27;m running errands. I didn&#x27;t want to make a special trip, so I ordered online.  I&#x27;m skeptical about trying new brands/products; I can&#x27;t stand waterproof mascara that really isn&#x27;t waterproof.  This mascara is exactly as marketed.  It is waterproof and my lashes stayed soft. No stiff,  gobbed up lashes here!  I did the subscribe &amp; save. No more forgetting; mascara delivered directly to my door, no more forgetting.</li>
            <li> Been using this product since the late 90s. I hate clumpy and stiff eyelashes--and this product keeps that from happening! It&#x27;s perfect and I am&lt;br /&gt;Always satisfied with my soft and full eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Bought this product because mine was running out. This is my go to mascara, so it always lives up to expectations. It gives a full and natural look as the product is not too thick.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara because it doesn&#x27;t flake or become dry on my lashes.  My lashes stay silky looking and fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I dislike about this mascara is that it tends to dry out in the tube faster than other mascara.</li>
            <li> Beat mascara! Used it for years. Never an issue. No runs, smears, smudges. Need makeup or eye makeup remover to fully remove-it means waterproof when it says waterproof.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I always use because it does what it claims and it was out of stock where I purchase it locally so others must prefer it as well.</li>
            <li> This mascara is for someone who wants to look natural and when I say natural like if you just didn&#x27;t even put mascara on. The brush  smears on my eyelids (huge pet peeve) and it just doesn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes .. bummer!</li>
            <li> Great for a drug store mascara, very light and natural would buy again! Doesn&#x27;t clump, but better for a feather look than a thick look.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest mascara EVER!  I hate so badly it has been discontinued.  I will continue to seek out every last tube until it is gone!</li>
            <li> This has become my go-to daily wear mascara. It&#x27;s pretty thin and light, so it&#x27;s got a naked feel and look to it, but it&#x27;s also thin and light, and has a naked feel to it. Especially in first applications, it&#x27;s almost hard to tell you&#x27;re wearing anything, but as the mascara starts to dry out a little after a few uses, it thickens a bit and gives the extra oomph I&#x27;m looking for with mascara without being thick and clumpy like most mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. When I&#x27;m going out and want a darker application, I tend to use this as a base with a darker non-waterproof mascara (lancome definicils-- the waterproof version of definicils got really clumpy really quick for me). Yes, this technically defeats the purpose of waterproof, but I really use the waterproof more to hold the curl in my lashes than purely for its waterproofness.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara and it is great as it does not clump easily but I didn&#x27;t really notice any added fullness to my eyelashes. Your lashes stay super soft but it really does need some improvement in the thickening department.</li>
            <li> I recently cried my way through an important family event and, at the end of the day, this mascara was the only cosmetic left on my face. And, best of all, it still looked freshly applied and natural. An added bonus for me was the affordable price. Since I don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara very often, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on one, so the relatively low price of Maybelline&#x27;s Full &#x27;N Soft Waterproof Mascara -- as compared to department store brands -- made this product even more attractive to me.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Comes off easy with baby oil.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara for the last decade. I just found out that they test their products on animals:( Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.  Does not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara in the world.  It is easy, reliable, and doesn&#x27;t clump my eye lashes together like some other brands.  Perfect for my everyday needs.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes the product and I liked the price, but it took 2 weeks to arrive instead of the promised 4 days.  Spend the extra fifty cents and have a happy wife!</li>
            <li> It is amazing, I love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for SEVERAL years.  I&#x27;ve tried SO many brands in between and ALWAYS come back to this.  It&#x27;s PERFECT.  It can be layered on for a more dramatic look or just a coat or two for daytime wear.  It NEVER clumps at all and from the second you open it, it&#x27;s the perfect texture...not super wet and clumpy.  You don&#x27;t have to wipe the wand off on the edges of the container before using it for the first week.  It&#x27;s awesome from the get go!  I have NEVER had this mascara run/smudge/smear either...even on super hot and humid summer days that include swimming!  I&#x27;ve tried to stray but always come back...I&#x27;ll be loyal to this brand for years to come...which is why I picked up several on Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li> I love it!!  As age is funning around with pieces of me at a time...my lashes are not what they used to be..so to find a soft, waterproof mascara that really does &#x27;full out the funning&#x27;...I say &amp;#34;I win!&amp;#34; Thank you Maybelline &amp; Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever! Doesn&#x27;t clump, smear, or flake.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Of all the mascaras I have tried, and I have tried many, this is the one that I keep coming back to. I don&#x27;t live someplace humid like some of the other reviewers, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it running. I put it on in the morning and it stays until I take it off at night. The brush is the best for giving you clump-free, natural-looking lashes. I do wish it came in brown, instead of just black and more black, but I&#x27;m very happy with the way it applies.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft is my favorite mascara ever. The full brush gets every lash and the formula allows to for multiple coats without getting stiff.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara but I can&#x27;t always find it in the stores when I need it. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry with auto-ship, I&#x27;ll never have to go from store to store looking for it again.</li>
            <li> love this brand. super fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Not as waterproof as other Maybelline mascaras that I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara! Never lets me down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably 10 years now... maybe longer. I&#x27;ve never found anything better.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras in my 50+ years and always go back to Great Lash or Full &#x27;n Soft. I need the waterproof as my eyes are always tearing. This mascara leaves lashes soooo soft and lengthens with only 1 coat, no flaking or smudging. Lasts ALL day without touch ups. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite. Doesn&#x27;t leave clumps and is very light. I can&#x27;t even feel it&#x27;s on like some other mascaras I&#x27;ve used. Gives great definition, length, and fullness. The name doesn&#x27;t lie!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for over 10 years...so that should tell you something. This mascara gives me beautiful, soft lashes without smudging or clumping. It works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied and definitely regret this purchase. I had to layer on over five coats for a noticeable difference on my lash length. The wand was slightly large, so the lashes would end up on my eyelids when I was applying on my lashes. But the biggest hassle of all was the fact that it was IMPOSSIBLE to remove. There was still a smidgen of mascara on my lashes even when I used my eye makeup remover wipes as well as my cleanser. Several lashes were lost in the process of trying to remove this mascara. Do not recommend when there are better waterproof mascaras out there.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. It&#x27;s my favorite. Fair price and great Amazon shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in the market for a new mascara I&#x27;ve tried cheap ones expensive ones I finally found this one and it&#x27;s a keeper. it&#x27;s waterproof but you could still get off at night and I feel like a coat my lashes really well</li>
            <li> This is my usual makeup purchase at the store. I l like the way my lashes look after one application. They look natural and usually the formula is smooth and does not clump. It is waterproof while swimming and out in intense heat. But ordering it through the mail was very dissappointing! The mascara was sticky and clumpy. I am not sure if it is because it was 5 degrees outside when it arrived; or that it may have been an older one that was shipped to me. I am going to think twice about ordering mascara through the mail.Otherwise I would give Full &#x27;N Soft a 5.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of mascaras from pricey ones through Clinique, DHC, and Estee Lauder to really cheap ones, but I keep coming back to the Full N Soft Mascara from Maybelline. It goes on with few clumps even when new and makes eyelashes stand out but not in a garish way. I have trouble finding this line in most stores like CVS, Walgreens and Wal-Mart as I think it sells out quickly. Was thrilled to see I could purchase by  a subscription service every 2 months via Amazon. Way to go Amazon! I just hope Maybelline doesn&#x27;t decide to do away with this one!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara. I keep trying others due to having a hard time finding it in brownish-black, and I keep throwing those out and going back to this. It is natural looking while adding length and volume without the crusty clumping and sticking the eyelashes together. It isn&#x27;t as waterproof as others but that&#x27;s why it s so soft. I&#x27;ve cried with it many times and as long as I dab instead of wiping, it stays put. Plus, it&#x27;s easy to wipe off. I just use coconut oil.</li>
            <li> As a triathlete and avid swimmer, I need a waterproof mascara that I can rely on. This mascara lives up to everything it promises and more! I first gave it the shower test and found that it stayed put, no smearing or raccoon eyes, there was some eyelash grouping that happened, but no breakdown of the product. I have since given it the pool test. Each time 1200-1800m swim (30-45min of pool time) PLUS showering after...I didn&#x27;t even have to re-apply! My mascara looked just as it had when I applied it earlier that day! It comes off easily with waterproof mascara remover (I use Almay Longwear &amp; Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover Pads). Compared to paying $20 for Cannonball mascara, this is a steal! I highly recommend this product and I have already ordered more!</li>
            <li> Great waterproof mascara at a great price. Soft and natural looking and perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look fantastic!  Only problem is that it smudges under my eyes throughout the day.  I&#x27;m going to buy an insanely expensive clear, waterproof topcoat to apply over this mascara to hopefully fix that issue.  It&#x27;s worth it.  No other mascara at any price point has ever made my lashes look so good.</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail mascara, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it for a few years. I&#x27;m using up all of the other crappy mascara that I have laying around, so I haven&#x27;t been on a real hunt for this stuff... But NOTHING has EVER compared to this mascara. I used this all the time when I lifeguarded at a waterpark. Co-workers always wondered how my makeup stayed perfect throughout the day (other female lifeguards would look like raccoons midway through the day), even though I was under water for a good portion of the day because I was usually on the rotation of lifeguarding in the wave pool, so I got smacked in the face with a huge wall of water every few minutes. This stuff NEVER BUDGED. It was amazing. When they say waterproof, they MEAN waterproof... But don&#x27;t worry about getting it off because it came off so nicely with a makeup remover! This mascara never clumped and it looked natural. When I was wearing this, people always asked me if my eyelashes were really that long and then they would be shocked when I told them that I was wearing mascara. If you can find this, use it. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. Once I get through all of these other mascaras that I have laying around (most of them were free), I&#x27;ll get back to using this one regularly when I can find it again!!!</li>
            <li> Product is very dry...like it&#x27;s old.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  It goes on easily and stays on throughout the day.  The one I use is the waterproof formula - I cannot say how the regular formula performs.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of mascaras. This one is nothing particularly special but it gets the job done, has a standard brush and doesn&#x27;t smudge too much unless you rub your eyes (I sometimes do) in that case, it will smudge.</li>
            <li> I bought this because most of he reviews said that it didn&#x27;t smudge but it definitely smudges on my face. I think it is mainly because I have a super oily face. After a few hours I got raccoon eyes. It isn&#x27;t super waterproof like some mascaras still look great after being in the shower or swimming, this one isn&#x27;t. But if you get teary eyes throughout the day it is still okay. Just not for oily face. It has a very natural look. I put one coat on and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes super volumizing or long but it still looks good. The tube is long but doesn&#x27;t seem like it contains that much product in it. It holds in curls and doesn&#x27;t make eyelashes brittle or flaky. It is definitely a lot softer than other mascaras and isn&#x27;t a really liquidy formula. I recommend to people that want a more natural look and doesn&#x27;t have a super oily face.</li>
            <li> Works well, it last really long. I have to really work to take it off!  It does clump a little, but not much at all. If I accidentally get some on my eye lid, it comes off easily before it sets up. Once it is set though, it lasts for a long time. I have been swimming, sweating, etc and it stays on.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.Keeps the curl in my lashes after I curl them as they are super straight.</li>
            <li> I have used better mascaras at this price point that do not leave splotchy black marks around my eyes (for example, sweating at the gym, not removing completely at night).</li>
            <li> love it waterproof is the best. I WOULD ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN</li>
            <li> I apply one to two coats of this mascara after curling my lashes. It applies as a dark black color and definitely adds length to my lashes. It&#x27;s not very volumizing but provides a nice look that&#x27;s not too dramatic. However, this mascara smudges and flakes a lot, which is why I won&#x27;t repurchase this item again. It&#x27;s easy to remove with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Formula is smooth and easy to apply, the brush is large, but not enough to be a problem to get into the corners of small eyes. My only complaint is that it is not completely waterproof. I can wear it all day and if it is hot outside or the humidity is high I get some smudges on my lower lid.</li>
            <li> Finally! This is a beautiful, basic, clean mascara!  No lump or clumps! So tired of all those others with fillers and fibers that always wind up in a mess.  Found this product on a product review website where it ranked in the top five mascaras ... right up there with the expensive stuff.  A bargain price for a beautiful product!</li>
