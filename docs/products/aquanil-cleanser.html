            <li>I love it and use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have used many many cleansers.  </li>
            <li>It removes eye makeup 100 times better than those makeup wipes you buy.  </li>
            <li>Wish the company would come up with a moister version because I think that might be helpful to many folks like me.</li>
            <li>I have suffered with Rosacea for many years.  </li>
            <li>It does, however, get you clean and does an amazing job getting stuff</li>
            <li>It is awesome that they ship their stuffs pretty fast.</li>
            <li>So I got this stuff based on the good reviews and because it was extremely mild and soap free, since I didn&#x27;t think my skin could tolerate any more harshness.</li>
            <li>This is a better substitute - cheap, lasts forever, and most importantly it works!</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>It is great at removing eye makeup and it leaves my face very soft.</li>
            <li>This product is probably fine for most people</li>
            <li>Ever since I haven&#x27;t had huge breakouts or a lot of redness :)</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin and people</li>
            <li>It was very effective on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who has suffered or suffering from acne or any other skin problems because it is so gentle and perfect for any skin types and also works best on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes.</li>

            <li>I will use this forever to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Aquanil is the most effective product I have found for calming red, inflamed skin.  </li>
            <li>It works very nicely when washing  your face and doesn&#x27;t dry it out!i like that it isn&#x27;t sudsy,I recommend it</li>
            <li>At the same time Aquanil does a a great job cleaning my oily forehead, so it *is* cleaning, just very gently.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face in nice and soft.</li>
            <li>researched and researched and Aquanil was the only one that had consistently good reviews</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean, no soapy residue.&lt;br /&gt;bb</li>
            <li>Super prompt shipping..</li>
            <li>Its mild, has no odor and is soap free which is a plus, but i do wear light makeup every day and this wasn&#x27;t enough to thoroughly clean it off every night.</li>
            <li>I was using it to remove my make up and didn&#x27;t have any success.</li>
            <li>Excellent facial cleanser, easy on dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still pretty impressive considering something like that can completely take off my very stubborn makeup, even if it does take 2 tries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that they both were of good quality, and helped my skin get back to normal.</li>
            <li>very dry, sensitive skin and this cleanser has been, by far, the best cleansing product I have used!</li>
            <li>Very mild for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for 5 or 6 years and it is very gentle and removes makeup well.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is very gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>I bought this because Fitbit suggested that I use it to clean my new Fitbit Charge HR band</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m pretty sure because this didn&#x27;t cleanse well enough and</li>
            <li>I had been using many of the same products on my face</li>
            <li>Tried many facial cleaners.</li>
            <li>as described - thanks!</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference from the first time I used this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin has never felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully gentle!</li>
            <li>I constantly need to wash my hands and since they are very dry this works great.</li>
            <li>This product works deeply leaving my face soft very clean , I use it every night ,I recommends for everyone looking for a clean radiant face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the hunt for another facial cleanser, but i&#x27;ll keep this only because it makes a good shaving lotion.</li>
            <li>I tried this per the positive comments posted.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I trust Amazon and do much of my on-line ordering from them.</li>
            <li>My rosacea tolerates this really well, too.  </li>
            <li>I will be making another purchase very soon.</li>
            <li>Gentle and cleanses.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleanser that cleans and refreshes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but thorough.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonable and</li>
            <li>It cleans really really well, but it is not damaging or drying to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and then rinse gently with water</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for something I&#x27;ll just wash off my face.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s just as gentle as Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and very sensitive skin, and if you&#x27;re in the same boat, you understand what a treat it is to wash your face and have it feel clean but calm, not irritated.</li>
            <li>Wow, I didn&#x27;t think there would be much of a difference in my skin between using this and Cetaphil, but the Aquanil really does do a better job of removing/preventing little blackheads on my face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps my daughter keep her skin clear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and light in your hands that it feels only slightly more substantial than the small amounts of water you need to dab your face with pre-use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Aquanil if you have sensitive, picky, particular skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is the first facial cleanser I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn my face scarlet or make my skin peel off.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this in our home for the past 7 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my Dermatologist for occasional eczema issues on my hands, and it really does the trick!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, irritable, rosacea-&amp;-eczema prone skin that hates everything I&#x27;ve tried except for this...</li>
            <li>My daughter have a sensitive skin and she have this marks likes flies</li>
            <li>This cleanser not only is gentle, but it works.</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived with a completely smashed pump head and the liquid was all over the shipping box and made it soggy...</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>but it does not irritate my face and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li>, Toleriane felt greasy, and every natural cleanser that I&#x27;ve tried has clogged my pores.</li>
            <li>I tried this after my dermatologist suggested one of Avene&#x27;s sensitive skin cleansers</li>
            <li>It is well worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used numerous different cleansers over the years, but this is the first that didn&#x27;t completely dry out my face and actually felt clean at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It is very economical, need very little to do the job.</li>
            <li>I have been using Aquanil Cleanser for about one month, have very sensitive skin, and I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>and I gave it to my acne-prone son and he came up two days later with a clear face!  </li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the DML Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 25.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re sufficiently wet enough, apply as much or as little of the soap as you want and you&#x27;ll barely be able to feel it once it&#x27;s in place.</li>
            <li>I just turned 40 and all of a sudden my skin is completely out of control.</li>
            <li>It is advertised as non-drying, but my fragile, sensitive skin needs moisture - and this product just didn&#x27;t have the needed levels for my situation.</li>
            <li>I have skin so porcelain and sensitive that even ancient Chinese pottery experts would be baffled by it.</li>
            <li>I know this because I gently ran a finger nail down my face after cleansing it with this stuff and there was makeup on my finger.</li>

            <li> i&#x27;m pretty sure because this didn&#x27;t cleanse well enough and</li>
            <li> I had been using many of the same products on my face</li>
            <li> Tried many facial cleaners.</li>
            <li> as described - thanks!</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference from the first time I used this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin has never felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderfully gentle!</li>
            <li> I constantly need to wash my hands and since they are very dry this works great.</li>
            <li> This product works deeply leaving my face soft very clean , I use it every night ,I recommends for everyone looking for a clean radiant face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the hunt for another facial cleanser, but i&#x27;ll keep this only because it makes a good shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> I tried this per the positive comments posted.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I trust Amazon and do much of my on-line ordering from them.</li>
            <li> My rosacea tolerates this really well, too.  </li>
            <li> I will be making another purchase very soon.</li>
            <li> Gentle and cleanses.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleanser that cleans and refreshes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but thorough.  </li>
            <li> It is reasonable and</li>
            <li> It cleans really really well, but it is not damaging or drying to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and then rinse gently with water</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for something I&#x27;ll just wash off my face.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s just as gentle as Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and very sensitive skin, and if you&#x27;re in the same boat, you understand what a treat it is to wash your face and have it feel clean but calm, not irritated.</li>
            <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t think there would be much of a difference in my skin between using this and Cetaphil, but the Aquanil really does do a better job of removing/preventing little blackheads on my face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps my daughter keep her skin clear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and light in your hands that it feels only slightly more substantial than the small amounts of water you need to dab your face with pre-use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Aquanil if you have sensitive, picky, particular skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleanser I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn my face scarlet or make my skin peel off.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this in our home for the past 7 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist for occasional eczema issues on my hands, and it really does the trick!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, irritable, rosacea-&amp;-eczema prone skin that hates everything I&#x27;ve tried except for this...</li>
            <li> My daughter have a sensitive skin and she have this marks likes flies</li>
            <li> This cleanser not only is gentle, but it works.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived with a completely smashed pump head and the liquid was all over the shipping box and made it soggy...</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> but it does not irritate my face and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li> , Toleriane felt greasy, and every natural cleanser that I&#x27;ve tried has clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> I tried this after my dermatologist suggested one of Avene&#x27;s sensitive skin cleansers</li>
            <li> It is well worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous different cleansers over the years, but this is the first that didn&#x27;t completely dry out my face and actually felt clean at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It is very economical, need very little to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aquanil Cleanser for about one month, have very sensitive skin, and I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> and I gave it to my acne-prone son and he came up two days later with a clear face!  </li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the DML Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 25.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re sufficiently wet enough, apply as much or as little of the soap as you want and you&#x27;ll barely be able to feel it once it&#x27;s in place.</li>
            <li> I just turned 40 and all of a sudden my skin is completely out of control.</li>
            <li> It is advertised as non-drying, but my fragile, sensitive skin needs moisture - and this product just didn&#x27;t have the needed levels for my situation.</li>
            <li> I have skin so porcelain and sensitive that even ancient Chinese pottery experts would be baffled by it.</li>
            <li> I know this because I gently ran a finger nail down my face after cleansing it with this stuff and there was makeup on my finger.</li>
            <li> I go through those bottles way too fast and a bottle is usually $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and generally only wear a little eye makeup and tinted sunscreen on my face.  </li>
            <li> This was the only one that didn&#x27;t dry the skin and did not cause redness or wrinkling.</li>
            <li> it cleans your face and doesn&#x27;t over dry it, which can actually cause pimples.  </li>
            <li> Feels like silk, foams slightly, works beautifully with my clarisonic deep pore brush, and NEVER feels tight, dry, or painful afterwards.</li>
            <li> nevera greasy film and doenst dry out her skin</li>
            <li> And it almost cleared up acne, dryness and dry spot around the eyes.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist for my dry skin</li>
            <li> It seems the last few weeks I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing worked and the toughest concealer wasn&#x27;t enough to hide it.</li>
            <li> I usually get it for free (medical insurance), but was in a pinch and unable to refill my script</li>
            <li> I put it on without water and then wipe off with a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Along with the breakout, I was getting welts and redness on my cheeks, and the skin was uncomfortable and hot to touch.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist reccomended this for me due to my rosacea.</li>
            <li> Due to the reviews I was hoping this would help me with my issue.</li>
            <li> My face never has redness from other cleansers that I&#x27;ve used with water.  </li>
            <li> Each press of the pump delivers just under half a teaspoon of cleanser, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have NO WRINKLES due at least in part to twice daily cleansing with Aquanil lotion.  </li>
            <li> To make matters a little worse, I started getting white heads (milia) around my cheek and chin area..</li>
            <li> A few days a week I add a pinch of baking soda and use it as a scrub.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me a few ears ago for my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup wearer and my esthetician recommended I use a milk cleanser to remove my makeup instead of harsh cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I broke out after using this for a few days.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil and Cerave dried and irritated my skin</li>
            <li> I started checking out facial cleansers on Amazon because, in my late 20&#x27;s I&#x27;m experiencing yet again some terrible break outs like I did back in high school.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a small sample of this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Not very good for treat acne.</li>
            <li> I completely hated it, so, I bounced back and forth between CeraVe and Aquanil, since I only had the sample bottles.</li>
            <li> Using it for 25 years at least.</li>
            <li> At the very least STOP using soap on your face.  </li>
            <li> I found Cetaphil irritating</li>
            <li> My face get worse after a month of using this product.</li>
            <li> off my skin without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> So, needless to say, finding a soap that doesn&#x27;t irritate it can be a baffling chore.</li>
            <li> Tired of unpleasant soaps with weird fragrances and color additives and grainy suds?</li>
            <li> After I had really bad damaged skin from using benzoyl peroxide products for my acne..</li>
            <li> We were both shocked!  </li>
            <li> Broke out horribly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this because Fitbit suggested that I use it to clean my new Fitbit Charge HR band and I did not want to go to th store looking for it.  Fitbit also recommended Cetaphil but I decided to go with Aquanil to see what it was like and  I love it.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist suggested I use this and I really like it. A few days a week I add a pinch of baking soda and use it as a scrub. It makes my skin really smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> Both my dermatologist and my facialist recommended Aquanil. I have been using it for 5 or 6 years and it is very gentle and removes makeup well. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes. Great for sensitive skin. Highly recommend it. I trust Amazon and do much of my on-line ordering from them.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist instead of soap after I had some skin problems (rash under and around my eye)this winter.  Since using Aquanil, my skin has improved and I no longer use soap at all on my face.  I put it on without water and then wipe off with a wet wash cloth. The skin on my face in nice and soft. I am grateful that my dermatologist suggested this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser.  I&#x27;ve used numerous different cleansers over the years, but this is the first that didn&#x27;t completely dry out my face and actually felt clean at the same time.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> product was recommended by my dermatologist and was happy to find that I could order through Amazon....was great on my face and I gave it to my acne-prone son and he came up two days later with a clear face!  We were both shocked!  Product is awesome!</li>
            <li> After I had really bad damaged skin from using benzoyl peroxide products for my acne..i finally gave up after my face was so sore that it would sting and turn red after only splashing with water! i went to the dermatologist, and since i had such severe sensitivity..he gave me a bunch of samples such as cetaphil, CeraVe, and Aquanil, plus some topical medication for acne. Cetaphil..I completely hated it, so, I bounced back and forth between CeraVe and Aquanil, since I only had the sample bottles. I&#x27;d say that they both were of good quality, and helped my skin get back to normal. I probably would have bought the Aquanil and gave it 5 stars, if it didn&#x27;t have SLS in it though.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist, and my face LOVES it.  I have sensitive, irritable, rosacea-&amp;-eczema prone skin that hates everything I&#x27;ve tried except for this... it makes my skin look good and feel great.  My rosacea tolerates this really well, too.  Highly recommend Aquanil if you have sensitive, picky, particular skin.</li>
            <li> The product works as stated, and I have had no problems at all with it. I will be making another purchase very soon.</li>
            <li> I started checking out facial cleansers on Amazon because, in my late 20&#x27;s I&#x27;m experiencing yet again some terrible break outs like I did back in high school. It seems the last few weeks I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing worked and the toughest concealer wasn&#x27;t enough to hide it. Along with the breakout, I was getting welts and redness on my cheeks, and the skin was uncomfortable and hot to touch. So I got this stuff based on the good reviews and because it was extremely mild and soap free, since I didn&#x27;t think my skin could tolerate any more harshness. Its mild, has no odor and is soap free which is a plus, but i do wear light makeup every day and this wasn&#x27;t enough to thoroughly clean it off every night. I know this because I gently ran a finger nail down my face after cleansing it with this stuff and there was makeup on my finger. To make matters a little worse, I started getting white heads (milia) around my cheek and chin area.. i&#x27;m pretty sure because this didn&#x27;t cleanse well enough and my pores we just backing up with junk. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for another facial cleanser, but i&#x27;ll keep this only because it makes a good shaving lotion. I guess thats a benefit.</li>
            <li> Great product, gentle on the face. Won&#x27;t use anything else to clean my face. I had the product within the week of ordering. Excellant Service.</li>
            <li> I love this face cleanser.  Two dermatologists have recommended Aquanil.  It is everything it is supposed to be.  Gentle and cleanses.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for me.  It&#x27;s really great - I feel I&#x27;m taking good care of my face all the time.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my daughter keep her skin clear.  She had a stubborn bout of acne and her doctor tried all kinds of prescriptions, finally referred to a dermatologist.  The derm suggested this, and it did the trick.  She gave her a prescription cream just in case and my daughter doesn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Very mild for sensitive skin.  Good for rosacea. Oil-free.  Leaves my skin very soft.  I found Cetaphil irritating but this never is.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes either.  I expect to buy this forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquanil for years because my dermatologist recommends it.  I figure he knows what he is talking about.  Every now and then I switch to something else, but always come back to Aquanil.  Highly recommend.  Love the pump.</li>
            <li> Great price-- great shipping!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had been using a DCL cleansing lotion recommended by my dermatologist.  I find this product even better. It leaves my skin smoother and, best of all, it relieves itching.</li>
            <li> Great!!  Love this stuff. Have been using for over a year now.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for me as I have roseacea &amp; my skin is looking so much better.  Younger too!</li>
            <li> A great cleanser for all skin types at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Excellent for rosacea and chemical sensitivities. Works beautifully. This is the first facial cleanser I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn my face scarlet or make my skin peel off. Each press of the pump delivers just under half a teaspoon of cleanser, and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist reccomended this for me due to my rosacea. Ever since I haven&#x27;t had huge breakouts or a lot of redness :)</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years. Gentle cleanser that cleans and refreshes. Recommended by a dermatologist and have used since.</li>
            <li> I tried this per the positive comments posted. I had been using many of the same products on my face the others have commented on, and wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results.  I have been using Aquanil Cleanser for about one month, have very sensitive skin, and I definitely recommend. I also highly recommend the DML Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 25.</li>
            <li> This product works deeply leaving my face soft very clean , I use it every night ,I recommends for everyone looking for a clean radiant face</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best facial cleanser I have ever used.  It&#x27;s gentle but thorough.  I&#x27;ve used it exclusively for 20 years.  I am 61 years old and generally only wear a little eye makeup and tinted sunscreen on my face.  I have NO WRINKLES due at least in part to twice daily cleansing with Aquanil lotion.  I will use this forever to clean my face.</li>
            <li> My daughter have a sensitive skin and she have this marks likes flies bite, and with this cream this marks have been gone.!!! I recommended!!</li>
            <li> Excellent facial cleanser, easy on dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this product and I love it.  It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean, no soapy residue.&lt;br /&gt;bb</li>
            <li> It works very nicely when washing  your face and doesn&#x27;t dry it out!i like that it isn&#x27;t sudsy,I recommend it</li>
            <li> Tried many facial cleaners. This was the only one that didn&#x27;t dry the skin and did not cause redness or wrinkling. Will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is well worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> as described - thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  This went with Aquanil and I took a change on this stuff and love it.  It is reasonable and it works.&lt;br /&gt;I will order agrain</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me a few ears ago for my rosacea. I love it and use it twice a day. I especially like the way you don&#x27;t need to use water with it. I rub it all over my face and eyes and use a paper towel to wipe it off. It is great at removing eye makeup and it leaves my face very soft. I&#x27;m looking for a smaller size for traveling.</li>
            <li> Aquanil leaves my face feeling good, no harsh soap that drys out the skin. My Dermatologist recommended this. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> my daughter has been using this product for years and loves it. nevera greasy film and doenst dry out her skin</li>
            <li> My face get worse after a month of using this product. Not very good for treat acne.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry itchy skin.  Recommended by my dermatologist.  Shipping prompt.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference from the first time I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used many many cleansers.  This cleanser not only is gentle, but it works. It removes eye makeup 100 times better than those makeup wipes you buy.  It is very economical, need very little to do the job.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to everything.  My dermatologist prescribed this for me, and it has helped my skin quite a bit.  I usually get it for free (medical insurance), but was in a pinch and unable to refill my script so I had this sent to my parent&#x27;s house.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used this cleanser before, be warned it isn&#x27;t something you can use on a loofah and I doubt a washcloth would work well.  It does, however, get you clean and does an amazing job getting stuff (ie: deodorant) off my skin without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> dermatologist told me to use--this was great price</li>
            <li> It was very effective on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really great when I had irritated skin.  It cleans really really well, but it is not damaging or drying to the skin.  No residue because this is a lipid free cleaner.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a small sample of this cleanser. And it almost cleared up acne, dryness and dry spot around the eyes. I had to purchase it again when i ran out so, I ordered it at night and they sent it to me in the next day morning. It is awesome that they ship their stuffs pretty fast. I recommend this product to anyone who has suffered or suffering from acne or any other skin problems because it is so gentle and perfect for any skin types and also works best on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this in our home for the past 7 years and love it.  A derm doc recommend it, and we haven&#x27;t looked back.  Great enough for sensitive skin, great for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I used to use Cetaphil&#x27;s cleanser, but when I decided to try to cut back on parabens on my skin, I discovered Aquanil and haven&#x27;t looked back. It&#x27;s wonderfully gentle! I have rosacea and very sensitive skin, and if you&#x27;re in the same boat, you understand what a treat it is to wash your face and have it feel clean but calm, not irritated. At the same time Aquanil does a a great job cleaning my oily forehead, so it *is* cleaning, just very gently.</li>
            <li> It is a good waterless hand cleaner.  I constantly need to wash my hands and since they are very dry this works great.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived with a completely smashed pump head and the liquid was all over the shipping box and made it soggy... I had to return it.</li>
            <li> this product was actually recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dermatologist... we get it WAY cheaper from Amazon</li>
            <li> Super prompt shipping..I blinked and it was here! I love this item, my dermatologist recommended it and it is very gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Due to the reviews I was hoping this would help me with my issue. I just turned 40 and all of a sudden my skin is completely out of control. I have never had acne like this in my life!!! This along with the HC had great reviews but unforturnately didn&#x27;t work for me. They were great in the sense that they didn&#x27;t break out my sensative skin but they didn&#x27;t help me get rid of the acne as others had luck with. Oh well!</li>
            <li> I am rating this a 3 because the product did not perform the way I had hoped, although I think that for most people it would be excellent. It is advertised as non-drying, but my fragile, sensitive skin needs moisture - and this product just didn&#x27;t have the needed levels for my situation. Wish the company would come up with a moister version because I think that might be helpful to many folks like me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist for occasional eczema issues on my hands, and it really does the trick!</li>
            <li> Broke out horribly.  Have rosacea...was so hoping once again for a miracle.  This burned as was applied too.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Aquanil cleanser. It is silky smooth and cleaning was so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good. Love it!!! Using it for 25 years at least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a milky cleanser for my face. I&#x27;m a makeup wearer and my esthetician recommended I use a milk cleanser to remove my makeup instead of harsh cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I used Say Yes to Cucumbers Milk Cleanser, which works AMAZING! The downside is the price, and the quantity you get for the price. I go through those bottles way too fast and a bottle is usually $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched and researched and Aquanil was the only one that had consistently good reviews so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was big, which I like a lot. The consistency is similar to the milk cleanser, but not quite, only because I know it&#x27;s not meant to be a milk cleanser. It completely takes off my makeup, but I docked off one star because it takes 2 tries to get it out. It&#x27;s still pretty impressive considering something like that can completely take off my very stubborn makeup, even if it does take 2 tries. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have suffered with Rosacea for many years.  Aquanil is the most effective product I have found for calming red, inflamed skin.  I saw results almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Title says it all! Thirty years of searching for this type of product; been using it for two full years and am still thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> I have skin so porcelain and sensitive that even ancient Chinese pottery experts would be baffled by it. So, needless to say, finding a soap that doesn&#x27;t irritate it can be a baffling chore. Enter: Aquanil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is, honestly, perfect. It&#x27;s so soft and light in your hands that it feels only slightly more substantial than the small amounts of water you need to dab your face with pre-use. Once you&#x27;re sufficiently wet enough, apply as much or as little of the soap as you want and you&#x27;ll barely be able to feel it once it&#x27;s in place. Scrub to your heart&#x27;s content- no abrasive soap suds here- and then rinse gently with water and you&#x27;re done. It&#x27;s like an odorless, colorless waft of air just hit your face, not a state of the art soap product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have sensitive skin? Tired of unpleasant soaps with weird fragrances and color additives and grainy suds? Then this is the cleanser for you. It feels like a delightful cloud passing across your skin. Except, y&#x27;know, cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin and this cleanser has been, by far, the best cleansing product I have used!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to remove all traces of makeup but it does not irritate my face and leaves it so soft. I can finally wash my face without looking like a tomato afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 30 years.  It is the best on the market.  Anyone considering this product should give it a try.  At the very least STOP using soap on your face.  No one can guess my age by my facial skin.</li>
            <li> This product is probably fine for most people but I have very sensitive skin and I broke out after using this for a few days.</li>
            <li> like it use it every morning</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist.  I use hazel witch astringent to remove oil, then I rub this in just like a lotion...no washing with water...it cleans your face and doesn&#x27;t over dry it, which can actually cause pimples.  My face never has redness from other cleansers that I&#x27;ve used with water.  Great for sensitive skin and people prone to break outs.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever tried. Cetaphil and Cerave dried and irritated my skin, Toleriane felt greasy, and every natural cleanser that I&#x27;ve tried has clogged my pores. My face loves this! Feels like silk, foams slightly, works beautifully with my clarisonic deep pore brush, and NEVER feels tight, dry, or painful afterwards. Best of all - no clogging! I tried this after my dermatologist suggested one of Avene&#x27;s sensitive skin cleansers but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for something I&#x27;ll just wash off my face. This is a better substitute - cheap, lasts forever, and most importantly it works! Hope they never stop making it! Thanks for all the great reviews here that convinced me to try it!</li>
            <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t think there would be much of a difference in my skin between using this and Cetaphil, but the Aquanil really does do a better job of removing/preventing little blackheads on my face. And it&#x27;s just as gentle as Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> There is just a nice feel to this very gently, light weight, non-greasy cleanser that leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist for my dry skin and I do like it.</li>
            <li> This is very gentle on my face. It is also a very good value</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the texture of this lotion. I was using it to remove my make up and didn&#x27;t have any success. I would wash my face with it, then use Bioderma Sensibio H2O and I could see all the makeup I had left on my face. I gave it to a friend that uses it in the morning.</li>
