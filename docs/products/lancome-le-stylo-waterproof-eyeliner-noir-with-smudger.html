            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this new waterpoof eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>great color... really soft touch...  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and to remove.</li>
            <li>I have oily eyes and with a primer and this particular liner, I&#x27;m all good.</li>
            <li>Ok as the lead breaks very easily &amp; smudges a bit too much for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After much research for a good waterpoof eyeliner, I&#x27;m very pleased at how long it stays on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with much cheaper drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>just ran out quickly..</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays on all day until I&#x27;m ready to take it off.  </li>
            <li>No damage to your thin eyes skin, so makes it perfect for all purposes.</li>
            <li>Thank you Lancome, and the price was really reasonable!</li>
            <li>A very satified customer I will keep ordering from you to include your super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Wound to much out</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fix that much, and what else do you want from a eyeliner??</li>
            <li>smudges very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon &amp; the vendor I purchased from.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>you happen to take a dip in the pool it stays fairly well with no Alice Cooper effect (which is usually a mascara issue anyway), but also washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be spending money on the product not to mention the shipping cost was high as well.</li>
            <li>look os complete!!</li>
            <li>Love the Lancôme waterproof long lasting eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I bought it in black, and the color came out looking gray because the color pigments your skin so lightly.</li>
            <li>i´m used to Dior, which is really soft and creamy ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extramly soft and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had thus far</li>
            <li>Applies smoothly and last longer then the other eyeliner I formally used.</li>
            <li>In general , I love Lancome, but this product is very disappointing and doesn&#x27;t worth that quite high price !</li>
            <li>Not used to such soft liners.</li>
            <li>If is it a Lancome, then, I&#x27;m surprised with the low quality...</li>
            <li>I barely got any product for the price.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily eye lids and by 2:00pm in humid , sunny Florida, my previous eye shadow and liner just melt and slime off.  </li>

            <li> It really is long lasting and waterproof!</li>
            <li> It stays on longer, glides on nicely, can be applied in a thin or thick line, and comes in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Additionally, to keep it on all day I don&#x27;t have to brush a tiny layer of dark eyeshadow over it unless I just want to boost the color darker or add another tint.</li>
            <li> This is the only waterproof eyeliner I can wear that doesn&#x27;t melt down my face here in South Alabama with our humidity.  </li>
            <li> Definately not what i expected from lancome brand.</li>
            <li> So be careful</li>
            <li> Product was almost empty..</li>
            <li> You never have to sharpen it and the smudger at the other end</li>
            <li> It does not go on dark, and it faded from my eyes within an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> It has smudged 1 hour after applying and the black shade I&#x27;ve bought  </li>
            <li> I use this item nearly everyday now.</li>
            <li> i have been a fan of Lancome eye products for years--and this eyeliner did not let me down!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this eyeliner is neither waterproof nor long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this liner.  </li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I was very disappointed in this eyeliner.  </li>

            <li> Love the Lancôme waterproof long lasting eyeliner. I am ordering another today. Applies smoothly and last longer then the other eyeliner I formally used.</li>
            <li> My impatience caused me to not like this product. Wound to much out then it fell off. Not used to such soft liners. I did put on &amp; I like it alot. Give it a chance too. Happy with it! P.s. Tryna remove my rating under diress. lol</li>
            <li> great color... really soft touch...  i´m used to Dior, which is really soft and creamy ... but this lancome is also really great !! i loved it !!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fix that much, and what else do you want from a eyeliner?? If is it a Lancome, then, I&#x27;m surprised with the low quality...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this eyeliner is neither waterproof nor long-lasting. It has smudged 1 hour after applying and the black shade I&#x27;ve bought  wasn&#x27;t deep at all, it was gray. In general , I love Lancome, but this product is very disappointing and doesn&#x27;t worth that quite high price !The only benefit is that it seems to be hypoallergenic.  I would not recommend it...</li>
            <li> I love this eye pencil.  You never have to sharpen it and the smudger at the other end gives you a perfect smokey eye look every time.  Plus it stays on for hours because its waterproof.  great pencil and it comes in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Love the eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t run by lunch time. It stays in place without smudging and disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Definately not what i expected from lancome brand. smudges very well. Maybe it will be different for you. I have asian eyes.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I was very disappointed in this eyeliner.  It does not go on dark, and it faded from my eyes within an hour or so.  I bought it in black, and the color came out looking gray because the color pigments your skin so lightly. I&#x27;ve had better luck with much cheaper drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I use this item nearly everyday now. It has great color. 2 thing have to remind people. It&#x27;s extramly soft and not water prove. So be careful</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon &amp; the vendor I purchased from.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Ok as the lead breaks very easily &amp; smudges a bit too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was asked if this was for one or two pencils, answer is one.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps♥</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this new waterpoof eyeliner.  It goes on smoothly and stays on all day until I&#x27;m ready to take it off.  I have very oily eye lids and by 2:00pm in humid , sunny Florida, my previous eye shadow and liner just melt and slime off.  Not with this product! After much research for a good waterpoof eyeliner, I&#x27;m very pleased at how long it stays on.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and to remove. No damage to your thin eyes skin, so makes it perfect for all purposes.</li>
            <li> Adoro marca e seus produtos! O produto é maravilhoso de alta qualidade , possui uma variedade de opções de produtos e cores!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this liner.  It worked for about a week and stopped working.  I barely got any product for the price.  I don&#x27;t know if it was defective but I won&#x27;t be spending money on the product not to mention the shipping cost was high as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner. It really is long lasting and waterproof! I have oily eyes and with a primer and this particular liner, I&#x27;m all good. I will purchase it again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been buying Clinique after years of using MaryKay. Both these brands are good. This one, though, by Lancome outdoes them both. It stays on longer, glides on nicely, can be applied in a thin or thick line, and comes in a variety of colors. Additionally, to keep it on all day I don&#x27;t have to brush a tiny layer of dark eyeshadow over it unless I just want to boost the color darker or add another tint. Because I&#x27;m fair-skinned I choose cafe (similar to brown/black) to avoid any suggestion of raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to take a dip in the pool it stays fairly well with no Alice Cooper effect (which is usually a mascara issue anyway), but also washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> La mercancia es de buena calidad, y llego a tiempo segun lo establecido en el sistema. Lo recomiendo ... Venezuela</li>
            <li> Arrived within a couple of days and it stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve had thus far</li>
            <li> LANCOME you are the leading in makeup products the Waterproof is the best I have tried so far and believe me I have tried them all. Thanks Amazon your lead in providing your customers with the best quality products thank you once again. A very satified customer I will keep ordering from you to include your super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I play sports and therefore sweat a lot. In the end of the day this eyeliner stays like freshly applied and perfect. Love it!</li>
            <li> though i do not use it, it seems good. the package is good and the stuff looks fine. nice eyeliner</li>
            <li> This is water proof magic! Thank you Lancome, and the price was really reasonable! Everything it said it is, Micky D&#x27;s I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> Product was almost empty..&lt;br /&gt;The color was good&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is waterproof is excellent&lt;br /&gt;I just ran out quickly..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make it for a blonde..</li>
            <li> Still ran in the corner of my eyes. I had hopes it would last through out my work day.  Didn&#x27;t seem to be as waterproof as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> i have been a fan of Lancome eye products for years--and this eyeliner did not let me down!! it glides on and won&#x27;t come off until you take it off!! i strongly recommend the best eye makeup remover-also made by Lancome and sold on Amazon. this liner is so smooth and easy to use!! just glide it in along the lash line, follow it up with Lancome Hyponose mascara and your vixen look os complete!! ALWAYS in my make up bag!!</li>
            <li> This is the only waterproof eyeliner I can wear that doesn&#x27;t melt down my face here in South Alabama with our humidity.  Love it.  Way cheaper on Amazon than at the lancome counter.</li>
