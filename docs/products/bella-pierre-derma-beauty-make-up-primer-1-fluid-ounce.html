            <li>It really gives your skin a smooth finish.</li>

            <li>I was hesitant at first, but one try was all I needed to know this is the secret to flawless skin.</li>
            <li>I first tried Bella Pierre primer when I was stopped by one of those girls at the mall selling the cosmetics.</li>
            <li>This one really works!  </li>
            <li>I tried the primer first time after reading reviews and ordering it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>Made me break out and no different than cheap stuff at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Also it makes my skin just feel very nourished and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This product is very lite.</li>
            <li>The other thing I love about this product is that it is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This primer does not make me break out at all, and it helps the foundation go on smoothly over dry areas of my skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, ultra moisturizing and really helps mineral foundation last the entire day!</li>
            <li>light, silky, long lasting</li>
            <li>Give a nice, smooth look without caking or feeling heavy or greasy, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every high end primer from Saphora, Ulta and Estee Lauder, and Bella Pierre Primer is by far above any competitor in quality and price.  </li>
            <li>I recently had to purchase a new foundation and decided to buy the primer since it was on sale.</li>

            <li> Iʻd rate this a 5 but I started breaking out with it.  Tried it 2 different times for several days hoping it wasnʻt the product causing my breakout, but turned out it was.  Feels very good on the skin though.</li>
            <li> I tried this primer at a kiosk at the mall. Although I didn&#x27;t buy it at time, I really liked the way it made my skin feel and how the makeup looked with it; this was about a year ago. I recently had to purchase a new foundation and decided to buy the primer since it was on sale. I have to say, I love this product. It&#x27;s small, but a little goes a long way! I only use a dab of it. It makes your skin feel incredibly soft and the foundation goes on smoothly and nicely afterwards. I have acne prone skin (I am seeing a dermatologist, am on antibiotics, cream medicine, and will be on accutane shortly), so I am very careful as to what I put on my face. This primer does not make me break out at all, and it helps the foundation go on smoothly over dry areas of my skin. I would definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing through amazon when I need a refill!</li>
            <li> I first tried Bella Pierre primer when I was stopped by one of those girls at the mall selling the cosmetics. I liked the make up, but this primer is what sold me! The second it touched my skin, it made feel like silk! I love this stuff! The other thing I love about this product is that it is gentle on my sensitive skin. Since using this (and bella pierre make up) I have not had any bad breakouts. It also fights fine lines &amp; aging. The only down side is the price &amp; the size of the jar. You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot. I used this everyday &amp; it lasted 2 months. I just ordered my second jar today. I will keep buying this primer because I can trust that it works with my skin.</li>
            <li> awesome..very light..definitely order some more..</li>
            <li> Not a fan of any of Bella&#x27;s products aside from their foundation and bronzer that is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve tried their facial products and wasn&#x27;t happy. Made me break out and no different than cheap stuff at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I love this primer and am so glad I found it here on Amazon.  I originally purchased at the mall a couple years ago and loved how it felt on my face.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation, but use the Bella Pierre mineral powder.  This stuff is really awesome.  Give a nice, smooth look without caking or feeling heavy or greasy, and a little goes a long way.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love Bella Pierre makeup primer!  This one really works!  Put it on your skin, last thing after your moisturizer, and let it sit there for a few minutes before applying makeup.  My makeup lasts all day and into the evening hours.  Also it makes my skin just feel very nourished and moisturized.  The look after applying your makeup is fabulous!  You really can tell the difference in the way your makeup looks on your skin and how long your makeup stays in place!!</li>
            <li> I tried the primer first time after reading reviews and ordering it on Amazon. The results were amazing. Leaves my skin soft and smooth, making the mineral foundation glide easily and stay put for hours. Love it! Plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a really good base for mineral makeup foundation powder.  Your makeup stays all day even in heat and humidity.  It really gives your skin a smooth finish.</li>

            <li> I was hesitant at first, but one try was all I needed to know this is the secret to flawless skin. Makes my Bella Pierre Mineral Foundation brush on like silk. My overall skin tone has improved since I started using this line of products. Love them!</li>
            <li> It is the greatest to put under your makeup as it makes your skin very smooth and feeling good. Also tighten your pores</li>
            <li> This product is very lite. Its not heavy at all and does add a lil moisture especially when I have dry patches on my face. I would definitely recommed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for every skin type!</li>
            <li> This is the finest base I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Goes on smooth, ultra moisturizing and really helps mineral foundation last the entire day!</li>
            <li> Wear it right before foundation.  The difference is noticeable.</li>
            <li> Under makeup, this product makes your skin flawless, and allows for longer wear of most any foundation for over 15 hours still looking matte and freshly applied,never even needing to powder after a long day of heat, humidity and sweat.

            <li> light, silky, long lasting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this makeup primer for 3-4 years and I haven&#x27;t looked back since. I have oily skin and large pores. With this product, my face remains shine free at the end of the day. My pores have also gone down in size over the years. I&#x27;m a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome primer I have ever used.  I have combination skin and he keeps the oily spots from separating my make-up.  It goes on very smoothly and it a perfect primer for velvet make-up application.  I am on my 3rd container and will never do without it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I can wear this alone to help even out lines in face. It goes in easy, no breaks out on my acne probe skin after wearing this product and it really does make a difference using this product under makeup</li>
            <li> Fantastic product...a little goes a long way!</li>
