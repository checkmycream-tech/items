    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>ANEW GENICS IS ONE OF THE BEST FACE CREAMS</li>
            <li>IF PERFECT FOR MY SKIN TYPE!</li>
            <li>I think that is a great selling point as well as the age repair!</li>
            <li>Anew did a wonderful job moisturizing and evening skin tone around the area applied, but that&#x27;s not why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Very good price.</li>
            <li>It is a very good cream</li>
            <li>Not always have the access to an Avon Representative, so this online rep was a great find.  </li>
            <li>I know Avon makes really great</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>This is a very nice cream.</li>
            <li>But one star for being a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product but doesn&#x27;t compare to this one, for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced better results from drugstore skincare.  </li>
            <li>well, even better than that!</li>
            <li>I honestly did not see or feel any change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many and liked some of them</li>
            <li>and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Love love this product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more of this.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and the color is more uniform.  </li>
            <li>have tried probably thousands of dollars in skin care products, I was even a Mary Kay rep for over a decade and used to swear by them until I realized that Olay Pro-X gave me better skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THAT THIS CREAM HAS GLYCOLIC ACID.  </li>
            <li>Ok ... I think anything will fall short compared to DIOR ONE because that one is a miracle cream that takes effect after one use ( a bit pricey so my search goes on for a great miracle cream that is not a budget buster)!</li>
            <li>(I stopped using DIOR ONE for a week before I started using ANEW to be able to see the effect).  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I can feel my skin becomes much better in looking.</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular product since it first came out and still am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks a lot better, brighter, smooth, firmer.</li>
            <li>IT TRULY TAKES AWAY FINE LINES.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll use those products from time to time or just leave them alone and take a huge loss.  </li>
            <li>Amazing item fast delivery AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li>Theproduct is fabulous..</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe that AVON of all companies, has such an effective skin care system!</li>
            <li>Lol now just to figure out a way for you to pay a little more and buy it legitimately from me</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think this is anything special.</li>
            <li>I love the product but really noticed it evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy night moisturizer, nicely scented.</li>
            <li>NOT BAD</li>
            <li>ANEW GENICS is not bad though, after 5 days of use I started noticing that my skin is brighter and softer</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>no problems&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks Avon!!</li>
            <li>The left eye that I used the Estee Lauder product, looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Honestly since then my texture has not improved further, it sort of plateaued</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I love even more that it competes with the Lancome Genifique and wins HANDS DOWN over results and price.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this cream after a coworker showed me an article about the \\&quot;breakthrough\\&quot; ingredients that are now in a lot of new products, including this one.  </li>
            <li>It tightens pretty well.</li>
            <li>[...] I guess we are all trying to figure out how to pay our higher grocery costs to feed my kids somehow.</li>
            <li>First time user for this product</li>
            <li>I have been an Avon rep in the past, and found that despite my Avon bias (I find their makeup to be horrid, with the exception of their mascara), I love the Anew products for the most part.</li>
            <li>This is a great product but it&#x27;s way to thick for me.</li>
            <li>, I thought my sensitive skin will not be comfortable for this product.</li>
            <li>I am sure that this product would be better served on women who are just beginning the aging  process rather than in the late stages of aging...</li>
            <li>Trust me, I was very reluctant at first, but I&#x27;m now a BELIEVER.    </li>
            <li>The fine lines around the eye I used the Anew, look exactly the same as it did before treatment.  </li>
            <li>I can see a slight difference and its only been about 2 days!!Feels great on your skin..</li>
            <li>BUT DONT SEE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE FROM NOT USING IT.</li>
            <li>I really like the Avon Genics...</li>
            <li>Thanks Avon</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY MOISTURIZING WITHOUT BEING GREASY.</li>
            <li>I had angel kisses that have really faded after about 2 weeks use.</li>
            <li>Straight from the avon rule book::Online auctions, markets and outlets --</li>
            <li>My daughter says nothing really works, but it can&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks Avon for assisting me in aging gracefully.....</li>
            <li>really like what this product does for my skin and how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a night cream I&#x27;ve been using a long time that soothes my skin, and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended along with the serum.</li>
            <li>I am 50 yrs old and really have no wrinkles.</li>
            <li>With few exceptions, every Anew product I&#x27;ve tried (including their age-specific line) has done what it says it will, and more.</li>
            <li>BUT IT&#x27;S SO TINY, ONLY ONE OUNCE, AND IT DOESN&#x27;T SPREAD AS EASILY</li>
            <li>I tried Genics on my right eye and a Estee Lauder nighttime advance oil on my left, for over a month.  </li>
            <li>and I love this product, at least as much as that.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that product that is not purchased from an Avon Representative could potentially be expired, stolen or counterfeit.</li>
            <li>Besides, this leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I was anxious to try the Genics and LOVE the consistency, texture, and how it applies.</li>
            <li>My skin did look and feel younger and the positive effect is noticeable, it just took about a week</li>
            <li>I bought the first bottle a few months ago accidentally, but I did not use it right way</li>
            <li>my idea of perfection as far as beauty products go.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I am 44 years old</li>
            <li>but Recently I decided to try, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Ladies, in two days I noticed my pores are smaller, my face looked more radiant, and I actually started to see some of my dark blemish spots disappear.  </li>
            <li>After several years of the Pro-X I thought, wow why not try the high end skin care?</li>
            <li>Younger women will not notice the difference this product (or any anti-aging product) makes as much as an older woman.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do not have major problems except for minor breakouts once in a while during the certain time of the month.</li>
            <li>The bottle is plenty large enough if you only use it around your eyes.</li>
            <li>I have not used this enough to say it really does what it is supposed to, but I do like how it feels the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried from the very cheapest to the most expensive serums, day, and night creams.  </li>
            <li>used and liked Principle Secret products for several years</li>
            <li>They are barely noticeable!</li>
            <li>People selling Avon products on Amazon have been known to cut the products with water/cheap lotion, there is NO OTHER WAY this person could be making a profit</li>
            <li>This means that, without limitation, you may not:  o Create listings on eBay for Avon products.  </li>
            <li>It is against Avon policy for us to sell on Amazon and it is also impossible for us to get Genics at this kind of price even with our discount!</li>
            <li>As an Avon Independent Sales Representative, you may not list for sale or advertise Avon products or the Avon selling opportunity in online auctions (including but not limited to eBay and Yahoo!</li>

            <li> Fine lines dramatically decreased, in just one month and the whole eye area where it was applied looks at least 5 years repaired.  </li>
            <li> I was joking to a friend about using it to look younger and was a little self conscious.</li>
            <li> I am using it every other day, opposite another product.  </li>
            <li> The same can&#x27;t be said of products from other companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS DRY AND GENICS</li>
            <li> can tell you that the Anew Wrinkle Corrector kicked Lancome/Estee/Clinique (etc.) hiney every single time, no matter what else I buy</li>
            <li> (Yes, I bought some Genifique at full price, and went back to my Avon Genics after a depressing month!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been previously using DIOR ONE ESSENTIAL (which is $95 for 1 oz compared to ANEW GENICS for $38 for 1 oz and even cheaper here on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> Feel like my face looks a few years younger.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 55+ year old from SC and must say that I was very skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I got not regular jar how I expected instead 5 small sampals tubes</li>
            <li> Auctions), markets, or other online outlets.</li>
            <li> that nothing else that costs twice as much, will show you such instant results!&lt;br /&gt;The results are especially dramatic on neck/chest skin, and if you have dull/dry/flaky skin or age-related issues.</li>
            <li> I have some sun damage and think that this helps make it less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I THINK THIS LITTLE JAR WILL BE GONE SOON,</li>
            <li> Now I have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Now use it as a hand moisturizer so as not to waste it</li>
            <li> Yeah, I&#x27;m a guy and the crows feet started showing pretty bad when I turned 40.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so thick.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other 1 star review, I am an Avon rep and something is very wrong here.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I hate wasting anything these days</li>

            <li> NOT BAD BUT DONT SEE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE FROM NOT USING IT.</li>
            <li> My wife looks like she is 75 again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular product since it first came out and still am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like the results from this product. It tightens pretty well. My skin looks a lot better, brighter, smooth, firmer. I am 50 yrs old and really have no wrinkles. I give a lot of the credit to Avon Anew Skin Care products. They do what they say they will. I notice when I don&#x27;t use them. I really like the Avon Genics...can&#x27;t wait for the serum to get on the market!</li>
            <li> Amazing item fast delivery AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried from the very cheapest to the most expensive serums, day, and night creams.  I&#x27;m a 55+ year old from SC and must say that I was very skeptical at first but I decided to give AVON a try.  I ordered the Avon Anew Genics Treatment Cream.  Ladies, in two days I noticed my pores are smaller, my face looked more radiant, and I actually started to see some of my dark blemish spots disappear.  I still have some of my more expensive creams to finish up...I hate wasting anything these days but I&#x27;ll use those products from time to time or just leave them alone and take a huge loss.  I&#x27;m a believer in Avon Anew Genics and will look at purchasing the Avon Plantinum line as well for day/night creams.  I hope the Genics Treatment Serum arrive shortly on the market so I can purchase that as well.  Trust me, I was very reluctant at first, but I&#x27;m now a BELIEVER.    Thanks Avon</li>
            <li> Love love this product...I can see a slight difference and its only been about 2 days!!Feels great on your skin..</li>
            <li> Not always have the access to an Avon Representative, so this online rep was a great find.  Get to try a product at my leisure.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this cream after a coworker showed me an article about the \\&quot;breakthrough\\&quot; ingredients that are now in a lot of new products, including this one.  I don&#x27;t think this cream did anything but moisturize.  I honestly did not see or feel any change in my skin.  I finished one jar.  I know some companies will say you should use the product for a lot longer to see results.  I disagree.  I&#x27;ve experienced better results from drugstore skincare.  I know Avon makes really great products- I just don&#x27;t think this is anything special.</li>
            <li> Theproduct is fabulous..my idea of perfection as far as beauty products go. I have tried many and liked some of them alot but since using this I will never be without it again. Thanks Avon!!</li>
            <li> ANEW GENICS IS ONE OF THE BEST FACE CREAMS I HAVE EVER USED! IT IS VERY MOISTURIZING WITHOUT BEING GREASY. IT TRULY TAKES AWAY FINE LINES. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE FROM 30 - 60+ YEARS OF AGE. YOU GET A LOT FOR THE MONEY AND IT WILL LAST QUITE A WHILE. MY SKIN IS DRY AND GENICS IF PERFECT FOR MY SKIN TYPE!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I was joking to a friend about using it to look younger and was a little self conscious. He replied that he had noticed a difference. Now I have to use it everyday. Lol now just to figure out a way for you to pay a little more and buy it legitimately from me[...] I guess we are all trying to figure out how to pay our higher grocery costs to feed my kids somehow.</li>
            <li> I have not used this enough to say it really does what it is supposed to, but I do like how it feels the next morning.  I am using it every other day, opposite another product.  I have tried lots of products trying to keep the \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; look, and will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I love the product but really noticed it evened out my skin tone. I had angel kisses that have really faded after about 2 weeks use. They are barely noticeable! I think that is a great selling point as well as the age repair!</li>
            <li> It is against Avon policy for its representatives to sell Avon products on websites such as Amazon.com or to provide product to someone knowing that the intent is to sell it online like this.  Please be aware that product that is not purchased from an Avon Representative could potentially be expired, stolen or counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Straight from the avon rule book::Online auctions, markets and outlets -- As an Avon Independent Sales Representative, you may not list for sale or advertise Avon products or the Avon selling opportunity in online auctions (including but not limited to eBay and Yahoo! Auctions), markets, or other online outlets. This means that, without limitation, you may not:  o Create listings on eBay for Avon products.  o Sell Avon products through an online storefront, for example, through Amazon.com or Yahoo!

            <li> First time user for this product but so far I love it. Not a heavy night moisturizer, nicely scented. Very good price. Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this cream it was from a small sample tube, within 3 days I felt the difference on my face.  My skin was softer and smoother, that made me order the jar.  Honestly since then my texture has not improved further, it sort of plateaued therefore it is not likely that I would reorder it again.</li>
            <li> I reorder every four to six months...  great product</li>
            <li> My daughter says nothing really works, but it can&#x27;t hurt to try. Besides, this leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> This is a night cream I&#x27;ve been using a long time that soothes my skin, and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every night cream out there and this one is by far the best.  It makes my face feel soft and not greasy.  I have some sun damage and think that this helps make it less noticeable.  Feel like my face looks a few years younger.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I adore Avon&#x27;s skin care products and Anew Genics Treatment Cream has lived up to my expectations.  At the age of &amp;#34;62&amp;#34;, people comment all the time on how youthful my skin looks.  Thanks Avon for assisting me in aging gracefully.....well, even better than that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more of this.  My skin is smoother and the color is more uniform.  Highly recommended along with the serum.</li>
            <li> I have been an Avon rep in the past, and found that despite my Avon bias (I find their makeup to be horrid, with the exception of their mascara), I love the Anew products for the most part. With few exceptions, every Anew product I&#x27;ve tried (including their age-specific line) has done what it says it will, and more. The same can&#x27;t be said of products from other companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried probably thousands of dollars in skin care products, I was even a Mary Kay rep for over a decade and used to swear by them until I realized that Olay Pro-X gave me better skin. After several years of the Pro-X I thought, wow why not try the high end skin care? There has to be a reason that eye cream is $45! (um, marketing hype?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that the Anew Wrinkle Corrector kicked Lancome/Estee/Clinique (etc.) hiney every single time, no matter what else I buy, I always go back to the Avon Anew. I was anxious to try the Genics and LOVE the consistency, texture, and how it applies. I love even more that it competes with the Lancome Genifique and wins HANDS DOWN over results and price. (Yes, I bought some Genifique at full price, and went back to my Avon Genics after a depressing month!)&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe that AVON of all companies, has such an effective skin care system! This from someone who would not buy anything else from them and I&#x27;ve been a rep. When something works, it works, and there&#x27;s no sense wasting money on products that don&#x27;t even compare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try it, give it a week or two. I like both the Anti Wrinkle and Genics; try them, get your money back if you don&#x27;t like them, but I guaran-dang-tee you that nothing else that costs twice as much, will show you such instant results!&lt;br /&gt;The results are especially dramatic on neck/chest skin, and if you have dull/dry/flaky skin or age-related issues.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cream. I am sure that this product would be better served on women who are just beginning the aging  process rather than in the late stages of aging...</li>
            <li> Yeah, I&#x27;m a guy and the crows feet started showing pretty bad when I turned 40. After just 3 days I can notice a difference. The bottle is plenty large enough if you only use it around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other 1 star review, I am an Avon rep and something is very wrong here. It is against Avon policy for us to sell on Amazon and it is also impossible for us to get Genics at this kind of price even with our discount! You don&#x27;t know what you are getting here, beware! People selling Avon products on Amazon have been known to cut the products with water/cheap lotion, there is NO OTHER WAY this person could be making a profit</li>
            <li> I LOVE THAT THIS CREAM HAS GLYCOLIC ACID.  WHEN I AWAKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, MY FACE ISN&#x27;T AS GREASY AS IT HAS BEEN BEFORE USING THIS.  I WANT TO USE IT IN THE DAY ALSO BUT IT&#x27;S SO TINY, ONLY ONE OUNCE, AND IT DOESN&#x27;T SPREAD AS EASILY AS I&#x27;D LIKE.  I THINK THIS LITTLE JAR WILL BE GONE SOON, SO I WILL NEVER PAY THE AVON PRICE FOR IT.  HOPE I CAN FOREVER FIND IT ON AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old and I have just started noticing the aging of my facial skin.  I do not have major problems except for minor breakouts once in a while during the certain time of the month. I have been previously using DIOR ONE ESSENTIAL (which is $95 for 1 oz compared to ANEW GENICS for $38 for 1 oz and even cheaper here on Amazon).  Ok ... I think anything will fall short compared to DIOR ONE because that one is a miracle cream that takes effect after one use ( a bit pricey so my search goes on for a great miracle cream that is not a budget buster)! ANEW GENICS is not bad though, after 5 days of use I started noticing that my skin is brighter and softer (I stopped using DIOR ONE for a week before I started using ANEW to be able to see the effect).  I am also using the ANEW ULTIMATE DAY CREAM in the morning and these 2 products worked well.  My skin did look and feel younger and the positive effect is noticeable, it just took about a week but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to a friend. It is a very good cream and I use it every day. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem any improvement to my skin. Now use it as a hand moisturizer so as not to waste it</li>
            <li> Did not work as promised.  I purchased Anew Genics and a product from Estee Lauder, that promised similar results as Genics  the same day.  I tried Genics on my right eye and a Estee Lauder nighttime advance oil on my left, for over a month.  The left eye that I used the Estee Lauder product, looks amazing.  Fine lines dramatically decreased, in just one month and the whole eye area where it was applied looks at least 5 years repaired.  The fine lines around the eye I used the Anew, look exactly the same as it did before treatment.  Anew did a wonderful job moisturizing and evening skin tone around the area applied, but that&#x27;s not why I purchased it.  It didn&#x27;t take even one year off.  Sorry Anew Genics, but I&#x27;d never purchase it again.  But one star for being a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it&#x27;s way to thick for me. I end up mixing some water with it so it&#x27;s not so thick.</li>
            <li> I got not regular jar how I expected instead 5 small sampals tubes</li>
            <li> Like all anti-aging products, you have to think of your age and need for the product. Younger women will not notice the difference this product (or any anti-aging product) makes as much as an older woman.&lt;br /&gt;I used and liked Principle Secret products for several years and I love this product, at least as much as that. I&#x27;ve also used Olay- it&#x27;s a good product but doesn&#x27;t compare to this one, for me.&lt;br /&gt;I really like what this product does for my skin and how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Intend to buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought the first bottle a few months ago accidentally, but I did not use it right way, I thought my sensitive skin will not be comfortable for this product. but Recently I decided to try, and it works very well. I can feel my skin becomes much better in looking. so I bought another bottle.</li>
            <li> A one Item and seller</li>
            <li> no problems&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived quickly.</li>
