    <ol>
            <li>In both cases, the shipping package and the retail box were perfect.  </li>
            <li>This provides great acne control!</li>
            <li>(Fair warning)</li>
            <li>This is a good product to lessen your acne during pregnancy, but it has not gotten rid of my acne.  </li>
            <li>SO bizarre!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Also the sulfur smell is very strong too.</li>
            <li>I just started and so far its the best that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again during pregnancy because it helps more than not using it.</li>
            <li>Many, many years ago, my dermatologist prescribed an acne spot treatment to treat my acne.  </li>
            <li>and i have to say i love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I struggled with the resurgence of acne since becoming pregnant and it continued after having my child.  </li>
            <li>Really wanted to love this</li>
            <li>When used in combination with a good skin cleansing routine, this spot treatment has helped to keep my initial cystic pregnancy acne clear for most of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I have a long history of using harsher and more toxic products, and this has controlled my acne just as well or better.  </li>
            <li>Received product with the top completely off.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I found that can use this best every other day, if used daily my skin will be very flaky.  </li>
            <li>This product is awesome; however, the last two times I have bought it the tube has a hole in it causing A LOT of product waste.</li>
            <li>The first order came with tube uncapped and product leaking out into the retail box.  </li>
            <li>This treatment started drying up my pimples after the first night I used it.</li>
            <li>The first time I thought it was a fluke, but it has happened two times in a row.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Slight sulfur smell that I&#x27;ve completely gotten use to and is far better than the problem I had with benzoil peroxide bleaching my clothes and sheets.</li>
            <li>It is usually pretty fast working too, if I have a spot developing</li>
            <li>I am 4 months pregnant and FINALLY something is clearing up my skin.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the Belli Spot Treatment smells; one of the main ingredients is sulfur.  </li>
            <li>The prescription&#x27;s main ingredient is sulfur too.  </li>
            <li>I really did not like this spot treatment, and I have discontinued use of it completely.</li>
            <li>I really wish that I had it when my skin first started acting up.</li>
            <li>Love this scrub even when I&#x27;m not pregnant!</li>
            <li>But I will return to my normal chemically rich products when I am not pregnant.</li>
            <li>I just like how it makes my skin tight but smooth.</li>
            <li>pregnant wife really wanted to try this product, but I am not willing to try ordering a third time.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t treat my cystic acne, it takes a couple of weeks for the acne to clear up.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really cleared up my acne while pregnant, but it probably at least HELPS.</li>
            <li>This product (in combination with the acne wash 2x daily) helped clear the blackhead and red bumps that had covered my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I use a thin coat on my entire face and top of my back.  </li>

            <li> I use a thin coat on my entire face and top of my back.  </li>
            <li> This product cleared up the bumps completely and leaves only a few intermittent red zits here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typically, I applied the treatment two to three times, then the acne would clear up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sulfur smell is a small price to pay for clear skin!</li>
            <li> This product will dry up zits, but it tends to turn them into scabs.  </li>
            <li> The tube is smaller than I thought but a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try to help with hormone related ance, after a few nights there is no noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put this product on it a few times a day and the spot will be significantly smaller.</li>
            <li> Second order came with neck and cap broken off the tube completely</li>
            <li> even worse than when I went to seek professional help from a dermatologist and went on the prescriptions!  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m late in my second trimester</li>
            <li> I broke out far worse than I can ever recall...</li>
            <li> Also seemed like some product was missing from tube as it seemed mostly empty.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight sulfur smell</li>
            <li> All the product was gone from the tube, having either leaked out or dried up.</li>
            <li> but it goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we are not the only ones that have had this problem with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disgusting smell -- and for those of us who are pregnant and already sensitive to smell, it&#x27;s that much worse!</li>
            <li> I think it may be working or at least helping.</li>
            <li> When I use the facewash it burns and leaves my face red and the on the spot treatment smells HORRIBLE, both after applying and the next morning.</li>
            <li> so its getting a little expensive.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this has not cleared up my pregnancy acne.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for a few nights before I realized that horrible sulfur smell...was my face.</li>
            <li> Since it has sulfur in it, it smells REALLY BAD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I think it may be working or at least helping. Or it may just be that my pregnancy hormones are finally starting to even out.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try to help with hormone related ance, after a few nights there is no noticeable difference.  When I use the facewash it burns and leaves my face red and the on the spot treatment smells HORRIBLE, both after applying and the next morning. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but after two unsuccessful orders for this product I felt compelled to write about our experiences. The first order came with tube uncapped and product leaking out into the retail box.  Second order came with neck and cap broken off the tube completely (can be seen in attached photo). All the product was gone from the tube, having either leaked out or dried up. In both cases, the shipping package and the retail box were perfect.  This manufacturer appears to have a quality control issue with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of my orders came from different sellers, so I cannot place the blame squarely on them. Amazon needs to review this product and determine what percentage of product is defective. Unfortunately, we are not the only ones that have had this problem with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pregnant wife really wanted to try this product, but I am not willing to try ordering a third time.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to love this but unfortunately this has not cleared up my pregnancy acne.  I hope it works for others</li>
            <li> This provides great acne control! It is usually pretty fast working too, if I have a spot developing I&#x27;ll put this product on it a few times a day and the spot will be significantly smaller.</li>
            <li> This product has not helped my pregnancy acne at all.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  Also the sulfur smell is very strong too.</li>
            <li> I used this spot treatment for about 1 month as I was discontinuing my prescription skin treatments prior to trying for a baby.  I was so hopeful that I could go off the prescriptions and use just the Belly wash and spot treatment, but it just did not work out for me.  I noticed my pores looking larger, my skin texture around the nose and chin getting a sand-paper feel, and I started to break out around the nose, chin and hair-line.  I broke out far worse than I can ever recall...even worse than when I went to seek professional help from a dermatologist and went on the prescriptions!  I really did not like this spot treatment, and I have discontinued use of it completely.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd product I have tried for my acne-prone skin.  I am 4 months pregnant and FINALLY something is clearing up my skin.  I use a thin coat on my entire face and top of my back.  After 3 days, it is clearing up!  Yippee!!!  3rd time is the charm!  It does have a slight sulfur smell but it goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really cleared up my acne while pregnant, but it probably at least HELPS. It does keep my skin from getting too oily overnight. Since it has sulfur in it, it smells REALLY BAD. (Fair warning)</li>
            <li> Love this scrub even when I&#x27;m not pregnant!</li>
            <li> This is a good product to lessen your acne during pregnancy, but it has not gotten rid of my acne.  This product will dry up zits, but it tends to turn them into scabs.  The key is to exfoliate while using this product.  I would buy it again during pregnancy because it helps more than not using it. But I will return to my normal chemically rich products when I am not pregnant.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few nights before I realized that horrible sulfur smell...was my face. UGH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be using it again. Disgusting smell -- and for those of us who are pregnant and already sensitive to smell, it&#x27;s that much worse!</li>
            <li> I found that can use this best every other day, if used daily my skin will be very flaky.  I do have complicated/combination skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, the Belli Spot Treatment smells; one of the main ingredients is sulfur.  Many, many years ago, my dermatologist prescribed an acne spot treatment to treat my acne.  The prescription&#x27;s main ingredient is sulfur too.  Sulfur dries up the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belli&#x27;s spot treatment worked on my cystic acne.  Typically, I applied the treatment two to three times, then the acne would clear up.  If I don&#x27;t treat my cystic acne, it takes a couple of weeks for the acne to clear up.  For white heads, the spot treatment only took one to two applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfur smell is a small price to pay for clear skin!</li>
            <li> This treatment started drying up my pimples after the first night I used it. I really wish that I had it when my skin first started acting up. I&#x27;m late in my second trimester but I hope that this will help control my acne. I just started and so far its the best that I&#x27;ve tried. Yes it does smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. The tube is smaller than I thought but a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I struggled with the resurgence of acne since becoming pregnant and it continued after having my child.  This product (in combination with the acne wash 2x daily) helped clear the blackhead and red bumps that had covered my forehead and cheeks. I have a long history of using harsher and more toxic products, and this has controlled my acne just as well or better.  Prior to switching I was using a 2% benzoil peroxide cream 2x daily and that was not helping at all with bumps or red zits after a while.  This product cleared up the bumps completely and leaves only a few intermittent red zits here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight sulfur smell that I&#x27;ve completely gotten use to and is far better than the problem I had with benzoil peroxide bleaching my clothes and sheets.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome; however, the last two times I have bought it the tube has a hole in it causing A LOT of product waste. The first time I thought it was a fluke, but it has happened two times in a row.</li>
            <li> Received product with the top completely off. I don&#x27;t just mean the lid, I mean the top that squeezes the product out was completely unattached! Also seemed like some product was missing from tube as it seemed mostly empty. I could not find any product in my box though where it leaked. SO bizarre!! I will be returning!</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind this won&#x27;t get rid of your acne, but will help control it. I use this along with the face Belli wash. I used both products during my pregnancy and beyond. My baby is 7 months now and I still use these products. I like that they are non-toxic!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  Cleared up my hormonal acne (I had never dealt with any acne before) instantly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with the Belli face wash and i have to say i love how my skin feels. I do wish that this was sold as an all over face lotion. I have been using it as an all over treatment so its getting a little expensive. I just like how it makes my skin tight but smooth.</li>
            <li> When used in combination with a good skin cleansing routine, this spot treatment has helped to keep my initial cystic pregnancy acne clear for most of my pregnancy. It is pricey, but worth it.</li>
