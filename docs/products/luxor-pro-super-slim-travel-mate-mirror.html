            <li>Perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror as a travel mirror for camping or trips and it is the perfect size.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for an overnight bag.</li>
            <li>Depending on your needs I would say this is perfect.</li>
            <li>It is a great value for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great deal you get two good size mirrors for the price.</li>
            <li>Good product, is the size beyond my imagination</li>
            <li>and I got more order for them!</li>
            <li>Lacks rubber feet and therefore cannot stand on its own.</li>
            <li>And I like that it is able to stand on its own also.</li>
            <li>Great quality and very functional!</li>
            <li>Very nice travel mirror, especially if you&#x27;re travelng by car &amp; weight or space is not an issue.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Really like that it packs easily, but it isn&#x27;t as adjustable as the plastic thicker cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>The stand is clear plastic unlike the picture which I think looks even better.  </li>
            <li>mirrors are &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; for the price, but there are smaller and more durable mirrors for pocket or purse use.</li>
            <li>x 6&amp;#34;) for a purse.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit flimsy, plastic case, glass mirror – it&#x27;s pretty much like the picture shows.</li>
            <li>Mirrors are a little large to carry everyday in bag however perfect size for travel or leaving in desk.</li>
            <li>However, the mirror is real glass (not plastic) and</li>
            <li>(they wear SO much makeup at competitions).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Exact dimensions of the unit when closed (including the plastic stand) is: 3 5/8&amp;#34; x 4 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very thin and the optics are very good for the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for packing in a suitcase or bag, but it&#x27;s rather large (5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>These were perfect for what we needed - compact enough to fit in a dance bag, but large mirror area, and protective cover folds back, making it self-standing - it was a huge hit backstage, I kept hearing other dancers asking to borrow my daughters&#x27; mirrors, and at least one other girl asked me where we found it.</li>
            <li>While the mirror is good quality, the stand is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li>I loved everything about this mirror... until the plastic hinges on the cover snapped under minimal pressure less than a month after purchase.</li>
            <li>The Amazon photo is in black and white, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what the color would be, but mine was clear plastic.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Big enough to see your whole face and hair without moving around.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, broken out of the box.</li>
            <li>Not sure how big purses are in China, but these mirrors are huge.</li>
            <li>For the price, I expected these to feel much cheaper and flimsy than they did.</li>
            <li>and I still use it, but trying to get it to balance at the proper angle is a major pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too large for what I was needing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This mirror is thin, which makes it nice, but it is relatively heavy. Its weight (and flimsy cover) made me decide to leave this travel mirror at home.</li>
            <li> Good product, is the size beyond my imagination</li>
            <li> The hinge for the cover will probably break soon after you start using this, so don&#x27;t plan on having a mirror with a cover.  However, the mirror is real glass (not plastic) and thin like I was looking for.  Overall, I am pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice travel mirror, especially if you&#x27;re travelng by car &amp; weight or space is not an issue.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li> Lacks rubber feet and therefore cannot stand on its own. Plastic hinge piece broke after a weeks use.  While the mirror is good quality, the stand is poorly designed.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Mirror doesn&#x27;t travel well. Case snapped off</li>
            <li> Not sure how big purses are in China, but these mirrors are huge. Not that I&#x27;m complaining about this size, because I intend to use them in my work desk, but the description is a bit misleading. These mirrors are about half the size of standard piece of 8.5 x 11 paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my mirrors came with a cracked case, and it looks like with just a little torsion or a hard bump, the mirror will crack or be damaged too. The plastic case is very thin and just doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These mirrors are &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; for the price, but there are smaller and more durable mirrors for pocket or purse use.</li>
            <li> Really like that it packs easily, but it isn&#x27;t as adjustable as the plastic thicker cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I put vinyl cheer stickers on them (in team colors), personalized them and gave them to my niece&#x27;s cheer pals (they wear SO much makeup at competitions).  They were a total hit and I got more order for them!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror as a travel mirror for camping or trips and it is the perfect size.  Very thin and the optics are very good for the mirror.  The stand is clear plastic unlike the picture which I think looks even better.  Also, I received TWO mirrors in a pack, not just one mirror.  It is a great value for the price.  I would highly recommend for packing in a suitcase or bag, but it&#x27;s rather large (5&amp;#34; x 6&amp;#34;) for a purse.  Perfect for an overnight bag.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy here. Does exactly what it should. I keep this thing in my camera backpack (I&#x27;m a portrait photographer). Takes a beating, and hasn&#x27;t broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exact dimensions of the unit when closed (including the plastic stand) is: 3 5/8&amp;#34; x 4 1/2&amp;#34; x 1/4&amp;#34;. The Amazon photo is in black and white, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what the color would be, but mine was clear plastic.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal you get two good size mirrors for the price. Mirrors are a little large to carry everyday in bag however perfect size for travel or leaving in desk. Big enough to see your whole face and hair without moving around. And I like that it is able to stand on its own also. Depending on your needs I would say this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very functional!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too large for what I was needing.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for what we needed - compact enough to fit in a dance bag, but large mirror area, and protective cover folds back, making it self-standing - it was a huge hit backstage, I kept hearing other dancers asking to borrow my daughters&#x27; mirrors, and at least one other girl asked me where we found it. For the price, I expected these to feel much cheaper and flimsy than they did. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> One of the hinges broke almost immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit flimsy, plastic case, glass mirror – it&#x27;s pretty much like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> It is  broken!!!!! poor quality !!!! Do not buy it !!!! you will regret it !!!!</li>
            <li> Very cheap, broken out of the box.</li>
            <li> I loved everything about this mirror... until the plastic hinges on the cover snapped under minimal pressure less than a month after purchase. It&#x27;s super-thin and I still use it, but trying to get it to balance at the proper angle is a major pain. What&#x27;s worse is that this was purchased to replace a smaller version from a different company that suffered the same fate. If they improved the quality/strength of the material, I would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
