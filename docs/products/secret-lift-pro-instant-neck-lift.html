            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>quite effective - quite nice!</li>
            <li>But I love the design, great idea</li>
            <li>IT TAKES AWHILE TO GET JUST THE RIGHT POSITION ON YOUR NECK TO BE COMFORTABE AND DO THE BEST JOB.  </li>
            <li>I think scotch tape would work better or even a bandaid!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>this product is pretty great!</li>
            <li>Yikes - the others were better!  </li>
            <li>These are great, easy to apply, and YES they stay put all day if you follow directions.  </li>
            <li>it is amazing.</li>
            <li>As a gag gift it would be nice if it came packaged separately as pictured.</li>
            <li>if you prep the skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does tighten nicely for the time that it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Very nice neck band - smooth and snug.</li>
            <li>,  Wothout those Lifts, I truly felt I might as well just turn around and go home, so great was my dependence on the significant appearance-booster of the Lifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This company is great and really cares about its customers!!  </li>
            <li>if it is warm ouside the fall off ..be sure to use a lot of rubbing  alcohol before you put it on.</li>
            <li>I find the adhesive to be very secure, and they&#x27;re very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>However .. the first time I used one,  I lost patches of skin upon removal.&lt;br /&gt;After the scabs healed (lol)</li>
            <li>Very good, but  notice always clear with alcohol before put it one.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I will continue to order from this seller  </li>
            <li>The product works for me the way it said that it would I have received so many compliments since I started using the tapes and they are the reason why</li>
            <li>I love my face lift tapes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
            <li>I want these available forever!</li>
            <li>I really love these.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love it I keep on ordering this.</li>
            <li>(Maybe it is the metal attachment that makes it so much more visible.)</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The concept of the lift is excellent, and when I wear it, I look 10 years younger,</li>
            <li>Love this one piece system.</li>
            <li>I love the difference they make in how I look and feel.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied from day one.</li>
            <li>I have been using these lifts for several months and am very happy with my lifted look.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more</li>
            <li>Will not stay on more than an hour.</li>
            <li>but so much more cheaper and painless :-)  </li>
            <li>The Final Exam was when I wore them around the house for a day and night, and my husband thought I &amp;#34;looked great today&amp;#34; (said so), yet never detected the Lifts!</li>
            <li>In fact I almost hesitate to write these details as I can&#x27;t believe that level of responsiveness is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, But you can be sure  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, even greater customer service.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, even greater customer service.</li>
            <li>It is a great, quick fix for special occasions or photos, and  I wore mine to a class reunion.</li>
            <li>I really liked the original band and tapes but they went up in price.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.. :)</li>
            <li>lol, All kidding aside I am addicted to the wonderful difference it makes in my appearance and want everyone to get them that needs them...</li>
            <li>thought the elastic would be more comfortable</li>
            <li>but please make to hold more secure.</li>
            <li>I use spirit gum remover and any residue after removal comes off easily.  </li>
            <li>These are easy to use - they make a difference</li>
            <li>Just make sure your skin is clean and the adhesive will hold without a problem.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very easy to apply, they make a dramatic difference in smoothing out the neck and jawline, and best of all, they&#x27;re are much more comfortable to wear all day...</li>
            <li>However, the adhesive is not as strong as on the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered from CosmeSearch several times, and I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with their customer service.</li>
            <li>Fantastic  </li>
            <li>I love this product soooo much!  </li>
            <li>First, the directions have you putting the adhesive pad at the front top of your ear.</li>
            <li>I JUST USE SOAP AND WATER TO CLEAN THE AREA  </li>
            <li>The new design is more convenient but the adhesive is not as good as the that used with old tabs you attach yourself.  </li>
            <li>I used them for a special occasion and had to take the strip off after a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>It DOES eliminate the lines and droopiness; however, you most certainly realize you have it on, and I would recommend using a type of &amp;#34;spirit gum&amp;#34; if you intend to wear it all day.  </li>
            <li>She went right home and ordered them!  </li>
            <li>They are a fast, inexpensive and mostly painless alternative to surgery or injections.</li>
            <li>Instant Lift is extremely effective take as much as 20 yrs off in a NEW YORK MINUTE and the new design is perfect : Lets Face it and feel refreshed</li>
            <li>My wife thought this would be a quick alternative to a facelift.  </li>
            <li>This device is much more comfortable than the older, first version.  </li>
            <li>I will be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br</li>
            <li>be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this new version.....</li>
            <li>I received all my orders earlier than expected, and the product works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were an unmitigated success.</li>
            <li>Not as good at all as the other.</li>
            <li>Mine come right off.</li>
            <li>the customer service was excellent,the product,really works..and you need just a minimum of practice to find the right lift foy yourself.</li>
            <li>Need to practice a lot to get these in the right spot and then keep them there.</li>
            <li>I mean, how often do you get a great product, that level of customer responsiveness, and accommodation to your special circumstance?</li>
            <li>Not an easy place to hide the tape even though it is &#x27;clear&#x27; .</li>
            <li>THEN I FORGOT TO PACK THEM ON MY CROSS COUNTRY TRIP, and found myself Lift-less 3 days from my first important appearance ( a private party for one of my favorite actors!)</li>
            <li>( *NOT ALCOHOL*)</li>
            <li>In any case, they sure help you feel a bit &amp;#34;fresher of face&amp;#34; for the occasional meeting, party or getting your picture taken.  </li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>Try it, I think you will like it as much as I do!,</li>
            <li>it actually gives the adhesive a better surface texture to grip and protects your face from the adhesive.</li>
            <li>So much for vanity!</li>
            <li>Love these tapes as they have given me my self confidence back  </li>
            <li>friends have said &amp;#34;What have you done, you look awesome&amp;#34; some I tell, others not a chance ; )</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had one last more than an hour.</li>
            <li>These are great if you never sweat and have hair long enough to cover them.  </li>
            <li>suggest  having a friend help at first, and take along a spare band when you are out just in case.  </li>
            <li>They cost twice as much and don&#x27;t work well!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;neck &amp; jaw&amp;#34; strips help appearance when first applied.  </li>
            <li>Worked well until weather at function got hot humid.  </li>
            <li>(hereafter referred to as the &amp;#34;Lifts&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>The asdhesive doesn&#x27;t adhere to the skin on most of them--usually only on one side!</li>
            <li>More comfortable band for half the time.</li>
            <li>I think the use of the ties are better than the stretched rubber.  </li>
            <li>Worked great until I started losing hair due to the constant tension on this area.</li>
            <li>This is a really Great product for the late 50s -- early-to-mid 60s gal that just wants to look &amp;#34;refreshed.&amp;#34;  A wrinkly/saggy neck really adds years...</li>
            <li>To make a long story short, everyone (including myself), thought I looked pretty damn good.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it every single day alternating with &amp;#34;instant face, neck and eye lift&amp;#34;, it is just like getting a cosmetic surgery</li>
            <li>Lifts are large and unsightly.  </li>
            <li>I liked the results but it was too tight on my neck.</li>
            <li>Save your dollars for the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t do without this face life now.  </li>
            <li>Works well and much cheaper than a facelift</li>
            <li>comfortable especially if your hair gets caught in the adhesive.  </li>
            <li>and although it says neck and jaw it doesn&#x27;t really stretch out to on the jaw.</li>
            <li>Secret lift pro -neck and jaw is great</li>
            <li>I thought I would try it again, and be more careful when pulling off the adhesives.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you try them all; they are reasonably priced, I think, for the results).  </li>
            <li>In my case, the rubber cord was too short and didn&#x27;t fit around my head.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect success: delivery times tend to be pretty firm, as each vendor has their own standard procedures for fulfillment of orders and I don&#x27;t imagine they like to disrupt their fulfillment</li>
            <li>Big Improvement over the original.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and are sensitive to the tape buy the liquid bandage that is in the first aid section of any drug store and put the on the spot you will be attaching the adhesive to.  </li>
            <li>The Neck lifts were pretty much undetectable unless I wore my hair up high; the face Lifts were placed very close to the ear; lower ear straight across, and upper ear/temple slanted up, both covered with the front of my haircut, which I gelled into place.</li>
            <li>However, with the Pro version, it is much harder to apply and does not stick easily.  </li>
            <li>I have super short hair and this will not work for me.</li>
            <li>I love them and buy an extra box to keep on hand in case I run out without realizing I&#x27;m running low.</li>
            <li>I found either Face Lift product worked fine, but I liked the connivence of the Secret Lift Pro,  and tended to use them most of the time (you may prefer the other product however; everyone&#x27;s hair coverage is different.</li>
            <li>My neck is transformed from loose skin  and wrinkles to smooth and youthful.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>and they just did not work or I was doing them wrong, but the ones with the elastic work great.  </li>
            <li>The only exception is perhaps on a hot sweaty day or if your skin is very oily.  </li>
            <li>After having read the directions, don&#x27;t waste your money if you think this will give you a more youthful look.</li>
            <li>I have a normal size head and shape.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used the face one before, and that is much better, however when you do a knot to shorten it , the elastic doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li>Does not work snaps right in the middle when you stretch it..</li>
            <li>I have become so dependent on these wonder strips that I called immediately to get a new band mailed out promptly.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with this new one - just using 4</li>
            <li>no one new</li>
            <li>This product provides lovely lift for half a day, as compared to the full day of lift with the original Secret Lift.  </li>
            <li>They did their job, but my skin is very sensitive to the tape on these bands.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a small price for a simple and effective product that truly delivers what it promises if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>works pretty cool just wish they were just a bit shorter, maybe I have a small neck</li>
            <li>, THEY REALLY MAKE YOU LOOK YOUNGER.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li>I tried one on a friend who is 68 years old and she couldn&#x27;t believe it either.  </li>
            <li>fast and simple to apply.</li>
            <li>but it does not pull back quite a much as I would like but cheaper than a facelift</li>
            <li>You do have to consider your hairstyle carefully (no ponytails or buns if you have longer hair), and are a bit less cooperative when it&#x27;s super hot out (especially if you sweat a lot)</li>
            <li>I use a little spirit gum on the tapes and use light pressure on them for several seconds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 62 years old and thanks to some lucky genetics in facial bone structure, usually came off looking younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li>I used alcohol to clean the areas and even tried to use a little extra glue.  </li>
            <li>To bad from the demo it looked great if it worked....</li>
            <li>Rubber won&#x27;t stretch far enough to go around head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old, and feel that I should finally opt out of cosmetic surgery. ..</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the small amount of improvement</li>
            <li>As an older woman who doesn&#x27;t want surgery, I&#x27;ve tried several types of applied lifts to reduce the appearance of a saggy jawline and aged neck.  </li>
            <li>the glue on this one was not as strong as the face secret lift.</li>
            <li>It not only brings back my neck and removes the unsightly and aging vertical bands from under my chin and down, it brings back my whole jawline.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Love it I keep on ordering this.</li>
            <li> (Maybe it is the metal attachment that makes it so much more visible.)</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The concept of the lift is excellent, and when I wear it, I look 10 years younger,</li>
            <li> Love this one piece system.</li>
            <li> I love the difference they make in how I look and feel.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied from day one.</li>
            <li> I have been using these lifts for several months and am very happy with my lifted look.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I plan to order more</li>
            <li> Will not stay on more than an hour.</li>
            <li> but so much more cheaper and painless :-)  </li>
            <li> The Final Exam was when I wore them around the house for a day and night, and my husband thought I &amp;#34;looked great today&amp;#34; (said so), yet never detected the Lifts!</li>
            <li> In fact I almost hesitate to write these details as I can&#x27;t believe that level of responsiveness is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, But you can be sure  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, even greater customer service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, even greater customer service.</li>
            <li> It is a great, quick fix for special occasions or photos, and  I wore mine to a class reunion.</li>
            <li> I really liked the original band and tapes but they went up in price.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.. :)</li>
            <li> lol, All kidding aside I am addicted to the wonderful difference it makes in my appearance and want everyone to get them that needs them...</li>
            <li> thought the elastic would be more comfortable</li>
            <li> but please make to hold more secure.</li>
            <li> I use spirit gum remover and any residue after removal comes off easily.  </li>
            <li> These are easy to use - they make a difference</li>
            <li> Just make sure your skin is clean and the adhesive will hold without a problem.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very easy to apply, they make a dramatic difference in smoothing out the neck and jawline, and best of all, they&#x27;re are much more comfortable to wear all day...</li>
            <li> However, the adhesive is not as strong as on the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from CosmeSearch several times, and I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with their customer service.</li>
            <li> Fantastic  </li>
            <li> I love this product soooo much!  </li>
            <li> First, the directions have you putting the adhesive pad at the front top of your ear.</li>
            <li> I JUST USE SOAP AND WATER TO CLEAN THE AREA  </li>
            <li> The new design is more convenient but the adhesive is not as good as the that used with old tabs you attach yourself.  </li>
            <li> I used them for a special occasion and had to take the strip off after a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> It DOES eliminate the lines and droopiness; however, you most certainly realize you have it on, and I would recommend using a type of &amp;#34;spirit gum&amp;#34; if you intend to wear it all day.  </li>
            <li> She went right home and ordered them!  </li>
            <li> They are a fast, inexpensive and mostly painless alternative to surgery or injections.</li>
            <li> Instant Lift is extremely effective take as much as 20 yrs off in a NEW YORK MINUTE and the new design is perfect : Lets Face it and feel refreshed</li>
            <li> My wife thought this would be a quick alternative to a facelift.  </li>
            <li> This device is much more comfortable than the older, first version.  </li>
            <li> I will be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br</li>
            <li> be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this new version.....</li>
            <li> I received all my orders earlier than expected, and the product works great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were an unmitigated success.</li>
            <li> Not as good at all as the other.</li>
            <li> Mine come right off.</li>
            <li> the customer service was excellent,the product,really works..and you need just a minimum of practice to find the right lift foy yourself.</li>
            <li> Need to practice a lot to get these in the right spot and then keep them there.</li>
            <li> I mean, how often do you get a great product, that level of customer responsiveness, and accommodation to your special circumstance?</li>
            <li> Not an easy place to hide the tape even though it is &#x27;clear&#x27; .</li>
            <li> THEN I FORGOT TO PACK THEM ON MY CROSS COUNTRY TRIP, and found myself Lift-less 3 days from my first important appearance ( a private party for one of my favorite actors!)</li>
            <li> ( *NOT ALCOHOL*)</li>
            <li> In any case, they sure help you feel a bit &amp;#34;fresher of face&amp;#34; for the occasional meeting, party or getting your picture taken.  </li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> Try it, I think you will like it as much as I do!,</li>
            <li> it actually gives the adhesive a better surface texture to grip and protects your face from the adhesive.</li>
            <li> So much for vanity!</li>
            <li> Love these tapes as they have given me my self confidence back  </li>
            <li> friends have said &amp;#34;What have you done, you look awesome&amp;#34; some I tell, others not a chance ; )</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one last more than an hour.</li>
            <li> These are great if you never sweat and have hair long enough to cover them.  </li>
            <li> suggest  having a friend help at first, and take along a spare band when you are out just in case.  </li>
            <li> They cost twice as much and don&#x27;t work well!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;neck &amp; jaw&amp;#34; strips help appearance when first applied.  </li>
            <li> Worked well until weather at function got hot humid.  </li>
            <li> (hereafter referred to as the &amp;#34;Lifts&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> The asdhesive doesn&#x27;t adhere to the skin on most of them--usually only on one side!</li>
            <li> More comfortable band for half the time.</li>
            <li> I think the use of the ties are better than the stretched rubber.  </li>
            <li> Worked great until I started losing hair due to the constant tension on this area.</li>
            <li> This is a really Great product for the late 50s -- early-to-mid 60s gal that just wants to look &amp;#34;refreshed.&amp;#34;  A wrinkly/saggy neck really adds years...</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, everyone (including myself), thought I looked pretty damn good.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it every single day alternating with &amp;#34;instant face, neck and eye lift&amp;#34;, it is just like getting a cosmetic surgery</li>
            <li> Lifts are large and unsightly.  </li>
            <li> I liked the results but it was too tight on my neck.</li>
            <li> Save your dollars for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t do without this face life now.  </li>
            <li> Works well and much cheaper than a facelift</li>
            <li> comfortable especially if your hair gets caught in the adhesive.  </li>
            <li> and although it says neck and jaw it doesn&#x27;t really stretch out to on the jaw.</li>
            <li> Secret lift pro -neck and jaw is great</li>
            <li> I thought I would try it again, and be more careful when pulling off the adhesives.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you try them all; they are reasonably priced, I think, for the results).  </li>
            <li> In my case, the rubber cord was too short and didn&#x27;t fit around my head.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect success: delivery times tend to be pretty firm, as each vendor has their own standard procedures for fulfillment of orders and I don&#x27;t imagine they like to disrupt their fulfillment</li>
            <li> Big Improvement over the original.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and are sensitive to the tape buy the liquid bandage that is in the first aid section of any drug store and put the on the spot you will be attaching the adhesive to.  </li>
            <li> The Neck lifts were pretty much undetectable unless I wore my hair up high; the face Lifts were placed very close to the ear; lower ear straight across, and upper ear/temple slanted up, both covered with the front of my haircut, which I gelled into place.</li>
            <li> However, with the Pro version, it is much harder to apply and does not stick easily.  </li>
            <li> I have super short hair and this will not work for me.</li>
            <li> I love them and buy an extra box to keep on hand in case I run out without realizing I&#x27;m running low.</li>
            <li> I found either Face Lift product worked fine, but I liked the connivence of the Secret Lift Pro,  and tended to use them most of the time (you may prefer the other product however; everyone&#x27;s hair coverage is different.</li>
            <li> My neck is transformed from loose skin  and wrinkles to smooth and youthful.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> and they just did not work or I was doing them wrong, but the ones with the elastic work great.  </li>
            <li> The only exception is perhaps on a hot sweaty day or if your skin is very oily.  </li>
            <li> After having read the directions, don&#x27;t waste your money if you think this will give you a more youthful look.</li>
            <li> I have a normal size head and shape.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used the face one before, and that is much better, however when you do a knot to shorten it , the elastic doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> Does not work snaps right in the middle when you stretch it..</li>
            <li> I have become so dependent on these wonder strips that I called immediately to get a new band mailed out promptly.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with this new one - just using 4</li>
            <li> no one new</li>
            <li> This product provides lovely lift for half a day, as compared to the full day of lift with the original Secret Lift.  </li>
            <li> They did their job, but my skin is very sensitive to the tape on these bands.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small price for a simple and effective product that truly delivers what it promises if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> works pretty cool just wish they were just a bit shorter, maybe I have a small neck</li>
            <li> , THEY REALLY MAKE YOU LOOK YOUNGER.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> I tried one on a friend who is 68 years old and she couldn&#x27;t believe it either.  </li>
            <li> fast and simple to apply.</li>
            <li> but it does not pull back quite a much as I would like but cheaper than a facelift</li>
            <li> You do have to consider your hairstyle carefully (no ponytails or buns if you have longer hair), and are a bit less cooperative when it&#x27;s super hot out (especially if you sweat a lot)</li>
            <li> I use a little spirit gum on the tapes and use light pressure on them for several seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 62 years old and thanks to some lucky genetics in facial bone structure, usually came off looking younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li> I used alcohol to clean the areas and even tried to use a little extra glue.  </li>
            <li> To bad from the demo it looked great if it worked....</li>
            <li> Rubber won&#x27;t stretch far enough to go around head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old, and feel that I should finally opt out of cosmetic surgery. ..</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the small amount of improvement</li>
            <li> As an older woman who doesn&#x27;t want surgery, I&#x27;ve tried several types of applied lifts to reduce the appearance of a saggy jawline and aged neck.  </li>
            <li> the glue on this one was not as strong as the face secret lift.</li>
            <li> It not only brings back my neck and removes the unsightly and aging vertical bands from under my chin and down, it brings back my whole jawline.  </li>
            <li> but I will be ordering the original Secret Lift from now on.</li>
            <li> an unmistakable marker of my true age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lived with this, unhappily, while I consider surgery which for a variety of reasons, I really want to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the present ones are either too long or too short.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were not clear enough on how to pull the skin back so there was no turkey neck!</li>
            <li> as long as you experiment and test them before making your public debut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with the tape sticking on the lifts from my last two orders, in fact, the ones I put on to go out to dinner tonight came loose after only an hour.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, several tines a year I an in the public eye, as part of a musical group that tours nationally each year, and internationally every few years.</li>
            <li> it couldn&#x27;t provide both comfort and long wear.</li>
            <li> When stretched they snap.</li>
            <li> It works, as long as you can keep it covered with your hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It is necessary to hold one side firmly in place for 90 seconds before pulling the second tab into place.  </li>
            <li> Both had slipped &amp; shifted loose.  </li>
            <li> If you perspire it will come loose.  </li>
            <li> It was ok, but hard to put on, uncomfortable to wear, and tended to come loose before the night was over</li>
            <li> I think it needs to be a little wider in the back.</li>
            <li> one size definitely does not fit all.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Always snaps (breaks) in back of neck after a few hrs.</li>
            <li> your skin is wet</li>
            <li> Then you pull it to the other side over the crown of your head where you have parted your hair so as to make a space for this stretchy elastic band.  </li>
            <li> I Just apply one then pull two under my neck hair and up to the other ear.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear my hair up because they would show but other than that</li>
            <li> upon the other.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a person at the other end of your email who promptly reads and responds to our request or comment.</li>
            <li> Then hold both firmly for another 90, or they will pop loose.  </li>
            <li> A waste of my money, didnt work as I expected.</li>
            <li> I always lie down to do this so that gravity helps.  </li>
            <li> my neck is all sticky and black from the tape.</li>
            <li> The band that runs from end to end across the back of your neck is not only uncomfortable while on, it was tender for days after.</li>
            <li> I will try to find them elsewhere for less money.</li>
            <li> i was looking to lift the jowls on the corner of the mouth by wearing this just beneath the ear lobes, but it was a total disappointment as the elastic was way too short and the glue bits kept snapping off.</li>
            <li> waste of money, don&#x27;t stick, don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> , I tried the Face, Neck and Eye Lift, the Secret Pro Neck and Jaw Lift, and the Instant Face Neck and Eye Lift products.</li>
            <li> I took a few weeks to experiment, and learn how to use them undetectably.</li>
            <li> The patches don&#x27;t adhere to the skin and come off after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> , late on the night of my arrival (and finding upon unpacking that I had forgotten the Lifts), I ordered another batch of Lifts for delivery to my hotel,  and sent a rather desperate email to CosmeSearch (the company who sells all the products), begging them to somehow speed my delivery (deliveries for my past order always came promptly and within the promised &amp;#34;Standard Mail&amp;#34; timeframes, but I knew the far bounds of that time frame would not be soon enough this time).</li>
            <li> , my pigtails are TOO TIGHT!</li>
            <li> My neck looks years younger with the Secret Lift Pro!</li>
            <li> I found these to be uncomfortable to wear, but they do work for a short time.</li>
            <li> I had no sensitivity to the one on the small elastic string.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this!</li>
            <li> I have a small head and the bands kept popping.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will use it again.</li>
            <li> The product works by braiding a small patch of hair and using small rubber bands to tie the braid.</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> The past 2 years have seen jowls come to my face and neck</li>
            <li> I got both the secret lift pro and the regular secret lift,and they were shipped in a couple days.</li>
            <li> The secret lift pro is very uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t stick as well as the original Secret</li>
            <li> The elastic band, when stretched out it becomes very thin and small string.</li>
            <li> this product will take off at least 10.  </li>
            <li> No more scarves trying to hide my neck!  </li>
            <li> Subtle difference but</li>
            <li> A little difficult to use and not at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a problem</li>
            <li> and this was late at night on the west coast!</li>
            <li> I have for years used the orginal secret lifts and when my elastic broke was devastated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be continuing to use the Secret Life Pro product for years to come.</li>
            <li> I have used the Secret Pro Lift (neck and jaw lift) for a couple of years</li>
            <li> Not great.  </li>
            <li> but when you stretch it, it goes so thin and digs into your neck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> secret lift should produce one specifically for the lifting of the mouth corners.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> my secret</li>
            <li> do you have tape behind your ear ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit allergic to the tape behind the ears but nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and people think I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s!!  </li>
            <li> Terrible, would not stay on for a second.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want a facelift because of the fake way it makes everyone who has had one look...</li>
            <li> It can be a bit uncomfortable, but it&#x27;s working well for me at this time.</li>
            <li> This tore the skin off the back of my ear horribly -  so painful!!</li>
            <li> I used 100 when only 2 would crap off!!  </li>
            <li> (Which by the way she had and is still unhappy).  </li>
            <li> Unhappy with product.</li>
            <li> but the metal grips that hold are painful to my ears.</li>
            <li> I get frustrated when I read that they have &#x27;discontinued&#x27; the product and don&#x27;t know if it will return.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable and very painful!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think these are just terrible.  </li>
            <li> It was lousy!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had two crap off!  </li>
            <li> , Worst case 15-20 minutes.&lt;br</li>

            <li> To anyone considering going under the knife....I have for years used the orginal secret lifts and when my elastic broke was devastated. I have become so dependent on these wonder strips that I called immediately to get a new band mailed out promptly. As soon as it gets here I can go on with my lifel. lol, All kidding aside I am addicted to the wonderful difference it makes in my appearance and want everyone to get them that needs them...</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THESE FOR OVER ONE YEAR AND THEY WORK GREAT!!!  IT TAKES AWHILE TO GET JUST THE RIGHT POSITION ON YOUR NECK TO BE COMFORTABE AND DO THE BEST JOB.  DO&#x27;NT GIVE UP, THEY REALLY MAKE YOU LOOK YOUNGER.  I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN SO I JUST USE SOAP AND WATER TO CLEAN THE AREA  ( *NOT ALCOHOL*)</li>
            <li> I have already written a review for this product. Here is another I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I will continue to order from this seller  The product works for me the way it said that it would I have received so many compliments since I started using the tapes and they are the reason why</li>
            <li> These are great, easy to apply, and YES they stay put all day if you follow directions.  The only exception is perhaps on a hot sweaty day or if your skin is very oily.  In any case, they sure help you feel a bit &amp;#34;fresher of face&amp;#34; for the occasional meeting, party or getting your picture taken.  Subtle difference but quite effective - quite nice!</li>
            <li> Very nice neck band - smooth and snug. However, the adhesive is not as strong as on the original. This product provides lovely lift for half a day, as compared to the full day of lift with the original Secret Lift.  My conclusion? More comfortable band for half the time. Shame it couldn&#x27;t provide both comfort and long wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from CosmeSearch several times, and I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with their customer service. I received all my orders earlier than expected, and the product works great! My neck looks years younger with the Secret Lift Pro! I find the adhesive to be very secure, and they&#x27;re very easy to apply. I&#x27;ll be continuing to use the Secret Life Pro product for years to come.</li>
            <li> Fantastic  You owe it to yourself to try this great idea.</li>
            <li> one size definitely does not fit all.  way too big</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and they work!!  This company is great and really cares about its customers!!  I&#x27;m 65 and people think I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s!!  I love my face lift tapes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
            <li> waste of money, don&#x27;t stick, don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Tape won&#x27;t hold even with following directions. Rubber won&#x27;t stretch far enough to go around head. Save your dollars for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I found these to be uncomfortable to wear, but they do work for a short time.</li>
            <li> Terrible, would not stay on for a second.</li>
            <li> My wife thought this would be a quick alternative to a facelift.  (Which by the way she had and is still unhappy).  Anyway, it stayed stuck on for 15 minutes and then fell off.  The end of that.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t even make it five minutes before it fell off. Total waste of money. I bought this product and NeckTITE at  the same time, and I&#x27;m throwing these away.</li>
            <li> The sticky part did not have enough sticky on it to stay.  The instructions were not clear enough on how to pull the skin back so there was no turkey neck!</li>
            <li> They did their job, but my skin is very sensitive to the tape on these bands. I had no sensitivity to the one on the small elastic string. but the metal grips that hold are painful to my ears.</li>
            <li> I love this product soooo much!  I won&#x27;t go out without it anymore!  It not only brings back my neck and removes the unsightly and aging vertical bands from under my chin and down, it brings back my whole jawline.  I don&#x27;t want a facelift because of the fake way it makes everyone who has had one look... I just want to look younger and refreshed and this product does it.  I tried one on a friend who is 68 years old and she couldn&#x27;t believe it either.  She went right home and ordered them!  I want these available forever!</li>
            <li> Brilliant. Look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but hard to put on, uncomfortable to wear, and tended to come loose before the night was over</li>
            <li> I really love these. They are a fast, inexpensive and mostly painless alternative to surgery or injections. You do have to consider your hairstyle carefully (no ponytails or buns if you have longer hair), and are a bit less cooperative when it&#x27;s super hot out (especially if you sweat a lot) but it&#x27;s a small price for a simple and effective product that truly delivers what it promises if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Really works!</li>
            <li> I think these are just terrible.  I put one on for couple of hours. When I get home to take it off. my neck is all sticky and black from the tape.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. In fact It actually wouldn&#x27;t stay on and kept popping off.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product because it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great product. It can be a bit uncomfortable, but it&#x27;s working well for me at this time. Really, REALLY happy I found it.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I get frustrated when I read that they have &#x27;discontinued&#x27; the product and don&#x27;t know if it will return.</li>
            <li> Love it I keep on ordering this.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t do without this face life now.  I only ish I can go into a store a buy it than waiting for it to come through the mail.</li>
            <li> After having read the directions, don&#x27;t waste your money if you think this will give you a more youthful look. First, the directions have you putting the adhesive pad at the front top of your ear. Not an easy place to hide the tape even though it is &#x27;clear&#x27; . (Maybe it is the metal attachment that makes it so much more visible.) Then you pull it to the other side over the crown of your head where you have parted your hair so as to make a space for this stretchy elastic band.  Good luck with that! As a gag gift it would be nice if it came packaged separately as pictured.</li>
            <li> Would not stick no matter what. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on like the face kit</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this! I think scotch tape would work better or even a bandaid! Would never buy again!</li>
            <li> Works well and much cheaper than a facelift</li>
            <li> Belle...I have used the Secret Pro Lift (neck and jaw lift) for a couple of years and I love it.  It works and definitely takes years off. Also, it is&lt;br /&gt;comfortable.  Try it, I think you will like it as much as I do!,</li>
            <li> I have super short hair and this will not work for me.</li>
            <li> I received samples of the lifts that you do not need the elastic bands with and they just did not work or I was doing them wrong, but the ones with the elastic work great.  If you are like me and are sensitive to the tape buy the liquid bandage that is in the first aid section of any drug store and put the on the spot you will be attaching the adhesive to.  Works like a charm...it actually gives the adhesive a better surface texture to grip and protects your face from the adhesive.</li>
            <li> These tapes.bands do not hold!! I have a small head and the bands kept popping. They held for about 20 minutes. I used for an interview. By the time I got there, they had given way.  I think the use of the ties are better than the stretched rubber.  I used alcohol to clean the areas and even tried to use a little extra glue.  I would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Not great.  A little difficult to use and not at all comfortable especially if your hair gets caught in the adhesive.  The adhesive left red marks on my neck.  I used them for a special occasion and had to take the strip off after a couple of hours.  So much for vanity!</li>
            <li> Not as good at all as the other.</li>
            <li> does not stay on.....</li>
            <li> These are too short for me to use for my double chin skin.</li>
            <li> The concept of the lift is excellent, and when I wear it, I look 10 years younger, No kidding.  However, with the Pro version, it is much harder to apply and does not stick easily.  It is necessary to hold one side firmly in place for 90 seconds before pulling the second tab into place.  Then hold both firmly for another 90, or they will pop loose.  I always lie down to do this so that gravity helps.  I Just apply one then pull two under my neck hair and up to the other ear.  This device is much more comfortable than the older, first version.  I just wish there were a way to make it easier to apply.  It is a great, quick fix for special occasions or photos, and  I wore mine to a class reunion.</li>
            <li> Love these tapes as they have given me my self confidence back  I use a little spirit gum on the tapes and use light pressure on them for several seconds. My neck is transformed from loose skin  and wrinkles to smooth and youthful.  I cannot stand to run out!  I use spirit gum remover and any residue after removal comes off easily.  No more scarves trying to hide my neck!  So thankful for these  I wish they were a bit longer .</li>
            <li> Instant Lift is extremely effective take as much as 20 yrs off in a NEW YORK MINUTE and the new design is perfect : Lets Face it and feel refreshed</li>
            <li> Big Improvement over the original. Love this one piece system. Do not rip these off like a band aid it will take skin with it...trust me.&lt;br /&gt;My friends have said &amp;#34;What have you done, you look awesome&amp;#34; some I tell, others not a chance ; )</li>
            <li> if it is warm ouside the fall off ..be sure to use a lot of rubbing  alcohol before you put it on.</li>
            <li> As an older woman who doesn&#x27;t want surgery, I&#x27;ve tried several types of applied lifts to reduce the appearance of a saggy jawline and aged neck.  These are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  They&#x27;re very easy to apply, they make a dramatic difference in smoothing out the neck and jawline, and best of all, they&#x27;re are much more comfortable to wear all day... love this new version.....</li>
            <li> They work great.  I love the difference they make in how I look and feel.  I can&#x27;t wear my hair up because they would show but other than that I love the product.</li>
            <li> Great idea but they don&#x27;t stay on.  Mine come right off.</li>
            <li> The secret lift pro is very uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t stick as well as the original Secret lift.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the elastic would be more comfortable but when you stretch it, it goes so thin and digs into your neck.&lt;br /&gt;I will use the rest of these in an emergency but I will be ordering the original Secret Lift from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times. They are very good if used as directed.  I just re-ordered and they have even improved the neck band. I&#x27;m impressed.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The straps are too short.  I have a normal size head and shape.  The straps were so taut it gave me the &amp;#34;Mommy, Mommy, my pigtails are TOO TIGHT! look.&amp;#34;  Yikes.  I wish I could return them.  Unusable for me.</li>
            <li> the glue on this one was not as strong as the face secret lift. and although it says neck and jaw it doesn&#x27;t really stretch out to on the jaw. i was looking to lift the jowls on the corner of the mouth by wearing this just beneath the ear lobes, but it was a total disappointment as the elastic was way too short and the glue bits kept snapping off. i&#x27;ve used the face one before, and that is much better, however when you do a knot to shorten it , the elastic doesn&#x27;t last as long.  secret lift should produce one specifically for the lifting of the mouth corners. the present ones are either too long or too short.</li>
            <li> I recently lost a lot of weight. Rather than have my muscles pulled up on my face during plastic surgery I decided to give Cosmesearch a try and haven&#x27;t  stopped ordering it yet!  I&#x27;m satisfied from day one. Easy to apply.. :)</li>
            <li> Not happy. They break when wearing them. When stretched they snap.</li>
            <li> The new design is more convenient but the adhesive is not as good as the that used with old tabs you attach yourself.  I haven&#x27;t had one last more than an hour. Bummer.</li>
            <li> oh it works, and you look wonderful. It also tore my skin off when I removed it. The band that runs from end to end across the back of your neck is not only uncomfortable while on, it was tender for days after. I am not sure I will use it again.</li>
            <li> Does not work snaps right in the middle when you stretch it.. To bad from the demo it looked great if it worked....</li>
            <li> Amazing!  It works, as long as you can keep it covered with your hair.  It is amazing!!  What a difference!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I really liked the original band and tapes but they went up in price. I gave the preassembled ones a shot (2 orders) and they don&#x27;t stick. Im using 3-4 a day. Even with alcohol. I will try to find them elsewhere for less money.</li>
            <li> Tape doesn&#x27;t work...waste of money.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using these lifts for several months and am very happy with my lifted look.  I have been having problems with the tape sticking on the lifts from my last two orders, in fact, the ones I put on to go out to dinner tonight came loose after only an hour.  I hope this is a fluke problem with the tape because I use them everday.</li>
            <li> I got both the secret lift pro and the regular secret lift,and they were shipped in a couple days. the customer service was excellent,the product,really works..and you need just a minimum of practice to find the right lift foy yourself. I would  definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Heather Silman</li>
            <li> These are easy to use - they make a difference and I highly recommend them.  Just make sure your skin is clean and the adhesive will hold without a problem.  This is a really Great product for the late 50s -- early-to-mid 60s gal that just wants to look &amp;#34;refreshed.&amp;#34;  A wrinkly/saggy neck really adds years...this product will take off at least 10.  I love them and buy an extra box to keep on hand in case I run out without realizing I&#x27;m running low.</li>
            <li> Always snaps (breaks) in back of neck after a few hrs.</li>
            <li> This tore the skin off the back of my ear horribly -  so painful!!</li>
            <li> If you sweat it comes off!</li>
            <li> Lifts are large and unsightly.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone using them.</li>
            <li> These are great if you never sweat and have hair long enough to cover them.  They will come unglued if you sweat.</li>
            <li> this product is pretty great! fast and simple to apply.</li>
            <li> works pretty cool just wish they were just a bit shorter, maybe I have a small neck but it does not pull back quite a much as I would like but cheaper than a facelift and they do work somewhat</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This does not work at all.</li>
            <li> This attaches by the hair over your ear. The product works by braiding a small patch of hair and using small rubber bands to tie the braid.The hair combs then attach through the braid with an elastic band around the back of the head. Worked great until I started losing hair due to the constant tension on this area. Gr8 concept, just isnt going to be an option for me.:(</li>
            <li> it works great. it is amazing. I love it.</li>
            <li> Its  Wonderful Product. Congratulations CosmeSearch!!</li>
            <li> Did not look like pictures.  I still had sagging.  Wasn&#x27;t worth the small amount of improvement</li>
            <li> It was lousy!!!!! The tape didn&#x27;t stick and yes I used  alcohol yo cleaning the area first.......went thru the  whole pack and nothing! !!!!!! Just a waste of money!  Amazon I&#x27;m very disappointed this is the first time I&#x27;ve had a problem so now I really am leery on ordering anything again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good, but  notice always clear with alcohol before put it one.&lt;br /&gt;When your skin is wet our sweaty it will not slick.&lt;br /&gt;the result are great.&lt;br /&gt;you need to where you hear longer it is not for short hear.</li>
            <li> Try this.  It takes some doing to figure out where to place the tabs fr best lift, but it does work.  I suggest cleaningoff your ski i with alcohol before applyig the tabs. I  have purchased a lot of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest  having a friend help at first, and take along a spare band when you are out just in case.  It does hold well, but what if.....</li>
            <li> Great product! Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I had a problem with this new one - just using 4 I had two crap off!  Yikes - the others were better!  I used 100 when only 2 would crap off!!  They cost twice as much and don&#x27;t work well!</li>
            <li> Secret lift pro -neck and jaw is great it actually made me look five years younger my friends ask me what was I using on my skin no one new my secret I plan to order more</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  Best case, 1-2 hours., Worst case 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you prep the skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does tighten nicely for the time that it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;neck &amp; jaw&amp;#34; strips help appearance when first applied.  However .. the first time I used one,  I lost patches of skin upon removal.&lt;br /&gt;After the scabs healed (lol) I thought I would try it again, and be more careful when pulling off the adhesives.  I was having coffee with a friend,&lt;br /&gt;and she asked, &amp;#34;Why do you have tape behind your ear ?&amp;#34;  I learned from that .. Do not stick the face-lift tabs over the Pro-Lift tabs,&lt;br /&gt;one upon the other.  Both had slipped &amp; shifted loose.  I&#x27;m 68 years old, and feel that I should finally opt out of cosmetic surgery. .. although&lt;br /&gt;that &amp;#34;Joan Rivers vanity&amp;#34; still speaks from the mirror.  A surgical face lift only last about 7 years .. so I find this product the next-best alternative;&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m thankful for development &amp; distribution of these beauty products.</li>
            <li> Unhappy with product. Will not stay on more than an hour. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I liked the results but it was too tight on my neck. I think it needs to be a little wider in the back.</li>
            <li> Worked well until weather at function got hot humid.  I tried several but the wouldn&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li> Need to practice a lot to get these in the right spot and then keep them there.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! I love it and use it every single day alternating with &amp;#34;instant face, neck and eye lift&amp;#34;, it is just like getting a cosmetic surgery but so much more cheaper and painless :-)  I&#x27;m a bit allergic to the tape behind the ears but nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> I am 50, and have started to experience the lines and droop around the mouth/jaw area.  In wanting to delay a &amp;#34;lifestyle lift&amp;#34; I bought this to use as a temporary fix.  It DOES eliminate the lines and droopiness; however, you most certainly realize you have it on, and I would recommend using a type of &amp;#34;spirit gum&amp;#34; if you intend to wear it all day.  If you perspire it will come loose.  This would be great for photographs, etc.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all ....</li>
            <li> A waste of my money, didnt work as I expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave the house without them!!</li>
            <li> WON&#x27;T STAY......AWEFUL STUFF</li>
            <li> The elastic band, when stretched out it becomes very thin and small string. It digs into my neck! Very uncomfortable and very painful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 62 years old and thanks to some lucky genetics in facial bone structure, usually came off looking younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until recently. The past 2 years have seen jowls come to my face and neck an unmistakable marker of my true age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lived with this, unhappily, while I consider surgery which for a variety of reasons, I really want to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, several tines a year I an in the public eye, as part of a musical group that tours nationally each year, and internationally every few years. There are photographs, interviews, meeting a lot of people I&#x27;d like to look my best for. I just couldn&#x27;t bear to accept looking so much older than I had in previous years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried the Face, Neck and Eye Lift, the Secret Pro Neck and Jaw Lift, and the Instant Face Neck and Eye Lift products. (hereafter referred to as the &amp;#34;Lifts&amp;#34;). I took a few weeks to experiment, and learn how to use them undetectably. The Neck lifts were pretty much undetectable unless I wore my hair up high; the face Lifts were placed very close to the ear; lower ear straight across, and upper ear/temple slanted up, both covered with the front of my haircut, which I gelled into place. I found either Face Lift product worked fine, but I liked the connivence of the Secret Lift Pro,  and tended to use them most of the time (you may prefer the other product however; everyone&#x27;s hair coverage is different. I suggest you try them all; they are reasonably priced, I think, for the results).  The Final Exam was when I wore them around the house for a day and night, and my husband thought I &amp;#34;looked great today&amp;#34; (said so), yet never detected the Lifts! Fortified, I &amp;#34;went public&amp;#34; (very public!) for last summer&#x27;s events and shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were an unmitigated success. To make a long story short, everyone (including myself), thought I looked pretty damn good. And no one ever suspected I was using the Lifts. Wow! These are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward to the present day. In anticipation of another short tour this month, I ordered my stock of Lifts. THEN I FORGOT TO PACK THEM ON MY CROSS COUNTRY TRIP, and found myself Lift-less 3 days from my first important appearance ( a private party for one of my favorite actors!),  Wothout those Lifts, I truly felt I might as well just turn around and go home, so great was my dependence on the significant appearance-booster of the Lifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, late on the night of my arrival (and finding upon unpacking that I had forgotten the Lifts), I ordered another batch of Lifts for delivery to my hotel,  and sent a rather desperate email to CosmeSearch (the company who sells all the products), begging them to somehow speed my delivery (deliveries for my past order always came promptly and within the promised &amp;#34;Standard Mail&amp;#34; timeframes, but I knew the far bounds of that time frame would not be soon enough this time). I didn&#x27;t expect success: delivery times tend to be pretty firm, as each vendor has their own standard procedures for fulfillment of orders and I don&#x27;t imagine they like to disrupt their fulfillment chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the miracle part: A CosmeSearch representative emailed me a reply within hours...and this was late at night on the west coast! They said the would &amp;#34;upgrade your order to expedited shipping tomorrow&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt; I offered to pay. They declined and said &amp;#34;free of charge&amp;#34;. I mean, how often do you get a great product, that level of customer responsiveness, and accommodation to your special circumstance? I know the answer. In fact I almost hesitate to write these details as I can&#x27;t believe that level of responsiveness is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, But you can be sure  there&#x27;s a person at the other end of your email who promptly reads and responds to our request or comment. I also think you will like the products too...as long as you experiment and test them before making your public debut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m blown away. I will be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, even greater customer service. What do you expect? 5 Stars. Wish I could give 6!ill be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, even greater customer service. What do you expect? 5 Stars. Wish I could give 6!</li>
            <li> Doest stick well. But I love the design, great idea but please make to hold more secure.</li>
            <li> The description of the product did not match what I received. The tapes were 1 piece not two. You pull the rubber cord around your head and tape it to your face. In my case, the rubber cord was too short and didn&#x27;t fit around my head.</li>
            <li> The asdhesive doesn&#x27;t adhere to the skin on most of them--usually only on one side!</li>
            <li> happy wife, happy life!</li>
            <li> Great Products and great customer service</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  The patches don&#x27;t adhere to the skin and come off after a few minutes.</li>
