            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>good for keeping my teeth healthy......</li>
            <li>It is probably suitable for scrubbing your bathroom.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best toothbrushes I have found.</li>
            <li>The handle has a nicely contoured grip and quite easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always end up forgetting to buy new toothbrushes at the store, but now I have a good stockpile at a good price.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s at best a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>The wave pattern of the bristles makes sure that you get all sides of every tooth without damaging gums or enamel.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush works ok</li>
            <li>We love this toothbrush and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores.</li>
            <li>Absolutely my favorite toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s challenging to order them.</li>
            <li>Many Comfort Fits and Zigzags have incorrect text descriptions along with their non-matching pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the Wave stays in my hand so much better than all the &amp;#34;360&amp;#34; brushes.  </li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The compact head is an appropriate size.</li>
            <li>Makes you enjoy brushing your teeth--will brush longer, then!</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the aesthetics of this toothbrush, with its purple and gray color scheme, wave-shaped handle, and full head of soft, plush bristles.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product and good value.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe how good and fast the service was.</li>
            <li>However much you like this kind of toothbrush, more power to you.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean, since it&#x27;s mostly uncomplicated.</li>
            <li>We like them so it is easy to order them from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to maneuver, and feels comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>They are all huge.  </li>
            <li>But you have to draw a line somewhere before these silky smooth brush heads take over your life.  </li>
            <li>If anyone would like the remaining 7, feel free to drop me a line.</li>
            <li>thank you for making them available.</li>
            <li>Comfort Fit, Zigzag, Gum Comfort.</li>
            <li>From what I understand, they&#x27;ve discontinued the Comfort Fit and foolishly decided to use its UPC code for the Zigzag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since Comfort Fits are still available</li>
            <li>This one is just a toothbrush - comfortable and I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>So comfortable.</li>
            <li>So excited to find them on line</li>
            <li>Makes your teeth feel well cared for and clean.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those of us with smaller mouths who prefer a soft brush.</li>
            <li>So glad to find the Colgate Wave Soft Compact Head Toothbrush as it has been my favorite for years.  </li>
            <li>The compact head is mostly good although I wish it was a bit smaller.</li>
            <li>Good to have some extra toothbrushes around anyway.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true about Colgate re-using a product code ...</li>
            <li>What a nice change to feel the smooth back on these.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I got lucky with the vendor Teeth-n-things.</li>
            <li>Ordered a bunch more to put in chemo care bags which I give to new chemo patients.</li>
            <li>Arrived faster than promised and the product is exactly as described - couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel great without using a harsh brush.</li>
            <li>Then it occurred to me look on-line and sure enough one of Amazon&#x27;s vendors had them available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started going thru Amazon rather than driving all over town looking for it without success.    </li>
            <li>Many Amazon ads with Comfort Fit pictures and descriptions are shipping as Zigzags instead, and likely will be returned.</li>
            <li>Very soft and comfortable, yet feels like I can still get my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is soft and very easy on the gums, is long-lasting considering its softness, and has an unusual shape that enables it to get to all your teeth.</li>
            <li>My grown son likes them because he can easily get back to where his wisdom teeth were removed and get the area clean.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are far softer than the Oral-B, and I just don&#x27;t feel like they clean adequately..</li>
            <li>My local stores don&#x27;t seem to be stocking many or often any compact head toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>They are exactly that you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>Glad to save money and time by buying several.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a short-headed toothbrush to fit in my mouth, not a narrow-headed toothbrush as the Colgate Wave Soft Compact Head toothbrush is.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes I received were a slightly different shape and felt more like a medium bristle on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and comfortable against my gums.</li>
            <li>However, since this is my favorite tooth brush and they are becoming impossible to find in stores where I live, I am still quite happy with the product itself.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have a small mouth, but the compact size is definitely more comfortable for me.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this expecting a gentle toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Amazon will readily correct any order problem if it even happens.</li>
            <li>I buy them in the combo pack and have them ready as needed.  </li>
            <li>They are fast and work well.</li>
            <li>Fast, efficient and affordable.</li>
            <li>These are gentle on the gums and get the job done.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m definitely a Comfort Fit fan.</li>
            <li>and I liked it enough to try and find it at a number of local B&amp;M&#x27;s but had no luck.</li>
            <li>Why is such a great toothbrush hard to find???  </li>
            <li>For those who gave a low score to the toothbrush because they didn&#x27;t receive 8 make sure to purchase from Amazon themselves and not a third party seller.  </li>
            <li>Item ordered came quickly and mot damaged and will order again in future</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t clean thoroughly or had these long bristles on the outer edge that irritated the gums.  </li>
            <li>The compact head and soft bristles makes it easier for me to clean my back teeth.</li>
            <li>Buy a Dr. Collins perio ultra soft brush if you need a gentle but thorough toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really like the toothbrushes with the soft compact head</li>
            <li>So far out of the 8 that came the first one I tried wasn&#x27;t as soft as the ones I get from my dentist office.</li>
            <li>Makes a good detail cleaner (again, due to soft bristles and small head) when I rotate in a fresh brush.</li>
            <li>I will be more careful next time.</li>
            <li>I also really like having the extra brushes ready when I need to change my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is honestly a very soft brush without being too soft.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite toothbrushes and are always hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some supposedly soft bristles, these are actually soft and do not irritate sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Try these, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised, as I was.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and had been given an ultra soft colgate from my dentist.</li>
            <li>Soft and compact, yet gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I knew to use a soft brush</li>
            <li>I used the sensitive version for my molars and this soft version for my front teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used #53 Colgate Compact Head Soft Bristle that I bought at a Target store.  </li>
            <li>My dentist gives an ultra soft compact toothbrush after cleaning which I like.  </li>
            <li>So I have purchased the ultra soft from another web site.</li>
            <li>I bought 16 of the Colgate Wave Soft Compact Head Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Truly soft.</li>
            <li>They are nice and soft/flexible bristles and pretty small heads (which is hard to find some places).</li>
            <li>This brush is comfortable to use &amp; has a small head</li>
            <li>The bristles on the ones I received are much softer and they do not clean my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>Finally, a soft bristle, compact toothbrush without those pesky tongue cleaners on the back!</li>
            <li>I love the small head for my small mouth and the bristles are actually soft!  </li>
            <li>This brush is not soft, let alone ultra soft.</li>
            <li>Sadly the bristles are harsh and my teeth don&#x27;t feel like they are getting as clean as with the original.</li>

            <li> I also really like having the extra brushes ready when I need to change my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is honestly a very soft brush without being too soft.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes and are always hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some supposedly soft bristles, these are actually soft and do not irritate sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Try these, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised, as I was.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and had been given an ultra soft colgate from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Soft and compact, yet gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I knew to use a soft brush</li>
            <li> I used the sensitive version for my molars and this soft version for my front teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used #53 Colgate Compact Head Soft Bristle that I bought at a Target store.  </li>
            <li> My dentist gives an ultra soft compact toothbrush after cleaning which I like.  </li>
            <li> So I have purchased the ultra soft from another web site.</li>
            <li> I bought 16 of the Colgate Wave Soft Compact Head Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Truly soft.</li>
            <li> They are nice and soft/flexible bristles and pretty small heads (which is hard to find some places).</li>
            <li> This brush is comfortable to use &amp; has a small head</li>
            <li> The bristles on the ones I received are much softer and they do not clean my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Finally, a soft bristle, compact toothbrush without those pesky tongue cleaners on the back!</li>
            <li> I love the small head for my small mouth and the bristles are actually soft!  </li>
            <li> This brush is not soft, let alone ultra soft.</li>
            <li> Sadly the bristles are harsh and my teeth don&#x27;t feel like they are getting as clean as with the original.</li>
            <li> Just want I wanted, small head and bristles gentle on gums</li>
            <li> This item number has a very small &amp;#34;compact head&amp;#34; and I really wanted the somewhat larger head.  </li>
            <li> but all I tried before this always were either not really soft,</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a toothbrush with soft bristles (gentle on gums) and a small head (easier to maneuver)</li>
            <li> The bristles are not soft!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too!  </li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t stand the round handle, so I am now using my old somewhat flat, slightly angled toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I like the soft compact head because I have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li> The two big complaints about this toothbrush are the extremely thin handle, and the very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> The brush is compact and soft and fits well in your mouth to scrub all the hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to get locally after a brief trial period.</li>
            <li> I have big teeth with small space around in my mouth, so I am always in search of small and soft headed toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> For anyone will a small mouth or who still has all their teeth including wisdom teeth, a smaller head on the toothbrush can make a difference in the ability to reach all the teeth.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the other ones will be softer but I have a feeling they might not be.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the Oral-B toothbrushes, but couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted and ended up choosing the Colgate variant of something similar.</li>
            <li> The design is also less ergonomic.</li>
            <li> I was given this little gem when I visited my dentist for a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> wife has to use them when she brushes, has a lot of trouble finding them, and we thought we did when we went on Amazon and found this one billed as Compact Heads.  </li>
            <li> We got tired of the tooth brushes with the &amp;#34;scrubbies&amp;#34; on the back.  </li>
            <li> Few people will \\&quot;love\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was looking for a compact head toothbrush because my mouth is so small that I had to have four permanent teeth removed besides my wisdom</li>
            <li> The head is really small but this doesn&#x27;t bother me because my mouth is fairly small.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to find them in the store, so</li>
            <li> Hard to find otherwise</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> Sorry to hear about those that received the other one.</li>
            <li> So I invested in this 8 pack which left me disappointed.</li>
            <li> compact head tooth brushes are very hard to find in the stores..</li>
            <li> I am just not happy with the seller and their mistake.</li>
            <li> but it is heavy and awkward to use since I have arthritis in my hands.</li>
            <li> This is one of those items that shouldn&#x27;t be difficult to find but is.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid they have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find the compact head toothbrushes in the stores</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the perfect size toothbrush. It&#x27;s smaller than the regular ones but not child size. It easier to brush and reach all your teeth.</li>
            <li> The brush is compact and soft and fits well in your mouth to scrub all the hard to reach areas.  Makes your teeth feel well cared for and clean. Great price for a pack of 8.  Try these, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised, as I was.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> LOVE these toothbrushes!  Finally, a soft bristle, compact toothbrush without those pesky tongue cleaners on the back!</li>
            <li> The perfect toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li> This order was for a pack of 8 tooth brushes. I only received 7. However, since this is my favorite tooth brush and they are becoming impossible to find in stores where I live, I am still quite happy with the product itself. I am just not happy with the seller and their mistake.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this expecting a gentle toothbrush.It is probably suitable for scrubbing your bathroom.  I have sensitive gums and had been given an ultra soft colgate from my dentist.This is not even close to it.The ultra has been discontinued.   Buy a Dr. Collins perio ultra soft brush if you need a gentle but thorough toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Why is such a great toothbrush hard to find???  I was given this little gem when I visited my dentist for a cleaning.  I loved it so much I ordered the 8 pack from Amazon.  Don&#x27;t want to pay almost $4 each at the store (when I can find them).  This is a bargain for an awesome toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I have similar toothbrush so that&#x27;s why I ordered. I am happy with the purchase and will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This brush is not soft, let alone ultra soft.</li>
            <li> However much you like this kind of toothbrush, more power to you.  But it is NOT a compact head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has to use them when she brushes, has a lot of trouble finding them, and we thought we did when we went on Amazon and found this one billed as Compact Heads.  But it&#x27;s not...it&#x27;s at best a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My local stores don&#x27;t seem to be stocking many or often any compact head toothbrushes. They are all huge.  For anyone will a small mouth or who still has all their teeth including wisdom teeth, a smaller head on the toothbrush can make a difference in the ability to reach all the teeth. These work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Soft and compact, yet gets the job done. Makes my teeth feel great without using a harsh brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write my review for the one person out there that will buy this and try to use all 8 of them at once: hey dude, go one at a time.  I&#x27;m all about taking risks, but you gotta know your limits.  If you wanna start with 2 and work your way up to 4 or 5, go for it.  But you have to draw a line somewhere before these silky smooth brush heads take over your life.  That&#x27;s not gonna happen while I&#x27;m around, dear friend... you hear me??  NOT ON MY WATCH!!!  Also, the purple color matches my wallpaper.</li>
            <li> I have just had a lot of fillings done with my dentist and have been shown how to perform proper oral hygiene on my teeth and gums.  I have not been doing this for years.  And the toothbrush they gave me?  The Colgate Wave.  They explained to me why it was the brush they gave patients and I am so grateful.  I knew to use a soft brush but all I tried before this always were either not really soft, didn&#x27;t clean thoroughly or had these long bristles on the outer edge that irritated the gums.  This Wave toothbrush is perfection.  It is honestly a very soft brush without being too soft.  The wave pattern of the bristles makes sure that you get all sides of every tooth without damaging gums or enamel.  When I use this brush my mouth always feels like I just got a dental cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine, a brush that does what it says and thoroughly cleans without supposed bells and whistles.  My order arrived promptly and of course I got the 8 brushes I ordered.  For those who gave a low score to the toothbrush because they didn&#x27;t receive 8 make sure to purchase from Amazon themselves and not a third party seller.  Amazon will readily correct any order problem if it even happens.</li>
            <li> Appreciate that I can still find the Wave toothbrush through Amazon.  I like the soft compact head because I have a small mouth.  My grown son likes them because he can easily get back to where his wisdom teeth were removed and get the area clean.  I buy them in the combo pack and have them ready as needed.  Good price.  Recommend the Wave.</li>
            <li> The compact head is mostly good although I wish it was a bit smaller. I do like the shape of the head (tapered I guess). I used the sensitive version for my molars and this soft version for my front teeth. The toothbrush works ok and it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean, since it&#x27;s mostly uncomplicated. However, I can&#x27;t stand the round handle, so I am now using my old somewhat flat, slightly angled toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I have big teeth with small space around in my mouth, so I am always in search of small and soft headed toothbrushes. I used to use Colgate navigator, but that was discontinued. Then I found this one in local grocery store, but this was also discontinued soon after it was launched. So I immediately went on Amazon to find if anyone has leftover stock and ordered these here. They are exactly that you see in the picture. They come in bulk packaging.</li>
            <li> Got one from my dentist. Stop using anything else.</li>
            <li> These are hard to get locally after a brief trial period. We like them so it is easy to order them from Amazon. They are fast and work well.</li>
            <li> Happy to find the toothbrush that the dentist recommends for me and haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores.  Glad to save money and time by buying several.</li>
            <li> So far out of the 8 that came the first one I tried wasn&#x27;t as soft as the ones I get from my dentist office. Hopefully the other ones will be softer but I have a feeling they might not be.</li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores. So excited to find them on line</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a Colgate Wave during one of my visits and I liked it enough to try and find it at a number of local B&amp;M&#x27;s but had no luck. Then it occurred to me look on-line and sure enough one of Amazon&#x27;s vendors had them available. So I invested in this 8 pack which left me disappointed. While the brush looks like the freebie I received from my dentist it does not feel the same in my mouth. Sadly the bristles are harsh and my teeth don&#x27;t feel like they are getting as clean as with the original. If anyone would like the remaining 7, feel free to drop me a line. I would be happy to send them your way.</li>
            <li> I was trying to buy the Wave toothbrush in the picture that I can no longer find in stores, but I was sent a newer version, not the pictured item.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase of these toothbrushes. I need the compact head so I can reach everywhere and it is hard to find them in the store, so thank you for making them available.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes and are always hard to find.  I really like the toothbrushes with the soft compact head</li>
            <li> We got tired of the tooth brushes with the &amp;#34;scrubbies&amp;#34; on the back.  What a nice change to feel the smooth back on these.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just like the one in the picture but various colors. Could not be more happy.  Sorry to hear about those that received the other one.</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient and affordable. How do you improve on perfection.</li>
            <li> good product, good service</li>
            <li> I received different Colgate Wave toothbrushes from the one pictured. The bristles on the ones I received are much softer and they do not clean my teeth very well. The design is also less ergonomic.</li>
            <li> Item ordered came quickly and mot damaged and will order again in future</li>
            <li> These are gentle on the gums and get the job done.  I don&#x27;t think I have a small mouth, but the compact size is definitely more comfortable for me.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush.  I have an electric toothbrush but it is heavy and awkward to use since I have arthritis in my hands.</li>
            <li> I used to go to a dentist who had this style of toothbrush to hand out at each check-up.  It is hard to find a toothbrush with soft bristles (gentle on gums) and a small head (easier to maneuver) so I bought an 8 pack!  Good to have some extra toothbrushes around anyway.  Makes a good detail cleaner (again, due to soft bristles and small head) when I rotate in a fresh brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not soft!</li>
            <li> compact head tooth brushes are very hard to find in the stores..this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is one of those items that shouldn&#x27;t be difficult to find but is.  I&#x27;ve started going thru Amazon rather than driving all over town looking for it without success.    Perfect for those of us with smaller mouths who prefer a soft brush.</li>
            <li> Have used the wave for yrs and yrs and never could find in the drug stores. Now I will have my supply. I am 81 and cannot change now.</li>
            <li> Hard to find otherwise</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these.  It is very difficult to find the compact head toothbrushes in the stores</li>
            <li> The Best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve found yet and a great price. We will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite toothbrush ever. Couldn&#x27;t find anywhere for years.  Very happy I can now order on amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the aesthetics of this toothbrush, with its purple and gray color scheme, wave-shaped handle, and full head of soft, plush bristles. It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to maneuver, and feels comfortable to hold. The bristles are densely packed and feel like heaven on the gums. This is a quality manual toothbrush. I can appreciate the difference between it and a dollar store generic.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush for those of us with receeding gums.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than promised and the product is exactly as described - couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find in walmart/target/walgreens...so buy it here...great product...good for keeping my teeth healthy......</li>
            <li> So glad to find the Colgate Wave Soft Compact Head Toothbrush as it has been my favorite for years.  Tried others and just not the same.  Couldn&#x27;t believe how good and fast the service was.</li>
            <li> I always end up forgetting to buy new toothbrushes at the store, but now I have a good stockpile at a good price.  They are nice and soft/flexible bristles and pretty small heads (which is hard to find some places).</li>
            <li> Excellent, these brushes work well for me.  Hard to find in the stores anymore, even&lt;br /&gt;Wal Mart.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a compact head toothbrush because my mouth is so small that I had to have four permanent teeth removed besides my wisdom teeth so that the remaining teeth would not overlap and be crowded. I was looking for a short-headed toothbrush to fit in my mouth, not a narrow-headed toothbrush as the Colgate Wave Soft Compact Head toothbrush is. It&#x27;s like a pinstripe suit with horizontal stripes. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense!</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush and a great deal.</li>
            <li> I have used #53 Colgate Compact Head Soft Bristle that I bought at a Target store.  The toothbrushes I received were a slightly different shape and felt more like a medium bristle on my teeth. My dentist gives an ultra soft compact toothbrush after cleaning which I like.  So I have purchased the ultra soft from another web site.</li>
            <li> I bought one for use during chemotherapy, which can cause mouth sores.  Very soft and comfortable, yet feels like I can still get my teeth clean.  Ordered a bunch more to put in chemo care bags which I give to new chemo patients.</li>
            <li> Turns out Colgate sells 3 Wave toothbrushes: Comfort Fit, Zigzag, Gum Comfort. From what I understand, they&#x27;ve discontinued the Comfort Fit and foolishly decided to use its UPC code for the Zigzag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Comfort Fits are still available it&#x27;s challenging to order them. Many Amazon ads with Comfort Fit pictures and descriptions are shipping as Zigzags instead, and likely will be returned. Many Comfort Fits and Zigzags have incorrect text descriptions along with their non-matching pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think I&#x27;m making a mountain out of a molehill, these are quite different toothbrushes in both appearance, shape and design. Few people will \\&quot;love\\&quot; them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got lucky with the vendor Teeth-n-things. Their picture matched their description and they shipped the correct product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely a Comfort Fit fan. This toothbrush is soft and very easy on the gums, is long-lasting considering its softness, and has an unusual shape that enables it to get to all your teeth. The handle has a nicely contoured grip and quite easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product - good seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s true about Colgate re-using a product code ... well, shame on them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading --- Sam</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes are being over-engineered these days.  This one is just a toothbrush - comfortable and I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought 16 of the Colgate Wave Soft Compact Head Toothbrush.  I love the small head for my small mouth and the bristles are actually soft!  Can&#x27;t find them in the grocery or drug store anymore.  I am afraid they have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and found these toothbrushes are the ideal size, brush softness and value for the price from my perspective.</li>
            <li> I got just what I ordered but I didn&#x27;t read close enough.  This item number has a very small &amp;#34;compact head&amp;#34; and I really wanted the somewhat larger head.  But the Wave stays in my hand so much better than all the &amp;#34;360&amp;#34; brushes.  I will be more careful next time.</li>
            <li> The price for these toothbrushes was good on amazon. The head is really small but this doesn&#x27;t bother me because my mouth is fairly small. Unlike some supposedly soft bristles, these are actually soft and do not irritate sensitive gums. I also really like having the extra brushes ready when I need to change my toothbrush. Overall, good product and good value.</li>
            <li> No frills, no weird/stiff/hard bristles.  Lasts a long time too!  I love the multi-pack, great value.  Compact head is the best.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the Oral-B toothbrushes, but couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted and ended up choosing the Colgate variant of something similar. The two big complaints about this toothbrush are the extremely thin handle, and the very soft bristles. The bristles are far softer than the Oral-B, and I just don&#x27;t feel like they clean adequately..</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush. Bristles are soft and comfortable against my gums. The compact head is an appropriate size. Cleans well.</li>
            <li> This brush is comfortable to use &amp; has a small head so teeth are cleaned thoroughly but gums are not battered. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Just want I wanted, small head and bristles gentle on gums</li>
            <li> These are by far the best toothbrushes I have found. The compact head and soft bristles makes it easier for me to clean my back teeth. Love them!</li>
            <li> So comfortable. Truly soft. Makes you enjoy brushing your teeth--will brush longer, then!</li>
