            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>It took about 10 days, but they all came in great condition and everything was there.</li>
            <li>they re amazing but the nail glue donsent work the best</li>

            <li>Love these nails!</li>
            <li>and you get so many!</li>
            <li>and I love them!</li>
            <li>Nice sizes.</li>
            <li>but they looked nice after you cut them.</li>
            <li>The clear option is the best choice in my opinion; your nail polish color can show through</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and nice fitting these nails are.....</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>And love the shape of these.</li>
            <li>and they kept coming off because water would get under the nails easily.</li>
            <li>and these are great to work with , and to try different styles out on for more practice</li>
            <li>These nails looked more natural and a long time, great product!</li>
            <li>I love them so much</li>
            <li>I file them down to make them shorter, but these are so great</li>
            <li>They look beautiful from a certain angle but they have a awkward curve no matter how many sizes you try on the top doesn&#x27;t fall into place.</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Arrived much sooner than originally informed.</li>
            <li>I did like the design of the nails, however they tend to be very straight and leave gaps underneath the nails.</li>
            <li>However, most of the nails were on the smaller side.</li>
            <li>okay if you have smaller hands and don&#x27;t mind changing your nails out often.</li>
            <li>Clear is much more natural looking than the alternative.</li>
            <li>Clear, full nails.</li>
            <li>And also came in the mail fast ...</li>
            <li>And they came really early!!!</li>
            <li>They were okay, they were a pain to cut down</li>
            <li>Arrived 2 weeks early!!</li>
            <li>Look so  weird when Ur placing them but beautiful when u had nail polish or something looks natural, very long but easy to cut Clear color</li>
            <li>so they came about 2 weeks early!</li>
            <li>I ordered both clear and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Look so  weird when Ur placing them but beautiful when u had nail polish or something looks natural, very long but easy to cut Clear color</li>
            <li> so they came about 2 weeks early!</li>
            <li> I ordered both clear and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The largest nail was still too small for my thumb nails, and I don&#x27;t have large hands.</li>
            <li> only thing i don&#x27;t like is having to file down every (500) one of them before I practice my nail art, but that&#x27;s not big deal.</li>
            <li> I just wish you could customize the order to get only the bags of the sizes you need...there are some in there that are wayyy too small for me to ever use.</li>
            <li> Lots of the other nails I have bought on here took months for me to get!</li>
            <li> you get a lot for a little cash</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace my usual Kiss nails from Walmart.</li>
            <li> GLUE IS NOT STRONG!!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have an ugly white underside of the nail.</li>
            <li> However, the shape and thickness of the nail base makes them awkward to wear in real life.</li>
            <li> Came with mediocre glue.</li>
            <li> They have an unnaturally tall profile at the base.</li>

            <li> Love these nails! I file them down to make them shorter, but these are so great and you get so many! The clear option is the best choice in my opinion; your nail polish color can show through so you don&#x27;t have an ugly white underside of the nail. I just wish you could customize the order to get only the bags of the sizes you need...there are some in there that are wayyy too small for me to ever use. But if you&#x27;re using these on clients or whatever, you&#x27;ll probably have a use for all the sizes.</li>
            <li> These nails looked more natural and a long time, great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace my usual Kiss nails from Walmart. I think that it&#x27;s definitely a bargain price point. However, most of the nails were on the smaller side. The largest nail was still too small for my thumb nails, and I don&#x27;t have large hands. I did like the design of the nails, however they tend to be very straight and leave gaps underneath the nails. I wore a set twice and they kept coming off because water would get under the nails easily. They work okay if you have smaller hands and don&#x27;t mind changing your nails out often. However, the shipping and price were great.</li>
            <li> I ordered my nails June 24th and they came July 9th! They weren&#x27;t suppose to come till July 24th so they came about 2 weeks early! I love them so much and I can&#x27;t wait to try them on üíû</li>
            <li> They look beautiful from a certain angle but they have a awkward curve no matter how many sizes you try on the top doesn&#x27;t fall into place.</li>
            <li> Great value. Clear, full nails. Nice sizes. Came with mediocre glue. Clear is much more natural looking than the alternative. Arrived much sooner than originally informed. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Look so  weird when Ur placing them but beautiful when u had nail polish or something looks natural, very long but easy to cut Clear color</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and nice fitting these nails are.....you get a lot for a little cash and I love them!</li>
            <li> It took about 10 days, but they all came in great condition and everything was there. No problems at all!!! Can&#x27;t wait to practice my nail art on them! I ordered both clear and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i don&#x27;t like is having to file down every (500) one of them before I practice my nail art, but that&#x27;s not big deal.</li>
            <li> I love them. And they came really early!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅ</li>
            <li> Nice! Lots of nails for practicing!</li>
            <li> Great quality!! Arrived 2 weeks early!!</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping! Product is as shown</li>
            <li> They were okay, they were a pain to cut down but they looked nice after you cut them. GLUE IS NOT STRONG!!</li>
            <li> they re amazing but the nail glue donsent work the best</li>
            <li> because I now have a lot of nails  to practice on and these are great to work with , and to try different styles out on for more practice</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d say these are alright for swatching or for design practice. However, the shape and thickness of the nail base makes them awkward to wear in real life. They have an unnaturally tall profile at the base. They&#x27;re just meh for my use.</li>
            <li> I loveeee buying my nails on amazon ! I can get these to last for about 3 weeks! Way cheaper then going to the salon. And love the shape of these. I will be buying again when I run out! And also came in the mail fast ... Lots of the other nails I have bought on here took months for me to get! Love them!!!</li>
