    <ol>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but wasn&#x27;t too upset either.</li>
            <li>Perfect for oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I tried this!</li>
            <li>Great for travel!</li>
            <li>This product is AWESOME !  </li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!!  </li>
            <li>Have seen great results from using this product to maintain the effects of a peel.</li>
            <li>Great for brightening the skin</li>
            <li>Convenient and very effective.</li>
            <li>Having said that, perhaps that is the reason I haven&#x27;t seen remarkable results from this brightening peel pad.</li>
            <li>people says things like you look great, you must have gotten a good night&#x27;s sleep</li>
            <li>, your complexion looks so bright, etc.</li>
            <li>I have been using philosophy for years and have really good skin from staying out the sun and good skin routine.</li>
            <li>The combination of acids is good</li>
            <li>but is not as good as this</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>My skin looks better now than in my 20&#x27;s, amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Philosophy peel pads before and love them!</li>
            <li>even better!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>My face feels nice when I use</li>
            <li>comments on my skin, youthful appearance, etc were abundant.</li>
            <li>Nice for value.  </li>
            <li>I have used this twice and can see that this is an effective solution.  </li>
            <li>Kind of sketchy.</li>
            <li>it is both effective and safe.  </li>
            <li>first I wasn&#x27;t happy and wanted to return it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and brighter and I&#x27;ve received many compliments since using it.  </li>
            <li>it was okay</li>
            <li>I found an exfoliating mask at Sephora that does 10x better than this product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t notice anything remarkable.</li>
            <li>It was softer, more radiant and clearer.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my face feels afterward</li>
            <li>After two weeks, my skin tone was more even, my pores had noticably shrunk &amp; my skin just looked brighter.</li>
            <li>More recommended products are Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker PM Retinoid Pads &amp; the Miracle Worker AM Antioxidant Pads.</li>
            <li>And the best cleanser/makeup remover ever, Purity Made Simple!</li>
            <li>Your skin will thank you :)</li>
            <li>Have used most of the 12 pads ... can feel a difference when the product in on my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s left my skin in the best condition it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>They seem to work okay.</li>
            <li>Gave as gift, person seemed to be pleased with trying this product</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM.  </li>
            <li>I sure hope/wish Amazon puts these on Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li>and I love my philosophy products.</li>
            <li>Great exfolliant, great price, and received shipment from this seller sooner then expected.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Microdelivery Peel for years and love it, but I will be replacing it with this.  </li>
            <li>I love these things but beware....</li>
            <li>Best money I ever spent, I love philosophy... :-)</li>
            <li>The guest made it sound so convincing and the model demonstration too that I had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- 81% decrease in fine lines after 4 uses&lt;br</li>
            <li>but, don&#x27;t notice a difference in fine lines or tightening or brightening.  </li>
            <li>I also like M2 lotion, similar antiaging effects and great for pimples (antibacterial).</li>
            <li>Worth the money if you want to &amp;#34;brighten&amp;#34; your look!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 1/3 cheaper here than where I originally bought it.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t come in their original box....</li>
            <li>My skin looked super smooth the next morning and had a  nice rosy color to it !</li>
            <li>These work great for resurfacing dry patchy skin.</li>
            <li>As a result I was always searching for that perfect foundation to hide everything but at the same time let my natural skin shine through.  </li>
            <li>One time I just gently patted making sure that face was damp afterwards, meaning the product transfered.</li>
            <li>I have rather thick skin &amp; find that leaving it on overnight works best for me.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and very gentle.</li>
            <li>I have gotten tremendous results with this peel.  </li>
            <li>There was some mild flaking, but nothing weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use this once a week you have enough treatments for 3 months which is an exceptional value.</li>
            <li>When I first started, I saw a difference after just one use!</li>
            <li>I think this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li>This is so easy and just as effective as the messy 2 step peel.</li>
            <li>Its good product it makes my face tight and fresh</li>
            <li>My skin was softer for sure, but it didn&#x27;t clear up much, even after using it once a week for three weeks.</li>
            <li>They are decreasing, so maybe my skin is just getting used to the higher retinol concentration.</li>
            <li>Noticed an improvement from the first use.</li>
            <li>These pads have given my skin the boost it really needed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting these elsewhere (on Auto Delivery) since they first came out.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>they made my face smooth and after a few times people started to notice my skin had a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and recommend NOT using it more than once a week for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have good skin, very little sagging and no lines</li>
            <li>and I still see positive results.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m beginning to notice positive changes.</li>
            <li>Pro - it&#x27;s easy to transport since individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use...and only once a week.</li>
            <li>I also get little breakouts on my back and these pads are great for that too .</li>
            <li>If you have sun damage, dull skin, or just feel your skin isn&#x27;t looking good, try these.</li>
            <li>next week, when I used the Triple-Acid Peel Pads it made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>They all exfoliate skin and work, but Philosophy Triple acid works really fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;It could be the combination of this with the Miracle Worker line, but I see the real difference after using the Triple-Acid peel pads.</li>
            <li>it does burn but I really like the results.</li>
            <li>Happy with the results after using one pad per week for approximately 5 weeks now.  </li>
            <li>I expected a better result</li>
            <li>I have been using the Micro Delivery pads for 4 weeks now and really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>I really do see an improvement in my skin from using them.</li>
            <li>however found it much cheaper here.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so clear no acne products are necessary:) My complexion is also brighter.</li>
            <li>Honestly this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>After the first two times of trying this I started seeing that youthful pink glow and fine, moist texture</li>
            <li>This system is just as effective (if not more) but much easier to use, cleaner and quicker.  </li>
            <li>but maybe since I&#x27;ve use a lot of very acidic peels by professionals in medi-spas my expectations were too high.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of moisturizer and that this one looked \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;, but it quickly dissapates into your skin and leaves it ready for makeup or not.</li>
            <li>So I plan to purchase this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>and I will not re-purchase because I was not one of those lucky individuals that noticed any of the following results as stated by Philosophy:&lt;br</li>
            <li>These pads have a light clean scent and a powerful formula that works very well on dark spots and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and has a new glow.  </li>
            <li>Product was brand new just as described.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see much of a result from using these pads for several weeks now.</li>
            <li>First, my face is brighter and some of the my facial discoloration has faded.</li>
            <li>I agree with other users that you could cut these in half and get even more bang for your buck!</li>
            <li>I was pressing to hard more like removing make up.</li>
            <li>This product is beginning to clear these spots up.</li>
            <li>Clearly this is the newest technology in skincare b/c</li>
            <li>And WOW, my wrinkles disappeared and my face is all tightened and look glowing and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cost of professional peels are astronomical.</li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;m a long time user of the Philosophy Miracle Worker™ Miraculous Anti-aging Retinoid Pad which has done wonders to improve the texture of my sun-damaged skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I suggest rinsing it off like it says to do.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve used it for the 12 weeks, I go 12 weeks just using a daily, gentle peel like the Microdelivery Enzyme Peel.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin this is not for you</li>
            <li>but too many years in the Southern California sun has resulted in brown spots and uneven texture.  </li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on my skin, this works!</li>
            <li>Normally oily skin with larger pores.  </li>
            <li>The third week, when I used the pads I could see a glow the following day and the texture is much smoother and softer than before.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any major changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>When you remove the dead skin and gunk, your skin is healthier and your other products work better.  </li>
            <li>great product, originally ordered from QVC, amazon is less expensive!!</li>
            <li>This is one of the most amazing products ever, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li>So I was surprised that these made such a difference after just using them just a couple times.</li>
            <li>After the first application, I cut the pad in half to get two applications from it (used one pad a week, two applications per pad).</li>
            <li>Now it will be the only peel product I will use, because not only removed dead layers of the skin but also iron my first wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;From</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t really see much of a result from using these pads for several weeks now.</li>
            <li> First, my face is brighter and some of the my facial discoloration has faded.</li>
            <li> I agree with other users that you could cut these in half and get even more bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> I was pressing to hard more like removing make up.</li>
            <li> This product is beginning to clear these spots up.</li>
            <li> Clearly this is the newest technology in skincare b/c</li>
            <li> And WOW, my wrinkles disappeared and my face is all tightened and look glowing and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cost of professional peels are astronomical.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m a long time user of the Philosophy Miracle Worker™ Miraculous Anti-aging Retinoid Pad which has done wonders to improve the texture of my sun-damaged skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I suggest rinsing it off like it says to do.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve used it for the 12 weeks, I go 12 weeks just using a daily, gentle peel like the Microdelivery Enzyme Peel.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin this is not for you</li>
            <li> but too many years in the Southern California sun has resulted in brown spots and uneven texture.  </li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on my skin, this works!</li>
            <li> Normally oily skin with larger pores.  </li>
            <li> The third week, when I used the pads I could see a glow the following day and the texture is much smoother and softer than before.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any major changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> When you remove the dead skin and gunk, your skin is healthier and your other products work better.  </li>
            <li> great product, originally ordered from QVC, amazon is less expensive!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing products ever, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> So I was surprised that these made such a difference after just using them just a couple times.</li>
            <li> After the first application, I cut the pad in half to get two applications from it (used one pad a week, two applications per pad).</li>
            <li> Now it will be the only peel product I will use, because not only removed dead layers of the skin but also iron my first wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that when I open a new pad they are a little bit discolored.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if they were sitting around in the warehouse too long.</li>
            <li> I only use a pad every other week or so</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to their effect on wrinkles but the pads instantly dry up my acne and my skin feels tighter overnight.  </li>
            <li> usually in the spring to get my skin ready for less makeup wearing in the summer.</li>
            <li> My dark \\&quot;sun spots\\&quot; are fading and my skin feels and looks smoother; pores seem to have also gotten smaller.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product weekly for last three months but not sure I&#x27;m seeing any results.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it works for age spot since I only use 6 pads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s younger looking skin, to include a few little pimples, but I think those are from the face wash.</li>
            <li> now on I will cut a pad in 2 and keep half in the ziplock, use 2 night in a row</li>
            <li> I cut the pads in half to stretch the usage as some reviews recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, in the past I&#x27;ve used lactic and glycolic acid (55%), Philosophy other peels and retinol pads, tretinoin cream, M2 lotion.</li>
            <li> A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested these to me a few years ago</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it doesn&#x27;t exist when you&#x27;re 55+ years old.</li>
            <li> I have a small break out which leaves black spots.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> But I was using it wrong-</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too expensive.</li>
            <li> I saw this product demonstrated on QVC and was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Can say that it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or feel uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t doing a bad job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these! I have been using philosophy for years and have really good skin from staying out the sun and good skin routine. So I was surprised that these made such a difference after just using them just a couple times. Will difinitely keep using them!</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing products ever, you will not be disappointed! Best money I ever spent, I love philosophy... :-)</li>
            <li> I have used this product weekly for last three months but not sure I&#x27;m seeing any results.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a 3 weeks now and see zero changes..</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I only use a pad every other week or so and I still see positive results.  Worth the money if you want to &amp;#34;brighten&amp;#34; your look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 or 4 pads every 4 days and no difference. But I was using it wrong-I was pressing to hard more like removing make up. One time I just gently patted making sure that face was damp afterwards, meaning the product transfered. I used 2 pads 2 night in a row, no washing off after. And WOW, my wrinkles disappeared and my face is all tightened and look glowing and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I wasn&#x27;t happy and wanted to return it. Now it will be the only peel product I will use, because not only removed dead layers of the skin but also iron my first wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;From now on I will cut a pad in 2 and keep half in the ziplock, use 2 night in a row and I can run to class reunion to make girls look jealous yeah;))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, in the past I&#x27;ve used lactic and glycolic acid (55%), Philosophy other peels and retinol pads, tretinoin cream, M2 lotion. They all exfoliate skin and work, but Philosophy Triple acid works really fast, well, there&#x27;s no stinging. I also like M2 lotion, similar antiaging effects and great for pimples (antibacterial).</li>
            <li> great product, originally ordered from QVC, amazon is less expensive!!</li>
            <li> I am 26 and have a problem with chin breakouts leaving my skin red and scarred looking. Someone suggested these to me a few years ago and I&#x27;ve been using them once a year ever since- usually in the spring to get my skin ready for less makeup wearing in the summer. I can&#x27;t speak to their effect on wrinkles but the pads instantly dry up my acne and my skin feels tighter overnight.  I agree with other users that you could cut these in half and get even more bang for your buck! I also get little breakouts on my back and these pads are great for that too .</li>
            <li> I think this product is worth a try. My face feels nice when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;i think it is a personal choice depending on age/skin type.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use. Just swipe a pad all over your face, neck and back of hands. No need to wash it off. Just use a pad once a week, and after a couple of weeks you&#x27;ll see a difference.</li>
            <li> The combination of acids is good but maybe since I&#x27;ve use a lot of very acidic peels by professionals in medi-spas my expectations were too high.  I didn&#x27;t get dramatic results.  My skin was softer for sure, but it didn&#x27;t clear up much, even after using it once a week for three weeks.</li>
            <li> I have gotten tremendous results with this peel.  My skin is smoother and brighter and I&#x27;ve received many compliments since using it.  It will always be in my beauty regime.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks. And I&#x27;m beginning to notice positive changes. First, my face is brighter and some of the my facial discoloration has faded. I do not have a problem with acne, however, from time to time I have a small break out which leaves black spots. This product is beginning to clear these spots up. And my pores are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I formally used a microdermabrasion system (Neutrogena) it was okay but is not as good as this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of professional peels are astronomical. So I plan to purchase this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money. I found an exfoliating mask at Sephora that does 10x better than this product.</li>
            <li> Try it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m a long time user of the Philosophy Miracle Worker™ Miraculous Anti-aging Retinoid Pad which has done wonders to improve the texture of my sun-damaged skin. Having said that, perhaps that is the reason I haven&#x27;t seen remarkable results from this brightening peel pad. I used this product product according to the directions with the following modifications: After the first application, I cut the pad in half to get two applications from it (used one pad a week, two applications per pad). I did this with hopes of obtaining quicker results and I used six of the pads this way. I have one pad left and I will not re-purchase because I was not one of those lucky individuals that noticed any of the following results as stated by Philosophy:&lt;br /&gt;- 96% improvement in skin smoothness, with no irritation, after 2 uses&lt;br /&gt;- 96% improvement in brightening after 4 uses&lt;br /&gt;- 81% decrease in fine lines after 4 uses&lt;br /&gt;- 90% enhanced clarity after 4 uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, not all products work for everyone and had I not been using the Miracle Worker Peel Pad, perhaps I would have seen results with the Triple Acid Peel Pad.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any major changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t notice anything remarkable. I started using this and the Miracle Worker line, with the face wash, lotion and daily retinol pads (it was in a trial kit with all three). I was seeing some different with the Miracle worker line, but nothing to write home about. I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but wasn&#x27;t too upset either. It&#x27;s not that much more expensive than the Neutregena retinol stuff at the drugstore and it wasn&#x27;t doing a bad job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next week, when I used the Triple-Acid Peel Pads it made a huge difference in my skin. It was softer, more radiant and clearer. The third week, when I used the pads I could see a glow the following day and the texture is much smoother and softer than before. It&#x27;s younger looking skin, to include a few little pimples, but I think those are from the face wash. They are decreasing, so maybe my skin is just getting used to the higher retinol concentration. There was some mild flaking, but nothing weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be the combination of this with the Miracle Worker line, but I see the real difference after using the Triple-Acid peel pads. I&#x27;ll probably buy them again and use the Miracle Worker cream, but not the daily pads or the face wash.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I have spent so much money on my skin, this works! My skin is so clear no acne products are necessary:) My complexion is also brighter. I cut the pads in half to stretch the usage as some reviews recommended.</li>
            <li> I do like these. they made my face smooth and after a few times people started to notice my skin had a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I like this peel. it does burn but I really like the results. I have sensitive skin and recommend NOT using it more than once a week for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for oily skin. Noticed an improvement from the first use.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my face feels afterward it&#x27;s just too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philosophy skin care &amp; fragrances for over 9 yrs now. These pads have given my skin the boost it really needed! I use one pad a week as directed. When I first started, I saw a difference after just one use! After two weeks, my skin tone was more even, my pores had noticably shrunk &amp; my skin just looked brighter. I don&#x27;t rinse the product after applying. I use it at night followed by tarte&#x27;s Maracuja Oil. Then I cleanse with The Microdelivery Wash in the AM and follow with my AM skin care and my skin glows! If you have sensitive skin, I suggest rinsing it off like it says to do. I have rather thick skin &amp; find that leaving it on overnight works best for me. After I&#x27;ve used it for the 12 weeks, I go 12 weeks just using a daily, gentle peel like the Microdelivery Enzyme Peel. Then restart the regimen. Sometimes I go longer in between depending on my skin&#x27;s needs. If you have sun damage, dull skin, or just feel your skin isn&#x27;t looking good, try these. I can go days with no makeup! My skin looks better now than in my 20&#x27;s, amazing! More recommended products are Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker PM Retinoid Pads &amp; the Miracle Worker AM Antioxidant Pads. And the best cleanser/makeup remover ever, Purity Made Simple! Your skin will thank you :)</li>
            <li> Happy with the results after using one pad per week for approximately 5 weeks now.  My skin is smoother and has a new glow.  Freckles and sun damage are noticeably diminished.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Have used most of the 12 pads ... can feel a difference when the product in on my face but, don&#x27;t notice a difference in fine lines or tightening or brightening.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> These work great for resurfacing dry patchy skin. My skin glows with a smoothness I haven&#x27;t seen for awhile!</li>
            <li> Convenient and very effective.</li>
            <li> It works well when you leave it on overnight. I would purchase it again because it you can see a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product for another site, but felt compelled to add it here as well. I&#x27;m so happy I tried this! It&#x27;s left my skin in the best condition it&#x27;s ever been. I started using it a month before a reunion, and let me tell you....comments on my skin, youthful appearance, etc were abundant. I won&#x27;t be without it now, and even have my husband using it. Another bonus? It&#x27;s 1/3 cheaper here than where I originally bought it.</li>
            <li> Just started using it - about 2 times over 2 weeks so the jury is still out on the results.  Can say that it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or feel uncomfortable.  Pro - it&#x27;s easy to transport since individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Philosophy peel pads before and love them! Product was brand new just as described. I&#x27;ve noticed that when I open a new pad they are a little bit discolored. Makes me wonder if they were sitting around in the warehouse too long. They seem to work okay.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see much of a result from using these pads for several weeks now. I expected a better result and I&#x27;m just not seeing it. Would not order again.</li>
            <li> Gave as gift, person seemed to be pleased with trying this product</li>
            <li> Normally oily skin with larger pores.  I have been using the Micro Delivery pads for 4 weeks now and really notice a difference.  I LOVE THEM.  My dark \\&quot;sun spots\\&quot; are fading and my skin feels and looks smoother; pores seem to have also gotten smaller.  I can&#x27;t wait until I am done all 12!</li>
            <li> I use this once a week. This is so easy and just as effective as the messy 2 step peel. Great for travel!</li>
            <li> Clears the skin up well and smoothes it out well. A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> It is OK...not a big difference when using.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin this is not for you</li>
            <li> I sure hope/wish Amazon puts these on Subscribe &amp; Save. I&#x27;ve been getting these elsewhere (on Auto Delivery) since they first came out. I really do see an improvement in my skin from using them. I am a philosophy girl and I love my philosophy products. These are so easy to use...and only once a week. I don&#x27;t want to be without these ever!</li>
            <li> Nice for value.  Leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. Have seen great results from using this product to maintain the effects of a peel.</li>
            <li> Great for brightening the skin</li>
            <li> Honestly this was a waste of money. I did not notice any change in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Every time I use one of these peels people says things like you look great, you must have gotten a good night&#x27;s sleep, your complexion looks so bright, etc. They are easy to use and very gentle.</li>
            <li> These pads have a light clean scent and a powerful formula that works very well on dark spots and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Great exfolliant, great price, and received shipment from this seller sooner then expected.  Would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME !  My skin looked super smooth the next morning and had a  nice rosy color to it !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any miracle happening here.</li>
            <li> I saw this product demonstrated on QVC and was skeptical.  The guest made it sound so convincing and the model demonstration too that I had to give it a try.  I have good skin, very little sagging and no lines but too many years in the Southern California sun has resulted in brown spots and uneven texture.  As a result I was always searching for that perfect foundation to hide everything but at the same time let my natural skin shine through.  Needless to say it doesn&#x27;t exist when you&#x27;re 55+ years old. So Phliosopy&#x27;s motto is \\&quot;makeup optional skin\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s what I was looking for.  I ordered it on QVC however found it much cheaper here.  THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!!  After the first two times of trying this I started seeing that youthful pink glow and fine, moist texture I remember I had,,,perhaps even better!  Immediately I saw glowing sking and the brown spots fading away...no lines, and my skin perhaps even tightening and firming.  I WON&#x27;T BE WITHOUT THIS ONE PRODUCT!!!  The moisturizer \\&quot;Miracle Worker\\&quot; is also correctly named.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of moisturizer and that this one looked \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;, but it quickly dissapates into your skin and leaves it ready for makeup or not.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Microdelivery Peel for years and love it, but I will be replacing it with this.  Why?  This system is just as effective (if not more) but much easier to use, cleaner and quicker.  You literally wash your face and glide the pad over your face (and neck, chest, anything else) and then moisturize.  Clearly this is the newest technology in skincare b/c it is both effective and safe.  I have used this twice and can see that this is an effective solution.  Why use a peel?  When you remove the dead skin and gunk, your skin is healthier and your other products work better.  If you use this once a week you have enough treatments for 3 months which is an exceptional value.</li>
            <li> I love these things but beware.... They didn&#x27;t come in their original box.... No expiration date.... Kind of sketchy.</li>
            <li> Its good product it makes my face tight and fresh but I am not sure if it works for age spot since I only use 6 pads.</li>
